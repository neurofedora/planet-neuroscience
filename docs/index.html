     alt="Gray matter volume reduction in the emotional brain networks in adults with anosmia"/>
<p>In our study, we examined the network-level changes of the gray matter volumes in anosmia. Patients with anosmia had the lower gray matter volumes in the emotional brain networks relative to healthy controls. Based on a significant association between the gray matter volume loss and lower olfactory-specific quality of life, we assume that these morphometric network changes may be closely related to emotional dysfunctions in anosmia.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, frequently accompanies emotional dysfunctions, partly due to the overlapping brain regions between the olfactory and emotional processing centers. Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Contributions of Distinct Auditory Cortical Inhibitory Neuron Types to the Detection of Sounds in Background Noise</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to separate background noise from relevant acoustic signals is essential for appropriate sound-driven behavior in natural environments. Examples of this separation are apparent in the auditory system, where neural responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli become increasingly noise invariant along the ascending auditory pathway. However, the mechanisms that underlie this reduction in responses to background noise are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we first evaluated the effects of auditory cortical inactivation on mice of both sexes trained to perform a simple auditory signal-in-noise detection task and found that outputs from the auditory cortex are important for the detection of auditory stimuli in noisy environments. Next, we evaluated the contributions of the two most common cortical inhibitory cell types, parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, to the perception of masked auditory stimuli. We found that inactivation of either PV<sup>+</sup> or SOM<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in a reduction in the ability of mice to determine the presence of auditory stimuli masked by noise. These results indicate that a disruption of auditory cortical network dynamics by either of these two types of inhibitory cells is sufficient to impair the ability to separate acoustic signals from noise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">NPRL2 Inhibition of mTORC1 Controls Sodium Channel Expression and Brain Amino Acid Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Genetic mutations in nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2) are associated with a wide spectrum of familial focal epilepsies, autism, and sudden unexpected death of epileptics (SUDEP), but the mechanisms by which NPRL2 contributes to these effects are not well known. NPRL2 is a requisite subunit of the GAP activity toward Rags 1 (GATOR1) complex, which functions as a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase when intracellular amino acids are low. Here, we show that loss of NPRL2 expression in mouse excitatory glutamatergic neurons causes seizures before death, consistent with SUDEP in humans with epilepsy. Additionally, the absence of NPRL2 expression increases mTORC1-dependent signal transduction and significantly alters amino acid homeostasis in the brain. Loss of NPRL2 reduces dendritic branching and increases the strength of electrically stimulated action potentials (APs) in neurons. The increased AP strength is consistent with elevated expression of epilepsy-linked, voltage-gated sodium channels in the NPRL2-deficient brain. Targeted deletion of NPRL2 in primary neurons increases the expression of sodium channel <I>Scn1A</I>, whereas treatment with the pharmacological mTORC1 inhibitor called rapamycin prevents <I>Scn1A</I> upregulation. These studies demonstrate a novel role of NPRL2 and mTORC1 signaling in the regulation of sodium channels, which can contribute to seizures and early lethality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Brain Dynamics of Action Monitoring in Higher-Order Motor Control Disorders: The Case of Apraxia</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Limb apraxia (LA) refers to a high-order motor disorder characterized by the inability to reproduce transitive actions on commands or after observation. Studies demonstrate that action observation and action execution activate the same networks in the human brain, and provides an onlooker&rsquo;s motor system with appropriate cognitive, motor and sensory-motor cues to flexibly implementing action-sequences and gestures. Tellingly, the temporal dynamics of action monitoring has never been explored in people suffering from LA. To fill this gap, we studied the electro-cortical signatures of error observation in human participants suffering from acquired left-brain lesions with (LA+) and without (LA&ndash;) LA, and in a group of healthy controls (H). EEG was acquired while participants observed from a first-person perspective (1PP) an avatar performing correct or incorrect reach-to-grasp a glass action in an immersive-virtual environment. Alterations of typical EEG signatures of error observation in time (early error positivity; Pe) and time-frequency domain (theta band-power) were found reduced in LA+ compared with H. Connectivity analyses showed that LA+ exhibited a decreased theta phase synchronization of both the frontoparietal and frontofrontal network, compared with H and LA&ndash;. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the severity of LA [test of upper LA (TULIA) scores] was predicted by mid-frontal error-related theta activity, suggesting a link between error monitoring capacity and apraxic phenotypes. These results provide novel neurophysiological evidence of altered neurophysiological dynamics of action monitoring in individuals with LA and shed light on the performance monitoring changes occurring in this disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neurophysiological Evidence for Cognitive Map Formation during Sequence Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans deftly parse statistics from sequences. Some theories posit that humans learn these statistics by forming cognitive maps, or underlying representations of the latent space which links items in the sequence. Here, an item in the sequence is a node, and the probability of transitioning between two items is an edge. Sequences can then be generated from walks through the latent space, with different spaces giving rise to different sequence statistics. Individual or group differences in sequence learning can be modeled by changing the time scale over which estimates of transition probabilities are built, or in other words, by changing the amount of temporal discounting. Latent space models with temporal discounting bear a resemblance to models of navigation through Euclidean spaces. However, few explicit links have been made between predictions from Euclidean spatial navigation and neural activity during human sequence learning. Here, we use a combination of behavioral modeling and intracranial encephalography (iEEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity might support the formation of space-like cognitive maps through temporal discounting during sequence learning. Specifically, we acquire human reaction times from a sequential reaction time task, to which we fit a model that formulates the amount of temporal discounting as a single free parameter. From the parameter, we calculate each individual&rsquo;s estimate of the latent space. We find that neural activity reflects these estimates mostly in the temporal lobe, including areas involved in spatial navigation. Similar to spatial navigation, we find that low-dimensional representations of neural activity allow for easy separation of important features, such as modules, in the latent space. Lastly, we take advantage of the high temporal resolution of iEEG data to determine the time scale on which latent spaces are learned. We find that learning typically happens within the first 500 trials, and is modulated by the underlying latent space and the amount of temporal discounting characteristic of each participant. Ultimately, this work provides important links between behavioral models of sequence learning and neural activity during the same behavior, and contextualizes these results within a broader framework of domain general cognitive maps.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) results from a loss of dopaminergic neurons. What triggers the break-down of neuronal signaling, and how this might be compensated, is not understood. The age of onset, progression and symptoms vary between patients, and our understanding of the clinical variability remains incomplete. In this study, we investigate this, by characterizing the dopaminergic landscape in healthy and denervated striatum, using biophysical modeling. Based on currently proposed mechanisms, we model three distinct denervation patterns, and show how this affect the dopaminergic network. Depending on the denervation pattern, we show how local and global differences arise in the activity of striatal neurons. Finally, we use the mathematical formalism to suggest a cellular strategy for maintaining normal dopamine (DA) signaling following neuronal denervation. This strategy is characterized by dual enhancement of both the release and uptake capacity of DA in the remaining neurons. Overall, our results derive a new conceptual framework for the impaired dopaminergic signaling related to PD and offers testable predictions for future research directions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Dopamine D4 Receptor Regulates Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Excitability in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-secreting neurons control fertility. The release of GnRH peptide regulates the synthesis and release of both luteinizing  hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. While it is known that dopamine regulates GnRH neurons, the specific dopamine receptor subtype(s) involved remain unclear. Previous studies in adult rodents have reported juxtaposition of fibers containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of catecholaminergic cells, onto GnRH neurons and that exogenous dopamine inhibits GnRH neurons postsynaptically through dopamine D1-like and/or D2-like receptors. Our microarray data from GnRH neurons revealed a high level of <I>Drd4</I> transcripts [i.e., dopamine D4 receptor (D4R)]. Single-cell RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry confirmed GnRH cells express the <I>Drd4</I> transcript and protein, respectively. Calcium imaging identified changes in GnRH neuronal activity during application of subtype-specific dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists when GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission was blocked. Dopamine, dopamine with D1/5R-specific or D2/3R-specific antagonists or D4R-specific agonists decreased the frequency of calcium oscillations. In contrast, D1/5R-specific agonists increased the frequency of calcium oscillations. The D4R-mediated inhibition was dependent on G<SUB>&alpha;i/o</SUB> protein coupling, while the D1/5R-mediated excitation required G<SUB>&alpha;s</SUB> protein coupling. Together, these results indicate that D4R plays an important role in the dopaminergic inhibition of GnRH neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Crucial Role of the Frontal Operculum in Task-Set Dependent Visuomotor Performance Monitoring</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>For adaptive goal-directed action, the brain needs to monitor action performance and detect errors. The corresponding information may be conveyed via different sensory modalities; for instance, visual and proprioceptive body position cues may inform about current manual action performance. Thereby, contextual factors such as the current task set may also determine the relative importance of each sensory modality for action guidance. Here, we analyzed human behavioral, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from two virtual reality-based hand&ndash;target phase-matching studies to identify the neuronal correlates of performance monitoring and error processing under instructed visual or proprioceptive task sets. Our main result was a general, modality-independent response of the bilateral frontal operculum (FO) to poor phase-matching accuracy, as evident from increased BOLD signal and increased source-localized gamma power. Furthermore, functional connectivity of the bilateral FO to the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) increased under a visual versus proprioceptive task set. These findings suggest that the bilateral FO generally monitors manual action performance; and, moreover, that when visual action feedback is used to guide action, the FO may signal an increased need for control to visuomotor regions in the right PPC following errors.</p>

On basic liver function tests (LFT), she had aspartate transaminase / alanine transaminase > 2.2 and alkaline phosphatase / total bilirubin < 4. This pattern in acute liver failure patients signifies Wilson’s disease. Its presence in our patient with subacute liver disease also prompted us to suspect Wilson’s disease and we extended the liver disease screen to include slit lamp eye examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper level, which led to the diagnosis. She improved clinically and biochemically with zinc acetate therapy.  As screening for rare diseases is not always possible in low-income countries, this case demonstrates the usefulness of the basic LFT as a guide for suspecting Wilson’s disease in patients with liver disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on the severity of atopic dermatitis in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common dermatosis in children, that includes skin architecture defects, immune dysregulation, and changes of skin flora. Several new drugs have been found to reduce the severity of AD. Vitamin D is one of the new therapies that is still controversial. The purpose of this research is to conclude the efficacy of vitamin D on atopic dermatitis severity in children aged 0-18 years old. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Clinical Trial website, and university repositories including studies published from January 2010 through October 2020. We compared populations, intervention, study design, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was done with Review Manager 5.4.1. Results: Eight articles met eligibility and inclusion criteria, four articles provided complete data and were analysed. Not all studies demonstrated the efficacy of vitamin D but a meta-analysis of four studies of vitamin D supplementation vs placebo found a mean difference of -0.93 (95%CI -1.76, to -0.11, p<0.001) of patient outcome, but statistically, there was no difference in cure rate (risk ratio 1.46 (95%CI 0.72, to 2.97, p=0.008) in vitamin D supplementation groups compared to placebo groups. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation in paediatric atopic dermatitis patients could offer improvement of disease severity but the recommended dose and duration of administration cannot be concluded yet.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elections in Nondemocratic Settings: When and Why Do They Help Regime Survival? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Elections in nondemocratic settings are expected to play a regime sustaining role and a regime subverting role. Recent research finds that these two seemingly competing views are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary with each other. This is the case because the regime subverting role of elections is at work in the short run, whereas the regime sustaining role operates in the long term. In this paper, I argue that these effects are conditional on the nature of competition in those elections. Specifically, I contend that these effects that derive from the informational role of elections do not emerge when opposition forces boycott the elections. Methods: Using data from 262 nondemocratic regimes in 116 countries from 1946 to 2007, I examined (1) whether holding multiparty elections with ex ante competition increases the risks of authoritarian breakdowns; (2) whether holding multiparty elections without opposition boycott increases the risks of authoritarian breakdowns in the short term; and (3) whether holding multiparty elections without opposition boycott decreases the likelihood of authoritarian breakdowns in the long run. Results: First, only legislative elections with ex ante competition are found to increase the probability of authoritarian breakdowns. Second, both presidential and legislative elections increase the likelihood of authoritarian breakdowns in the short term only if viable opposition candidates or parties compete. Lastly, both presidential and legislative elections decrease the chances of authoritarian breakdowns in the long run, but this effect is present only when viable opposition do not boycott the elections. Conclusions: The regime subverting role and the regime sustaining role of elections in nondemocratic settings can be contaminated by the absence of opposition forces. This paper suggests a need to further scrutinize the nature and quality of elections when assessing their impact on the survival of nondemocratic regimes.

                Background: Accurate assessment of the welfare of non-human primates (NHPs) used and bred for scientific purposes is essential for effective implementation of obligations to optimise their well-being, for validation of refinement techniques and novel welfare indicators, and for ensuring the highest quality data is obtained from these animals. Despite the importance of welfare assessment in NHP research, there is little consensus on what should be measured. Greater harmonisation of welfare indicators between facilities would enable greater collaboration and data sharing to address welfare-related questions in the management and use of NHPs. Methods: A Delphi consultation was used to survey attendees of the 2019 NC3Rs Primate Welfare Meeting (73 respondents) to build consensus on which welfare indicators for macaques and marmosets are reliable, valid, and practicable, and how these can be measured. Results: Self-harm behaviour, social enrichment, cage dimensions, body weight, a health monitoring programme, appetite, staff training, and positive reinforcement training were considered valid, reliable, and practicable indicators for macaques (≥70% consensus) within a hypothetical scenario context involving 500 animals. Indicators ranked important for assessing marmoset welfare were body weight, NHP induced and environmentally induced injuries, cage furniture, huddled posture, mortality, blood in excreta, and physical enrichment. Participants working with macaques in infectious disease and breeding identified a greater range of indicators as valid and reliable than did those working in neuroscience and toxicology, where animal-based indicators were considered the most important. The findings for macaques were compared with a previous Delphi consultation, and the expert-defined consensus from the two surveys used to develop a prototype protocol for assessing macaque welfare in research settings. Conclusions: Together the Delphi results and proto-protocol enable those working with research NHPs to more effectively assess the welfare of the animals in their care and to collaborate to advance refinement of NHP management and use.

                Appendiceal cancer is rare and is often diagnosed incidentally in patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis. However, patients with appendiceal cancer are at increased risk of synchronous malignancy. In this case report, we present a 58-year-old man initially diagnosed with acute appendicitis after presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain. He had an appendectomy and was discharged the following day. Unexpectedly, the postoperative histopathologic examination showed a primary adenocarcinoma in the appendix. A computed tomography scan showed rectal wall thickening and the patient was referred to colonoscopy where an experienced endoscopist found a rectal tumor during the digital rectal examination prior to the colonoscopy. The tumor was initially missed by the newly qualified doctor who examined the patient during his first admittance to hospital. The patient’s two primary cancers were treated with a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for the appendiceal cancer and a low anterior resection for the rectal cancer. This case supports the importance of a full colorectal workup in patients with appendiceal cancer. It also emphasizes the value of a thorough digital rectal examination and the need for improved focus on teaching and practice of the procedure.

                Background: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are very common disorders affecting the population and causing pain. Researchers have reported a high prevalence of TMDs among university students due to increased distress. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of TMDs in Umm al-Qura University (UQU) dental students using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD), and to examine the relationship between anxiety, bruxism, and TMDs among those students. Methods: The DC/TMD pain screener questionnaire was completed by dental students. Students who reported TMD pain or had at least one positive TMD symptom were invited to the dental clinic for a full TMJ evaluation. History of bruxism was documented and an ultra-brief tool for detecting anxiety and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-4 PHQ) was completed by all students. Results: A total of 240 students responded to the TMD pain screener in which 119 reported at least one TMJ symptom. Only 93 dental students presented to clinical examination in which 64.5% (n=60) of them had temporomandibular joint disorders. Disc displacement with reduction and local myalgia (38.7% & 32.25%, respectively) were the most frequent diagnosis. A total of 29% (n=27) of students had more than one diagnosis. Overall, 41 participants (44.09%) reported a positive response to the anxiety scale and (n=38) 40% of participants reported parafunctional habits. Both the history of bruxism and anxiety were significantly related to TMDs (P=0.0002) and also significantly higher in women of higher academic years (P≤0.01). Conclusions: This study found a high prevalence of TMDs among UQU dental students. Disc displacement with reduction was the most prevalent disorder. Bruxism and anxiety were associated with painful TMDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Human discrimination and modeling of high-frequency complex tones shed light on the neural codes for pitch</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel R. Guest, Andrew J. Oxenham</p>

Accurate pitch perception of harmonic complex tones is widely believed to rely on temporal fine structure information conveyed by the precise phase-locked responses of auditory-nerve fibers. However, accurate pitch perception remains possible even when spectrally resolved harmonics are presented at frequencies beyond the putative limits of neural phase locking, and it is unclear whether residual temporal information, or a coarser rate-place code, underlies this ability. We addressed this question by measuring human pitch discrimination at low and high frequencies for harmonic complex tones, presented either in isolation or in the presence of concurrent complex-tone maskers. We found that concurrent complex-tone maskers impaired performance at both low and high frequencies, although the impairment introduced by adding maskers at high frequencies relative to low frequencies differed between the tested masker types. We then combined simulated auditory-nerve responses to our stimuli with ideal-observer analysis to quantify the extent to which performance was limited by peripheral factors. We found that the worsening of both frequency discrimination and F0 discrimination at high frequencies could be well accounted for (in relative terms) by optimal decoding of all available information at the level of the auditory nerve. A Python package is provided to reproduce these results, and to simulate responses to acoustic stimuli from the three previously published models of the human auditory nerve used in our analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autocrine signaling can explain the emergence of Allee effects in cancer cell populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Philip Gerlee, Philipp M. Altrock, Adam Malik, Cecilia Krona, Sven Nelander</p>

In many human cancers, the rate of cell growth depends crucially on the size of the tumour cell population. Low, zero, or negative growth at low population densities is known as the Allee effect; this effect has been studied extensively in ecology, but so far lacks a good explanation in the cancer setting. Here, we formulate and analyze an individual-based model of cancer, in which cell division rates are increased by the local concentration of an autocrine growth factor produced by the cancer cells themselves. We show, analytically and by simulation, that autocrine signaling suffices to cause both strong and weak Allee effects. Whether low cell densities lead to negative (strong effect) or reduced (weak effect) growth rate depends directly on the ratio of cell death to proliferation, and indirectly on cellular dispersal. Our model is consistent with experimental observations from three patient-derived brain tumor cell lines grown at different densities. We propose that further studying and quantifying population-wide feedback, impacting cell growth, will be central for advancing our understanding of cancer dynamics and treatment, potentially exploiting Allee effects for therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How does a small molecule bind at a cryptic binding site?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yibing Shan, Venkatesh P. Mysore, Abba E. Leffler, Eric T. Kim, Shiori Sagawa, David E. Shaw</p>

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous biomolecular processes that are central to virtually all aspects of cellular function. Identifying small molecules that modulate specific disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging, however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI interfaces are “cryptic”: When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites only emerging upon ligand binding. The rational design of small molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)—which performs its function by forming a PPI with its receptor—without incorporating any prior structural information about the ligands’ binding. In multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a protein–small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound emerged only transiently and incompletely. Moreover, free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations successfully distinguished between the native and non-native IL2–small-molecule binding poses found in the simulations, suggesting that binding simulations in combination with FEP may provide an effective tool for identifying cryptic binding sites and determining the binding poses of small molecules designed to disrupt PPI interfaces by binding to such sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Encoding time in neural dynamic regimes with distinct computational tradeoffs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shanglin Zhou, Sotiris C. Masmanidis, Dean V. Buonomano</p>

Converging evidence suggests the brain encodes time in dynamic patterns of neural activity, including neural sequences, ramping activity, and complex dynamics. Most temporal tasks, however, require more than just encoding time, and can have distinct computational requirements including the need to exhibit temporal scaling, generalize to novel contexts, or robustness to noise. It is not known how neural circuits can encode time and satisfy distinct computational requirements, nor is it known whether similar patterns of neural activity at the population level can exhibit dramatically different computational or generalization properties. To begin to answer these questions, we trained RNNs on two timing tasks based on behavioral studies. The tasks had different input structures but required producing identically timed output patterns. Using a novel framework we quantified whether RNNs encoded two intervals using either of three different timing strategies: scaling, absolute, or stimulus-specific dynamics. We found that similar neural dynamic patterns at the level of single intervals, could exhibit fundamentally different properties, including, generalization, the connectivity structure of the trained networks, and the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Critically, depending on the task structure RNNs were better suited for generalization or robustness to noise. Further analysis revealed different connection patterns underlying the different regimes. Our results predict that apparently similar neural dynamic patterns at the population level (e.g., neural sequences) can exhibit fundamentally different computational properties in regards to their ability to generalize to novel stimuli and their robustness to noise—and that these differences are associated with differences in network connectivity and distinct contributions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We also predict that the task structure used in different experimental studies accounts for some of the experimentally observed variability in how networks encode time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimates of the basic reproduction number for rubella using seroprevalence data and indicator-based approaches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Timos Papadopoulos, Emilia Vynnycky</p>

The basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) of an infection determines the impact of its control. For many endemic infections, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is often estimated from appropriate country-specific seroprevalence data. Studies sometimes pool estimates from the same region for settings lacking seroprevalence data, but the reliability of this approach is unclear. Plausibly, indicator-based approaches could predict <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for such settings. We calculated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for rubella for 98 settings and correlated its value against 66 demographic, economic, education, housing and health-related indicators. We also trained a random forest regression algorithm using these indicators as the input and <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> as the output. We used the mean-square error to compare the performances of the random forest, simple linear regression and a regional averaging method in predicting <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> using 4-fold cross validation. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> was <5, 5–10 and >10 for 81, 14 and 3 settings respectively, with no apparent regional differences and in the limited available data, it was usually lower for rural than urban areas. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> was most correlated with educational attainment, and household indicators for the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients respectively and with poverty-related indicators followed by the crude death rate considering the Maximum Information Coefficient, although the correlation for each was relatively weak (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.4, 95%CI: (0.24,0.48) for educational attainment). A random forest did not perform better in predicting <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> than simple linear regression, depending on the subsets of training indicators and studies, and neither out-performed a regional averaging approach. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for rubella is typically low and using indicators to estimate its value is not straightforward. A regional averaging approach may provide as reliable an estimate of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for settings lacking seroprevalence data as one based on indicators. The findings may be relevant for other infections and studies estimating the disease burden and the impact of interventions for settings lacking seroprevalence data.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the limitations of the current scientific publication system, in which serious post-publication concerns are often addressed too slowly to be effective. In this Perspective, we offer suggestions to improve academia’s willingness and ability to correct errors in an appropriate time frame.

Four scientists who have identified issues in published papers struggled to get them amended or retracted; here they present evidence that these struggles are widely shared and that scientific advances are presently critically hindered. They make suggestions for academic actors that would help scientists raise concerns about submissions and improve academia’s correction rate and speed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Distinct neurocomputational mechanisms support informational and socially normative conformity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Mahmoodi, Hamed Nili, Dan Bang, Carsten Mehring, Bahador Bahrami</p>

A change of mind in response to social influence could be driven by <i>informational</i> conformity to increase accuracy, or by <i>normative</i> conformity to comply with social norms such as reciprocity. Disentangling the behavioural, cognitive, and neurobiological underpinnings of informational and normative conformity have proven elusive. Here, participants underwent fMRI while performing a perceptual task that involved both advice-taking and advice-giving to human and computer partners. The concurrent inclusion of 2 different social roles and 2 different social partners revealed distinct behavioural and neural markers for informational and normative conformity. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) BOLD response tracked informational conformity towards both human and computer but tracked normative conformity only when interacting with humans. A network of brain areas (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ)) that tracked normative conformity increased their functional coupling with the dACC when interacting with humans. These findings enable differentiating the neural mechanisms by which different types of conformity shape social changes of mind.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Lipidomic risk scores are independent of polygenic risk scores and can predict incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in a large population cohort</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chris Lauber, Mathias J. Gerl, Christian Klose, Filip Ottosson, Olle Melander, Kai Simons</p>

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) represent significant disease burdens for most societies and susceptibility to these diseases is strongly influenced by diet and lifestyle. Physiological changes associated with T2D or CVD, such has high blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels in the blood, are often apparent prior to disease incidence. Here we integrated genetics, lipidomics, and standard clinical diagnostics to assess future T2D and CVD risk for 4,067 participants from a large prospective population-based cohort, the Malmö Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort. By training Ridge regression-based machine learning models on the measurements obtained at baseline when the individuals were healthy, we computed several risk scores for T2D and CVD incidence during up to 23 years of follow-up. We used these scores to stratify the participants into risk groups and found that a lipidomics risk score based on the quantification of 184 plasma lipid concentrations resulted in a 168% and 84% increase of the incidence rate in the highest risk group and a 77% and 53% decrease of the incidence rate in lowest risk group for T2D and CVD, respectively, compared to the average case rates of 13.8% and 22.0%. Notably, lipidomic risk correlated only marginally with polygenic risk, indicating that the lipidome and genetic variants may constitute largely independent risk factors for T2D and CVD. Risk stratification was further improved by adding standard clinical variables to the model, resulting in a case rate of 51.0% and 53.3% in the highest risk group for T2D and CVD, respectively. The participants in the highest risk group showed significantly altered lipidome compositions affecting 167 and 157 lipid species for T2D and CVD, respectively. Our results demonstrated that a subset of individuals at high risk for developing T2D or CVD can be identified years before disease incidence. The lipidomic risk, which is derived from only one single mass spectrometric measurement that is cheap and fast, is informative and could extend traditional risk assessment based on clinical assays.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The microprotein Nrs1 rewires the G1/S transcriptional machinery during nitrogen limitation in budding yeast</a></h4>

Commitment to cell division at the end of G1 phase, termed Start in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is strongly influenced by nutrient availability. To identify new dominant activators of Start that might operate under different nutrient conditions, we screened a genome-wide ORF overexpression library for genes that bypass a Start arrest caused by absence of the G1 cyclin Cln3 and the transcriptional activator Bck2. We recovered a hypothetical gene <i>YLR053c</i>, renamed <i>NRS1</i> for Nitrogen-Responsive Start regulator 1, which encodes a poorly characterized 108 amino acid microprotein. Endogenous Nrs1 was nuclear-localized, restricted to poor nitrogen conditions, induced upon TORC1 inhibition, and cell cycle-regulated with a peak at Start. <i>NRS1</i> interacted genetically with <i>SWI4</i> and <i>SWI6</i>, which encode subunits of the main G1/S transcription factor complex SBF. Correspondingly, Nrs1 physically interacted with Swi4 and Swi6 and was localized to G1/S promoter DNA. Nrs1 exhibited inherent transactivation activity, and fusion of Nrs1 to the SBF inhibitor Whi5 was sufficient to suppress other Start defects. Nrs1 appears to be a recently evolved microprotein that rewires the G1/S transcriptional machinery under poor nitrogen conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Complementary encoding of spatial information in hippocampal astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sebastiano Curreli, Jacopo Bonato, Sara Romanzi, Stefano Panzeri, Tommaso Fellin</p>

Calcium dynamics into astrocytes influence the activity of nearby neuronal structures. However, because previous reports show that astrocytic calcium signals largely mirror neighboring neuronal activity, current information coding models neglect astrocytes. Using simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual environment, we demonstrate that astrocytic calcium signals encode (i.e., statistically reflect) spatial information that could not be explained by visual cue information. Calcium events carrying spatial information occurred in topographically organized astrocytic subregions. Importantly, astrocytes encoded spatial information that was complementary and synergistic to that carried by neurons, improving spatial position decoding when astrocytic signals were considered alongside neuronal ones. These results suggest that the complementary place dependence of localized astrocytic calcium signals may regulate clusters of nearby synapses, enabling dynamic, context-dependent variations in population coding within brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, post-operative pulmonary complications and pulmonary function in abdominal surgery- Evidence from systematic reviews. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following abdominal surgery are common in patients owing to patient-related and procedure-related risk factors. Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) along with various chest physiotherapy manipulations and adjuncts have been proven to reduce PPCs. Current evidence suggests that IMT proves beneficial in reducing PPCs without additional management in varying types of surgeries.  The objective of this review was to synthesize the findings from systematic reviews that evaluate the effectiveness of IMT on abdominal surgery and assess their methodological quality. Methods This review was formed following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42020177876, OSF registry: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/K8NGV). A comprehensive search strategy identifying the effectiveness of IMT on abdominal surgery was developed using electronic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane database of a systematic review, and ClinicalKey. Methodological quality assessment was done using AMSTAR 2 tool. Data on characteristics of intervention and outcome measures were extracted. Results The search yielded 1249 articles, out of which 4 systematic reviews and meta-analysis; reviewing 9 randomized controlled trials; met the inclusion criteria. The most-reported outcome measures were respiratory muscle strength, PPCs, and pulmonary function tests. The overall quality of systematic reviews reported was high. The results for meta-analysis conducted on outcome measure PPCs, i.e., atelectasis and pneumonia reported RR=0.40 (95%CI 0.19 to 0.88), I2=0%, and RR=0.41 (95%CI 0.41 to 1.19), I2=0% respectively and maximum inspiratory pressure was MD=4.97, (95% CI -5.07 to 15.01), I2= 53%. Conclusions The review concluded that IMT is a beneficial intervention when given 2 weeks before surgery for a minimum of 15 minutes in reducing PPCs. However, factors concerning breathing cycles, respiratory flow, and rest interval should be observed for better management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A multi-parameter grading system for optimal fitting of scleral contact lenses [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While scleral lens practise has improved over the years due to factors such as availability of lenses with better materials and designs as well as experience of practitioners, a lack of objectivity appears to remain in terms of assessment of scleral lens fitting. This prospective observational work aimed to achieve standardization on this front through proposing a grading system for scleral lens fitting. Methods: After application of prosthetic replacement of ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) devices on the participants’ eyes, four fundamental components for understanding scleral lens fitting such as central and limbal corneal clearance, mid-haptic compression, and alignment of lens edge over anterior sclera were assessed through a series of slit-lamp biomicroscopy imaging as well as with anterior segment optical coherence tomography. FitConnect® was used to modify the device parameters to simulate different grading patterns on the proposed scale. Serial imaging was done for all the different lenses to compose the grading scale. Results: A clinically relevant grading scale was constructed that pictorially demonstrated grades for the different aspect of scleral lens fitting. The grades were conveniently scaled within three categories: “optimal”, “acceptable” and “not acceptable”. Conclusion: The gradation of scleral lens fitting parameters would take a step towards objectifying the assessment patterns in practise. This will also help reducing the gap between a novice and an experienced practitioner in terms of understanding of scleral lens fitting.

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Coagulopathy is one of the most common complications characterized by increased D-dimer level. We aimed to investigate the dose-response relationship between elevated D-dimer level and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in 259 critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit admission between March and December 2020. We compared the mortality rate between patients with and without elevated D-dimer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Fagan’s nomogram, and dose-response relationship were performed to determine the association between D-dimer level and mortality. Results: Overall mortality rate was 40.9% (106 patients). Median D-dimer level was higher in non-survivor group (10,170 ng/mL vs 4,050 ng/mL, p=0.028). The association remained significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis (p=0.046). The optimal cut-off for D-dimer level to predict mortality from ROC curve analysis was 9,020 ng/mL (OR (odds ratio) 3.73 [95% CI (confidence interval) 1.91 – 7.28], p<0.001). D-dimer level >9,020 ng/mL confers 67% posterior probability of mortality and D-dimer level <9,020 ng/mL had 35% probability of mortality. Conclusions: There was a non-linear dose-response relationship between D-dimer level and mortality with Pnonlinearity of 0.004. D-dimer level was associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the non-linear dose-response relationship.

     alt="Spatial distribution of beta-klotho mRNA in the mouse hypothalamus, hippocampal region, subiculum, and amygdala"/>
<p>The central expression of beta-klotho (<i>Klb</i>) is essential for the physiological actions of endocrine fibroblast growth factors. <i>Klb</i> mRNA was widely expressed throughout the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. However, the level of <i>Klb</i> expression varied between cells and contributed to a distinctive pattern of distribution within each brain structure.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Beta-klotho (KLB) is a coreceptor required for endocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 and FGF21 signaling in the brain. <i>Klb</i> is prominent within the hypothalamus, which is consistent with its metabolic functions, but diverse roles for <i>Klb</i> are now emerging. Central <i>Klb</i> expression is low but discrete and may govern FGF-targeted sites. However, given its low expression, it is unclear if <i>Klb</i> mRNA is more widespread. We performed in situ hybridization to label <i>Klb</i> mRNA to generate spatial maps capturing the distribution and levels of <i>Klb</i> within the mouse hypothalamus, hippocampal region, subiculum, and amygdala. Semiquantitative analysis revealed that <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells may express low, medium, or high levels of <i>Klb</i> mRNA. Hypothalamic <i>Klb</i> hybridization was heterogeneous and varied rostrocaudally within the same region. Most <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells were found in the lateral hypothalamic zone, but the periventricular hypothalamic region, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contained the greatest proportion of cells expressing medium or high <i>Klb</i> levels. We also found heterogeneous <i>Klb</i> hybridization in the amygdala and subiculum, where <i>Klb</i> was especially distinct within the central amygdalar nucleus and ventral subiculum, respectively. By contrast, <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells in the hippocampal region only expressed low levels of <i>Klb</i> and were typically found in the pyramidal layer of Ammon's horn or dentate gyrus. The <i>Klb</i>-labeled regions identified in this study are consistent with reported roles of <i>Klb</i> in metabolism, taste preference, and neuroprotection. However, additional identified sites, including within the hypothalamus and amygdala, may suggest novel roles for FGF15/19 or FGF21 signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Mitochondria-lysosome contact site dynamics and misregulation in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely heavily on properly regulated mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis, with multiple neurodegenerative diseases linked to dysfunction in these two organelles. Interestingly, mitochondria-lysosome membrane contact sites have been identified as a key pathway mediating their crosstalk in neurons. Recent studies have further elucidated the regulation of mitochondria-lysosome contact dynamics via distinct tethering/untethering protein machinery. Moreover, this pathway has been shown to have additional functions in regulating organelle network dynamics and metabolite transfer between lysosomes and mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recognition of discrete export signals in early flagellar subunits during bacterial Type III secretion</a></h4>

              
                Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) deliver subunits from the bacterial cytosol to nascent cell surface flagella. Early flagellar subunits that form the rod and hook substructures are unchaperoned and contain their own export signals. A gate recognition motif (GRM) docks them at the FlhBc component of the FlhAB-FliPQR export gate, but the gate must then be opened and subunits must be unfolded to pass through the flagellar channel. This induced us to seek further signals on the subunits. Here, we identify a second signal at the extreme N-terminus of flagellar rod and hook subunits and determine that key to the signal is its hydrophobicity. We show that the two export signal elements are recognised separately and sequentially, as the N-terminal signal is recognised by the flagellar export machinery only after subunits have docked at FlhB<sub>C</sub> <i>via</i> the GRM. The position of the N-terminal hydrophobic signal in the subunit sequence relative to the GRM appeared to be important, as a FlgD deletion variant (FlgD<sub>short</sub>), in which the distance between the N-terminal signal and the GRM was shortened, 'stalled' at the export machinery and was not exported. The attenuation of motility caused by FlgD<sub>short</sub> was suppressed by mutations that destabilised the closed conformation of the FlhAB-FliPQR export gate, suggesting that the hydrophobic N-terminal signal might trigger opening of the flagellar export gate.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nephronectin-Integrin α8 signaling is required for proper migration of periocular neural crest cells during chick corneal development</a></h4>

              
                During development, cells aggregate at tissue boundaries to form normal tissue architecture of organs. However, how cells are segregated into tissue precursors remains largely unknown. Cornea development is a perfect example of this process whereby neural crest cells aggregate in the periocular region prior to their migration and differentiation into corneal cells. Our recent RNA-Seq analysis identified upregulation of Nephronectin (Npnt) transcripts during early stages of corneal development where its function has not been investigated. We found that Npnt mRNA and protein are expressed by various ocular tissues including the migratory periocular neural crest (pNC), which also express the integrin alpha 8 (Itga8) receptor. Knockdown of either <i>Npnt</i> or <i>Itg</i><i>a8</i> attenuated cornea development, whereas overexpression of <i>Npnt</i> resulted in cornea thickening. Moreover, overexpression of Npnt variants lacking RGD binding sites did not affect corneal thickness. Neither the knockdown or augmentation of Npnt caused significant changes in cell proliferation, suggesting that Npnt directs pNC migration into the cornea. <i>In vitro</i> analyses showed that Npnt promotes pNC migration from explanted periocular mesenchyme, which requires Itga8, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho kinase (ROCK). Combined, these data suggest that Npnt augments cell migration into the presumptive cornea ECM by functioning as a substrate for Itgα8-positive pNC cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Improvement of muscle strength in a mouse model for congenital myopathy treated with HDAC and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                To date there are no therapies for patients with congenital myopathies, muscle disorders causing poor quality of life of affected individuals. In approximately 30% of the cases, patients with congenital myopathies carry either dominant or recessive mutations in the <i>RYR1</i> gene; recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations are accompanied by reduction of RyR1 expression and content in skeletal muscles and are associated with fiber hypotrophy and muscle weakness. Importantly, muscles of patients with recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations exhibit increased content of class II histone de-acetylases and of DNA genomic methylation. We recently created a mouse model knocked-in for the p.Q1970fsX16+p.A4329D RyR1 mutations, which are isogenic to those carried by a severely affected child suffering from a recessive form of RyR1-related multi-mini core disease. The phenotype of the RyR1 mutant mice recapitulates many aspects of the clinical picture of patients carrying recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations. We treated the compound heterozygous mice with a combination of two drugs targeting DNA methylases and class II histone de-acetylases. Here we show that treatment of the mutant mice with drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes improves muscle strength, RyR1 protein content and muscle ultrastructure. This study provides proof of concept for the pharmacological treatment of patients with congenital myopathies linked to recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations.

                Patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) may have a disproportionally severe outcome after head trauma, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we subjected knock-in mice carrying the severer S218L or milder R192Q FHM1 gain-of-function missense mutation in the <i>CACNA1A</i> gene that encodes the α<sub>1A </sub>subunit of neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channels and their wild-type (WT) littermates to experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and investigated cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), lesion volume, brain edema formation, and functional outcome. After TBI, all mutant mice displayed considerably more CSDs and seizures than WT mice, while S218L mutant mice had a substantially higher mortality. Brain edema formation and the resulting increase in intracranial pressure was more pronounced in mutant mice, while only S218L mutant mice had larger lesion volumes and worse functional outcome. Here we show that gain of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel function worsens histopathological and functional outcome after TBI in mice. This phenotype was associated with a higher number of CSDs, increased seizure activity, and more pronounced brain edema formation. Hence, our results suggest increased susceptibility for CSDs and seizures as potential mechanisms for bad outcome after TBI in FHM1 mutation carriers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sampling alternative conformational states of transporters and receptors with AlphaFold2</a></h4>

              
                Equilibrium fluctuations and triggered conformational changes often underlie the functional cycles of membrane proteins. For example, transporters mediate the passage of molecules across cell membranes by alternating between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states, while receptors undergo intracellular structural rearrangements that initiate signaling cascades. Although the conformational plasticity of these proteins has historically posed a challenge for traditional <i>de novo</i> protein structure prediction pipelines, the recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in CASP14 culminated in the modeling of a transporter in multiple conformations to high accuracy. Given that AF2 was designed to predict static structures of proteins, it remains unclear if this result represents an underexplored capability to accurately predict multiple conformations and/or structural heterogeneity. Here, we present an approach to drive AF2 to sample alternative conformations of topologically diverse transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are absent from the AF2 training set. Whereas models of most proteins generated using the default AF2 pipeline are conformationally homogeneous and nearly identical to one another, reducing the depth of the input multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) by stochastic subsampling led to the generation of accurate models in multiple conformations. In our benchmark, these conformations spanned the range between two experimental structures of interest, with models at the extremes of these conformational distributions observed to be among the most accurate (average template modeling (TM)-score of 0.94). These results suggest a straightforward approach to identifying native-like alternative states, while also highlighting the need for the next generation of deep learning algorithms to be designed to predict ensembles of biophysically relevant states.

                Combining multiple Parkinson's disease (PD) relevant cellular phenotypes might increase the accuracy of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) in vitro models. We differentiated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a LRRK2 G2019S mutation, isogenic control and genetically unrelated iPSCs into mDA neurons. Using automated fluorescence microscopy in 384-well plate format, we identified elevated levels of -synuclein and Serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129), reduced dendritic complexity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Next, we measured additional image-based phenotypes and used machine learning (ML) to accurately classify mDA neurons according to their genotype. Additionally, we show that chemical compound treatments, targeting LRRK2 kinase activity or -synuclein levels, are detectable when using ML classification based on multiple image-based phenotypes. We validated our approach using a second isogenic patient derived SNCA gene triplication mDA neuronal model. This phenotyping and classification strategy improves the exploitability of mDA neurons for disease modelling and the identification of novel PD drug targets.

                Sleep consists of two basic stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep is characterized by slow high-amplitude cortical EEG signals, while REM sleep is characterized desynchronized cortical rhythms. While, until recently, it has been widely believed that cortical activity during REM sleep is globally desynchronized, recent electrophysiological studies showed slow waves (SW) in some cortical areas during REM sleep. Electrophysiological techniques, however, have been unable to resolve the regional structure of these activities, due to relatively sparse sampling. We mapped functional gradients in cortical activity during REM sleep using mesoscale imaging in mice, and observed local SW patterns occurring mainly in somatomotor and auditory cortical regions, with minimum presence within the default mode network. The role of the cholinergic system in local desynchronization during REM sleep was also explored by calcium imaging of cholinergic terminal activity within the mouse cortex. Terminal activity was weaker in regions exhibiting SW activity more frequently during REM sleep. We also analyzed Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity dataset and found that these regions have weaker cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PRL1 and CK2 collaborate to time morning and evening phase in short photoperiods</a></h4>

              
                The TIMELESS (TIM) phosphatase, Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver-1 (PRL-1), is required for setting behavioral phase especially under short photoperiod conditions. Yet the circadian clock neurons and underlying mechanisms important for these effects are unknown. Here we demonstrate that PRL-1 function in PDF neurons is necessary and sufficient for timing morning and evening phase under short photoperiod (6:18) conditions. In standard (12:12) photoperiod, we find that PRL-1 rescue or blocking PRL-1 knockdown in PDF neurons restores wild-type morning phase. Expression of the TIM kinase shaggy (sgg) in PDF neurons suppresses in an additive manner PRL-1 period lengthening and delayed morning phase further underscoring the role of PDF neurons. In contrast to knockdown in all clock neurons, knockdown of PRL-1 selectively in PDF clock neurons does not alter the timing of morning or evening phase under standard photoperiod conditions, suggesting PRL-1 function in non-PDF neurons may also be important. In contrast to SGG effects, we find that phase delay of evening onset due to expression of a dominant negative version of the TIM kinase CK2 (CK2alphaTik) requires PRL-1. Given that TIM is a substrate of both the PRL-1 phosphatase and CK2 kinase, we hypothesize that PRL-1 dephosphorylation at specific sites may be necessary for subsequent CK2 phosphorylation to time behavior.

                The axon initial segment (AIS) is a highly specialized neuronal compartment that regulates the generation of action potentials and maintenance of neuronal polarity. Despite its importance, live imaging of the AIS is challenging due to the limited number of suitable labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we established a novel approach for live labeling of the AIS using unnatural amino acids (UAAs) and bioorthogonal click chemistry. The small size of the UAAs and the possibility of introducing them virtually anywhere into the target proteins make this method particularly suitable for live labeling and imaging of complex and spatially restricted proteins. With this approach, we labeled two large AIS components, the 186 kDa isoform of neurofascin (NF186) and the 260 kDa voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.6), and performed widefield and confocal microscopy in fixed and living neurons. Moreover, we demonstrated the applicability of this method by studying the localization of two epilepsy-causing NaV1.6 variants with a loss-of-function effect. Finally, to further improve the efficiency of the UAA incorporation, we developed adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for click labeling in primary neurons. The use of AAV vectors will facilitate the transfer of UAA-based click labeling technology to more complex biological systems, such as organotypic slice cultures, organoids, and animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Magnetoencephalography can reveal deep brain network activities linked to memory processes</a></h4>

              
                Recording from deep neural structures such as hippocampus non-invasively and yet with high temporal resolution remains a major challenge for human neuroscience. Although it has been proposed that deep neuronal activity might be recordable during cognitive tasks using magnetoencephalography (MEG), this remains to be demonstrated as the contribution of deep structures to MEG recordings may be too small to be detected or might be eclipsed by the activity of large-scale neocortical networks. In the present study, we disentangled mesial activity and large-scale networks from the MEG signals thanks to blind source separation (BSS). We then validated the MEG BSS components using intracerebral EEG signals recorded simultaneously in patients during their presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. In the MEG signals obtained during a memory task involving the recognition of old and new images, we identified with BSS a putative mesial component, which was present in all patients and all control subjects. The time course of the component selectively correlated with SEEG signals recorded from hippocampus and rhinal cortex, thus confirming its mesial origin. This finding complements previous studies with epileptic activity and opens new possibilities for using MEG to study deep brain structures in cognition and in brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG evidence that morally relevant autobiographical memories can be suppressed</a></h4>

              
                Remembering unpleasant events can trigger negative feelings. Fortunately, research indicates that unwanted memories can be suppressed to prevent them from intruding into awareness, improving our mental state. The current scientific understanding of memory suppression is, however, based mostly on simpler memories such as associations between words or pictures, which may not reflect how people control unpleasant memory intrusions in everyday life. Here, we investigated the neural and behavioural dynamics of suppressing personal and emotional autobiographical memories using a modified version of the Think/No-Think task. We asked participants to suppress memories of their own past immoral actions, which were hypothesised to be both highly intrusive and motivating to suppress. We report novel evidence from behavioural, ERP and EEG oscillation measures that autobiographical memory retrieval can be suppressed and suggest that autobiographical suppression recruits similar neurocognitive mechanisms as suppression of simple laboratory associations. Suppression did fail sometimes, and EEG oscillations indicated that such memory intrusions occurred from lapses in sustained control. Importantly however, participants improved at limiting intrusions with repeated practice. Furthermore, both behavioural and EEG evidence indicated that intentional suppression may be more difficult for memories of our morally wrong actions than memories of our morally right actions. The findings elucidate the neurocognitive correlates of autobiographical retrieval suppression and have implications for theories of morally motivated memory control.

                Intelligence captures the cognitive ability level of an individual person and electroencephalography (EEG) has been used for decades to identify neurocognitive processes related to intelligence. The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) that is elicited when, within a series of frequent standard stimuli, rare deviant stimuli are presented. As stimuli are typically presented outside the focus of attention, the MMN is suggested to capture automatic pre-attentive discrimination processes, and mixed results have been reported in relation to intelligence. However, the MMN and its relation to intelligence has only been studied in the auditory domain, thus preventing any conclusion about the involvement of automatic discrimination processes in humans dominant sensory modality, i.e., vision. Here we provide a first test of this question. Electroencephalography was recorded from 50 healthy participants during a passive visual oddball task that presented simple sequence violations as well as deviations within a more complex hidden pattern. Signed area amplitudes and fractional area latencies of the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) were calculated with and without Laplacian transformation. Neither vMMN amplitudes nor vMMN latencies were significantly related to intelligence (Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices, RAPM) and Bayes Factors suggest moderate evidence for the absence of associations. Our study presents the first test of whether neural indices of pre-attentive visual discrimination processes are related to intelligence. We discuss critical differences between the auditory and visual MMN and conclude with a discussion of limitations and recommendations for further research in this evolving field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speeded Inference Game: Opening a new chapter in the assessment of error awareness</a></h4>

              
                Influential theories on error processing assume that when we conduct errors adaptive processes are triggered to improve our behaviour and prevent errors in the future. These processes appear to be more effective after participants have detected an error. Therefore, the assessment of error awareness allowing a differential analysis of detected and undetected errors in the context of cognitive control and behavioural adjustments has gained more and more attention in the past decades. A common methodological challenge posed on all studies investigating error detection is that the number of undetected errors is usually relatively low. Here, we introduce a gamified experimental task that uses an adaptive algorithm to generate a robust and stable amount of errors with a high rate of undetected errors. Further, we were able to identify error types, which interestingly differed in terms of their detection rate. Moreover, the game-like appearance of the novel experimental task led to highly motivated participants. The results of the first study were replicated and extended by a second behavioural study. Notably, in study 2, a change in task design specifically modulated error detection, while these changes did not affect the total error rate. Potential applications of the open-source code will be discussed. With this newly developed paradigm, we wish to lay the ground for future research to understand better (neural) processes associated with error awareness.

                Crosstalk mechanisms between pericytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes preserve integrity and function of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) under physiological conditions. Long intercellular channels allowing the transfer of small molecules and organelles between distant cells called tunneling nanotubes (TNT) represent a potential substrate for energy and matter exchanges between the tripartite cellular compartments of the BBB. However, the role of TNT across BBB cells under physiological conditions and in the course of BBB dysfunction is unknown. In this work, we analyzed the TNT role in the functional dialogue between human brain endothelial cells, and brain pericytes co-cultured with human astrocytes under normal conditions or after exposure to ischemia/reperfusion, a condition in which BBB breakdown occurs, and pericytes participate in the BBB repair. Using live time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy, we found that astrocytes form long TNT with pericytes and endothelial cells and receive functional mitochondria from both cell types through this mechanism. The mitochondrial transfer also occurred in multicellular assembloids of human BBB that reproduce the three-dimensional architecture of the BBB. Under conditions of ischemia/reperfusion, TNT formation is upregulated, and astrocytes exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation were rescued from apoptosis by healthy pericytes through TNT-mediated transfer of functional mitochondria, an effect that was virtually abolished in the presence of TNT-destroying drugs. The results establish a functional role of TNT in the crosstalk between BBB cells and demonstrate that TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer from pericytes rescues astrocytes from ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. Our data confirm that the pericytes might play a pivotal role in preserving the structural and functional integrity of BBB under physiological conditions and participate in BBB repair in brain diseases.

                The locus coeruleus (LC) houses the vast majority of noradrenergic neurons in the brain and regulates many fundamental functions. While efferent projections of the LC have been extensively investigated, little is known about its local circuit organization. Here, we performed large-scale multi-patch recordings of LC noradrenergic neurons to profile their morpho-electric properties while simultaneously examining their interactions. LC neurons were diverse and could be classified into two major morpho-electric types. While chemical transmission was not detected, these neurons connected via electrical coupling at a rate comparable to other brain regions. Most connections form between dendrites and were restricted to narrowly spaced pairs or small clusters of neurons of the same type. Furthermore, more than two coupled pairs were often identified from individual recording sets that follow a train-like organizational pattern. The assembly of LC neurons thus follows a spatial and cell type-specific wiring principle that may be imposed by a unique train-like rule.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fluctuation-driven plasticity allows for flexible rewiring of neuronal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic connections in neuronal circuits are modulated by pre- and post-synaptic spiking activity. Heuristic models of this process of synaptic plasticity can provide excellent fits to results from in-vitro experiments in which pre- and post-synaptic spiking is varied in a controlled fashion. However, the plasticity rules inferred from fitting such data are inevitably unstable, in that given constant pre- and post-synaptic activity the synapse will either fully potentiate or depress. This instability can be held in check by adding additional mechanisms, such as homeostasis. Here we consider an alternative scenario in which the plasticity rule itself is stable. When this is the case, net potentiation or depression only occur when pre- and post-synaptic activity vary in time, e.g. when driven by time-varying inputs. We study how the features of such inputs shape the recurrent synaptic connections in models of neuronal circuits. In the case of oscillatory inputs, the resulting structure is strongly affected by the phase relationship between drive to different neurons. In large networks, distributed phases tend to lead to hierarchical clustering. Our results may be of relevance for understanding the effect of sensory-driven inputs, which are by nature time-varying, on synaptic plasticity, and hence on learning and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presence or absence of a prefrontal sulcus is linked to reasoning performance during child development</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between structural variability in late-developing association cortices like the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the development of higher-order cognitive skills is not well understood. Recent findings show that the morphology of LPFC sulci predicts reasoning performance; this work led to the observation of substantial individual variability in the morphology of one of these sulci, the para-intermediate frontal sulcus (pimfs). Here, we sought to characterize this variability and assess its behavioral significance. To this end, we identified the pimfs in a developmental cohort of 72 participants, ages 6-18. When controlling for age, the presence or absence of the ventral component of the pimfs was associated with reasoning, as was the total surface area of pimfs. These findings show that multiple features of sulci can support the development of complex cognitive abilities and highlight the importance of considering individual differences in local morphology when exploring the neurodevelopmental basis of cognition.

	<p>Metals&amp;amp;mdash;especially iron, copper and manganese&amp;amp;mdash;are important elements of brain functions and development. Metal-dysregulation homeostasis is associated with brain-structure damage to the motor, cognitive and emotional systems, and leads to neurodegenerative processes. There is more and more evidence that specialized cognitive and motor exercises can enhance brain function and attenuate neurodegeneration in mechanisms, such as improving neuroplasticity by altering the synaptic structure and function in many brain regions. Psychological and physical methods of rehabilitation are now becoming increasingly important, as pharmacological treatments for movement, cognitive and emotional symptoms are limited. The present study describes physical and cognitive rehabilitation methods of patients associated with metal-induced neurotoxicity such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. In our review, we describe physical (e.g., virtual-reality environments, robotic-assists training) and psychological (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies) methods, significantly improving the quality of life and independence of patients associated with storage diseases. Storage diseases are a diverse group of hereditary metabolic defects characterized by the abnormal cumulation of storage material in cells. This topic is being addressed due to the fact that rehabilitation plays a vital role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately so far there are no specific guidelines concerning physiotherapy in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in regards to duration of exercise, type of exercise and intensity, as well as frequency of exercise. This is in part due to the variety of symptoms of these diseases and the various levels of disease progression. This further proves the need for more research to be carried out on the role of exercise in neurodegenerative disorder treatment.</p>

	<p>Verbs are central to the syntactic structure of sentences, and, thus, important for learning one&amp;amp;rsquo;s native language. This study examined how children visually inspect events as they hear, and do not hear, a new verb. Specifically, there is evidence that children may focus on the agent of the action or may prioritize attention to the action being performed; to date, little evidence is available. This study used an eye tracker to track 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds&amp;amp;rsquo; looking to the agent (i.e., face) vs. action (i.e., hands) while viewing events linked to a new verb as well as distractor events. A Tobii X30 eye tracker recorded children&amp;amp;rsquo;s fixations to AOIs (head/face and hands) as they watched three target events and two distractor events in different orders during the learning phase, and pointed to one of two events in two test trials. This was repeated for a second novel verb. Pointing results show that children in all age groups were able to learn and extend the new verbs to new events at test. Additionally, across age groups, when viewing target events, children increased their looking to the hands (where the action is taking place) as those trials progressed and decreased their looking to the agents&amp;amp;rsquo; face, which is less informative for learning a new verb&amp;amp;rsquo;s meaning. In contrast, when viewing distractor events, children decreased their looking to hands over trials and maintained their attention to the face. In summary, children&amp;amp;rsquo;s visual attention to agents&amp;amp;rsquo; faces and hands differed depending on whether the events cooccurred with the new verb. These results are important as this is the first study to show this pattern of visual attention during verb learning, and, thus, these results help reveal underlying attentional strategies children may use when learning verbs.</p>

	<p>Cognitive conflict effects are well characterized within unimodality. However, little is known about cross-modal conflicts and their neural bases. This study characterizes the two types of visual and auditory cross-modal conflicts through working memory tasks and brain activities. The participants consisted of 31 healthy, right-handed, young male adults. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test (PVSAT) were performed under distractor and no distractor conditions. Distractor conditions comprised two conditions in which either the PASAT or PVSAT was the target task, and the other was used as a distractor stimulus. Additionally, oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration changes in the frontoparietal regions were measured during tasks. The results showed significantly lower PASAT performance under distractor conditions than under no distractor conditions, but not in the PVSAT. Oxy-Hb changes in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPC) significantly increased in the PASAT with distractor compared with no distractor conditions, but not in the PVSAT. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between &amp;amp;Delta;task performance accuracy and &amp;amp;Delta;Oxy-Hb in the bilateral IPC only in the PASAT. Visual cross-modal conflict significantly impairs auditory task performance, and bilateral VLPFC and IPC are key regions in inhibiting visual cross-modal distractors.</p>

	<p>Alpha is the predominant rhythm of the human electroencephalogram, but its function, multiple generators and functional coupling patterns are still relatively unknown. In this regard, alpha connectivity patterns can change between different cortical generators depending on the status of the brain. Therefore, in the light of the communication through coherence framework, an alpha functional network depends on the functional coupling patterns in a determined state. This notion has a relevance for brain-state dependent EEG-TMS because, beyond the local state, a network connectivity overview at rest could provide further and more comprehensive information for the definition of &amp;amp;lsquo;instantaneous state&amp;amp;rsquo; at the stimulation moment, rather than just the local state around the stimulation site. For this reason, we studied functional coupling at rest in 203 healthy subjects with MEG data. Sensor signals were source localized and connectivity was studied at the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) between three different cortical areas (occipital, parietal and prefrontal). Two different and complementary phase-coherence metrices were used. Our results show a consistent connectivity between parietal and prefrontal regions whereas occipito-prefrontal connectivity is less marked and occipito-parietal connectivity is extremely low, despite physical closeness. We consider our results a relevant add-on for informed, individualized real-time brain state dependent stimulation, with possible contributions to novel, personalized non-invasive therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Morphology of an Inhibitory Retinal Interneuron Enables Simultaneous Local and Global Synaptic Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amacrine cells, inhibitory interneurons of the retina, feature synaptic inputs and outputs in close proximity throughout their dendritic trees, making them notable exceptions to prototypical somato-dendritic integration with output transmitted via axonal action potentials. The extent of dendritic compartmentalization in amacrine cells with widely differing dendritic tree morphology, however, is largely unexplored. Combining compartmental modeling, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, targeted microiontophoresis and multielectrode patch-clamp recording (voltage and current clamp, capacitance measurement of exocytosis), we investigated integration in the AII amacrine cell, a narrow-field electrically coupled interneuron that participates in multiple, distinct microcircuits. Physiological experiments were performed with <I>in vitro</I> slices prepared from retinas of both male and female rats. We found that the morphology of the AII enables simultaneous local and global integration of inputs targeted to different dendritic regions. Local integration occurs within spatially restricted dendritic subunits and narrow time windows and is largely unaffected by the strength of electrical coupling. In contrast, global integration across the dendritic tree occurs over longer time periods and is markedly influenced by the strength of electrical coupling. These integrative properties enable AII amacrines to combine local control of synaptic plasticity with location-independent global integration. Dynamic inhibitory control of dendritic subunits is likely to be of general importance for amacrine cells, including cells with small dendritic trees, as well as for inhibitory interneurons in other regions of the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our understanding of synaptic integration is based on the prototypical morphology of a neuron with multiple dendrites and a single axon at opposing ends of a cell body. Many neurons, notably retinal amacrine cells, are exceptions to this arrangement, and display input and output synapses interspersed along their dendritic branches. In the large dendritic trees of some amacrine cells, such arrangements can give rise to multiple computational subunits. Other amacrine cells, with small dendritic trees, have been assumed to operate as single computational units. Here, we report the surprising result that despite a small dendritic tree, the AII amacrine cell simultaneously performs local integration of synaptic inputs (over smaller dendritic subregions) and global integration across the entire cell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KCTD8 and KCTD12 Facilitate Axonal Expression of GABAB Receptors in Habenula Cholinergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons mediate strong presynaptic excitation and control aversive memory expression. K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) proteins are key interacting partners of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors; it remains unclear whether and how KCTDs contribute to GABA<SUB>B</SUB> excitatory signaling. Here, we show that KCTD8 and KCTD12 in these neurons facilitate the GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors expression in axonal terminals and contribute to presynaptic excitation by GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors. Genetically knocking out <I>KCTD8/12/16</I> or <I>KCTD8/12</I>, but not other combinations of the three <I>KCTD</I> isoforms, substantially reduced GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors&ndash;mediated potentiation of glutamate release and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in response to axonal stimulation, whereas they had no effect on GABA<SUB>B</SUB>-mediated inhibition in the somata of cholinergic neurons within the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway in mice of either sex. The physiological phenotypes were associated with a significant decrease in the GABA<SUB>B</SUB> expression within the axonal terminals but not the somata. Overexpressing either KCTD8 or KCTD12 in the <I>KCTD8/12/16</I> triple knock-out mice reversed the changes in axonal GABA<SUB>B</SUB> expression and presynaptic excitation. In mice lacking the KCTDs, aversion-predicting cues produced stronger neuronal activation in the interpeduncular nucleus, and the infusion of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> agonist in this nucleus produced a weaker effect on fear extinction. Collectively, our results reveal isoform-specific roles of KCTD proteins in enriching the axonal expression of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors, facilitating their presynaptic signaling, and modulating aversion-related memory processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors represent the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, but they mediate strong presynaptic excitation in the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway and modulate aversion memory expression. KCTD proteins are integral constituents of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors. By analyzing the physiological, neuroanatomical, and behavioral phenotypes of multiple KCTD knock-out mouse lines, we show that KCTD8 and KCTD12 facilitate the axonal expression and hence presynaptic excitation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons and control cued-aversion memory formation and expression in the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway. These results expand the physiological and behavioral functions of KCTDs in modulating the brain neural circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stabilization of Spine Synaptopodin by mGluR1 Is Required for mGluR-LTD</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions forming the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses, undergo activity-dependent molecular and structural remodeling. Activation of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation, induces LTD, but whether this is accompanied with spine elimination remains unresolved. A subset of telencephalic mushroom spines contains the spine apparatus (SA), an enigmatic organelle composed of stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whose formation depends on the expression of the actin-bundling protein Synaptopodin. Allocation of Synaptopodin to spines appears governed by cell-intrinsic mechanisms as the relative frequency of spines harboring Synaptopodin is conserved <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I>. Here we show that expression of Synaptopodin/SA in spines is required for induction of mGluR-LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of male mice. Post-mGluR-LTD, mushroom spines lacking Synaptopodin/SA are selectively lost, whereas spines harboring it are preserved. This process, dependent on activation of mGluR1 but not mGluR5, is conserved in mature mouse neurons and rat neurons of both sexes. Mechanistically, we find that mGluR1 supports physical retention of Synaptopodin within excitatory spine synapses during LTD while triggering lysosome-dependent degradation of the protein residing in dendritic shafts. Together, these results reveal a cellular mechanism, dependent on mGluR1, which enables selective preservation of stronger spines containing Synaptopodin/SA while eliminating weaker ones and potentially countering spurious strengthening by <I>de novo</I> recruitment of Synaptopodin. Overall, our results identify spines with Synaptopodin/SA as the locus of mGluR-LTD and underscore the importance of the molecular microanatomy of spines in synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term changes in functional synaptic strength are associated with modification of synaptic connectivity through stabilization or elimination of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic locus of excitatory synapses. How heterogeneous spine microanatomy instructs spine remodeling after long-term synaptic depression (LTD) remains unclear. Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR5 induce a form of LTD critical to circuit function in physiological and disease conditions. Our results identify spines containing the protein Synaptopodin, which enables local assembly of a spine apparatus, as the locus of expression of mGluR-LTD and demonstrate a specific role of mGluR1 in promoting selective loss after mGluR-LTD of mature dendritic spines lacking Synaptopodin/spine apparatus. These findings highlight the fundamental contribution of spine microanatomy in selectively enabling functional and structural plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Daam2 Regulates Myelin Structure and the Oligodendrocyte Actin Cytoskeleton through Rac1 and Gelsolin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelin is essential to neuronal health and CNS function, and oligodendrocytes (OLs) undergo a complex process of cytoskeletal remodeling to form compact myelin sheaths. We previously discovered that a formin protein, Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2), suppresses OL differentiation through Wnt signaling; however, its role in cytoskeletal control remains unknown. To investigate this, we used OL-specific Daam2 conditional knockout (Daam2 cKO) mice of either sex and found myelin decompaction during an active period of myelination in postnatal development and motor coordination deficits in adulthood. Using primary OL cultures, we found Daam2-depleted OLs showed morphologic dysregulation during differentiation, suggesting that Daam2 regulates the OL cytoskeleton. <I>In vivo</I> screening identified the actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin as possible effectors in Daam2-deficient OL cytoskeletal regulation. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function (LOF) experiments in primary OLs, we found that Rac1 and Gelsolin operate downstream of Daam2 in OL differentiation, with Gelsolin and Daam2 promoting and inhibiting membrane spreading during late differentiation, respectively. <I>In vivo</I> experiments using Daam2 cKO mice revealed increased protein levels of Gelsolin in the developing white matter with no change in RNA levels, suggesting that Daam2 acts in a posttranslational manner to suppress Gelsolin levels. <I>In vitro</I> biochemical studies show Daam2 induces Gelsolin ubiquitination and degradation in OLs. Together, our studies show Daam2 is essential for formation of functional myelin through modulation of Gelsolin levels to regulate the OL cytoskeleton. These findings further demonstrate the critical role of cytoskeletal dynamics in myelination and reveal novel avenues for treatment of a variety of white matter diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper myelin formation is essential to CNS function, and oligodendrocytes (OLs) require extensive changes in the actin cytoskeleton to form myelin sheaths. Here, we show that the formin protein Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2) is necessary for myelin compaction during development and motor learning in adulthood. Further, we demonstrate that Daam2 regulates OL differentiation and morphology through actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin. Lastly, we find that Daam2 may control myelin compaction by modulating the ubiquitination and degradation of Gelsolin through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. These findings reveal novel pathways for regulating myelin structure and function during white matter development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contralateral Limb Specificity for Movement Preparation in the Parietal Reach Region</a></h4>

              
                <p>The canonical view of motor control is that distal musculature is controlled primarily by the contralateral cerebral hemisphere; unilateral brain lesions typically affect contralateral but not ipsilateral musculature. Contralateral-only limb deficits following a unilateral lesion suggest but do not prove that control is strictly contralateral: the loss of a contribution of the lesioned hemisphere to the control of the ipsilesional limb could be masked by the intact contralateral drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere. To distinguish between these possibilities, we serially inactivated the parietal reach region, comprising the posterior portion of medial intraparietal area, the anterior portion of V6a, and portions of the lateral occipital parietal area, in each hemisphere of 2 monkeys (23 experimental sessions, 46 injections total) to evaluate parietal reach region's contribution to the contralateral reaching deficits observed following lateralized brain lesions. Following unilateral inactivation, reach reaction times with the contralesional limb were slowed compared with matched blocks of control behavioral data; there was no effect of unilateral inactivation on the reaction time of either ipsilesional limb reaches or saccadic eye movements. Following bilateral inactivation, reaching was slowed in both limbs, with an effect size in each no different from that produced by unilateral inactivation. These findings indicate contralateral organization of reach preparation in posterior parietal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Unilateral brain lesions typically affect contralateral but not ipsilateral musculature. Contralateral-only limb deficits following a unilateral lesion suggest but do not prove that control is strictly contralateral: the loss of a contribution of the lesioned hemisphere to the control of the ipsilesional limb could be masked by the intact contralateral drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere. Unilateral lesions cannot distinguish between contralateral and bilateral control, but bilateral lesions can. Here we show similar movement initiation deficits after combined unilateral and bilateral inactivation of the parietal reach region, indicating contralateral organization of reach preparation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Coupling between Infragranular and Subplate Layers to Layer 1 Neurons Before Ear Opening and throughout the Critical Period Depends on Peripheral Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical layer 1 (L1) contains a diverse population of interneurons that can modulate processing in superficial cortical layers, but the intracortical sources of synaptic input to these neurons and how these inputs change over development and with sensory experience is unknown. We here investigated the changing intracortical connectivity to L1 in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice of both sexes in <I>in vitro</I> slices across development using laser-scanning photostimulation. Before postnatal day (P)10, L1 cells receive excitatory input from within L1, L2/3, L4, and L5/6 as well as from subplate. Excitatory inputs from all layers increase, especially from L4, and peak during P10&ndash;P16, around the peak of the critical period for tonotopy. Inhibitory inputs followed a similar pattern. Functional circuit diversity in L1 emerges after P16. In adults, L1 neurons receive ascending inputs from L2/3 and L5/6, but only few inputs from L4. The transient hyperconnectivity from deep layers but not L2/3 is absent in deaf mice. Our results demonstrate that deep excitatory and superficial inhibitory circuits are tightly linked in early development and might provide a functional scaffold for the layers in between. These results suggest that early thalamically driven spontaneous and sensory activity in subplate can be relayed to L1 from the earliest ages on and shape L1 connectivity from deep layers. Our results also reveal a period of high transient columnar hyperconnectivity after ear opening coinciding with the critical period, suggesting that circuits originating in deep layers might play a key role in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> L1 contains a diverse population of interneurons that can modulate processing in superficial cortical layers but the sources of synaptic input to these neurons and how these inputs change over development is unknown. We found that during the critical period a large fraction of excitatory inputs to L1 originated in L5/6 and the cortical subplate. This hyperconnectivity is absent in deaf mice. Our results directly demonstrate that deep excitatory and superficial inhibitory circuits are tightly linked in early development and might provide a functional scaffold for the layers in between.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">TRPV1-Lineage Somatosensory Fibers Communicate with Taste Neurons in the Mouse Parabrachial Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Trigeminal neurons convey somatosensory information from craniofacial tissues. In mouse brain, ascending projections from medullary trigeminal neurons arrive at taste neurons in the parabrachial (PB) nucleus, suggesting that taste neurons participate in somatosensory processing. However, the cell types that support this convergence were undefined. Using Cre-directed optogenetics and <I>in vivo</I> neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching PB taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual PB neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers arriving at the dorsal trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the PB area. We also recorded PB neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers elicited responses in traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral PB nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to TRPV1-lineage fiber stimulation, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons responsive to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited PB bitter taste cells. Multivariate and machine learning analyses revealed the PB confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. Our results reveal that TRPV1-lineage fibers, which have defined roles in thermosensation and pain, communicate with PB taste neurons. This multisensory convergence supports dependencies between gustatory and somatosensory hedonic representations in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The parabrachial (PB) nucleus participates in autonomic and integrative neural processing for diverse sensory modalities. We recently found in mice that trigeminal neurons supplying craniofacial somatosensation project to PB neurons sensitive to tastes. Here, we show that trigeminal projections to PB gustatory cells are driven by a genetic class of thermosensory and nociceptive fiber. Input from these fibers was associated with PB neural sensitivity to aversive oral temperatures and tastes and supported a multimodal neural representation of sensory valence across gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. These results reveal gustation and somatosensation to be only components of a larger PB code that captures sensory value. Defining this circuit has implications for understanding the neural representation of taste, temperature, and also pain-related phenomena.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopamine Release in Nucleus Accumbens Is under Tonic Inhibition by Adenosine A1 Receptors Regulated by Astrocytic ENT1 and Dysregulated by Ethanol</a></h4>

              
                <p>Striatal adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (A<SUB>1</SUB>R) activation can inhibit dopamine release. A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In <I>ex vivo</I> striatal slices from male and female mice, A<SUB>1</SUB>R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine reduced dopamine release and promoted A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition, and, conversely, virally mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor [GPCR-activation based (GRAB)-Ado], we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 m<scp>m</scp>) promoted A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine axons in the mammalian striatum are emerging as strategic sites where neuromodulators can powerfully influence dopamine output in health and disease. We found that ambient levels of the neuromodulator adenosine tonically inhibit dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core via adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs), to a variable level that promotes the contrast in dopamine signals released by different frequencies of activity. We reveal that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on astrocytes limits this tonic inhibition, and that ethanol promotes it by diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. These findings support the hypotheses that A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs on dopamine axons inhibit dopamine release and, furthermore, that astrocytes perform important roles in setting the level of striatal dopamine output, in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Out of Rhythm: Compromised Precision of Theta-Gamma Coupling Impairs Associative Memory in Old Age</a></h4>

              
                <p>Episodic memory declines with advancing adult age. This decline is particularly pronounced when associations between items and their contexts need to be formed. According to theories of neural communication, the precise coupling of gamma power to the phase of the theta rhythm supports associative memory formation. To investigate whether age differences in associative memory are related to compromised theta-gamma coupling, we took EEG recordings during the encoding phase of an item-context association task. Fifty-eight younger (33 females) and 55 older (24 females) adults studied pictures of objects superimposed on background scenes. In a recognition test, objects were presented on old or new backgrounds, and participants responded if they had seen (1) the object and (2) the object/scene pair. Theta-gamma coupling supported pair memory formation in both age groups. Whereas pair memory was associated with coupling closer to the peak of the theta rhythm, item-only memory was associated with a deviation in phase angle relative to pair memory. Furthermore, a stable relation between coupling phase and pair memory performance demonstrated that coupling closer to the peak is beneficial for associative memory. Critically, older adults' lower pair memory was accompanied by a shift in coupling phase relative to that of younger adults. In concert, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that decrements in the temporal precision with which gamma power is coupled to a specific theta phase underlie the decline of associative memory in normal cognitive aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> According to prominent theories of neural communication, the precise coordination of oscillatory activity enables the formation of associative memories. We propose that normal cognitive aging impairs associative memory formation by compromising the temporal precision of neural communication. We show that the coupling of high-frequency gamma power to low-frequency theta phase supports associative memory formation in both younger and older adults, with coupling closer to the theta peak benefitting memory performance. However, compared with younger adults, the coupling phase angle is shifted in time and is more variable in the older adults. We conclude that alterations in the precise timing of theta-gamma coupling contribute to adult age differences in associative memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Retrieval-Related Anterior Shift Is Moderated by Age and Correlates with Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent research suggests that episodic memory is associated with systematic differences in the localization of neural activity observed during memory encoding and retrieval. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon whereby the retrieval of a stimulus event (e.g., a scene image) is associated with a peak neural response which is localized more anteriorly than the response elicited when the stimulus is experienced directly. Here, we examine whether the magnitude of the anterior shift (i.e., the distance between encoding- and retrieval-related response peaks) is moderated by age, and also whether the shift is associated with memory performance. Younger and older human subjects of both sexes underwent fMRI as they completed encoding and retrieval tasks on word-face and word-scene pairs. We localized peak scene and face selectivity for each individual participant within the face-selective precuneus and in three scene-selective (parahippocampal place area [PPA], medial place area, occipital place area) ROIs. In line with recent findings, we identified an anterior shift in the PPA and occipital place area in both age groups and, in older adults only, in the medial place area and precuneus also. Of importance, the magnitude of the anterior shift was larger in older than in younger adults. The shift within the PPA exhibited an age-invariant across-participant negative correlation with source memory performance, such that a smaller displacement between encoding- and retrieval-related neural activity was associated with better performance. These findings provide novel insights into the functional significance of the anterior shift, especially in relation to memory decline in older age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive aging is associated with reduced ability to retrieve precise details of previously experienced events. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon in which category-selective cortical activity at retrieval is localized anterior to the peak activity at encoding. The shift is thought to reflect a bias at retrieval in favor of semantic and abstract information at the expense of low-level perceptual detail. Here, we report that the anterior shift is exaggerated in older relative to younger adults, and we demonstrate that a larger shift in the parahippocampal place area is associated with poorer memory performance. These findings suggest that the shift is sensitive to increasing age and that it is moderated by the quality and content of the retrieved episode.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sleep-Dependent Facilitation of Visual Perceptual Learning Is Consistent with a Learning-Dependent Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>How sleep leads to offline performance gains in learning remains controversial. A use-dependent model assumes that sleep processing leading to performance gains occurs based on general cortical usage during wakefulness, whereas a learning-dependent model assumes that this processing is specific to learning. Here, we found evidence that supports a learning-dependent model in visual perceptual learning (VPL) in humans (both sexes). First, we measured the strength of spontaneous oscillations during sleep after two training conditions that required the same amount of training or visual cortical usage; one generated VPL (learning condition), while the other did not (interference condition). During a post-training nap, slow-wave activity (SWA) and sigma activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and theta activity during REM sleep were source localized to the early visual areas using retinotopic mapping. Inconsistent with a use-dependent model, only in the learning condition, sigma and theta activity, not SWA, increased in a trained region-specific manner and correlated with performance gains. Second, we investigated the roles of occipital sigma and theta activity during sleep. Occipital sigma activity during NREM sleep was significantly correlated with performance gains in presleep learning; however, occipital theta activity during REM sleep was correlated with presleep learning stabilization, shown as resilience to interference from postsleep learning in a trained region-specific manner. Occipital SWA was not associated with offline performance gains or stabilization. These results demonstrate that sleep processing leading to performance gains is learning dependent in VPL and involves occipital sigma and theta activity during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study shows strong evidence that could help resolve the long-standing controversy surrounding sleep processing that strengthens learning (performance gains). There are two conflicting models. A use-dependent model assumes that sleep processing leading to performance gains occurs because of general cortical usage during wakefulness, whereas a learning-dependent model assumes that processing occurs specifically for learning. Using visual perceptual learning and interference paradigms, we found that processing did not take place after general cortical usage. Moreover, sigma activity during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and theta activity during REM sleep in occipital areas were found to be involved in processing, which is consistent with the learning-dependent model and not the use-dependent model. These results support the learning-dependent model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Brain Selectively Tunes to Unfamiliar Voices during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain continues to respond selectively to environmental stimuli during sleep. However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition, is not fully understood. Here, we present 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detect K-complexes, sleep spindles, and microarousals, and assess event-related and frequency responses as well as intertrial phase synchronization to the different stimuli presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observe larger evoked potentials, more precise time-locking of brain responses in the delta band (1&ndash;4 Hz), and stronger activity in the high frequency (&gt;16 Hz) range, in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear completely when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the important internal processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital external sensory information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has shown that sensory processing continues during sleep. Here, we studied the capacity of the sleeping brain to extract and process relevant sensory information. We presented sleepers with their own names and unfamiliar names spoken by either an FV or a UFV. During NREM sleep, UFVs elicited more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. By contrasting stimuli that evoked K-complexes, we demonstrate that UFVs evoked larger, more synchronized brain responses as well as stronger power at high frequencies (&gt;16 Hz) relative to FVs. These differences in brain responses disappeared when no K-complexes were evoked. Our results suggest a pivotal role for K-complexes in the selective processing of relevant information during NREM sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrating Reward Information for Prospective Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Value-based decision-making is often studied in a static context, where participants decide which option to select from those currently available. However, everyday life often involves an additional dimension: deciding when to select to maximize reward. Recent evidence suggests that agents track the latent reward of an option, updating changes in their latent reward estimate, to achieve appropriate selection timing (latent reward tracking). However, this strategy can be difficult to distinguish from one in which the optimal selection time is estimated in advance, allowing an agent to wait a predetermined amount of time before selecting, without needing to monitor an option's latent reward (distance-to-goal tracking). Here, we show that these strategies can in principle be dissociated. Human brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), while female and male participants performed a novel decision task. Participants were shown an option and decided when to select it, as its latent reward changed from trial-to-trial. While the latent reward was uncued, it could be estimated using cued information about the option's starting value and value growth rate. We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to assess whether EEG signals more closely resembled latent reward tracking or distance-to-goal tracking. This approach successfully dissociated the strategies in this task. Starting value and growth rate were translated into a distance-to-goal signal, far in advance of selecting the option. Latent reward could not be independently decoded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using high temporal resolution neural recordings to identify internally computed decision variables in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reward-seeking behavior involves acting at the right time. However, the external world does not always tell us when an action is most rewarding, necessitating internal representations that guide action timing. Specifying this internal neural representation is challenging because it might stem from a variety of strategies, many of which make similar predictions about brain activity. This study used a novel approach to test whether alternative strategies could be dissociated in principle. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we were able to distinguish between candidate internal representations for selection timing. This shows how pattern analysis methods can be used to measure latent decision information in noninvasive neural data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Anti-Inflammatory Agent Bindarit Attenuates the Impairment of Neural Development through Suppression of Microglial Activation in a Neonatal Hydrocephalus Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neonatal hydrocephalus presents with various degrees of neuroinflammation and long-term neurologic deficits in surgically treated patients, provoking a need for additional medical treatment. We previously reported elevated neuroinflammation and severe periventricular white matter damage in the <I>progressive hydrocephalus</I> (<I>prh</I>) mutant which contains a point mutation in the <I>Ccdc39</I> gene, causing loss of cilia-mediated unidirectional CSF flow. In this study, we identified cortical neuropil maturation defects such as impaired excitatory synapse maturation and loss of homeostatic microglia, and swimming locomotor defects in early postnatal <I>prh</I> mutant mice. Strikingly, systemic application of the anti-inflammatory small molecule bindarit significantly supports healthy postnatal cerebral cortical development in the <I>prh</I> mutant. While bindarit only mildly reduced the ventricular volume, it significantly improved the edematous appearance and myelination of the corpus callosum. Moreover, the treatment attenuated thinning in cortical Layers II&ndash;IV, excitatory synapse formation, and interneuron morphogenesis, by supporting the ramified-shaped homeostatic microglia from excessive cell death. Also, the therapeutic effect led to the alleviation of a spastic locomotor phenotype of the mutant. We found that microglia, but not peripheral monocytes, contribute to amoeboid-shaped activated myeloid cells in <I>prh</I> mutants' corpus callosum and the proinflammatory cytokines expression. Bindarit blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in the <I>prh</I> mutant. Collectively, we revealed that amelioration of neuroinflammation is crucial for white matter and neuronal maturation in neonatal hydrocephalus. Future studies of bindarit treatment combined with CSF diversion surgery may provide long-term benefits supporting neuronal development in neonatal hydrocephalus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In neonatal hydrocephalus, little is known about the signaling cascades of neuroinflammation or the impact of such inflammatory insults on neural cell development within the perinatal cerebral cortex. Here, we report that proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells, the majority of which are derived from microglia, impairs periventricular myelination and cortical neuronal maturation using the mouse <I>prh</I> genetic model of neonatal hydrocephalus. Administration of bindarit, an anti-inflammatory small molecule that blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation, restored the cortical thinning and synaptic maturation defects in the <I>prh</I> mutant brain through suppression of microglial activation. These data indicate the potential therapeutic use of anti-inflammatory reagents targeting neuroinflammation in the treatment of neonatal hydrocephalus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting the Balance of Protein Quality Control Protein UBQLN2 Accelerates Tau Proteinopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tau protein accumulation drives toxicity in several neurodegenerative disorders. To better understand the pathways regulating tau homeostasis in disease, we investigated the role of ubiquilins (UBQLNs)&mdash;a class of proteins linked to ubiquitin-mediated protein quality control (PQC) and various neurodegenerative diseases&mdash;in regulating tau. Cell-based assays identified UBQLN2 as the primary brain-expressed UBQLN to regulate tau. UBQLN2 efficiently lowered wild-type tau levels regardless of aggregation, suggesting that UBQLN2 interacts with and regulates tau protein under normal conditions or early in disease. Moreover, UBQLN2 itself proved to be prone to accumulation as insoluble protein in male and female tau transgenic mice and the human tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy. Genetic manipulation of UBQLN2 in a tauopathy mouse model demonstrated that a physiological UBQLN2 balance is required for tau homeostasis. UBQLN2 overexpression exacerbated phosphorylated tau pathology and toxicity in mice expressing P301S mutant tau, whereas P301S mice lacking UBQLN2 showed significantly reduced phosphorylated tau. Further studies support the view that an imbalance of UBQLN2 perturbs ubiquitin-dependent PQC and autophagy. We conclude that changes in UBQLN2 levels, whether because of pathogenic mutations or secondary to disease states, such as tauopathy, contribute to proteostatic imbalances that exacerbate neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We defined a role for the protein quality control protein Ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2), in age-related neurodegenerative tauopathies. This group of disorders is characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates, which differ when UBQLN2 levels are altered. Given the lack of effective disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies and the function of UBQLN2 in handling various disease-linked proteins, we explored the role of UBQLN2 in regulating tau. We found that UBQLN2 reduced tau levels in cell models but behaved differently in mouse brain, where it accelerated mutant tau pathology and tau-mediated toxicity. A better understanding of the diverse functions of regulatory proteins like UBQLN2 can elucidate some of the causative factors in neurodegenerative disease and outline new routes to therapeutic intervention.</p>

                <p>The development of painful paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) represents a major dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel chemotherapy. Here we report a promising effect of duvelisib (Copiktra), a novel FDA-approved PI3K/ isoform-specific inhibitor, in preventing paclitaxel-induced pain-like behavior and pronociceptive signaling in DRGs and spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) in rat and mouse model of PIPN. Duvelisib blocked the development of mechanical hyperalgesia in both males and females. Moreover, duvelisib prevented paclitaxel-induced sensitization of TRPV1 receptors, and increased PI3K/Akt signaling in small-diameter DRG neurons and an increase of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells within DRGs. Specific optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory neurons combined with patch-clamp recording revealed that duvelisib inhibited paclitaxel-induced weakening of inhibitory, mainly glycinergic control on SCDH excitatory neurons. Enhanced excitatory and reduced inhibitory neurotransmission in the SCDH following PIPN was also alleviated by duvelisib application. In summary, duvelisib showed a promising ability to prevent neuropathic pain in PIPN. The potential use of our findings in human medicine may be augmented by the fact that duvelisib is an FDA-approved drug with known side effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that duvelisib, a novel FDA-approved PI3K/ isoform-specific inhibitor, prevents the development of paclitaxel-induced pain-like behavior in males and females and prevents pronociceptive signaling in DRGs and spinal cord dorsal horn in rat and mouse model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.</p>

                Background: Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life healthcare can be reduced by showing physicians how to best respond to a documented underlying cause: African American families’ hopes for a miracle via divine intervention influence their end-of-life medical decisions, like, for example, making them not want to withdraw ventilatory support in cases of poor neurologic prognosis because they are still hoping for God to intervene.  Methods: Autoethnographic research probing the author’s Spiritual Care experience in this context yields a nuanced, 90-second point-of-care spiritual intervention physicians can use to address the religious aspect of African American families who base end-of-life medical decisions on their hopes for a miracle via divine intervention. Autoethnographic analysis is framed by physician-author, Dr. Jessica Zitter’s documented journey of grappling with this context. The evolution of Dr. Zitter’s responses to miracle-hoping African American families provides a framework for applying autoethnographic analysis to a critical appropriation of the Johns Hopkins “AMEN” communication protocol for families hoping for a miracle.  Results: The common instinct of white physicians to remain neutral, holding miracle-hoping African American families at arm’s length, rather than supportively engaging their hopes, is shown to be an intellectual ruse for emotional avoidance. A novel, counterintuitive spiritual intervention for the religious aspect of miracle-hoping African American families is integrated into an existing physician communication protocol for responding to families hoping for a miracle with recommendations for utilization of existing communication technology when necessary.  Conclusion: Properly addressing the religious dimension of African American families hoping for a miracle may help physicians to increase their therapeutic connection with families, decrease their own stress/burnout levels, and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life healthcare.

                Background: Taxa Indicator Threshold ANalysis (TITAN) was developed to identify thresholds along environmental gradients where rapid changes in taxa frequency and relative abundance are observed. TITAN determines separate change-points for increasing and decreasing taxa in aggregate, as well as change-points for individual taxa, with associated confidence intervals generated using bootstrapping. However, if TITAN is applied to different classes of observations, additional analyses besides using non-overlapping confidence intervals are needed to establish whether change-points differ between treatments or groups because non-overlapping confidence intervals can indicate significant differences but overlapping confidence intervals do not necessarily mean the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Methods: To address this, we present a new R package, pTITAN2, which is an extension to the existing TITAN2 package. The pTITAN2 package was developed to enable comparisons of TITAN output between treatments by permutating the observed data between treatments and rerunning TITAN on the permuted data. Results: The pTITAN2 package includes two functions, occurrences and permute. The occurrences function selects the taxonomic codes to be used in a TITAN run while maintaining the most taxonomic details. The permute function is then used to create a list of permuted sets of taxa and environmental gradients. TITAN is then run again on the permuted data and p-value test can be calculated using the observed and permuted TITAN output to test for statistical differences between treatment effects. Conclusions: The package pTITAN2 is an extension of the existing TITAN2 package and enables users to perform the appropriate statistical tests and determine statistical differences without using overlapping confidence intervals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Non-invasive health prediction from visually observable features [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised the healthcare industry. In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person’s health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Water, sanitation and the risk of chronic diseases in old age: Results from the Ghana WHO SAGE 2 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The associations of water and sanitation with population health have been well-documented. However, the specific effects of water and sanitation on chronic diseases in old age are least explored. This study examines the associations between water, sanitation and chronic diseases among older people in Ghana and whether these associations are moderated by sex and spatial variation. Methods: Data from the WHO-SAGE Wave 2 involving adults aged ≥ 50 years were analyzed. Chronis diseases were assessed based on the self-reported diagnosis by a healthcare professional. The exposures included water sources, type of toilet, and sharing of toilet facilities. Generalized logistic regression models estimated the effects of water and sanitation indicators on chronic diseases.  Results: Overall, 18.8% of the sample reported at least one chronic disease. Compared to men and those in rural areas, women and urban residents respectively were more likely to report chronic disease (p < 0.001). After full adjustments, logistic regressions showed that the use of unimproved sanitation (OR = 1.732, CI: 1.377–5.418) and sharing of sanitation facilities (OR = 1.624, CI: 1.095–1.320) were associated with higher odds of chronic diseases. However, the use of water did not reach significance (p = 0.125). We found a significant interaction effect for type of toilet × sex (OR = 3.498, CI: 1.744–16.442), source of water × residence (OR = 5.935, CI: 1.320–26.685), and type of toilet × spatial variation (OR = 1.998, CI: 1.462–8.642).  Conclusions: The use of unimproved sanitation facilities and the sharing of toilet facilities are associated with the occurrence of chronic diseases among older people. Policy and public health interventions targeted at improving the health and well-being of older people should conspicuously include better access and improved sanitation services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dataset of the adoption of digital tools for research sharing among academics in African Varsities during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This dataset was collected from a total of 1,977 university lecturers across 24 African countries, that were purposively targeted due to their level of exposure to scholarly publications. The dataset was collected through an online survey that was sent to respondents through email, WhatsApp, and the Association of African Universities Telegram group. The questionnaire was designed by the researchers and validated by five experts for face and content validity. The demographic information of the data was analysed and the softcopy of the data uploaded to the Mendeley database for easy retrieval after deidentification (see Data Availability statement). The associated questionnaire can be found in the extended data. In Africa, this appears to be the broadest dataset associated with academics’ perception of utilizing digital platforms for research sharing. This implies that scholars can use this dataset to quantitatively analyse the extent to which different digital tools are being utilized for research communication. Considering the current restrictions on in-person social gatherings due to COVID-19, researchers working on related studies may readily utilize this set of data, saving time and cost. A comprehensive but non-exhaustive number of 20 digital tools were assessed based on academics' awareness and current engagement with them, and the challenges they have faced using them. This offers a wide range of areas for studies to be anchored. Furthermore, researchers interested in specific digital tools can also evaluate the extent to which academic staff in African universities are aware of and willing to utilize them for research dissemination. This data will enable scholars and researchers in Africa and beyond to understand the extent to which academics in varsities are willing to adopt digital repositories for research sharing in the context of Africa.

                Generating high-quality genome assemblies of complex microbial populations from shotgun metagenomics data is often a manually intensive task involving many computational steps. METASnake is a novel tool, implemented in the Snakemake workflow language, to automate multiple metaWRAP modules. Specifically, it wraps the shell scripts provided within the original metaWRAP software, within Snakemake. This approach enables high-throughput simultaneous assembly and analysis of multiple shotgun metagenomic datasets using the robust modular metaWRAP software. We expect this advancement to be of import in institutions where high-performance computing infrastructure is available, especially in the context of big data. This software tool is publicly available at https://github.com/jkrapohl/METASnake.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Impact of Green Practices in Value Chain on Firm Performance in the Context of a Developing Country [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Companies need to go green to remain relevant. Previous studies have confirmed that going green leads to superior performance for companies. However, research of green practices in a value chain requires further attention, especially in identifying the green value chain activities that lead to superior performance. A value chain analysis focuses on identifying competitive advantages of firms through five primary and four support activities. Methods: This study extends from Ong et al. (2019), who developed and validated the instrument for the nine green value chain activities, to also examine their effect on firm performance. The 207 valid responses in this study are collected through a questionnaire survey of the sampling frame consisting of companies in Bursa Malaysia and the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Directory. Results: The findings reveal that the companies’ green practices in primary value chain activities are higher than in the supporting value chain activities. Technological development is the activity with the lowest green attention among the nine value chain activities. Our multiple regression analysis shows that 25% of the variation in firm performance can be significantly explained by the nine green value chain activities. In terms of the individual green value chain activities, green technology development is the only activity that can positively and significantly explain firm performance. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that companies intending to build their green core competence need to engage in green technology development. Companies that go green for the purpose of complying to regulations and fulfilling minimum customers’ demands can still embed green practices into their green value chain without compromising their performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel mutation in hexokinase 2 confers resistance to 2-deoxyglucose by altering protein dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erich Hellemann, Jennifer L. Walker, Mitchell A. Lesko, Dakshayini G. Chandrashekarappa, Martin C. Schmidt, Allyson F. O’Donnell, Jacob D. Durrant</p>

Glucose is central to many biological processes, serving as an energy source and a building block for biosynthesis. After glucose enters the cell, hexokinases convert it to glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P) for use in anaerobic fermentation, aerobic oxidative phosphorylation, and the pentose-phosphate pathway. We here describe a genetic screen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> that generated a novel spontaneous mutation in hexokinase-2, <i>hxk2</i><sup>G238V</sup>, that confers resistance to the toxic glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Wild-type hexokinases convert 2DG to 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2DG-6P), but 2DG-6P cannot support downstream glycolysis, resulting in a cellular starvation-like response. Curiously, though the <i>hxk2</i><sup>G238V</sup> mutation encodes a loss-of-function allele, the affected amino acid does not interact directly with bound glucose, 2DG, or ATP. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Hxk2<sup>G238V</sup> impedes sugar binding by altering the protein dynamics of the glucose-binding cleft, as well as the large-scale domain-closure motions required for catalysis. These findings shed new light on Hxk2 dynamics and highlight how allosteric changes can influence catalysis, providing new structural insights into this critical regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. Given that hexokinases are upregulated in some cancers and that 2DG and its derivatives have been studied in anti-cancer trials, the present work also provides insights that may apply to cancer biology and drug resistance.

                <p>by Stuart A. MacGowan, Michael I. Barton, Mikhail Kutuzov, Omer Dushek, P. Anton van der Merwe, Geoffrey J. Barton</p>

SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Spike) binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the strength of this interaction could influence parameters relating to virulence. To explore whether population variants in ACE2 influence Spike binding and hence infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37°C. We discovered variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, ΔΔG = –1.33 ± 0.15 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and p.Gly352Val, predicted ΔΔG = –1.17 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified two variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro (ΔΔG = 0.59 ± 0.08 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) is predominant in the gnomAD African cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg (ΔΔG = 0.26 ± 0.09 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) is predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant affinities to published SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data and confirmed that ACE2 variants with reduced affinity for Spike can protect cells from infection. The effect of variants with enhanced Spike affinity remains unclear, but we propose a mechanism whereby these alleles could cause greater viral spreading across tissues and cell types, as is consistent with emerging understanding regarding the interplay between receptor affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared mCSM-PPI2 ΔΔG predictions against our SPR data to assess the utility of predictions in this system. We found that predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated with experiment and could be improved by calibration, but disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on Covid-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tumor immune cell clustering and its association with survival in African American women with ovarian cancer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Wilson, Alex C. Soupir, Ram Thapa, Jordan Creed, Jonathan Nguyen, Carlos Moran Segura, Travis Gerke, Joellen M. Schildkraut, Lauren C. Peres, Brooke L. Fridley</p>

New technologies, such as multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), are being developed and used for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations. However, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Therefore, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley’s <i>K</i>, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness (CSR) as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was then applied to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) using mIF collected on intra-tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 160 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 263 tissue cores; 93 subjects with 260 ROIs; 27 subjects with both TMA and ROI data). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3+), cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+CD3+), and regulatory T-cells (CD3+FoxP3+) with overall survival. Analysis was done on TMA and ROIs, treating the TMA data as validation of the finding from the ROIs. We found that EOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T-cell subsets in their tumors had the best overall survival. Additionally, patients with EOC tumors displaying high co-occurrence of cytotoxic T-cells and regulatory T-cells had the best overall survival. Grouping women with ovarian cancer based on both cell abundance and spatial contexture showed better discrimination for survival than grouping ovarian cancer cases only by cell abundance. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the TIME. In conclusion, the application of this spatial analysis framework to the study of the TIME could lead to the identification of immune content and spatial architecture that could aid in the determination of patients that are likely to respond to immunotherapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of individual perceptual and cognitive factors on collective states in a data-driven fish school model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weijia Wang, Ramón Escobedo, Stéphane Sanchez, Clément Sire, Zhangang Han, Guy Theraulaz</p>

In moving animal groups, social interactions play a key role in the ability of individuals to achieve coordinated motion. However, a large number of environmental and cognitive factors are able to modulate the expression of these interactions and the characteristics of the collective movements that result from these interactions. Here, we use a data-driven fish school model to quantitatively investigate the impact of perceptual and cognitive factors on coordination and collective swimming patterns. The model describes the interactions involved in the coordination of burst-and-coast swimming in groups of <i>Hemigrammus rhodostomus</i>. We perform a comprehensive investigation of the respective impacts of two interactions strategies between fish based on the selection of the most or the two most influential neighbors, of the range and intensity of social interactions, of the intensity of individual random behavioral fluctuations, and of the group size, on the ability of groups of fish to coordinate their movements. We find that fish are able to coordinate their movements when they interact with their most or two most influential neighbors, provided that a minimal level of attraction between fish exist to maintain group cohesion. A minimal level of alignment is also required to allow the formation of schooling and milling. However, increasing the strength of social interactions does not necessarily enhance group cohesion and coordination. When attraction and alignment strengths are too high, or when the heading random fluctuations are too large, schooling and milling can no longer be maintained and the school switches to a swarming phase. Increasing the interaction range between fish has a similar impact on collective dynamics as increasing the strengths of attraction and alignment. Finally, we find that coordination and schooling occurs for a wider range of attraction and alignment strength in small group sizes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Systematically assessing microbiome–disease associations identifies drivers of inconsistency in metagenomic research</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Braden T. Tierney, Yingxuan Tan, Zhen Yang, Bing Shui, Michaela J. Walker, Benjamin M. Kent, Aleksandar D. Kostic, Chirag J. Patel</p>

Evaluating the relationship between the human gut microbiome and disease requires computing reliable statistical associations. Here, using millions of different association modeling strategies, we evaluated the consistency—or robustness—of microbiome-based disease indicators for 6 prevalent and well-studied phenotypes (across 15 public cohorts and 2,343 individuals). We were able to discriminate between analytically robust versus nonrobust results. In many cases, different models yielded contradictory associations for the same taxon–disease pairing, some showing positive correlations and others negative. When querying a subset of 581 microbe–disease associations that have been previously reported in the literature, 1 out of 3 taxa demonstrated substantial inconsistency in association sign. Notably, >90% of published findings for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were particularly nonrobust in this regard. We additionally quantified how potential confounders—sequencing depth, glucose levels, cholesterol, and body mass index, for example—influenced associations, analyzing how these variables affect the ostensible correlation between <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> abundance and a healthy gut. Overall, we propose our approach as a method to maximize confidence when prioritizing findings that emerge from microbiome association studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Is orgasmic meditation a form of sex?: practitioners of orgasmic meditation view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Orgasmic Meditation (OM) is a structured, partnered meditative practice in which one person, who can be any gender, strokes the clitoris of their partner for 15 minutes. As such, it resembles a sexual activity. OM is taught as a practice that is distinct from sex, and we wondered whether people who engage in OM actually maintain that distinction themselves. Methods: We conducted an online convenience sample survey including qualitative open-ended text questions and quantitative Likert-style questions that was distributed to email listservs for practitioners of OM. In the study, 414 participants completed the 30-item questionnaire including questions designed to differentiate the potentially related concepts of OM, seated meditation, fondling, and sex, as bases for comparison. Results: Participants reported that they strongly agreed that OM is not fondling or sex, giving an average Likert-type rating of 4.55 and 4.65, respectively. Participants disagreed most strongly with the statements “OM is Sex,” and “OM is Fondling,” with average ratings of 1.42 and 1.48, respectively (strongly disagree). There was also high disagreement with the statement “OM is not mediation,” with a rating of 1.53. Conclusion: The quantitative results of this mixed methods study show that OM practitioners view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling. These results were consistent, regardless of whether the question was asked in the positive or negative or whether OM was being compared to one behavior individually or to multiple behaviors at the same time. The distinction between OM and sex/fondling rapidly becomes more pronounced as practitioners complete more OMs. This suggests that the novelty of genital touching in meditation may diminish over time, as practitioners get used to the more alternative point of focus. The results of this study have implications for the practice and how it is approached and regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of English language in agricultural organisations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background – The importance placed on having good English language proficiency and skills to secure employment in Malaysia is a well-known fact. However, very little is known about the role of the English language in multilingual organisations within the agricultural industry in Malaysia. As such, this study aimed to examine the employees’ perception of the use of the English language in a professional context particularly in the Malaysian agricultural and agricultural related sectors.     Methods – A concurrent triangulation design was used to quantitatively evaluate the data. A total of 320 questionnaires from employees of 10 agriculture and agriculture related companies were analysed.  Additionally, interviews were also conducted with 10 employers from the human resources department as they provided deep insights into the language matters of the organisations.       Results – The employers and employees agree that English language proficiency has economic value and can play an important role at the workplace, as this skill can influence one’s career path in terms of employability and career progression.       Conclusions - From the standpoint of employees, a more insightful idea on the influence of English on career development in the agricultural industry has been obtained. These findings have implications for learning outcomes of students, education system, and policymakers aspiring for the human capital which is needed for Malaysia to become a high income and developed nation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile perceived trust mediation on the intention and adoption of FinTech innovations using mobile technology: A systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The banking and financial sectors have witnessed a significant development recently due to financial technology (FinTech), and it has become an essential part of the financial system. Many factors helped the development of this sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust (MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured on the intention and adoption of the behaviour.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of the clinical effectiveness of self-etch sealant with the conventional acid-etch sealant for the retentive ability and marginal integrity in permanent molars: a split mouth one year randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaitin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Self-etching has been shown to be beneficial compared to the other resin sealants especially in pediatric practice. The present in-vivo study was designed to clinically evaluate the sealing ability and retention of the self-etching sealant compared to the conventional resin sealant. The aim was to evaluate and compare the retention and marginal integrity of the self-etch and acid etch sealant materials at three, six and twelve-month follow up. Methods: This was designed a randomized controlled trial, with double blind parallel, split-mouth design. In total, 35 children (70 teeth) between 7 and 10 years of age formed part of the study. Group 1 received acid-etch sealant and Group 2 received self-etch sealants. The study participants and the investigator who performed the statistical analysis were blinded to the treatment allocation. All the samples were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months. The inter-group and intragroup comparison were carried out using the Chi-Square test and Friedman test with level of significance set at 5% and the P value less than 0.05. Results: Complete retention of sealants was observed in 34.5% of conventional acid etch (group 1) and 22.9% of self-etch samples (group 2) whereas complete loss of sealants were seen in 11.4% of group 1 and 20% of the group 2 samples and intergroup comparison of retention failure was non-significant (p=0.135). In total, 85.7% of the group 1 and 82.9% of the group 2 samples exhibited good marginal integrity with no clinical changes in the enamel around the margins but this was not statistically significant (p=0.5). Conclusions: Sealants with fewer procedural steps and those which provide adequate retention would be ideal for use in children. Thus, self-etch sealants have been found to be effective and efficient as a sealant in the present in-vivo study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The pathogenicity of blood stream and central nervous system forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense trypanosomes in laboratory mice: a comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) develops in two stages namely early stage when trypanosomes are found in the blood and late stage when trypanosomes are found in the central nervous system (CNS). The two environments are different with CNS environment reported as being hostile to the trypanosomes than the blood environment. The clinical symptoms manifested by the disease in the two environments are different. Information on whether blood stream are pathologically different from CNS trypanosomes is lacking. This study undertook to compare the inter-isolate pathological differences caused by bloodstream forms (BSF) and central nervous system (CNS) of five Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) isolates in Swiss white mice. Methods: Donor mice infected with each of the five isolates were euthanized at 21 days post infection (DPI) for recovery of BSF trypanosomes in heart blood and CNS trypanosomes in brain supernatants. Groups of Swiss white mice (n = 10) were then infected with BSF or CNS forms of each isolate and monitored for parasitaemia, packed cell volume (PCV), body weight, survivorship, trypanosome length, gross and histopathology characteristics. Results: Amplification of SRA gene prior to trypanosome morphology and pathogenicity studies confirmed all isolates as T. b. rhodesiense.  At 21 DPI, CNS trypanosomes were predominantly long slender (LS) while BSF were a mixture of short stumpy and intermediate forms. The density of BSF trypanosomes was on average 2-3 log-scales greater than that of CNS trypanosomes with isolate KETRI 2656 having the highest CNS trypanosome density. Conclusions: The pathogenicity study revealed clear differences in the virulence/pathogenicity of the five (5) isolates but no distinct and consistent differences between CNS and BSF forms of the same isolate. We also identified KETRI 2656 as a suitable isolate for acute menigo- encephalitic studies.

                Background: The gene FOXO3a has been elucidated to govern the development of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL). Moreover, it has been suggested that the levels of FOXO3a in circulation are affected by the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism. However, no study has assessed the correlation between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a. The objective of this study was to assess the association between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a in CGL patients treated with imatinib mesylate.  Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2019 to February 2020. The genotyping of FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism was conducted using PCR-RFLP, and the levels of FOXO3a were assessed using ELISA. The association between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a were assessed using multiple logistic regression.  Results: A total of 60 CGL patients were assessed in our study. Among them, the CC, CT, and TT genotypes of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism were 35.0%, 48.3%, and 16.7% respectively. Our calculation revealed that elevated levels of FOXO3a were found in CGL patients with the CC genotype of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism. While we failed to clarify the association between either the CT or the TT genotype of FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a.  Conclusion: Our study identifies that the CC genotype of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism affects the elevated levels of FOXO3a in CGL patients treated with imatinib mesylate.

                A systematic review of clinical trials conducted with a low-dose inactivated influenza vaccine adjuvanted by azoximer bromide (AZB, Polyoxidonium), was performed to compare vaccine reactogenicity against non-adjuvant vaccines. We also assessed whether lower amounts of antigen per viral strain in AZB-adjuvanted vaccines affected antibody responses. A robust search strategy identified scientific publications reporting 30 clinical trials, comprising data on 11,736 participants and 86 trial arms, for inclusion in the analysis. Local reaction rates (Rlr) appeared to be lower in AZB-adjuvanted vaccine treatment arms versus comparator vaccine treatment arms. Meta‑regression analysis revealed that AZB did not contribute to vaccine reactogenicity. Post-vaccination geometric mean titres in those exposed to AZB-adjuvanted vaccine and comparator vaccine treatment arms were similar in both children and adults aged 18–60 years, implying an antigen-sparing effect by AZB.

                Background:  Most primary school Physical Education (PE) has relatively little health-enhancing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). - A promising theory and evidence-based intervention, the ‘SHARP Principles’ model, has been effective in making PE lessons more active in one area of England. This protocol paper explains the rationale for use of the SHARP intervention, and the methods used to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a version of SHARP translated for use in Scotland (SHARP Scotland). Methods: The feasibility of SHARP Scotland will be evaluated by key areas of focus for feasibility studies: Acceptability, Implementation, Integration, Limited Efficacy Testing. A combination of process measures, including observations, session delivery records, accelerometry-data collection, questionnaires, and semi-structured qualitative focus groups with teachers and pupils will be used. The feasibility and suitability of the SHARP Scotland intervention for a future Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will be assessed. The study will involve children from 8-11 years old (Primary 4 to 6) in two schools, one large urban school, and one smaller school; four classes will be randomly assigned to the intervention group, and four classes randomly assigned to the usual-care (standard curriculum) control group. Within the 8-week intervention, MVPA in the intervention group will be targeted by encouraging class teachers to deliver their PE classes in more active ways, following SHARP Principles. A maximum of 64 PE lessons delivered in a SHARP way will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: The outcome of this study will be an assessment of whether applying the SHARP intervention is feasible in Scottish schools. Identification of any modifications to the intervention or evaluation which are required will provide insight for a fully powered effectiveness trial in the future, if appropriate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parental coronavirus disease vaccine hesitancy for children in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires mass immunization to control the severity of symptoms and global spread. Data from developed countries have shown a high prevalence of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. However, parental vaccine hesitancy data in low- and middle-income countries are scarce. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of parental vaccine hesitancy and identify subgroups with higher odds of vaccine hesitancy in parents in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the parents of children aged <18 years from October 10, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Parents participated in face-to-face interviews in randomly selected locations in Bangladesh using a vaccine hesitancy questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 2,633 eligible parents were analyzed. Overall, 42.8% reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for their youngest child. The final model suggested the following factors were associated with hesitancy: children's age; parent's age, religion, occupation, monthly household income, permanent address, living location, status of tobacco use, adherence with regular government vaccination programs (other than COVID-19), perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy among Bangladeshi children, self-vaccination intentions, reported family members' illness or death from COVID-19, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were the independent predictors of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Conversely, participants who were not tobacco users, parents who were very likely to believe that their children or family members could be infected with COVID-19 in the following year and who were very concerned about their children or a family member contracting COVID-19 in the next year had significantly lower odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Our study suggested that vaccine hesitation varied based on sociodemographic characteristics, religion, behavior, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Therefore, interventions focused on addressing vaccine hesitancy among specific subgroups are warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Non-suicidal self-injurious behavior among the Saudi population: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Self-harm is a serious public health problem across the world, impacting not only people who self-harm but also their families and society as a whole through higher resource costs and productivity losses. This review was conducted among the general Saudi population to investigate the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and factors affecting it. Methods: An electronic literature search of four major databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus Science Direct, and Google Scholar, was conducted to include eligible studies. All studies reporting NSSI or relevant to the subject were included. Results: A total of five articles with 1758 participants were included. The lowest recorded NSSI prevalence was 0.47% while the highest was 10.2%, both in Al-Khobar city. Conclusion: We recorded a relatively low but increasing prevalence of NSSI. The review also demonstrated that NSSI was more common among the female population and young people. Self-poisoning, including drug overdose, was the most prevalent method of self-harm. Interpersonal difficulties, marital problems, academic failure, and family and self-conflicts were common motivating factors of NSSI.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of bone graft substitute in healing fractures with bone defects through examination of alkaline phosphatase and radiology in the murine model (Rattus norvegicus) Wistar strain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A significant bone defect is a condition wherein the bone cannot repair spontaneously. Therefore, replacing bone defects with bone substitution remains a reconstructive concern for orthopaedic surgeons. Bone Graft Substitution (BGS) are classified broadly, such as bone grafts (autograft, allograft, and xenograft) synthetic ceramics (hydroxyapatite, calcium sulphate). This study aims to determine the effect of various Bone Graft Substitute on the healing process of bone defects assessed based on the area of callus formation and levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP).   Methods: The study design was an in vivo laboratory experimental approach with a randomized post-test only control group design. The 36 experimental animals that matched the inclusion criteria were divided into five groups, in each one of control positive group, one of control negative group, and three of treatment group. The bone graft substitution used in this study is a synthetic ceramic, namely Synthetic HA-Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 - BONGROS®, Bone Graft Substitution Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4-PEROSSAL®, and also hydroxyapatite Bovine. After selecting rats, we performed osteotomy on the femur to the made bone defect. After 30 days, murine models were harvested. Then, we measure callus formation using radiological examination and ALP level serum  Results: From Callus formation, Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4 is the highest (86.54 ± 4.24604) compared with other groups and significantly (p:0.021) increase in callus formation than the other experimental groups. Then, from the ALP level, Bovine is the highest (9.287 ± 0.58586) but did not significantly compare with K-neg, and the second one is Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4 higher than KP-1, and it has a significantly higher levels serum ALP rather than K-Neg.   Conclusion: Bone Graft Substituted using Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4 is a good material that can repair and increase callus formation in fracture model rats with bone defects.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neurological Events Reported after COVID‐19 Vaccines: An Analysis of VAERS</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the rates of neurological events following administration of mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna) or adenovirus vector (Janssen) vaccines in the U.S..</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized publicly available data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collected between January 1, 2021-June 14, 2021. All free text symptoms that were reported within 42 days of vaccine administration were manually reviewed and grouped into 36 individual neurological diagnostic categories. Post-vaccination neurological event rates were compared between vaccine types and to age-matched baseline incidence rates in the U.S. and rates of neurological events following COVID.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 306,907,697 COVID vaccine doses administered during the study timeframe, 314,610 (0.1%) people reported any adverse event and 105,214 (0.03%) reported neurological adverse events in a median of 1 day (IQR0-3) from inoculation. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) occurred in fewer than 1 per 1,000,000 doses. Significantly more neurological adverse events were reported following Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccination compared to either Pfizer-BioNtech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273; 0.15% versus 0.03% versus 0.03% of doses, respectively,P&lt;0.0001). The observed-to-expected ratios for GBS, CVT and seizure following Janssen vaccination were ≥1.5-fold higher than background rates. However, the rate of neurological events after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reports of serious neurological events following COVID vaccination are rare. GBS, CVT and seizure may occur at higher than background rates following Janssen vaccination. Despite this, rates of neurological complications following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The neuroinvasiveness, neurotropism, and neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a diverse spectrum of neurological complications in the acute and post-acute stages. The pathogenesis of these complications is complex and dependent on many factors. For accurate and consistent interpretation of experimental data in this fast-growing field of research, it is essential to use terminology consistently. In this article, we outline the distinctions between neuroinvasiveness, neurotropism, and neurovirulence. Additionally, we discuss current knowledge of these distinct features underlying the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological complications.

A study in mice shows that increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone lead to characteristics of the disease — and that blocking action of this hormone prevents those features from developing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intrinsic timescales as an organizational principle of neural processing across the whole rhesus macaque brain</a></h4>

              
                Hierarchical temporal dynamics are a fundamental computational property of the brain; however, there are no whole-brain, noninvasive investigations into timescales of neural processing in animal models. To that end, we used the spatial resolution and sensitivity of ultrahigh field fMRI performed at 10.5 Tesla to probe timescales across the whole macaque brain. We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from fMRI and electrophysiology. Crucially, we extended existing electrophysiological hierarchies to whole brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Further, with these results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional functional connectivity topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match functional connectivity gradient topographies across the whole brain. We conclude that intrinsic timescales are a unifying organizational principle of neural processing across the whole brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tom70-based transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and aging</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial biogenesis has two major steps: the transcriptional activation of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins and the import of nascent mitochondrial proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol. These nascent mitochondrial proteins are aggregation-prone and can cause cytosolic proteostasis stress. The transcription factor-dependent transcriptional regulations and the TOM-TIM complex-dependent import of nascent mitochondrial proteins have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known regarding how these two steps of mitochondrial biogenesis coordinate with each other to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of these aggregation-prone nascent mitochondrial proteins. Here we show that in budding yeast, Tom70, a conserved receptor of the TOM complex, moonlights to regulate the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins. Tom70's transcription regulatory role is conserved in <i>Drosophila</i>. The dual roles of Tom70 in both transcription/biogenesis and import of mitochondrial proteins allow the cells to accomplish mitochondrial biogenesis without compromising cytosolic proteostasis. The age-related reduction of Tom70, caused by reduced biogenesis and increased degradation of Tom70, is associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA, and mitochondrial proteins. While loss of Tom70 accelerates aging and age-related mitochondrial defects, overexpressing TOM70 delays these mitochondrial dysfunctions and extends the replicative lifespan. Our results reveal unexpected roles of Tom70 in mitochondrial biogenesis and aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NBI-921352, a first-in-class, NaV1.6 selective, sodium channel inhibitor that prevents seizures in Scn8a gain-of-function mice, and wild-type mice and rats</a></h4>

              
                NBI-921352 (formerly XEN901) is a novel sodium channel inhibitor designed to specifically target Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels. Such a molecule provides a precision-medicine approach to target <i>SCN8A</i>-related epilepsy syndromes (<i>SCN8A</i>-RES), where gain-of-function (GoF) mutations lead to excess Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sodium current, or other indications where Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 mediated hyper-excitability contributes to disease (Gardella &amp; Moller, 2019; Johannesen et al., 2019; Veeramah et al., 2012). NBI-921352 is a potent inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.051 µM), with exquisite selectivity over other sodium channel isoforms (selectivity ratios of 756X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, 134X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, 276X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, and &gt;583X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5). NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor, preferentially inhibiting inactivated channels. The state dependence leads to potent stabilization of inactivation, inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents, including resurgent and persistent Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents, while sparing the closed/rested channels. The isoform-selective profile of NBI-921352 led to a robust inhibition of action-potential firing in glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons, while sparing fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, where Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 predominates. Oral administration of NBI-921352 prevented electrically induced seizures in a <i>Scn8a</i> GoF mouse, as well as in wild-type mouse and rat seizure models. NBI-921352 was effective in preventing seizures at lower brain and plasma concentrations than commonly prescribed sodium channel inhibitor anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lacosamide. NBI-921352 was well tolerated at higher multiples of the effective plasma and brain concentrations than those ASMs. NBI-921352 is entering phase II proof-of-concept trials for the treatment of <i>SCN8A</i><i>-</i>developmental epileptic encephalopathy (<i>SCN8A</i>-DEE) and adult focal-onset seizures.

                <b>Background:</b> There is mounting evidence that <i>in                        utero</i> and early life exposures may predispose an individual to                    metabolic disorders in later life; and dysregulation of lipid metabolism is                    critical in such outcomes. However, there is limited knowledge about lipid                    metabolism and factors causing lipid dysregulation in early life that could                    result in adverse health outcomes in later life. We studied the effect of                    antenatal factors such as gestational age, birth weight and mode of birth on                    lipid metabolism at birth; changes in the circulating lipidome in the first four                    years of life and the effect of breastfeeding in the first year of life. From                    this study, we aim to generate a framework for deeper understanding into factors                    effecting lipid metabolism in early life, to provide early interventions for                    those at risk of developing metabolic disorders including cardiovascular                    diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Small proline-rich proteins (SPRRs) are epidermally produced antimicrobial proteins that defend the cutaneous barrier by direct bacterial membrane disruption</a></h4>

              
                Human skin functions as a physical barrier, preventing the entry of foreign pathogens while also accommodating a myriad of commensal microorganisms. A key contributor to the skin landscape is the sebaceous gland. Mice devoid of sebocytes are prone to skin infection, yet our understanding of how sebocytes function in host defense is incomplete. Here we show that the small proline-rich proteins, SPRR1 and SPRR2 are bactericidal in skin. SPRR1B and SPPR2A were induced in human sebocytes by exposure to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonization of germ-free mice was insufficient to trigger increased SPRR expression in mouse skin, but LPS injected into mouse skin triggered the expression of the mouse SPRR orthologous genes, <i>Sprr1a</i> and <i>Sprr2a</i>, through stimulation of MYD88. Both mouse and human SPRR proteins displayed potent bactericidal activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and skin commensals. Thus, <i>Sprr1a<sup>-/-</sup>;Sprr2a<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are more susceptible to MRSA and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>skin infection. Lastly, mechanistic studies demonstrate that SPRR proteins exert their bactericidal activity through binding and disruption of the bacterial membrane. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the regulation and antimicrobial function of SPRR proteins in skin and how the skin defends the host against systemic infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rate-distortion theory of neural coding and its implications for working memory</a></h4>

              
                Rate-distortion theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the nature of human memory by formalizing the relationship between information rate (the average number of bits per stimulus transmitted across the memory channel) and distortion (the cost of memory errors). Here we show how this abstract computational-level framework can be realized by a model of neural population coding. The model reproduces key regularities of visual working memory, including some that were not previously explained by population coding models. We verify a novel prediction of the model by reanalyzing recordings of monkey prefrontal neurons during an oculomotor delayed response task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kv7 channel antagonists block glycine receptors</a></h4>

              
                XE991 (10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone) is currently the most widely used and specific antagonist of the Kv7 (KCNQ) family of K+ channels. We report an unexpected antagonistic effect of this drug on ionotropic glycine receptors. In recordings of synaptic transmission in two brainstem nuclei (the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and the dorsal cochlear nucleus), 10 M XE991, a concentration typical for Kv7 studies in brain tissue, inhibited evoked glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) without altering paired-pulse ratio, and also reduced the amplitude of glycinergic miniature IPSCs. These results are indicative of a direct effect of the drug on postsynaptic glycine receptors. XE991 also produced dose-dependent block of the response to exogenously applied glycine, to a degree comparable to the block of synaptic transmission. Moreover, the drug inhibited homomeric glycine receptors expressed on presynaptic membrane of the calyx of Held. The degree of block was independent of glycine concentration, suggesting an allosteric interaction. The effects of XE991 on glycine responses are not likely to reflect block of the glycine-activated Cl- channels themselves, because block was voltage independent, and because GABA-activated Cl- currents were resistant to XE991 at concentrations up to 100 M. Linopirdine, but not retigabine, also antagonized glycine receptor currents. Given the prevalence of glycine receptor signaling in the brain, these observations should be taken into account in studies of the roles of Kv7 channels in neural circuit function and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A vector reward prediction error model explains dopaminergic heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                The hypothesis that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons broadcast an error signal for the prediction of reward (reward prediction error, RPE) is among the great successes of computational neuroscience1-3. However, recent results contradict a core aspect of this theory: that the neurons uniformly convey a scalar, global signal. Instead, when animals are placed in a high-dimensional environment, DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display substantial heterogeneity in the features to which they respond, while also having more consistent RPE-like responses at the time of reward. Here we introduce a new Vector RPE model that explains these findings, by positing that DA neurons report individual RPEs for a subset of a population vector code for an animal's state (moment-to-moment situation). To investigate this claim, we train a deep reinforcement learning model on a navigation and decision-making task, and compare the Vector RPE derived from the network to population recordings from DA neurons during the same task. The Vector RPE model recapitulates the key features of the neural data: specifically, heterogeneous coding of task variables during the navigation and decision-making period, but uniform reward responses. The model also makes new predictions about the nature of the responses, which we validate. Our work provides a path to reconcile new observations of DA neuron heterogeneity with classic ideas about RPE coding, while also providing a new perspective on how the brain performs reinforcement learning in high dimensional environments.

                Thalamoreticular circuitry is central to sensory processing, attention, and sleep, and is implicated in numerous brain disorders, but the cellular and synaptic mechanisms remain intractable. Therefore, we developed the first detailed microcircuit model of mouse thalamus and thalamic reticular nucleus that captures morphological and biophysical properties of ~14,000 neurons connected via ~6M synapses, and recreates biological synaptic and gap junction connectivity. Realistic spontaneous and evoked activity during wakefulness and sleep emerge allowing dissection of cellular and synaptic contributions. Computer simulations suggest that reticular inhibition shapes thalamic responses and cortex can drive frequency-selective thalamic enhancement during wakefulness, whereas in sleep, reticular inhibition and cortical UP-states can trigger thalamic bursts and spindles. Gap junctions and short-term synaptic plasticity underlie spindle properties such as waxing and waning, and neuromodulation influences the occurrence of spindles. The model is openly available to support testing hypotheses of thalamoreticular circuitry in normal brain function and in disease.

                The slow oscillation (SO) is a central neuronal dynamic during sleep and is generated by alternating periods of high and low neuronal activity (ON and OFF states). Mounting evidence causally links the SO to sleep's functions, and it has recently become possible to manipulate the SO non-invasively and phase-specifically. These developments represent promising clinical avenues, but they also highlight the importance of improving our understanding of how ON/OFF states affect incoming stimuli and what role they play in neuronal plasticity. Most studies using closed-loop stimulation rely on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) signals, which reflect neuronal ON and OFF states only indirectly. Here we develop an online detection algorithm based on spiking activity recorded from laminar arrays in mouse motor cortex. We find that online detection of ON and OFF states reflects specific phases of spontaneous LFP SO. Our neuronal-spiking-based closed-loop procedure offers a novel opportunity for testing the functional role of SO in sleep-related restorative processes and neural plasticity.

                In drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, automated tools for seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization using brief interictal recordings would supplement presurgical evaluations and improve care. Thus, we sought to localize SOZs by training a multi-channel convolutional neural network on stereo-EEG (SEEG) cortico-cortical evoked potentials. We performed single pulse electrical stimulation with 10 drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients implanted with SEEG. Using the 500,000 unique post-stimulation SEEG epochs, we trained a multi-channel one-dimensional convolutional neural network to determine whether an SOZ was stimulated. SOZs were classified with a mean leave-one-patient-out testing sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 74.6%. To achieve maximum accuracy, the model requires a 0-350 ms post stimulation time period. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the model accurately classified unilateral vs bilateral mesial temporal lobe seizure onset, and neocortical SOZs. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that a deep learning framework can be used to accurately classify SOZs using cortico-cortical evoked potentials. Our findings suggest accurate classification of SOZs relies on a complex temporal evolution of evoked potentials within 350 ms of stimulation. Validation in a larger dataset could provide a practical clinical tool for the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human hippocampal responses to network stimulation vary with theta phase</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal memory function is thought to be supported by distinct connectivity states, with strong extrahippocampal input benefitting encoding and weak extrahippocampal input benefitting retrieval. Previous research in rodents suggests that the hippocampal theta oscillation orchestrates the transition between these states, with opposite phase angles respectively predicting minimal and maximal extrahippocampal input. However, it is unclear whether this phase dependence exists in humans. We used network-targeted stimulation to investigate whether hippocampal receptivity to network input varies with theta phase in humans of both sexes. Intracranial local field potentials were recorded from individuals with epilepsy undergoing medically necessary stereotactic electroencephalographic recording. In each subject, biphasic bipolar direct electrical stimulation was delivered to lateral temporal sites with demonstrated connectivity to hippocampus. Stimulation evoked ipsilateral hippocampal potentials with distinct early and late negative components. Using evoked-component amplitude to measure functional connectivity, we assessed whether different phases of hippocampal theta reflected distinct connectivity states. Stimulation enhanced both early and late component amplitudes when delivered during the observed theta peak relative to trough. Analysis of estimated theta phase delays between stimulation locations and hippocampus suggested that hippocampal response amplitude was maximized when stimulation influenced hippocampal activity at approximately 90{ring} before the trough of its theta rhythm. The pattern of theta phase dependence observed in hippocampus was not identified for amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex control locations. These findings demonstrate that theta phase reflects connectivity states of human hippocampal networks, confirming a putative mechanism by which oscillations modulate local hippocampal processing.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by defective dopaminergic (DAergic) input to the striatum. Mutations in two genes encoding synaptically-enriched clathrin-uncoating factors, synaptojanin 1 (SJ1) and auxilin, result in PD. SJ1 knock-in (SJ1-KIRQ) mice carrying PD mutation display neurological manifestation reminiscent of PD. Here we report that auxilin knockout (Aux-KO) mice display dystrophic changes of a subset of nigrostriatal DAergic terminals similar to those of SJ1-KIRQ mice. Furthermore, Aux-KO/SJ1-KIRQ double mutant mice have shorter lifespan and more severe synaptic defects than single mutant mice. These include more numerous dystrophic striatal nerve terminals positive for DAergic markers and for the PD risk protein SV2C, as well as adaptive changes in striatal interneurons. The synergistic effect of the two mutations demonstrates a special lability of DAergic neurons to defects in clathrin uncoating, with implications for PD pathogenesis in at least some forms of this condition.

                Background: Bike safety in older subjects is a major concern in multiple countries given the strong increase in the number of cyclists that are admitted to the hospital due to single-sided bicycle accidents in older populations. The increase in single-sided accident rate in older subjects suggests that older adults have more difficulty controlling balance while bicycling in traffic, which has been related to various age-related changes in the sensorimotor system. Yet, the impact of these age-related sensorimotor deficits on the ability of older people to remain stable on their bike during traffic situations such as turning their upper body to check on potential road users, remains unknown. Methods: We instructed a group of 40 young (22.86, SD:1.53 years) and 41 older participants (62.73 SD:1.57 years) to bike in a straight line while performing a shoulder check movement in order to identify the color of an object presented behind them. We recorded the task-errors (lost balance, errors in identifying the color, cycling outside the lane) and computed the steering angle and rotation of the frame, pelvis and torso from IMU recordings. Results: We observed that older adults made task-errors (one third of the older participants failed at the task by making errors such as cone-identification errors, loss of balance and cycling outside the lane). In the successful trials, we observed an increase in steering angle and rotation of the pelvis with respect to the frame in the older subjects compared to the young subjects. Significance: Older cyclists lose balance while turning their head, which might contribute to the increased number of single sided bike accidents in older subjects. The use of simple devices, such as using a mirror, should be encouraged in older subjects to replace the shoulder check maneuver.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial random noise stimulation of the primary visual cortex but not retina modulates visual contrast sensitivity.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) has been shown to significantly improve visual perception. Previous studies demonstrated that tRNS delivered over cortical areas acutely enhances visual contrast detection of stimuli when tRNS intensity is optimized for the individual. However, it is currently unknown whether tRNS-induced signal enhancement could be achieved within different neural substrates along the retino-cortical pathway and whether the beneficial effect of optimal tRNS intensities can be reproduced across sessions. In 3 experimental sessions, we tested whether tRNS applied to the primary visual cortex (V1) and/or to the retina improves visual contrast detection. We first measured visual contrast detection threshold (VCT; N=24, 16 females) during tRNS delivery separately over V1 (no tRNS, 0.75, 1, 1.5mA) and over the retina (no tRNS, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3mA), determined the optimal tRNS intensities for each individual (ind-tRNS), and retested the effects of ind-tRNS within the sessions. We further investigated whether we could reproduce the ind-tRNS-induced modulation on a different session (N=19, 14 females). Finally, we tested whether the simultaneous application of ind-tRNS to the retina and V1 causes additive effects. We found that at the group level tRNS of 0.75mA decreases VCT compared to baseline when delivered to the V1. Beneficial effects of ind-tRNS could be replicated when retested within the same experimental session but not when retested in a separate session. Applying tRNS to the retina did not cause a systematic reduction of VCT, irrespective of whether the individually optimized intensity was considered or not. We also did not observe consistent additive effects of V1 and retina stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that V1 seems to be more sensitive than the retina to tRNS-induced modulation of visual contrast processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic methamphetamine administration produces cognitive deficits through augmentation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Chronic methamphetamine (METH) abuse is associated with the emergence of cognitive deficits and hypofrontality, a pathophysiological marker of many neuropsychiatric disorders that is produced by altered balance of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying METH-induced cognitive deficits and associated hypofrontal states. We find here that repeated METH administration in rats produces deficits in working memory and increases in inhibitory synaptic transmission onto pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The increased PFC inhibition is detected by an increase in spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic synaptic currents (IPSCs), an increase in GABAergic presynaptic function, and a shift in the excitatory-inhibitory balance onto PFC deep-layer pyramidal neurons. We find that pharmacological blockade of D1 dopamine receptor function reduces the METH-induced augmentation of IPSCs, suggesting a critical role for D1 dopamine signaling in METH-induced hypofrontality. In addition, chronic METH administration increases the intrinsic excitability of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, a key local interneuron population in PFC that controls inhibitory tone. Using a cell type-specific chemogenetic approach, we show that increasing PV+FSI activity in the PFC is necessary and sufficient for METH-induced deficits in temporal order memory. Together, our findings reveal that chronic METH exposure increases PFC inhibitory tone through a D1 dopamine signaling-dependent potentiation of inhibitory synaptic transmission, and that reduction of PV+FSI activity can rescue METH-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to treating cognitive symptoms in patients suffering from methamphetamine use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo physiology of foveal retinal ganglion cells in Macaca fascicularis</a></h4>

              
                The primate fovea is specialized for high-resolution spatial and chromatic vision, possessing a unique topography characterized by a pit in which the inner retina and associated vasculature have been excavated, the highest density of cones anywhere in the retina, and a disproportionately large representation in visual cortex. The crucial visual properties conferred by the fovea are mediated by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) the somas of which lie at the margin of the foveal pit. Microelectrode recordings of these centermost retinal ganglion cells have been challenging due to the fragility of the fovea in the excised retina. This has been overcome in this study by combining high resolution fluorescence adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy with calcium imaging to optically record functional responses of foveal RGCs to visual stimuli in the living eye. Here we use this approach to study the chromatic responses of RGCs to uniform fields modulated in different directions in color space and achromatic responses with monochromatic drifting gratings. We repeated these recordings in many cells in each of three macaca fasicularis primates over weeks or months. We find that most of the L/M chromatically opponent cells serving the most central cones respond to high spatial frequencies, reflecting strong surround inhibition that sacrifices sensitivity at low frequencies in favor of the transmission of fine detail in the retinal image. In addition, we find the L/M cells vary in spatial frequency bandwidths, suggesting that L/M chromatic opponency, often considered largely due to input from single cones, has more diverse receptive field structure than previously thought. By characterizing the functional properties of retinal ganglion cells in vivo through adaptive optics, we provide a lower bound on the response characteristics of these cells in situ and their role in vision processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Perception of 3D Space and Shape in Time - Part II: 3D Space Perception with Holographic Depth</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception plays a critical role in navigating 3D space and extracting semantic information crucial to survival. Even though visual stimulation on the retina is fundamentally 2D, we seem to perceive the world around us in vivid 3D effortlessly. This reconstructed 3D space is allocentric and faithfully represents the external 3D world. How can we recreate stable 3D visual space so promptly and reliably? To solve this mystery, we have developed new concepts MePMoS (Memory-Prediction-Motion-Sensing) and NHT (Neural Holography Tomography). These models state that visual signal processing must be primarily top-down, starting from memory and prediction. Our brains predict and construct the expected 3D space holographically using traveling alpha brainwaves. Thus, 3D space is represented by the three time signals in three directions. To test this hypothesis, we designed reaction time (RT) experiments to observe predicted space-to-time conversion, especially as a function of distance. We placed LED strips on a horizontal plane to cover distances from close up to 2.5 m or 5 m, either using a 1D or a 2D lattice. Participants were instructed to promptly report observed LED patterns at various distances. As expected, stimulation at the fixation cue location always gave the fastest RT. Additional RT delays were proportional to the distance from the cue. Furthermore, both covert attention (without eye movements) and overt attention (with eye movements) created the same RT delays, and both binocular and monocular views resulted in the same RTs. These findings strongly support our predictions, in which the observed RT-depth dependence is indicative of the spatiotemporal conversion required for constructing allocentric 3D space. After all, we perceive and measure 3D space by time as Einstein postulated a century ago.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The endoplasmic reticulum in perisynaptic astrocytic processes: shape, distribution and effect on calcium activity</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmission triggers Ca2+ signals in perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). As most PAPs are below the diffraction limit, the presence of Ca2+ stores in PAPs, notably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is unclear. Here, we create 46 three dimensional meshes of hippocampal tripartite synapses reconstructed from electron microscopy. We find that 75% of PAPs contain some ER, as close as 72 nm to the synapse, and quantify its geometrical properties. To discern the effect of ER shape and distribution on Ca2+ activity, we implemented an algorithm that automatically redistributes the ER within the reconstructed PAP meshes, with constant ER and PAP shape. Reaction-diffusion simulations in those meshes reveal that Ca2+ signals in PAPs are shaped by a complex interplay between the clustering of Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ buffering, ER shape and distribution. This study, by detecting ER in PAPs and linking its spatial properties to Ca2+ activity, sheds new light on mechanisms regulating signal transmission at tripartite synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A tale of two connectivities: intra- and inter-subject functional connectivity jointly enable better prediction of social abilities</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms, such as movie viewing, are attracting increased attention, given their ability to mimic the real-world cognitive demands on attention and multimodal sensory integration. Moreover, naturalistic paradigms allow for characterizing brain network responses associated with dynamic social cognition in a model-free manner using inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC). While intra-subject functional connectivity (FC) characterizes the individual's brain functional architecture, ISFC characterizes the neural coupling driven by time-locked extrinsic dynamic stimuli across individuals. Here, we hypothesized that ISFC and FC provide distinct and complementary information about individual differences in social cognition. To test this hypothesis, we examined a public movie-viewing fMRI dataset with 32 healthy adults and 90 typically developing children. Building three partial least squares regression (PLS) models to predict social abilities using FC and/or ISFC, we compared predictive performance to determine whether combining two connectivity measures could improve the prediction accuracy of individuals' social-cognitive abilities measured by a Theory of Mind (ToM) assessment. Our results indicated that the joint model (ISFC+FC) yielded the highest predictive accuracy and significantly predicted individuals' social cognitive abilities (rho = 0.34, p < 0.001). We also confirmed that the improved accuracy was not due to the increased feature dimensionality. In conclusion, we demonstrated that intra-/inter-subject connectivity encodes unique information about social abilities, and a joint investigation could help us gain a more complete understanding of the complex processes supporting social cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psilocybin induces spatially constrained alterations in thalamic functional organization and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist psychedelics including psilocybin and LSD ("classic" psychedelics) evoke acute alterations in perception and cognition. Altered thalamocortical connectivity has been proposed to underlie these effects, which is supported by some functional MRI (fMRI) studies. Likely due to sample size limitations, these studies have treated the thalamus as a unitary structure, despite known differential 5-HT2AR expression and functional specificity of different intrathalamic nuclei. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been employed to generate functional subdivisions of the thalamus from resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. This report utilizes a novel data-sparing ICA approach in order to examine psilocybin-induced changes in intrathalamic functional organization and thalamocortical connectivity. Methods: Baseline rsfMRI data (n=38) was utilized to generate a template, which was then applied in a novel ICA-based analysis of the acute effects of psilocybin on intra- and extra-thalamic functional organization and connectivity in a smaller sample (n=18). Correlations with subjective reports of drug effect and comparisons with a previously reported analytic approach (treating the thalamus as a single functional unit) were conducted. Results: Several intrathalamic components showed significant psilocybin-induced alterations in intrathalamic spatial organization, largely localized to the mediodorsal and pulvinar nuclei, and correlated with reported subjective effects. These same components demonstrated alterations in thalamocortical connectivity, largely with visual and default mode networks. Analysis in which the thalamus is treated as a singular unitary structure showed an overall numerical increase in thalamocortical connectivity, consistent with previous literature using this approach, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Utilization of a novel analytic approach demonstrated changes in intra- and extra-thalamic functional organization and connectivity of intrathalamic nuclei and cortical networks known to express the 5-HT2AR. Given that these changes were not observed using whole-thalamus analyses, it seems that psilocybin may cause widespread but modest increases in thalamocortical connectivity that are offset by strong focal decreases in functionally relevant intrathalamic nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stage dependent differential influence of metabolic and structural networks on memory across Alzheimer's disease continuum</a></h4>

              
                Background: Large-scale neuronal network breakdown underlies memory impairment in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the differential trajectories of the relationships between network organization and memory across pathology and cognitive stages in AD remain elusive. We determined whether and how the influences of individual-level structural and metabolic covariance network integrity on memory varied with amyloid pathology across clinical stages without assuming a constant relationship. Methods: 708 participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were studied. Individual-level structural and metabolic covariance scores in higher-level cognitive and hippocampal networks were derived from magnetic resonance imaging and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography using seed-based partial least square analyses. The non-linear associations between network scores and memory across cognitive stages in each pathology group were examined using sparse varying coefficient modelling. Results: We showed that the associations of memory with structural and metabolic networks in the hippocampal and default mode regions exhibited pathology-dependent differential trajectories across cognitive stages using sparse varying coefficient modelling. In amyloid pathology group, there was an early influence of hippocampal structural network deterioration on memory impairment in the preclinical stage, and a biphasic influence of the angular gyrus-seeded default mode network metabolism on memory in both preclinical and dementia stages. In non- amyloid pathology groups, in contrast, the trajectory of the hippocampus-memory association was opposite and weaker overall, while no metabolism covariance networks were related to memory. Key findings were replicated in a larger cohort of 1280 participants. Conclusions: Our findings highlight potential windows of early intervention targeting network breakdown at the preclinical AD stage.
