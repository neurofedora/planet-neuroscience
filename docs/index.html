	<p>Background: The Default Mode Network (DMN) is involved in self-referential and emotional processes, while the insula integrates emotional and interoceptive signals. Functional connectivity between the insula and the DMN is proposed to enhance these processes by linking internal bodily states with self-referential thoughts and emotional regulation. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a measure of parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity, has been associated with the capacity to regulate autonomic arousal. This study explored the relationship between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN functional connectivity and HRV. We hypothesized that (1) insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional activity and volume would be related to HRV; (2) insula activation would be functionally connected with the DMN; and (3) stronger insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity would correlate with higher HRV. Methods: Forty-three healthy adults underwent a structural and functional MRI acquisition to assess insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity during resting state. HRV was measured also at rest using the BIOPAC system. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity, but no correlation was observed between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity and HRV. We also found a positive significant association between left insula volume and HRV. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while the AI and DMN are functionally interconnected, this connectivity may not be directly related to HRV. The results highlight the complexity of the relationship between brain connectivity and autonomic function, suggesting that other factors may influence HRV.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is a validated procedure for the treatment of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus. To select shunt-responsive patients, infusion and tap tests can be used. Only gait is evaluated after the procedure to establish a potential improvement. In this study, we present our Hydro-Real-Time Neuropsychological Testing protocol to assess the feasibility of performing an ultra-fast assessment of patients during the infusion and tap test. Methods: We tested 57 patients during the infusion and tap test to obtain real-time feedback on their cognitive status. Data were obtained immediately before the infusion phase (T0), when the pressure plateau was reached (T1), and immediately after cerebrospinal fluid subtraction (T2). Based on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, 63.15% of the patients presented a resistance to outflow &amp;amp;gt; 12 mmHg/mL/min, while 88% had a positive tap test response. Results: Compared to T0, cerebrospinal fluid removal significantly improved performance on tasks exploring executive functions (counting backward, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; verbal fluency, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients were significantly faster at counting backward at T2 vs. T1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and were significantly faster at counting forward at T2 vs. T1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005), suggesting an improvement in speed at T2. There was a significantly smaller index at T1 vs. T0 (p = 0.005) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), suggesting a more marked improvement in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; executive abilities at T2 and a smaller improvement at T1. Regarding verbal fluency, patients were worse at T1 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Patients&amp;amp;rsquo; performance can be monitored during the infusion and tap test as significant changes in executive functions are observable. In future, this protocol might help improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; selection for surgery.</p>

<p>Retinal abnormalities are observed in the early stages of neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Detection of retinal abnormalities in early stage, can prevent the increase in neurological diseases.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurological diseases are central nervous system (CNS) disorders affecting the whole body. Early diagnosis of the diseases is difficult due to the lack of disease-specific tests. Adding new biomarkers external to the CNS facilitates the diagnosis of neurological diseases. In this respect, the retina has a common embryologic origin with the CNS. Retinal imaging technologies including optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used in the understanding and processual monitoring of neurological diseases. Retinal imaging has been recently recognized as a potential source of biomarkers for neurological diseases, increasing the number of studies in this direction. In this review, the association of retinal abnormalities with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained. Structural and functional abnormalities in retina as a predictive marker may facilitate early diagnosis of diseases. Although not all retinal abnormalities are predictive of neurologic diseases, changes in the retinal layers including retinal pigment epithelium and plexiform layers should suggest the risk of PD, MS, ALS, and AD.</p>

<p>Striatonigral dopamine D1 receptors' signal asymmetrically producing more cAMP and GABA release at their terminals, which produces higher motor activity initiated in the right hemisphere respect left when receptors are activated.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Lateralization of motor behavior, a common phenomenon in humans and several species, is modulated by the basal ganglia, a site pointed out for the interhemispheric differences related to lateralization. Our study aims to shed light on the potential role of the striatonigral D1 receptor in functional asymmetry in normal conditions through neurochemical and behavioral means. We found that D1 receptor activation and D1/D3 receptor coactivation in striatonigral neurons leads to more cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase in the striatum and GABA release in their terminals in the right hemisphere compared to the left. These differences are linked to a higher receptor sensitivity and potentially a better coupling of G<sub>olf</sub> proteins. When we assessed motor behavior through intranigral injection of the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 in the left or right substantia nigra, we found higher contralateral circling when injected on the right side. Thus, differences in motor activity correlate with neurochemical data, indicating that D1 receptor signaling plays a significant role in motor asymmetry.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, research in humans and in the nonhuman primate model of human amnesia revealed that tasks involving free viewing of images provided an exceptionally sensitive measure of recognition memory. Performance on these tasks was sensitive to damage restricted to the hippocampus as well as to damage that included medial temporal lobe cortices. Early work in my laboratory used free-viewing tasks to assess the neurophysiological correlates of recognition memory, and the use of naturalistic visual exploration opened rich avenues to assess other aspects of the impact of eye movements on neural activity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Here, I summarize two main lines of this work and some of the stories of the trainees who made essential contributions to these discoveries.</p>

                Mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 OXPHOS subunits, which are synthesized inside the organelle. To address how mitochondrial gene expression integrates into cellular physiology, Yousefi et al. established a fluorescence-based high-throughput screen for mitochondrial translation, combining fluorescent labeling of mitochondrial translation products with siRNA-mediated knockdown. This work identifies kinases affecting mitochondrial translation.

                Molecular chaperones are vital proteins that maintain protein homeostasis by assisting in protein folding, activation, degradation, and stress protection. Among them, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) stands out as an essential proteostasis hub in eukaryotes, chaperoning hundreds of ‘clients’ (substrates). After decades of research, several ‘known unknowns’ about the molecular function of Hsp90 remain unanswered, hampering rational drug design for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative, and other diseases. We highlight three fundamental open questions, reviewing the current state of the field for each, and discuss new opportunities, including single-molecule technologies, to answer the known unknowns of the Hsp90 chaperone.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97654">Downregulation of semaphorin 4A in keratinocytes reflects the features of non-lesional psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                Psoriasis is a multifactorial disorder mediated by IL-17-producing T cells, involving immune cells and skin-constituting cells. Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A), an immune semaphorin, is known to take part in T helper type 1/17 differentiation and activation. However, Sema4A is also crucial for maintaining peripheral tissue homeostasis and its involvement in skin remains unknown. Here, we revealed that while Sema4A expression was pronounced in psoriatic blood lymphocytes and monocytes, it was downregulated in the keratinocytes of both psoriatic lesions and non-lesions compared to controls. Imiquimod application induced more severe dermatitis in Sema4A knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The naïve skin of Sema4A KO mice showed increased T cell infiltration and IL-17A expression along with thicker epidermis and distinct cytokeratin expression compared to WT mice, which are hallmarks of psoriatic non-lesions. Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice suggested that Sema4A expression in keratinocytes plays a regulatory role in imiquimod-induced dermatitis. The epidermis of psoriatic non-lesion and Sema4A KO mice demonstrated mTOR complex 1 upregulation, and the application of mTOR inhibitors reversed the skewed expression of cytokeratins in Sema4A KO mice. Conclusively, Sema4A-mediated signaling cascades can be triggers for psoriasis and targets in the treatment and prevention of psoriasis.

">Impact of bacterial translocation in stroke outcome. Soluble CD14 as early clinical marker and effect of TLR4</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial infections are among the most common complications in stroke patients. While some factors triggering these infections are well established, bacterial translocation (BT) from the intestine to other organs represents another significant factor to consider. In our study, we observed a high percentage of animals with intestinal barrier dysfunction (GBD) and BT following stroke, with typical intestinal bacteria even detected in the lungs. Moreover, this process not only exacerbates peripheral/central inflammation but also increases lesion size. In this context, our data in stroke patients demonstrate the presence of GBD, associated with elevated levels of soluble CD14 as a marker, and its strong correlation with neurological status, infarct volume, and the development of infections. Finally, our findings highlight the neuroprotective effects of the absence or pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 using ApTOLL, which not only reduces infarct volume and inflammation but also mitigates GBD/BT processes following experimental stroke.

">Evidence for distinct networks underlying symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Clinical and psychometric evidence has long supported a multidimensional model of PTSD, with symptom subcategories derived from factor analytic methods. Although research on the biological bases of PTSD as a unitary construct is profuse, comparatively few studies have examined the neural mechanisms underlying subcategories of PTSD symptoms. The present study aimed to provide the first evidence of causal relationships between brain structure and PTSD symptom subcategories, using a lesion-behavior mapping approach. Methods: Using a group of male combat veterans with focal penetrating traumatic brain injuries (n = 177), we determined the effects of focal damage on the PTSD symptom subcategories of hyperarousal, avoidance, and re-experiencing. Results: Our findings revealed two distinct networks that underlie symptom subcategories of PTSD: (1) an amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex network underlying hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms, in which amygdala damage acts as a risk factor for the development of these symptoms, while vmPFC damage acts as a protective factor against the same symptoms; and (2) a hippocampal network underlying re-experiencing and avoidance, in which hippocampal damage acts as a protective factor against these symptoms. Conclusions: The present study provides novel insights regarding the causal role of key brain regions in the heterogeneous expression of PTSD symptoms. Results not only contribute to a more complete picture of the neural mechanisms underlying PTSD, but may also aid in the future development of individualized therapeutic strategies that target specific symptom profiles.

">Disrupted Maternal Behavior in Morphine-Dependent Pregnant Rats and Anhedonia in their Offspring</a></h4>

              
                It is currently estimated that every 15 minutes an infant is born with opioid use disorder and undergoes intense early life trauma due to opioid withdrawal. Clinical research on the long-term consequences of gestational opioid exposure reports increased rates of social, conduct, and emotional disorders in these children. Here, we investigate the impact of perinatal opioid exposure (POE) on behaviors associated with anhedonia and stress in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Young adult female rats were administered morphine via programmable, subcutaneous micro-infusion pumps before, during, and through one week post gestation. Maternal behavior was examined for fragmentation and entropy for the first two postnatal weeks; offspring were assessed for sucrose preference, social behavior, and stress responsivity. Overall, dams that received morphine across gestation displayed significantly less pup-directed behavior with increased fragmentation for nursing and higher entropy scores. In adolescence, male and female rat offspring exposed to morphine displayed reduced sucrose preference and, as adults, spent significantly less time socially interacting with familiar conspecifics. Changes in social behaviors were linked to increased activity in nondopaminergic mesolimbic reward brain regions. Although no treatment effects were observed in forced swim test performance, corticosterone levels were significantly increased in POE adult males. Together, these results suggest that perinatal morphine exposure results in anhedonic behavior, possibly due to fragmented and unpredictable maternal behavior in opioid-dependent dams.

">Predictive routing emerges from self-supervised stochastic neural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiology studies propose that predictive coding is implemented via alpha/beta (8-30 Hz) rhythms that prepare specific pathways to process predicted inputs. This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics (~<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma (~40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.

">Top-down inputs are controlled by somatostatin-expressing interneurons during associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning links sensory signals to their behavioral meaning by combining bottom-up inputs with top-down contextual information, enabling decision-making based on expected outcomes. It triggers plastic changes of neuronal responses in both excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. However, the role of inhibition in shaping this plasticity remains debated. Here we used chronic extracellular electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulation of inhibitory neurons and top-down inputs in mice learning an auditory discrimination task. We found that learning enhances stimulus selectivity in a subset of neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Interestingly, somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons decrease their response to the rewarded cue and bidirectionally regulate associative learning. More specifically, an increased activity of SST neurons impairs learning by altering bottom-up signaling, whereas the reduction of their activity facilitates learning by gating top-down inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that inhibition plays a critical role in gating top-down inputs to primary sensory cortices involved in associative learning.

">Supervised Spike Sorting Feasibility of Noisy Single-Electrode Extracellular Recordings: Systematic Study of Human C-Nociceptors recorded via Microneurography</a></h4>

              
                Sorting spikes from noisy single-channel in-vivo extracellular recordings is challenging, particularly due to the lack of ground truth data. Microneurography, an electrophysiological technique for studying peripheral sensory systems, employs experimental protocols that time-lock a subset of spikes. Stable propagation speed of nerve signals enables reliable sorting of these spikes. Leveraging this property, we established ground truth labels for data collected in two European laboratories and designed an open-source pipeline to process data across diverse hardware and software systems. Using the labels derived from the time-locked spikes, we employed a supervised approach instead of the unsupervised methods typically used in spike sorting. We evaluated multiple low-dimensional representations of spikes and found that raw signal features consistently outperformed more complex approaches, which are effective in brain recordings. However, the choice of the optimal features remained dataset-specific, influenced by the similarity of average spike shapes and the number of fibers contributing to the signal. Based on our findings, we recommend tailoring lightweight algorithms to individual recordings and assessing the "sortability feasibility" based on achieved accuracy and the research question before proceeding with sorting of non-time-locked spikes. Our approach provides the foundation for further development of spike sorting algorithms in noisy extracellular recordings of neural activity.

">Discovery of neuronal cell types by pairing whole cell reconstructions with RNA expression profiles</a></h4>

              
                Effective classification of neuronal cell types requires both molecular and morphological descriptors to be collected in situ at single cell resolution. However, current spatial transcriptomics techniques are not compatible with imaging workflows that successfully reconstruct the morphology of complete axonal projections. Here, we introduce a new methodology that combines tissue clearing, submicron whole-brain two photon imaging, and Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH) to assign molecular identities to fully reconstructed neurons in the mouse brain, which we call morphoFISH. We used morphoFISH to molecularly identify a previously unknown population of cingulate neurons projecting ipsilaterally to the dorsal striatum and contralaterally to higher-order thalamus. By pairing whole-brain morphometry, improved techniques for nucleic acid preservation and spatial gene expression, morphoFISH offers a quantitative solution for discovery of multimodal cell types and complements existing techniques for characterization of increasingly fine-grained cellular heterogeneity in brain circuits.

">Graph neural networks for integrated information and major complex estimation</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) for estimating the system-level integrated information and major complex in integrated information theory (IIT) 3.0. Owing to the hierarchical complexity of IIT 3.0, tasks such as calculating integrated information and identifying major complex are computationally prohibitive for large systems, thereby restricting the applicability of IIT 3.0 to small systems. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a GNN model with transformer convolutional layers characterized by multi-head attention mechanisms for estimating the major complex and its integrated information. In our approach, exact solutions for integrated information and major complex are obtained for systems with 5, 6, and 7 nodes, and two evaluations are conducted: (1) a non-extrapolative setting in which the model is trained and tested on a mixture of systems with 5, 6, and 7 nodes, and (2) an extrapolative setting in which systems with 5 and 6 nodes are used for training and systems with 7 nodes are used for testing. The results indicate that the estimation performance in the extrapolative setting remains comparable to that in the non-extrapolative setting, showing no significant degradation. In an additional experiment, the model is trained on systems with 5, 6, and 7 nodes and tested on a larger system of 100 nodes, composed of two subsystems of 50 nodes each, with limited inter-subsystem connectivity resembling a split-brain configuration. When the connectivity between the subsystems is low, "local integration" emerges, meaning that a single subsystem forms a major complex. As the connectivity increases, local integration rapidly disappears, and the integrated information gradually rises toward "global integration," in which a large portion of the entire system forms a major complex. Overall, our findings suggest that GNNs can potentially be used for estimating integrated information, major complex, and other IIT-related quantities.

">Sleep patterns predicting stress resilience are dependent on sex</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disturbances and stress have a well-established link with neuropsychiatric illness; however, the nature of this relationship remains unclear. Recently, studies using the mouse social-defeat stress model revealed a causal role for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the maladaptive behavioral responses to stress. These results suggest a novel function for NREM sleep; as a response by cortical neurons to mitigate the maladaptive effects of stress. A major limitation in many social defeat studies has been the exclusion of females. Women exhibit a greater prevalence of both affective disorders and sleep disturbances compared to men, thus there is a clear need to understand sleep - stress interactions in females. The present study adapts recently developed female social-defeat stress models to allow social-defeat and EEG in male - female pairs. Our findings duplicated the behavioral responses that occurred in other female, nondiscriminatory, and male models of social-defeat stress. Analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, before exposure to stress, revealed that susceptibility to the behavioral effects of stress was associated with increased post-defeat NREM sleep--exclusively in females. In males, increased NREM sleep after social defeat stress occurred only in resilient mice. A potential cause of these sleep differences was also identified prior to stress exposure; we identified sex differences in recovery from NREM-sleep loss, thus, suggesting a sex-difference in the homeostatic process regulating sleep. These contrasting responses reveal sexual dimorphism in both NREM sleep predicting resilience and NREM sleep changes induced by social-defeat stress. When considered in the context of existing human literature, these findings suggest that sex is a major factor influencing the interaction of sleep with maladaptive behavioral responses to stress.

">Personalized cue-reactive delta-theta oscillations guide deep brain stimulation for opioid use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a significant public health concern, with over 30% failing available treatment. Severe SUD is characterized by drug-cue reactivity that predicts treatment-failure. We leveraged this pathophysiological feature to personalize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens region (NAc) in an SUD patient. While this DBS lead was externalized for clinical purposes, we administered a personalized drug cue-reactivity task while recording NAc electrophysiology. We identified a cue-evoked signal in the ventral NAc associated with intensification of opioid-related cravings, which attenuated with therapeutic stimulation delivered to this same area. DBS was then programmed to engage this subregion within NAc to account for the biomarker location, heralding the potential for personalized strategies to optimize DBS for SUD.

">Mitochondrial Complex I and ROS control synapse function through opposing pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Neurons require high amounts energy, and mitochondria help to fulfill this requirement. Dysfunctional mitochondria trigger problems in various neuronal tasks. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we previously reported that Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunits were required for maintaining NMJ function and growth. Here we report tissue-specific adaptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But instead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destructive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmission. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the Drosophila system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.

">Cortical Changes Associated with Isha Kriya Meditation Revealed by Encephalography in Novice and Experienced Meditators - a Longitudinal Pilot Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Isha Kriya (IK) is a widely available meditation practice that incorporates breathing regulation that has shown to improve self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. An increasing amount of research has been published on the effects of various meditative practices on scalp electroencephalography (EEG). However, the effects of IK on cortical activity have not been reported previously. Methods: Healthy volunteers aged 18 years or older were invited to participate. Participants were categorized as novice or experienced in meditation. EEG spectral features, computed during the eyes-closed condition before and soon after each IK meditation practice, were evaluated both at the start and after 6 weeks of IK meditation training. Results: This longitudinal study examined the effects of IK meditation on cortical state and trait patterns in a cohort of eight participants who practiced IK meditation over a period of 6 weeks. Across the two sessions, a simultaneous increase in global periodic alpha power was observed in multiple subjects (N=6) but this was not observed in all subjects/sessions. We observed an increase in periodic theta band power, particularly in the frontal regions, which emerged as a common state effect in all participants. Longitudinally, we observed an increased periodic gamma power in the resting state EEG in all the experienced meditators in the parietal occipital region. The changes in novices on the other hand was in the alpha and beta bands. Conclusion: Overall, in this pilot study, we report the changes in the quantitative EEG of the practitioners of Isha Kriya meditation over a 6-week cycle and investigated the difference between the start and end of that period at an individual level. We recommend future studies with a larger sample size and over a longer duration.

">Osmolarity regulates C. elegans egg-laying behavior via parallel chemosensory and biophysical mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Animals alter their behavior in response to changes in the environment. Upon encountering hyperosmotic conditions, the nematode worm C. elegans initiates avoidance and cessation of egg-laying behavior. While the sensory pathway for osmotic avoidance is well-understood, less is known about how egg laying is inhibited. We analyzed egg-laying behavior after acute and chronic shifts to and from hyperosmotic media. Animals on 400 mM sorbitol stop laying eggs immediately but then resume ~3 hours later, after accumulating additional eggs in the uterus. Surprisingly, the hyperosmotic cessation of egg laying did not require known osmotic avoidance signaling pathways. Acute hyperosmotic shifts in hyperosmotic-resistant mutants overproducing glycerol also blocked egg laying, but these animals resumed egg laying more quickly than similarly treated wild-type animals. These results suggest that hyperosmotic conditions disrupt a "high-inside" hydrostatic pressure gradient required for egg laying. Consistent with this hypothesis, animals adapted to hyperosmotic conditions laid more eggs after acute shifts back to normosmic conditions. Optogenetic stimulation of the HSN egg-laying command neurons in hyper-osmotic treated animals led to fewer and slower egg-laying events, an effect not seen following direct optogenetic stimulation of the postsynaptic vulval muscles. Hyperosmotic conditions also affected egg-laying circuit activity with the vulval muscles showing reduced Ca2+ transient amplitudes and frequency even after egg-laying resumes. Together, these results indicate that hyperosmotic conditions regulate egg-laying via two parallel mechanisms: a sensory pathway that acts to reduce HSN excitability and neurotransmitter release, and a biophysical mechanism where a hydrostatic pressure gradient reports egg accumulation in the uterus.

">Bipolar and schizophrenia risk gene AKAP11 encodes an autophagy receptor coupling the regulation of PKA kinase network homeostasis to synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Human genomic studies have identified protein-truncating variants in AKAP11 associated with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, implicating a shared disease mechanism driven by loss-of-function. AKAP11, a protein kinase A (PKA) adaptor, plays a key role in degrading the PKA-RI complex through selective autophagy. However, the neuronal functions of AKAP11 and the impact of its loss-of-function remains largely uncharacterized. Through multi-omics approaches, cell biology, and electrophysiology analysis in mouse models and human induced neurons, we delineated a central role of AKAP11 in coupling PKA kinase network regulation to synaptic transmission. Loss of AKAP11 disrupted PKA activity and impaired cellular functions that significantly overlap with pathways associated with the psychiatric disease. Moreover, we identified interactions between AKAP11, the PKA-RI adaptor SPHKAP, and the ER-resident autophagy-related proteins VAPA/B, which co-adapt and mediate PKA-RI degradation. Notably, AKAP11 deficiency impaired neurotransmission and decreased presynaptic protein levels in neurons, providing key insights into the mechanism underlying AKAP11-associated psychiatric diseases.

	<p>Background: Elastic image fusion (EIF) using an intraoperative CT (iCT) scan may enhance neuronavigation accuracy and compensate for brain shift. Objective: To evaluate the safety and reliability of the EIF algorithm (Virtual iMRI Cranial 4.5, Brainlab AG, Munich Germany, for the identification of residual tumour in glioblastoma surgery. Moreover, the impact of brain shift on software reliability is assessed. Methods: This ambispective study included 80 patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma. Pre-operative MRI was elastically fused with an intraoperative CT scan (BodyTom; Samsung-Neurologica, Danvers, MA, USA) acquired at the end of the resection. Diagnostic specificity and the sensitivity of each tool was determined. The impact of brain shift on residual tumour was statistically analysed. An analysis of accuracy was performed through Target Registration Error (TRE) measurement after rigid image fusion (RIF) and EIF. A qualitative evaluation of each Virtual MRI image (VMRI) was performed. Results: VMRI identified residual tumour in 26/80 patients (32.5%), confirmed by post-operative MRI (true positive). Of these, 5 cases were left intentionally due to DES-positive responses, 8 cases underwent near maximal or subtotal resection, and 13 cases were not detected by iCT. However, in the other 27/80 cases (33.8%), VMRI reported residual tumour that was present neither on iCT nor on post-operative MRI (false positive). i-CT showed a sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 100%; VMRI demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 50%. Spearman correlation analysis showed a moderate correlation between pre-operative volume and VMRI tumour residual. Moreover, tumour involving insula or infiltrating more than one lobe displayed higher median values (p = 0.023) of virtual residual tumour. A statistically significant reduction towards lower TRE values after EIF was observed for test structures. Conclusions: Virtual iMRI was proven to be a feasible option to detect residual tumour. Its integration within a multimodal imaging protocol may provide neurosurgeons with intraoperatively updated imaging.</p>

                <p>Lysosomes and related precursor organelles robustly build up in swollen axons that surround amyloid plaques and disrupted axonal lysosome transport has been implicated in worsening Alzheimer's pathology. Our prior studies have revealed that loss of Adaptor protein-4 (AP-4) complex function, linked primarily to spastic paraplegia (HSP), leads to a similar build of lysosomes in structures we term "AP-4 dystrophies." Surprisingly, these AP-4 dystrophies were also characterized by enrichment of components of APP processing machinery, &beta;-site cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Presenilin 2. Our studies examining whether the abnormal axonal lysosome buildup resulting from AP-4 loss could lead to amyloidogenesis revealed that the loss of AP-4 complex function in an Alzheimer's disease model resulted in a strong increase in size and abundance of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and corpus callosum as well as increased microglial association with the plaques. Interestingly, we found a further increase in enrichment of the secretase, BACE1, in the axonal swellings of the plaques of Alzheimer model mice lacking AP-4 complex compared with those having normal AP-4 complex function, suggestive of increased amyloidogenic processing under this condition. Additionally, the exacerbation of plaque pathology was region specific as it did not increase in the cortex. The burden of the AP-4 linked axonal dystrophies/AP-4 dystrophies was higher in the corpus callosum and hippocampus compared with the cortex, establishing the critical role of AP-4-dependent axonal lysosome transport and maturation in regulating amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing.</p>

                <p>by Akash Bahai, Chee Keong Kwoh, Yuguang Mu, Yinghui Li</p>

The 3D structure of RNA critically influences its functionality, and understanding this structure is vital for deciphering RNA biology. Experimental methods for determining RNA structures are labour-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Computational approaches have emerged as valuable tools, leveraging physics-based-principles and machine learning to predict RNA structures rapidly. Despite advancements, the accuracy of computational methods remains modest, especially when compared to protein structure prediction. Deep learning methods, while successful in protein structure prediction, have shown some promise for RNA structure prediction as well, but face unique challenges. This study systematically benchmarks state-of-the-art deep learning methods for RNA structure prediction across diverse datasets. Our aim is to identify factors influencing performance variation, such as RNA family diversity, sequence length, RNA type, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) quality, and deep learning model architecture. We show that generally ML-based methods perform much better than non-ML methods on most RNA targets, although the performance difference isn’t substantial when working with unseen novel or synthetic RNAs. The quality of the MSA and secondary structure prediction both play an important role and most methods aren’t able to predict non-Watson-Crick pairs in the RNAs. Overall among the automated 3D RNA structure prediction methods, DeepFoldRNA has the best prediction followed by DRFold as the second best method. Finally, we also suggest possible mitigations to improve the quality of the prediction for future method development.

BharatSim is an open-source agent-based modelling framework for the Indian population. It can simulate populations at multiple scales, from small communities to states. BharatSim uses a synthetic population created by applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to survey data from multiple sources, including the Census of India, the India Human Development Survey, the National Sample Survey, and the Gridded Population of the World. This synthetic population defines individual agents with multiple attributes, among them age, gender, home and work locations, pre-existing health conditions, and socio-economic and employment status. BharatSim’s domain-specific language provides a framework for the simulation of diverse models. Its computational core, coded in <i>Scala</i>, supports simulations of a large number of individual agents, up to 50 million. Here, we describe the design and implementation of BharatSim, using it to address three questions motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic in India: (i) When can schools be safely reopened given specified levels of hybrid immunity?, (ii) How do new variants alter disease dynamics in the background of prior infections and vaccinations? and (iii) How can the effects of varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) be quantified for a model Indian city? Through its India-specific synthetic population, BharatSim allows disease modellers to address questions unique to this country. It should also find use in the computational social sciences, potentially providing new insights into emergent patterns in social behaviour.

                <p>by Ethan Kulman, Rui Kuang, Quaid Morris</p>

Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i.e., <i>cancer phylogenies</i>, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce <i>Orchard</i>, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1,000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.

                <p>by Ryohei Shibue, Tomoharu Iwata</p>

Spike train modeling across large neural populations is a powerful tool for understanding how neurons code information in a coordinated manner. Recent studies have employed marked point processes in neural population modeling. The marked point process is a stochastic process that generates a sequence of events with marks. Spike train models based on such processes use the waveform features of spikes as marks and express the generative structure of the unsorted spikes without applying spike sorting. In such modeling, the goal is to estimate the joint mark intensity that describes how observed covariates or hidden states (e.g., animal behaviors, animal internal states, and experimental conditions) influence unsorted spikes. A major issue with this approach is that existing joint mark intensity models are not designed to capture high-dimensional and highly nonlinear observations. To address this limitation, we propose a new joint mark intensity model based on a variational autoencoder, capable of representing the dependency structure of unsorted spikes on observed covariates or hidden states in a data-driven manner. Our model defines the joint mark intensity as a latent variable model, where a neural network decoder transforms a shared latent variable into states and marks. With our model, we derive a new log-likelihood lower bound by exploiting the variational evidence lower bound and upper bound (e.g., the <i>χ</i> upper bound) and use this new lower bound for parameter estimation. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, we integrate our model into a state space model with a nonlinear embedding to capture the hidden state dynamics underlying the observed covariates and unsorted spikes. This enables us to reconstruct covariates from unsorted spikes, known as neural decoding. Our model achieves superior performance in prediction and decoding tasks for synthetic data and the spiking activities of place cells.

                <p>by Faye Orcales, Lucy Moctezuma Tan, Meris Johnson-Hagler, John Matthew Suntay, Jameel Ali, Kristiene Recto, Phelan Glenn, Pleuni Pennings</p>

Antibiotic resistance is a global public health concern. Bacteria have evolved resistance to most antibiotics, which means that for any given bacterial infection, the bacteria may be resistant to one or several antibiotics. It has been suggested that genomic sequencing and machine learning (ML) could make resistance testing more accurate and cost-effective. Given that ML is likely to become an ever more important tool in medicine, we believe that it is important for pre-health students and others in the life sciences to learn to use ML tools. This paper provides a step-by-step tutorial to train 4 different ML models (logistic regression, random forests, extreme gradient-boosted trees, and neural networks) to predict drug resistance for <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolates and to evaluate their performance using different metrics and cross-validation techniques. We also guide the user in how to load and prepare the data used for the ML models. The tutorial is accessible to beginners and does not require any software to be installed as it is based on Google Colab notebooks and provides a basic understanding of the different ML models. The tutorial can be used in undergraduate and graduate classes for students in Biology, Public Health, Computer Science, or related fields.

<p>There are no dramatically effective pharmacological treatments for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a complex disease with multiple underlying mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome alteration, and antiretroviral activity. We sifted through 15 years of reviews by a group called ALSUntangled to identify 8 alternative and off-label treatments that target ≥1 of these mechanisms, and have ≥1 human trial suggesting meaningful benefits. Given the overlapping pathological mechanisms of the highlighted products, we suggest that combinations of these treatments targeting diverse mechanisms might be worthwhile for future amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy development.

                <p>Oropouche virus (OROV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) in the <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> genus and <i>Peribunyaviridae</i> viral family that is endemic to parts of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It has recently emerged in Cuba, and travel-imported cases are recently being reported in the United States and Europe. Typically maintained in a sylvatic cycle between certain forest sloths, non-human primates, birds, and mosquitoes, OROV disease outbreaks can occur in an urban cycle between certain biting midges and/or mosquitoes and humans. Clinically, approximately 60% of infections are symptomatic with an abrupt fever and non-specific influenza-like illness within 3 to 10 days. Many initial OROV infections can present similarly to chikungunya, dengue, and Zika virus infections. Interestingly, OROV infections can follow a biphasic course with recurrence of symptoms approximately 1 week after initial symptom onset. Concerningly, similar to Zika virus, it appears that vertical transmission of OROV may occur with potentially adverse effects on fetal development including miscarriages. Neuroinvasion of OROV occurs in animal models, and human cases of meningitis, encephalitis, and peri-infectious Guillain-Barré syndrome have all been reported. Diagnosis is either through detection of OROV nucleic acid, OROV immunoglobulin M, or OROV neutralizing antibodies in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. No antiviral treatments are available, and there are no current vaccines. Preventing mosquito and biting midge bites is key. Neurologists should be aware of and report any potential neuroinvasive OROV disease cases to local/state/territorial health departments. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:28–33</p>

                <p>Obesity is implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), but its effect on disability is less well-established. This study examined the effects of various obesity measures on MS severity in 12,584 MS cases, using Mendelian randomization to mitigate confounding. Results showed a significant association between higher genetically-determined body mass index (N = 806,834) and increased MS severity (<i>P</i> = 0.02). This finding was supported by additional measures of general obesity but not adiposity distribution. The convergence of this genetic evidence with prior observational studies strengthens the association between obesity and adverse long-term disability in MS, suggesting weight management as a potential therapeutic strategy.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Clemastine has emerged as a promising therapy for the restoration of neurologic function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, clemastine and other agents with prodifferentiative effects on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in rodent models have underperformed in clinical trials. We hypothesized that the preclinical studies showed more robust effects because of the abundance of OPCs in rodent models. To better examine the therapeutic potential of clemastine, we examined its effect on demyelinated white matter lesions in rabbits, which exhibit progenitor densities and limited remyelination more closely matching those found in tissues from patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used lysolecithin to induce demyelination in white matter of New Zealand rabbits and then administered oral clemastine (10mg/kg/day) for various periods before assessing the OPC and oligodendrocyte (OL) populations in these lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Daily administration of clemastine for the full study period (56 days) increased oligodendrogenesis in white matter lesions. However, shorter durations of treatment failed to increase overall OL density despite enhancing OPC-to-OL differentiation. This effect was due to exhaustion of the OPC pool, as the differentiating progenitors were not replaced because of reduced OPC proliferation. Notably, delayed administration of clemastine led to an accumulation of activated OPCs expressing markers of senescence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although capable of driving OL differentiation, clemastine treatment in rabbits hampered progenitor pool replenishment, induced senescence, and promoted conversion of microglia/macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype. Whether these effects would also occur in humans or with other prodifferentiative therapies should be studied further, but our data suggest the need to carefully consider progenitor dynamics in the treatment of MS.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is currently scarce data on the electroclinical characteristics of epilepsy associated with synapsin 1 (<i>SYN1</i>) pathogenic variations. We examined clinical and electro-encephalographic (EEG) features in patients with epilepsy and <i>SYN1</i> variants, with the aim of identifying a distinctive electroclinical pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected and reviewed demographic, genetic, and epilepsy data of 19 male patients with <i>SYN1</i> variants. Specifically, we analyzed interictal EEG data for all patients, and electro-clinical data from 10 epileptic seizures in 5 patients, using prolonged video-EEG monitoring recordings. Inter-ictal EEG functional connectivity parameters and frequency spectrum of the 10 patients over 12 years of age, were computed and compared with those of 56 age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main electroclinical features of epilepsy in patients with <i>SYN1</i> were (1) EEG background and organization mainly normal; (2) interictal abnormalities are often rare or not visible on EEG; (3) more than 60% of patients had reflex seizures (cutaneous contact with water and defecation being the main triggers) isolated or associated with spontaneous seizures; (4) electro-clinical semiology of seizures was mainly temporal or temporo-insulo/perisylvian with a notable autonomic component; and (5) ictal EEG showed a characteristic rhythmic theta/delta activity predominating in temporo-perisylvian regions at the beginning of most seizures. Comparing patients with <i>SYN1</i> to healthy subjects, we observed a shift to lower frequency bands in power spectrum of interictal EEG and an increased connectivity in both temporal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A distinct epilepsy syndrome emerges in patients with <i>SYN1</i>, with a rather characteristic clinical and EEG pattern suggesting predominant temporo-insular involvement. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:34–50</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo variants in <i>cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase</i> (<i>CUL3</i>) have been strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but no large case series have been reported so far. Here, we aimed to collect sporadic cases carrying rare variants in <i>CUL3</i>, describe the genotype–phenotype correlation, and investigate the underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genetic data and detailed clinical records were collected via multicenter collaboration. Dysmorphic facial features were analyzed using GestaltMatcher. Variant effects on CUL3 protein stability were assessed using patient-derived T-cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We assembled a cohort of 37 individuals with heterozygous <i>CUL3</i> variants presenting a syndromic NDD characterized by intellectual disability with or without autistic features. Of these, 35 have loss-of-function (LoF) and 2 have missense variants. <i>CUL3</i> LoF variants in patients may affect protein stability leading to perturbations in protein homeostasis, as evidenced by decreased ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro. Notably, we show that 4E-BP1 (EIF4EBP1), a prominent substrate of CUL3, fails to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in patient-derived cells.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further refines the clinical and mutational spectrum of <i>CUL3</i>-associated NDDs, expands the spectrum of cullin RING E3 ligase-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, and suggests haploinsufficiency via LoF variants is the predominant pathogenic mechanism.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>The study aimed to compare outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in pediatric patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) versus cardioembolism (CE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Save ChildS and KidClot cohorts were merged. Children with AIS because of FCA or CE that underwent MT were included. The study used the Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) for stroke cause assessment. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to analyze final modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scores, periprocedural complications, and functional outcomes assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 to 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 60 children with 14 FCA and 46 CE cases. CE etiology was associated with better revascularization (good to excellent thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores) and shift toward better outcomes (common adjusted odds ratio of mRs for CE vs FCA: 0.27, 95% CI: [0.06–0.97], <i>p</i> = 0.039), with no difference in favorable outcome rates. FCA was associated with significantly lower rates of excellent revascularization (21% vs 65%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No difference in complications' rates was observed between the groups (7.2% in FCA vs 5.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.69).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found that pediatric AIS because of CE etiology has more favorable procedural outcomes compared to FCA following MT. This translated to mixed functional outcomes that may be more favorable in the CE group. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine treatment protocols for pediatric stroke, particularly in understanding and managing FCA in children.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common pathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is not always visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing surgical delays and reduced postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an open-source software to characterize and localize HS to aid the presurgical evaluation of children and adults with suspected TLE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included a multicenter cohort of 365 participants (154 HS; 90 disease controls; 121 healthy controls). HippUnfold was used to extract morphological surface-based features and volumes of the hippocampus from T1-weighted MRI scans. We characterized pathological hippocampi in patients by comparing them to normative growth charts and analyzing within-subject feature asymmetries. Feature asymmetry scores were used to train a logistic regression classifier to detect and lateralize HS. The classifier was validated on an independent multicenter cohort of 275 patients with HS and 161 healthy and disease controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HS was characterized by decreased volume, thickness, and gyrification alongside increased mean and intrinsic curvature. The classifier detected 90.1% of unilateral HS patients and lateralized lesions in 97.4%. In patients with MRI-negative histopathologically-confirmed HS, the classifier detected 79.2% (19/24) and lateralized 91.7% (22/24). The model achieved similar performances on the independent cohort, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data. Individual patient reports contextualize a patient's hippocampal features in relation to normative growth trajectories, visualise feature asymmetries, and report classifier predictions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Automated and Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal Sclerosis (AID-HS) is an open-source pipeline for detecting and lateralizing HS and outputting clinically-relevant reports. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:62–75</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The introduction of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) has led to a deceleration of disease course over the years. Although decreased relapse rate constitutes a factor, the role of relapse-associated worsening (RAW) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in MS course deceleration is still unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively examined long-term Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression in patients referred to the MS Center of Montichiari (Italy) and diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS from 1980 to 2022. To isolate PIRA, we deducted all EDSS changes associated with relapses from overall EDSS change. We compared the relative contribution of PIRA and RAW to EDSS progression in patients diagnosed in different periods using mixed-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,405 patients were included in the study, of whom 231 were diagnosed in 1980–1996 (pre-treatment era), 577 in 1997–2008 (injectable disease-modifying therapy era), and 597 after 2008 (oral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CD20 era). Across ages, both PIRA and RAW were reduced in patients diagnosed in more recent periods as compared with earlier periods. The average contribution of PIRA to overall EDSS progression was already predominant in patients diagnosed in 1980–1996 (78%) and in 1997–2008 (76%), but it was significantly increased (<i>p</i> = 0.0009) in patients diagnosed in later years (87%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The deceleration of MS course observed throughout the years is determined not only by fewer RAW events, but also by a reduction in PIRA. However, the shift toward a mostly relapse-independent progression highlights the importance of evaluating new therapies based on their effect on PIRA. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:95–103</p>

We used segmented DBS electrodes to investigate whether directing the predicted volume of tissue activated (VTA) to overlap the central STN preferentially improved gait and balance disorders compared to directional DBS applied in the more posterior STN (sensorimotor). We also assessed non-directional (ring-mode) STN-DBS. Our primary outcome was gait and balance control measured using instrumented gait recordings. Each patient had a pre-operative structural and diffusion-weighted imaging to model individual VTAs and to examine cortico-subthalamic connectivity. We used linear mixed-effects models to contrast the effects of central STN-dDBS, posterior STN-dDBS, and ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS produced significantly better improvement in gait and balance control compared to posterior STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.027), with fewer FOG episodes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, ring-mode STN-DBS resulted in worsened postural control compared to central STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The cortico-subthalamic connectivity with the STN VTAs involved mostly primary sensorimotor, premotor, and medial frontal cortices, with a higher overall cortico-STN connectivity with ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS represents the best option to improve gait and balance disorders in PD patients, including FOG. Our findings raise the possibility of reprogramming STN-DBS toward the central area in selected patients with disabling FOG and/or postural instability after surgery.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathological studies suggest that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions endure multiple waves of damage and repair; however, the dynamics and characteristics of these processes are poorly understood in patients living with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 128 MS patients (75 relapsing–remitting, 53 progressive) and 72 healthy controls who underwent advanced magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination at baseline and 2 years later. Magnetization transfer saturation and multi-shell diffusion imaging were used to quantify longitudinal changes in myelin and axon volumes within MS lesions. Lesions were grouped into 4 classes (repair, damage, mixed repair damage, and stable). The frequency of each class was correlated to clinical measures, demographic characteristics, and levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stable lesions were the most frequent (<i>n</i> = 2,276; 44%), followed by lesions with patterns of “repair” (<i>n</i> = 1,352; 26.2%) and damage (<i>n</i> = 1,214; 23.5%). The frequency of “repair” lesion was negatively associated with disability (β = −0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and sNfL (β = −0.16; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at follow-up. The frequency of the “damage” class was higher in progressive than relapsing–remitting patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and was related to disability (baseline: β = −0.078; follow-up: β = −0.076; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and age (baseline: β = −0.078; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Stable lesions were more frequent in relapsing–remitting than in progressive patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and in younger patients versus older (β = −0.07; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline. Further, “mixed” lesions were most frequent in older patients (β = 0.004; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings show that repair and damage processes within MS lesions occur across the entire disease spectrum and that their frequency correlates with patients disability, age, disease duration, and extent of neuroaxonal damage. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:134–148</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After severe corticospinal tract damage poststroke in humans, some recovery of strength and movement proximally is evident. It is possible that alternate motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of corticospinal tract input. We investigated the extent of reticulospinal tract excitability modulation and its inter-dependence on the severity of corticospinal tract damage after stroke in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel startle conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm to elicit ipsilateral motor evoked potentials, an index of reticulospinal tract excitability, in 22 chronic stroke participants with mild to severe corticospinal tract damage and 14 neurotypical age-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was higher in the paretic arm of people with severe corticospinal tract damage compared to their non-paretic arm, people with mild corticospinal tract damage, and age-matched controls. Interestingly, ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was correlated with motor impairment across the entire stroke cohort, whereby individuals with worse impairment exhibited more frequent ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (ie, higher reticulospinal tract excitability).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Following severe corticospinal tract damage, upregulated reticulospinal tract activity may compensate for a loss of corticospinal tract input, providing some proximal recovery of isolated and within-synergy movements, but deficits in performing out of synergy movements and finger fractionation remain. Interventions aimed at modulating the reticulospinal tract could be beneficial or detrimental to ameliorating motor impairment depending on the degree of reliance on this pathway for residual motor output.

                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was shown to be safe and efficacious in patients with large core stroke in multiple randomized controlled trials. However, the impact of reperfusion and other procedural metrics on EVT outcomes in this population has not been well-characterized.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From the SELECT2 trial, we evaluated the association between reperfusion status, first-pass effect (near-complete or complete reperfusion [extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) 2c-3] in 1 pass), procedure time and primary technique (aspiration vs stent-retriever) with functional outcomes in patients receiving EVT across ASPECTS (3 vs 4 vs 5) and core estimate strata (&lt;70 vs ≥70ml, &lt;100 vs ≥100ml, and &lt;150 vs ≥150ml).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 180 patients who received thrombectomy, 144 (80%) achieved successful reperfusion (eTICI 2b-3) and demonstrated better clinical outcomes (adjusted generalized odds ratios [aGenOR]: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–2.15), compared with unsuccessful reperfusion. Results were consistent across ASPECTS and core estimate strata. Additionally, complete or near-complete reperfusion (eTICI 2c-3) was associated with better functional outcome (aGenOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.33–2.97) in patients achieving successful reperfusion. Functional outcome point estimates favored those with first-pass-effect (42 of 167 (25%), aGenOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.96–2.24). Longer procedure time was associated with worse modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution (aGenOR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96, <i>p</i>-value = 0.001 for 10 minutes increment). Aspiration-first technique was used in 43 of 154 (25%) patients and was not associated with higher reperfusion (88% vs 78%, <i>p</i> = 0.18) or better functional outcome (aGenOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.50–1.10) as compared with stent-retriever first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Successful reperfusion resulted in improved clinical outcomes in large core patients across baseline ischemic core strata. Near complete or complete reperfusion was further associated with better outcomes, whereas prolonged procedures were associated with worse outcomes. Results were consistent regardless of the technique used. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:175–184</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:185–194</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27069?af=R">Mapping Functional Connectivity Signatures of Pharmacoresistant Focal Cortical Dysplasia‐Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine common network alterations in focal cortical dysplasia pharmacoresistant epilepsy (FCD-PRE) using functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective imaging cohort from Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA) from January, 2011 to January, 2022. Patients with 3-T MRI-confirmed FCD-PRE underwent rsfMRI as part of routine clinical care. Patients were included if they were age 5–22 years at the time of the scan, and had a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. Healthy, typically-developing controls were included from Children's National Hospital (n = 16) and matched from Human Connectome Project-Development public dataset (n = 100).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 42 FCD-PRE patients (20 M:22 F, aged 14.2 ± 4.1 years) and 116 healthy controls (56 M:60 F, aged 13.7 ± 3.3 years) with rsfMRI were included. Seed-based functional connectivity maps were generated for each FCD, and each seed was used to generate a patient-specific z-scored connectivity map on 116 controls. FCD-PRE patients had mutual altered connectivity in regions of dorsal attention, default mode, and control networks. Functional connectivity was diminished within the FCD dominant functional network, as well as in homotopic regions. Cluster specific connectivity patterns varied by pathological subtype. Higher FCD connectivity to the limbic network was associated with increased odds of Engel I outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates diminished functional connectivity patterns in FCD-PRE, which may represent a neuromarker for the disease, independent of FCD location, involving the dorsal attention, default mode, and control functional networks. Higher connectivity to the limbic network is associated with a seizure-free outcome. Future multicenter, prospective studies are needed to allow for much earlier detection of signatures of treatment-resistant epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:51–61</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the longitudinal dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) under B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT) and their capacity to prognosticate future progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 362 pwMS (1,480 samples) starting BCDT in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Cohort were included. sGFAP levels in 2,861 control persons (4,943 samples) provided normative data to calculate adjusted Z scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP levels (Z score &gt;1) at 1 year were associated with a higher hazard for PIRA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.17–2.78]; <i>p</i> = 0.0079) than elevated sNfL levels (HR, 1.45 [0.95–2.24], <i>p</i> = 0.0886) in a combined model. Independent of PIRA events, sGFAP levels longitudinally increased by 0.49 Z score units per 10 years follow-up (estimate, 0.49 [0.29, 0.69], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). In patients experiencing PIRA, sGFAP Z scores were 0.52 Z score units higher versus stable patients (0.52 [0.22, 0.83], <i>p</i> = 0.0009). Different sNfL Z score trajectories were found in pwMS with versus without PIRA (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.0028), with an average decrease of 0.92 Z score units per 10 years observed without PIRA (−0.92 [−1.23, −0.60], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas levels in patients with PIRA remained high.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP and lack of drop in sNfL after BCDT start are associated with increased risk of future PIRA. These findings provide a rationale for combined monitoring of sNfL and sGFAP in pwMS starting BCDT to predict the risk of PIRA, and to use sGFAP as an outcome in clinical trials aiming to impact on MS progressive disease biology.

                Zhou et al. found that CDK1 can phosphorylate IMPDH2 and suppress its basal enzymatic activity and allosteric regulation. FGFR signaling activation promotes PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of IMPDH2 and thereby enhances guanine nucleotide synthesis for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Consequently, elevation of IMPDH2 activity by FGFR activation contributes to tumor cell growth.

Degradation of the protein inhibitor in neural stem cell progeny activates the Brat-deadenylase complex, leading to the rapid clearance of obsolete transcripts and the timely onset of differentiation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98344">TCR transgenic clone selection guided by immune receptor analysis and single-cell RNA expression of polyclonal responders</a></h4>

              
                Since the precursor frequency of naive T cells is extremely low, investigating the early steps of antigen-specific T cell activation is challenging. To overcome this detection problem, adoptive transfer of a cohort of T cells purified from T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic donors has been extensively used but is not readily available for emerging pathogens. Constructing TCR transgenic mice from T cell hybridomas is a labor-intensive and sometimes erratic process, since the best clones are selected based on antigen-induced CD69 upregulation or IL-2 production in vitro, and TCR chains are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-cloned into expression vectors. Here, we exploited the rapid advances in single-cell sequencing and TCR repertoire analysis to select the best clones without hybridoma selection, and generated CORSET8 mice (<b>COR</b>ona <b>S</b>pike <b>E</b>pitope specific CD8 <b>T</b> cell), carrying a TCR specific for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Implementing newly created DALI software for TCR repertoire analysis in single-cell analysis enabled the rapid selection of the ideal responder CD8 T cell clone, based on antigen reactivity, proliferation, and immunophenotype in vivo. Identified TCR sequences were inserted as synthetic DNA into an expression vector and transgenic CORSET8 donor mice were created. After immunization with Spike/CpG-motifs, mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, CORSET8 T cells strongly proliferated and showed signs of T cell activation. Thus, a combination of TCR repertoire analysis and scRNA immunophenotyping allowed rapid selection of antigen-specific TCR sequences that can be used to generate TCR transgenic mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99757">Aberrant auditory prediction patterns robustly characterize tinnitus</a></h4>

              
                Phantom perceptions like tinnitus occur without any identifiable environmental or bodily source. The mechanisms and key drivers behind tinnitus are poorly understood. The dominant framework, suggesting that tinnitus results from neural hyperactivity in the auditory pathway following hearing damage, has been difficult to investigate in humans and has reached explanatory limits. As a result, researchers have tried to explain perceptual and potential neural aberrations in tinnitus within a more parsimonious predictive-coding framework. In two independent magnetoencephalography studies, participants passively listened to sequences of pure tones with varying levels of regularity (i.e. predictability) ranging from random to ordered. Aside from being a replication of the first study, the pre-registered second study, including 80 participants, ensured rigorous matching of hearing status, as well as age, sex, and hearing loss, between individuals with and without tinnitus. Despite some changes in the details of the paradigm, both studies equivalently reveal a group difference in neural representation, based on multivariate pattern analysis, of upcoming stimuli before their onset. These data strongly suggest that individuals with tinnitus engage anticipatory auditory predictions differently to controls. While the observation of different predictive processes is robust and replicable, the precise neurocognitive mechanism underlying it calls for further, ideally longitudinal, studies to establish its role as a potential contributor to, and/or consequence of, tinnitus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98535">Flamingo participates in multiple models of cell competition</a></h4>

              
                The growth and survival of cells with different fitness, such as those with a proliferative advantage or a deleterious mutation, is controlled through cell competition. During development, cell competition enables healthy cells to eliminate less fit cells that could jeopardize tissue integrity, and facilitates the elimination of pre-malignant cells by healthy cells as a surveillance mechanism to prevent oncogenesis. Malignant cells also benefit from cell competition to promote their expansion. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the mechanisms governing cell competition, particularly those common to developmental competition and tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here, we show that in <i>Drosophila</i>, the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Flamingo (Fmi) is required by winners to maintain their status during cell competition in malignant tumors to overtake healthy tissue, in early pre-malignant cells when they overproliferate among wildtype cells, in healthy cells when they later eliminate pre-malignant cells, and by supercompetitors as they compete to occupy excessive territory within wildtype tissues. ‘Would-be’ winners that lack Fmi are unable to overproliferate, and instead become losers. We demonstrate that the role of Fmi in cell competition is independent of PCP, and that it uses a distinct mechanism that may more closely resemble one used in other less well-defined functions of Fmi.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98867">NK cell exhaustion in Wilson’s disease revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing predicts the prognosis of cholecystitis</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic abnormalities associated with liver disease have a significant impact on the risk and prognosis of cholecystitis. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated this issue using Wilson’s disease (WD) as a model, which is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired mitochondrial function and copper metabolism. Our retrospective clinical study found that WD patients have a significantly higher incidence of cholecystitis and a poorer prognosis. The hepatic immune cell landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the tissue immune microenvironment is altered in WD, mainly a major change in the constitution and function of the innate immune system. Exhaustion of natural killer (NK) cells is the fundamental factor, supported by the upregulated expression of inhibitory receptors and the downregulated expression of cytotoxic molecules, which was verified in clinical samples. Further bioinformatic analysis confirmed a positive correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor prognosis in cholecystitis and other inflammatory diseases. The study demonstrated dysfunction of liver immune cells triggered by specific metabolic abnormalities in WD, with a focus on the correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor healing of cholecystitis, providing new insights into the improvement of inflammatory diseases by assessing immune cell function.

">Neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental roles for bulk lipid transporters VPS13A and BLTP2 in movement disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) mediate bulk lipid transport at membrane contact sites. Mutations in BLTPs are linked to both early-onset neurodevelopmental and later-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including movement disorders. The tissue specificity and temporal requirements of BLTPs in disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Objectives: To determine the age-of-onset and tissue-specific roles of VPS13A and BLTP2 in movement disorder pathogenesis using Drosophila models. Methods: We generated tissue-specific knockdowns of the VPS13A ortholog (Vps13) and the BLTP2 ortholog (hobbit) in neurons and muscles of Drosophila. We analyzed age-dependent locomotor behavior, neurodegeneration, and synapse development and function. Results: Neuron-specific loss of the VPS13A ortholog caused neurodegeneration followed by age-onset movement deficits and reduced lifespan, while muscle-specific loss affected only lifespan, revealing neurodegeneration and myopathy as independent comorbidities in VPS13A disease. In contrast, neuronal loss of the BLTP2 ortholog resulted in severe early-onset locomotor defects without neurodegeneration, while muscle loss impaired synaptogenesis and neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Conclusions: VPS13A maintains neuronal survival, while BLTP2 orchestrates synaptic development. VPS13A function in muscle does not play a role in movement defects. The phenotypic specificity of BLTP function provides mechanistic insights into distinct disease trajectories for BLTP-associated movement disorders.

">Weight Transfer in the Reinforcement Learning Model of Songbird Acquisition</a></h4>

              
                Song acquisition behavior observed in the songbird system provides a notable example of learning through trial-and-error which parallels human speech acquisition. Studying songbird vocal learning can offer insights into mechanisms underlying human language. We present a computational model of song learning that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Hebbian learning and agrees with known songbird circuitry. The song circuit outputs activity from nucleus RA, which receives two primary inputs: timing information from area HVC and stochastic activity from nucleus LMAN. Additionally, song learning relies on Area X, a basal ganglia area that receives dopaminergic inputs from VTA. In our model, song is first acquired in the HVC-to-Area X connectivity, employing an RL mechanism that involves node perturbation. This information is then consolidated into HVC-to-RA synapses through a Hebbian mechanism. The transfer of weights from Area X to RA takes place via the thalamus, utilizing a specific form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Thus, we present a computational model grounded in songbird circuitry in which the optimal policy is initially guided by RL and subsequently transferred to another circuit through Hebbian plasticity.

">When do measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry?</a></h4>

              
                The representational geometry of a brain region can be characterized by the distances among neural activity patterns for a set of experimental conditions. Researchers routinely estimate representational distances from brain-activity measurements that either sparsely sample the underlying neural population (e.g. neural recordings) or pool across the activity of many neurons (e.g. fMRI voxels). Here we use theory and simulations to clarify under what circumstances representational distances estimated from brain-activity measurements reflect the representational geometry of the underlying neural population, and what distortions must be expected under other circumstances. We demonstrate that the estimated representational distances are undistorted if single neurons are sampled at random. For voxels that take non-negatively weighted linear combinations, the resulting geometry is linearly distorted, correctly reflecting the population-mean dimension, while downscaling all orthogonal dimensions, for which the averaging cancels a large portion of the signal. Surprisingly, removing the mean from voxel patterns recovers the underlying representational geometry exactly in expectation under idealized conditions. This explains why the correlation distance, the most popular measure of representational dissimilarity in neuroimaging studies, ``works" so well, yielding geometries that can appear similar between fMRI and neural recordings. The Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) distance computed after removing the mean of each pattern (without normalizing its variance) is an attractive alternative to the correlation distance in that it corrects for the inflated relative contribution of the population-mean dimension, while avoiding the drawback of the correlation distance: it can be large for confusable low-norm patterns, failing to reflect decodability. Our results demonstrate that measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry when (1) single neurons are sampled at random or (2) the weights with which the measured responses sample the neurons are drawn i.i.d. and (2a) the weights are drawn from a zero-mean distribution or (2b) the population mean is the same for all conditions or (2c) the mean is removed from each estimated pattern. We discuss practical implications for analyses of neural representational geometries.

He also measured the height of a minor "deep winding" at the same location within the CS in the remaining 1,081 brains, reporting a distribution skewed towards significantly increased heights. These observations supported his hypothesis that the "bridged" CS represents an extreme form of the "deep winding" within the CS. In this replication we examined structural MRI data from an equally large dataset of 1,112 participants of the Human Connectome Project young adult (HCP-YA) dataset. Through visual inspection, we identified nine cases of a "bridged" CS, confirming its prevalence of less than 1%. The height of the "deep winding", referred to in the HCP-YA dataset as the pli de passage fronto-parietal moyen (PPfpm), was extracted from 1,983 MRI-based hemispheric depth profiles. The resulting PPfpm height distribution, although wider, still mirrored Heschls findings, showing a similar skew towards larger heights. Further analyses of the twin data within the HCP-YA dataset indicated a slightly increased prevalence of the "bridged" CS in monozygotic and dizygotic twins compared to non-twin individuals, though no concordance of "bridged" CS was observed in monozygotic twin pairs. This replication study validates both of Heschls observations, describes additional factors that might influence the prevalence of the "bridged" CS, and refines the characterization of the "deep winding" height distribution. Together, these findings reaffirm and expand historical insights into the intricate anatomical organization of the CS.

">How to deal with darkness: Modeling and visualization of zero-inflated personal light exposure data on a logarithmic scale</a></h4>

              
                Personal light exposure, the pattern of ocular light levels across time under free-living conditions measured with wearable devices, has become increasingly important in circadian and myopia research. Very small measurement values in light exposure patterns, especially zero, are regularly recorded in field studies. These zero-lux values are problematic for commonly applied logarithmic transformations, and should neither be dismissed nor be unduly influential in visualizations and statistical models. Common approaches used in zero-inflated data sets fail in at least one of these regards. We compare four ways to visualize such data on a linear, logarithmic, hybrid, or symlog scale and we model the light exposure patterns with a generalized additive model by removing zero-lux values, adding a very small or -1 log10 lux value to the dataset, or using the Tweedie error distribution. We show that a symlog-transformed visualization displays relevant features of light exposure across scales, including zero-lux, while at the same time reducing the emphasis on the small values (<1 lux). Symlog is well-suited to visualize differences in light exposure covering heavy-tailed negative values. The open-source software package LightLogR includes the symlog transformation for easy access. We further show that small but not negligible value additions to the light exposure data of -1 log10 lux for statistical modelling allow for acceptable models on a logarithmic scale, while very small values distort results. We also demonstrate the utility of the Tweedie distribution, which does not require prior transformations, models data on a logarithmic scale, and includes zero-lux values, capturing personal light exposure patterns satisfactorily. Data from field studies of personal light exposure requires appropriate handling of zero-lux values in a logarithmic context. Symlog scales for visualizations and an appropriate addition to input values for modelling, or the Tweedie distribution, provide a solid basis.

">Astrocyte-derived extracellular matrix proteins regulate synapse remodeling in stress-induced depression</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mood condition affecting multiple brain regions and cell types. Changes in astrocyte function contribute to depressive-like behaviors. However, while neuronal mechanisms driving MDD have been studied in some detail, molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes promote depression have not been extensively explored. To uncover astrocyte contributions to MDD, we subjected male mice to chronic social defeat stress precipitated by encounters with a dominant male. Animals exposed to this treatment exhibit symptoms indicative of MDD, including reduced social interactions, anxiety, despair, and anhedonia. We then measured astrocyte translating mRNA expression changes in mice that underwent chronic social defeat and control animals using ribosome affinity purification. Bioinformatic analyses reveal significant alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), consistent with previous studies implicating this brain region in MDD. Expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, cell-cell interaction proteins, and proteins controlling glutamatergic synaptic function are significantly altered. These changes correlate with perturbation of glutamatergic transmission, measured by electrophysiology, and increased synaptic cleft size. Among ECM genes, increased expression of mRNAs encoding the synaptic remodeling protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc) correlates the most with the depressive phenotype. Furthermore, presence of Sparc and other ECM proteins in synaptosomes is also increased and overexpressing Sparc in PFC partially alleviates stress symptoms. Our results raise the possibility that increased expression of Sparc may be a natural protective mechanism against stress-induced synaptic dysfunction in depression.

">Context-Dependent PSIICOS: A Novel Framework for Functional Connectivity Estimation Accounting for Task-Related Power Leakage</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) analysis using non-invasive neuroimaging methods, such as MEG and EEG, is often confounded by artifacts from spatial leakage and task-related power modulations. To address these limitations, we present Context-Dependent PSIICOS (CD-PSIICOS), a novel framework that improves the estimation of FC by incorporating task-specific cortical power distributions into the projection operator applied to the vectorized sensor-space cross-spectrum. Unlike the original PSIICOS approach, which is prone to suppress spatial leakage from all the sources, CD-PSIICOS dynamically adjusts the projection based on the active source distribution, enabling more accurate suppression of spatial leakage while preserving true zero-phase interactions. We validated CD-PSIICOS using realistic simulations and a multi-subject MEG dataset. The results demonstrate that CD-PSIICOS outperforms the original PSIICOS in suppressing artifacts at lower projection ranks, maintaining robust detection of functional networks across theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. By requiring lower projection ranks for optimal performance, CD-PSIICOS facilitates the reconstruction of physiologically relevant networks with improved specificity and stability.

">Dissociable neurofunctional and molecular characterizations of reward and punishment sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                While the hyper- and hypo- reward or punishment sensitivities (RS, PS) have received considerable attention as prominent transdiagnostic features of psychopathology, the lack of an overarching neurobiological characterization currently limits their early identifications and neuromodulations. Here we combined microarray data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas with a multimodal fMRI approach to uncover the neurobiological signatures of RS and PS in a discovery-replication design (N=655 participants). Both RS and PS were mapped separately in the brain, with the intrinsic functional connectome in the fronto-striatal network encoding reward responsiveness, while the fronto-insular system was particularly engaged in punishment sensitivity. This dissociable functional connectome patterns related to RS and PS were also specific in differentiating decisions driven by social or monetary reward and punishment motivations. Further imaging transcriptomic analyses revealed that functional connectome variations for RS and PS were associated with topography of specific gene sets enriched in ontological pathways, including synaptic transmission, dopaminergic metabolism, immune response and stress adaptation. On the neurotransmitter level, the serotonin neuromodulator was identified as a pivotal hub regulating the intrinsic functional connectome patterns of RS and PS, with this process critically dependent on its interactions with dopaminergic, opioid and GABAergic systems. Overall, these findings indicate dissociable neural connectome mapping of RS and PS and highlight their linkage with transcriptomic profiles, which may offer valuable insights into the treatment evaluation for symptomatology relevant to reward/punishment processing deficits.

">A quantitative spatial atlas of transcriptomic, morphological, and electrophysiological cell type densities in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain cells can be classified into transcriptomic, morphological, and electrophysiological types. We derived a quantitative spatial atlas of the distributions of these classes within the mouse brain. To do so, we first generated a 3D atlas of transcriptomic cell type densities, by scaling regional estimates of densities from brain slices using cell counts and slice dimensions. Adjustments for regions with high cell density, such as the cerebellum, were made using the average Nissl intensities as a density modifier on a voxel-by-voxel basis. To connect the transcriptomic-type signatures to cellular function (morphological-electrophysiological types), we leveraged patch-sequencing datasets, which integrate mRNA counts, morphology reconstructions, and electrophysiological recordings from single cortical neurons. We aligned mRNA counts with the established classifications of transcriptomic types, classified neuron morphologies according to morphological types, and derived electrophysiological types using K-means clustering. The resulting 3D atlas and computational framework can be used to probe neuronal cell-type diversity and its functional implications, setting the stage for further explorations into the cellular basis of brain function.

">Integration of head and body orientations in the macaque superior temporal sulcus is specific to upright bodies</a></h4>

              
                The neural processing of faces and bodies is often studied separately, despite their natural integration in perception. Unlike prior research on the neural selectivity for either head or body orientation, we investigated their interaction in macaque superior temporal sulcus (STS) using a monkey avatar with diverse head-body orientation angles. STS neurons showed selectivity for specific combinations of head-body orientations. Anterior STS (aSTS) neurons enabled more reliable decoding of head-body configuration angles compared to middle STS neurons. Decoding accuracy in aSTS was lowest for head-body angle pairs differing only in sign (e.g. head-body orientation difference of +/- 90 degrees relative to the anatomical midline), and highest for aligned (0 degrees) head-body orientations versus those with maximum angular difference. Inverted bodies showed diminished decoding of head-body orientation angle compared to upright bodies. These findings show that aSTS integrates head and body orientation cues, revealing configuration-specific neural mechanisms, and advance our understanding of social perception.

">Investigating the role of sensorimotor spatial dependencies in shaping conscious access to virtual 3D objects</a></h4>

              
                According to sensorimotor accounts of perceptual experience, the subjective veridicality of an object (the sense of its 'presence') builds up gradually as one learns how changes in sensory inputs depend on bodily movements. To investigate how sensorimotor interactions shape visual experience, we designed a virtual-reality-based study that allowed us to manipulate the complexity of spatial dependencies governing interactions with unfamiliar 3D objects. Participants had to learn to manually control fully visible objects that could move in congruent, opposite, novel (orthogonal), or random directions in response to their movements. The sensorimotor control tasks occurred alternately with a continuous flash suppression (CFS) task evaluating the access of stationary objects to visual awareness, operationalised as the time taken for a 3D object to break the interocular suppression. We hypothesised that objects whose motion was experienced as depending on actions in a lawful, and thus encodable, manner (i.e., according to a congruent, opposite, or novel - but not random - dependency) would overcome suppression faster than objects moving randomly in response to actions (for which there is no world-related statistical structure to learn). However, while performance in the sensorimotor tasks consistently decreased along with the difficulty of the conditions (i.e., congruent > opposite > novel > random), the pre-registered analysis yielded no significant differences in breakthrough times of objects manipulated under different coupling rules. An exploratory analysis assessing whether the acquisition of 'sensorimotor mastery' was associated with reduced breakthrough times also revealed no significant effects. Thus, our results suggest that one's knowledge of how an object responds to action does not play a salient role in determining conscious access to visual stimuli. This extends previous evidence for a general ineffectiveness of sensorimotor spatial manipulations in interocular suppression paradigms. Notably, in all conditions, object movement remained tightly coupled (i.e., contingent) to the participant's actions = and given such stimuli have already been shown to break suppression faster than uncoupled/pre-recorded visual inputs - it is possible that sensorimotor contingency was a sufficiently salient factor to override any influences related to how identifiable specific spatial dependencies were.

">Electrophysiological correlates of cognitive reserve in healthy older adults at different cognitive states</a></h4>

              
                High cognitive reserve (CR) is associated with a set of lifestyle factors such as high education level and occupational attainment. Studies suggest that CR is linked to enhanced executive control functions. Nevertheless, it is unclear what are the functional neural activity patterns linked to high CR and to what extent they are steady across different cognitive states. The aim of the present study was to investigate electrophysiological differences between low CR (LCR) and high CR (HCR) at rest and during the performance of two cognitive control tasks with different difficulty level. Thus, 67 older adults performed an experimental session consisting of two spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) tasks (i.e., the Simon task, and the more demanding spatial Stroop task), and a resting state during an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Cognitive control was better in HCR than LCR group, as revealed by higher accuracy in HCR compared to LCR group in incongruent conditions of the tasks. Moreover, event-related brain potentials (ERP) showed earlier latencies (P300) in HCR than LCR and time/frequency analysis showed higher alpha activity in HCR than LCR during the performance of the tasks, while no differences were observed at rest within any of the analyzed frequency bands. Higher P300 frontalization was observed in LCR than HCR in the more difficult task but it was not related to frontalization within a specific frequency band. Overall, results showed that electrophysiological differences between high and low CR depend on the cognitive state, with greater CR-related differences emerging at increased task demands.

">Diversity of set-related neuronal activity in the dorsal premotor cortex of monkeys during a path-planning task</a></h4>

              
                Actions involve multiple levels. The dorsal premotor area (PMd) of the primate cerebral cortex is involved in the preparation of actions based on perceptual information. In this study, we recorded neuronal activity from the PMd of monkeys while they performed a path-finding task. In the task, the animals were required to move a cursor step by step to a goal in a maze-like display, and the arm movement and the direction of the cursor operation were dissociated. We observed neurons involved in the preparation of a single arm movement and neurons involved in the preparation of a single cursor operation. Cursor operation-related neurons were also obtained from the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), but the PMd neurons showed more preparatory properties during the execution period than the lPFC neurons. Furthermore, we found neurons involved in the preparation of a specific sequence of cursor movements. The PMd included not only all types of single-shot preparatory neurons but also preparatory neurons for a variety of complex sequences for arm movements and cursor manipulation. These results suggest that the PMd contains diverse neurons involved in different levels of action preparation. Such diversity is one of the critical neural bases for robust goal-directed behavior in complex environments.

">Can we infer excitation-inhibition balance from the spectrum of population activity?</a></h4>

              
                Networks in the brain most of times operate in an excitation-inhibition (EI) balanced state. Altered EI balance is often associated with a change in brain state and impaired information processing. Given its importance, it is crucial to establish non-invasive measures of the EI balances. In this regard, previous studies have suggested that the relative EI balance can be inferred from the spectrum of the population signals such as Local Field Potentials (LFPs), Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). This idea exploits the fact that in most cases excitatory and inhibitory synapses have quite different time constants. However, it is not clear to what extent spectral slope of population activity is related to the network parameters that define the EI balance e.g. the excitatory and inhibitory conductance). To address this question we simulated two different types of recurrent networks and measured spectral slope for a wide range of network parameters. Our results show that slope of spectrum cannot predict the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance. Only in a small set of simulations a change in the spectral slope was consistent with the corresponding change in the synaptic weights or inputs to the network. Thus, our results show that we should be careful in interpreting the change in the slope of the population activity spectrum.

">NeuroTorch: A Python library for neuroscience-oriented machine learning</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool for data analysis, leading to significant advances in neuroscience research. While ML algorithms are proficient in general-purpose tasks, their highly technical nature often hinders their compatibility with the observed biological principles and constraints in the brain, thereby limiting their suitability for neuroscience applications. In this work, we introduce NeuroTorch, a comprehensive ML pipeline specifically designed to assist neuroscientists in leveraging ML techniques using biologically inspired neural network models. NeuroTorch enables the training of recurrent neural networks equipped with either spiking or firing-rate dynamics, incorporating additional biological constraints such as Dale's law and synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance. The pipeline offers various learning methods, including backpropagation through time and eligibility trace forward propagation, aiming to allow neuroscientists to effectively employ ML approaches. To evaluate the performance of NeuroTorch, we conducted experiments on well-established public datasets for classification tasks, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Heidelberg. Notably, NeuroTorch achieved accuracies that replicated the results obtained using the Norse and SpyTorch packages. Additionally, we tested NeuroTorch on real neuronal activity data obtained through volumetric calcium imaging in larval zebrafish. On training sets representing 9.3 minutes of activity under darkflash stimuli from 522 neurons, the mean proportion of variance explained for the spiking and firing-rate neural network models, subject to Dale's law, exceeded 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Our analysis of networks trained on these datasets indicates that both Dale's law and spiking dynamics have a beneficial impact on the resilience of network models when subjected to connection ablations. NeuroTorch provides an accessible and well-performing tool for neuroscientists, granting them access to state-of-the-art ML models used in the field without requiring in-depth expertise in computer science.

">Impaired axon regeneration and heightened synaptic dynamics in the injured aged mammalian cortex</a></h4>

              
                How aging affects axon regeneration and synaptic repair in the brain is poorly understood. To study age-related changes in neural circuits, we developed a model of axonal injury in the aged (> 2 years) mouse somatosensory cortex. By directly tracking fluorescently labelled injured axons by multiphoton imaging, we find that while axon degeneration in the aged brain is comparable to the young adult brain, axon regeneration is impaired. We further examine changes in the most common type of cortical synapses, En Passant Boutons (EPBs), and observe a transient and significant increase in the number and size of boutons 6 hours post-lesion. Using a computational model of a recurrent neural network, we examined the functional consequences of these synaptic increases on memory, comparing results to models of the young adult brain. The results suggest that increased synaptic dynamics might enable partial recovery from injury via synaptic re-wiring in the aged brain.

	<p>Background/Objectives: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) alternates short periods of intense exercise with recovery, effectively enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, and strength in various populations. Concurrently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports neuronal resilience and activity-dependent plasticity, which are vital for learning and memory. This study aims to systematically review changes in BDNF levels in response to HIIT, with three primary objectives: evaluating the benefits of HIIT for BDNF modulation, assessing methodological quality and the risk of bias in reviewed studies, and identifying patterns in BDNF response based on HIIT protocols and population characteristics. Methods: Comprehensive database searches were conducted in PubMed and SPORTDiscus to identify relevant studies published up to April 2024. Given the diversity in study designs and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was performed rather than a meta-analysis. Bias was evaluated using visualization tools such as RobVis, and the review was conducted by a single researcher, which may limit its comprehensiveness. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, with most indicating significant increases in BDNF levels post-HIIT, suggesting HIIT&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential to enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. However, variations in BDNF responses were observed across different HIIT protocols and study populations. Some studies reported decreases or no change in BDNF levels, reflecting the complex regulation of BDNF influenced by factors such as exercise intensity, duration, and individual variability. Conclusions: HIIT shows promise as an intervention for increasing BDNF levels, with potential benefits for brain health and cognitive function. These findings underscore the need for further research to confirm the optimal conditions under which HIIT can effectively enhance neurological outcomes. Future studies should explore standardized HIIT protocols and the long-term impact of HIIT on BDNF and neuroplasticity.</p>

	<p>Speech is a highly skilled motor activity that shares a core problem with other motor skills: how to reduce the massive degrees of freedom (DOF) to the extent that the central nervous control and learning of complex motor movements become possible. It is hypothesized in this paper that a key solution to the DOF problem is to eliminate most of the temporal degrees of freedom by synchronizing concurrent movements, and that this is performed in speech through the syllable&amp;amp;mdash;a mechanism that synchronizes consonantal, vocalic, and laryngeal gestures. Under this hypothesis, syllable articulation is enabled by three basic mechanisms: target approximation, edge-synchronization, and tactile anchoring. This synchronization theory of the syllable also offers a coherent account of coarticulation, as it explicates how various coarticulation-related phenomena, including coarticulation resistance, locus, locus equation, diphone, etc., are byproducts of syllable formation. It also provides a theoretical basis for understanding how suprasegmental events such as tone, intonation, phonation, etc., are aligned to segmental events in speech. It may also have implications for understanding vocal learning, speech disorders, and motor control in general.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Stressors occurring across the life course are considered to have a cumulative impact on health, but there is no instrument for assessing lifetime stressor exposure in Korea. Therefore, we validated the Stress and Adversity Inventory (Adult STRAIN) in Korean. Methods: We translated the Adult STRAIN into Korean and examined its concurrent, predictive, and comparative predictive validity in 218 Korean adults (79 men, 139 women; Mage = 29.5; 19&amp;amp;ndash;50 years old) recruited from a psychiatric setting. We assessed concurrent validity using Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations, predictive validity using multiple regression models, and comparative predictive validity using multivariate logistic regression to identify participants with lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Results: The Korean STRAIN exhibited sufficient usability and acceptability; good concurrent validity with other measures of early adversity, life events, and perceived stress (rs = 0.48&amp;amp;ndash;0.61); and strong predictive validity in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.47; &amp;amp;Delta;R2 = 0.11&amp;amp;ndash;0.21). Each domain of Korean-style stress, based on the timing, type, life domain, and sociopsychological characteristics of stress exposure, showed a different distribution of lifetime psychiatric diagnosis probabilities (odds ratios = 1.20&amp;amp;ndash;4.85). Finally, the test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability for total lifetime stressor count and severity over four weeks was high. Conclusions: The Korean STRAIN is a practical, valid, and reliable instrument for researchers and clinicians to efficiently assess lifetime stressor exposure.</p>

	<p>Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of observing actions at different speeds on the speed of motor task performance in subsequent actions. Methods: Sixty individuals, divided equally between those with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) and asymptomatic subjects, were enrolled. Participants were further split into subgroups to observe lumbar flexion and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test actions at either a slow or fast pace, following a randomized assignment. For post-video observation, participants replicated the observed actions three times without specific performance instructions, allowing for the assessment of their execution speed. Results: The analysis revealed that individuals observing actions at a faster pace executed the subsequent motor tasks significantly quicker than their counterparts who viewed the same actions at a slower speed. This was consistent across both NSCLBP sufferers and asymptomatic subjects, indicating that the action observation (AO) speed directly influenced the execution speeds of lumbar flexion and TUG test movements. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that AO speed significantly affects the pace of motor execution, irrespective of NSCLBP presence. This underscores the potential of utilizing varied AO speeds as a strategic component in clinical practice, particularly for enhancing motor planning and execution in physical therapy settings. The study highlights the importance of incorporating AO speed variations into therapeutic interventions for improving patient outcomes in motor task performance.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Computer-aided schizophrenia (SZ) detection methods mainly depend on electroencephalogram and brain magnetic resonance images, which both capture physical signals from patients&amp;amp;rsquo; brains. These inspection techniques take too much time and affect patients&amp;amp;rsquo; compliance and cooperation, while difficult for clinicians to comprehend the principle of detection decisions. This study proposes a novel method using face diagnosis images based on traditional Chinese medicine principles, providing a non-invasive, efficient, and interpretable alternative for SZ detection. Methods: An innovative face diagnosis image analysis method for SZ detection, which learns feature representations based on Vision Transformer (ViT) directly from face diagnosis images. It provides a face features distribution visualization and quantitative importance of each facial region and is proposed to supplement interpretation and to increase efficiency in SZ detection while keeping a high detection accuracy. Results: A benchmarking platform comprising 921 face diagnostic images, 6 benchmark methods, and 4 evaluation metrics was established. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves SZ detection performance with a 3&amp;amp;ndash;10% increase in accuracy scores. Additionally, it is found that facial regions rank in descending order according to importance in SZ detection as eyes, mouth, forehead, cheeks, and nose, which is exactly consistent with the clinical traditional Chinese medicine experience. Conclusions: Our method fully leverages semantic feature representations of first-introduced face diagnosis images in SZ, offering strong interpretability and visualization capabilities. It not only opens a new path for SZ detection but also brings new tools and concepts to the research and application in the field of mental illness.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can boost motor recovery after a stroke. Certain movement phases are more responsive to NIBS, so a system that auto-detects these phases would optimize stimulation timing. This study assessed the effectiveness of various machine learning models in identifying movement phases in hemiparetic individuals undergoing simultaneous NIBS and EEG recordings. We hypothesized that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of NIBS, would enhance EEG signals related to movement phases and improve classification accuracy compared to sham stimulation. Methods: EEG data from 10 chronic stroke patients and 11 healthy controls were recorded before, during, and after tDCS. Eight machine learning algorithms and five ensemble methods were used to classify two movement phases (hold posture and reaching) during each of these periods. Data preprocessing included z-score normalization and frequency band power binning. Results: In chronic stroke participants who received active tDCS, the classification accuracy for hold vs. reach phases increased from pre-stimulation to the late intra-stimulation period (72.2% to 75.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Late active tDCS surpassed late sham tDCS classification (75.2% vs. 71.5%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Linear discriminant analysis was the most accurate (74.6%) algorithm with the shortest training time (0.9 s). Among ensemble methods, low gamma frequency (30&amp;amp;ndash;50 Hz) achieved the highest accuracy (74.5%), although this result did not achieve statistical significance for actively stimulated chronic stroke participants. Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms showed enhanced movement phase classification during active tDCS in chronic stroke participants. These results suggest their feasibility for real-time movement detection in neurorehabilitation, including brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces for stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is a need in Korea for research estimating the impact of aging using the Useful Field Of View (UFOV) test, which can evaluate visual function for elderly drivers. Methods: This observational study involved young people in their twenties and thirties, later-middle-aged people in their fifties or older, and elderly people 65 or older recruited from the Gangwon-do region. UFOV testing was conducted on the participants where the participants completed a questionnaire about general and driving-related characteristics. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze the mean difference by age group, and a Pearson correlation analysis was carried out to evaluate the correlation between age and visual function. In addition, a simple linear regression analysis was conducted to verify UFOV subdomains that can confirm changes according to age increasing. Results: Findings after analyzing UFOV subtest differences by age group revealed significant differences in the visual function index of the young, later-middle-aged, and elderly in all three tests, and the difference between the later-middle-aged and old groups was only found in divided attention. The correlation between age and visual function was significant in all three subtests. And all three subtests were confirmed to be indicators that can verify changes according to increasing age. Conclusions: This study showed that visual function significantly decreases with age. Selective attention was confirmed as a visual function type that changes sensitively according to increasing age.</p>

	<p>Background: The segmentation of electroencephalography (EEG) signals into a limited number of microstates is of significant importance in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Currently, the microstate analysis algorithm based on global field power has demonstrated its efficacy in clustering resting-state EEG. The task-related EEG was extensively analyzed in the field of brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs); however, its primary objective is classification rather than segmentation. Methods: We propose an innovative algorithm for analyzing task-related EEG microstates based on spatial patterns, Riemannian distance, and a modified deep autoencoder. The objective of this algorithm is to achieve unsupervised segmentation and clustering of task-related EEG signals. Results: The proposed algorithm was validated through experiments conducted on simulated EEG data and two publicly available cognitive task datasets. The evaluation results and statistical tests demonstrate its robustness and efficiency in clustering task-related EEG microstates. Conclusions: The proposed unsupervised algorithm can autonomously discretize EEG signals into a finite number of microstates, thereby facilitating investigations into the temporal structures underlying cognitive processes.</p>

	<p>Background: The spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s gray matter (GM) have been interpreted as representations of neural activity variations. In previous research, white matter (WM) signals, often considered noise, have also been demonstrated to reflect characteristics of functional activity and interactions among different brain regions. Recently, functional gradients have gained significant attention due to their success in characterizing the functional organization of the whole brain. However, previous studies on brain functional gradients have predominantly focused on GM, neglecting valuable functional information within WM. Methods: In this paper, we have elucidated the symmetrical nature of the functional hierarchy in the left and right brain hemispheres in healthy individuals, utilizing the principal functional gradient of the whole-brain WM while also accounting for gender differences. Results: Interestingly, both males and females exhibit a similar degree of asymmetry in their brain regions, albeit with distinct regional variations. Additionally, we have thoroughly examined and analyzed the distribution of functional gradient values in the spatial structure of the corpus callosum (CC) independently, revealing that a simple one-to-one correspondence between structure and function is absent. This phenomenon may be associated with the intricacy of their internal structural connectivity. Conclusions: We suggest that the functional gradients within the WM regions offer a fresh perspective for investigating the structural and functional characteristics of WM and may provide insights into the regulation of neural activity between GM and WM.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive functions are the basis for the development of language skills. Cognitive disorders occur in schizophrenia and may be present even before the first symptoms of psychosis. Language deficits are also mentioned as one of the diagnostic symptoms of this disease. Methods: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database. Articles comparing linguistic and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia were searched for. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, twenty-six original articles were selected. Results: Most studies have observed a partial correlation between language and cognitive deficits. The correlation most often involved some cognitive functions or some components of language assessment. Conclusions: The correlation reported in many studies shows that there is a correlation between language and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. However, numerous studies contradict these reports. It is, therefore, possible that this correlation exists, but not in all patients. Future research should therefore be aimed at identifying in which patients this correlation is present.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disease caused by aberration of chromosome 22 that results in some phenotypic features and developmental disorders. This paper presents a cross-sectional study on speech and communication of Polish children with 22q11DS. Methods: Individuals affected with 22q11DS may show difficulties in functioning, including speech and hearing. Therefore, we prepared a speech development questionnaire and employed it to obtain data from parents (or legal guardians) of 54 children with 22q11DS. The questionnaire covered the following speech and communication development stages: babbling, using first words, first sentences, verbal and non-verbal communication, speech disfluencies, hearing loss, speech intelligibility, difficulties in interpersonal contact, and participation in speech therapy. The obtained answers underwent statistical analysis to verify relationships between the stages of personal development and selected dysfunctions and disorders. Results: In the study group we observed delays in achieving subsequent speech developmental stages and that hearing loss was associated with delays in producing first words. Hearing loss was reported in about a quarter of cases, but a significant proportion of children (55.56%) reported speech disfluencies, which had not been emphasized in previous works, where hearing loss is considered a common co-occurring disorder. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that this may represent a phenomenon associated with 22q11DS that warrants further investigation using standardized tests for assessing disfluencies. Additionally, we observed that speech therapists and caregivers were perceived as not fully aware of the speech development impairments caused by 22q11DS. These preliminary observations point to the need for future studies and increased awareness efforts in this area.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. These symptoms often lead to significant postural deformities and an increased risk of falls, severely impacting the quality of life. Conventional rehabilitation methods have shown benefits, but recent advancements suggest that virtual reality (VR) could offer a promising alternative. This scoping review aims to analyze the current literature to evaluate the effectiveness of VR in the postural rehabilitation of patients with PD. A scientific literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Our selection criteria included studies that compared VR-based rehabilitation to traditional methods regarding posture-related outcomes. We identified and analyzed nine RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The results consistently demonstrated that VR-based rehabilitation leads to greater improvements in balance and gait compared to conventional therapy. Key findings include significant enhancements in balance confidence and postural control and a reduction in fall rates. The superior efficacy of VR-based rehabilitation can be attributed to its engaging and immersive nature, which enhances patient motivation and adherence to therapy. VR allows for precise, repeatable training scenarios tailored to individual patient needs, providing a safe environment to practice and improve motor skills. In conclusion, VR-based rehabilitation represents an innovative approach with substantial potential to improve the quality of life for PD patients. However, limitations such as small sample sizes and short intervention durations in existing studies highlight the need for larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up periods to confirm these findings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive training paradigms rely on the idea that consistent practice can drive neural plasticity, improving not only connectivity within critical brain networks, but also ultimately result in overall enhancement of trained cognitive functions, irrespective of the specific task. Here we opted to investigate the temporal dynamics of neural activity and cognitive performance during a structured cognitive training program. Methods: A group of 20 middle-aged participants completed 20 training sessions over 10 weeks. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) parameters, including alpha and theta power, alpha/theta ratio, and fronto-parietal coherence, were analyzed at four time points to assess changes in neural activity. Results: Results revealed significant overall improvements in the trained task (n-back) performance, without an effect on the untrained task (OSPAN). qEEG analyses showed increased change in posterior (and a less robust in frontal) alpha power, particularly during mid-training, suggesting an improved neural efficiency in regions associated with attentional allocation and task engagement. Theta power remained stable across sessions, indicating a limited influence on neural processes underlying working memory and attentional control. The parietal alpha/theta ratio showed weak increases during mid-training, reflecting subtle shifts in the neural efficacy and cognitive engagement. There were no significant changes in functional connectivity between frontal and parietal locations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive training primarily influences localized neural activity, rather than network-level connectivity. This lack of a longer-range network-level effect might also explain the failure of cognitive training paradigms to induce performance enhancements on the untrained tasks.</p>

	<p>The interaction between Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and sleep deprivation has recently gained attention in the scientific literature, and recent advances suggest that AD epidemiology management should coincide with the management of sleeping disorders. This review focuses on the aspects of the mechanisms underlying the link between AD and insufficient sleep with progressing age. We also provide information which could serve as evidence for future treatments of AD from the early stages in connection with sleep disorder medication.</p>

                <p>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) has revealed new levels of cellular organization and diversity within the human brain. However, full-length mRNA isoforms are not resolved in typical snRNA-seq analyses using short-read sequencing that cannot capture full-length transcripts. Here we combine standard 10x Genomics short-read snRNA-seq with targeted PacBio long-read snRNA-seq to examine isoforms of genes associated with neurological diseases at the single-cell level from prefrontal cortex samples of diseased and nondiseased human brain, assessing over 165,000 cells. Samples from 25 postmortem donors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease (PD), along with age-matched controls, were compared. Analysis of the short-read libraries identified shared and distinct gene expression changes across the diseases. The same libraries were then assayed using enrichment probes to target 50 disease-related genes followed by long-read PacBio sequencing, enabling linkage between cell type and isoform expression. Vast mRNA isoform diversity was observed in all 50 targeted genes, even those that were not differentially expressed in the short-read data. We also developed an informatics method for detection of isoform structural differences in novel isoforms versus the reference annotation. These data expand available single-cell datasets of the human prefrontal cortical transcriptome with combined short- and long-read sequencing across AD, DLB, and PD, revealing increased mRNA isoform diversity that may contribute to disease features and could potentially represent therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Treatment for major depressive disorder (depression) often has partial efficacy and a large portion of patients are treatment resistant. Recent studies implicate reduced somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition in depression, and new pharmacology boosting this inhibition via positive allosteric modulators of α5-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (α5-PAM) offers a promising effective treatment. However, testing the effect of α5-PAM on human brain activity is limited, meriting the use of detailed simulations. We utilized our previous detailed computational models of human depression microcircuits with reduced SST interneuron inhibition and α5-PAM effects, to simulate EEG of individual microcircuits across depression severity and α5-PAM doses. We developed machine learning models that predicted optimal dose from EEG with high accuracy and recovered microcircuit activity and EEG. This study provides dose prediction models for α5-PAM administration based on EEG biomarkers of depression severity. Given limitations in doing the above in the living human brain, the results and tools we developed will facilitate translation of α5-PAM treatment to clinical use.

                <p>by Nyall Jamieson, Christiana Charalambous, David M. Schultz, Ian Hall</p>

Understanding the temporal relationship between key events in an individual’s infection history is crucial for disease control. Delay data between events, such as infection and symptom onset times, is doubly censored because the exact time at which these key events occur is generally unknown. Current mathematical models for delay distributions are derived from heuristic justifications. Here, we derive a new model for delay distributions, specifically for incubation periods, motivated by bacterial-growth dynamics that lead to the Burr family of distributions being a valid modelling choice. We also incorporate methods within these models to account for the doubly censored data. Our approach provides biological justification in the derivation of our delay distribution model, the results of fitting to data highlighting the superiority of the Burr model compared to currently used models when the mode of the distribution is clearly defined or when the distribution tapers off. Under these conditions, our results indicate that the derived Burr distribution is a better-performing model for incubation-period data than currently used methods, with the derived Burr distribution being 13 times more likely to be a better-performing model than the gamma distribution for Legionnaires’ disease based on data from a known outbreak.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In 1979, I joined Jim Ranck's group in Brooklyn and began recording hippocampal neurons. The first project was to record single neurons across three behaviors in different chambers: pellet retrieval on a radial-arm maze, bar-pressing for food reward in an operant chamber, and maternal pup-retrieval in a large home box. We found spatial firing in all three chambers, with a single-neuron's firing pattern unpredictable from one chamber to the next. We interpreted the spatial firing patterns as representing “context.” Later, in the 1980s, I began collaborating with Bob Muller (and Jim Ranck). In the first of a pair of 1987 papers, we used computerized data acquisition, recorded in simple, reduced environments to demonstrate robust, stable place cell firing and the characteristic features of firing fields. In the second paper we showed that when a rat is transferred from one environment to another, the set of place cells “remaps.” “Remapping” was defined later, in a pair of 1990 papers. “Context” was introduced in the early three-behavior experiment but was not discussed in the 1987 papers. What is the true relationship between the biological observation of “remapping” and the psychological concept of “context”? This difficult question is addressed here and in more detail in our recent paper.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with acute stroke, we aimed to identify those who will later develop central post-stroke pain (CPSP) versus those who will not (non-pain sensory stroke [NPSS]) by assessing potential differences in somatosensory profile patterns and evaluating their potential as predictors of CPSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective longitudinal study on 75 acute stroke patients with somatosensory symptoms, we performed quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) in the acute/subacute phase (within 10 days) and on follow-up visits for 12 months. Based on previous QST studies, we hypothesized that QST values of cold detection threshold (CDT) and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) would differ between CPSP and NPSS patients before the onset of pain. Mann–Whitney <i>U</i>-tests and mixed analysis of variances with Bonferroni corrections were performed to compare z-normalized QST scores between both groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 26 patients (34.7%) developed CPSP. In the acute phase, CPSP patients showed contralesional cold hypoesthesia compared to NPSS patients (<i>p</i> = 0.04), but no DMA differences. Additional exploratory analysis showed NPSS patients exhibit cold hyperalgesia on the contralesional side compared to the ipsilesional side, not seen in CPSP patients (<i>p</i> = 0.011). A gradient-boosting approach to predicting CPSP from QST patterns before pain onset had an overall accuracy of 84.6%, with a recall and precision of 75%. Notably, both in the acute and the chronic phase, approximately 80% of CPSP and NPSS patients showed bilateral QST abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cold perception differences between CPSP and NPSS patients appear early post stroke before pain onset. Prediction of CPSP through QST patterns seems feasible. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95488">Impact of the clinically approved BTK inhibitors on the conformation of full-length BTK and analysis of the development of BTK resistance mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib, and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph et al., 2020). Here, we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95988">Unveiling chemotherapy-induced immune landscape remodeling and metabolic reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma by scRNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy is widely used to treat lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients comprehensively. Considering the limitations of chemotherapy due to drug resistance and other issues, it is crucial to explore the impact of chemotherapy and immunotherapy on these aspects. In this study, tumor samples from nine LUAD patients, of which four only received surgery and five received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. In vitro and in vivo assays, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Seahorse assay, and tumor xenograft models, were carried out to validate our findings. A total of 83,622 cells were enrolled for subsequent analyses. The composition of cell types exhibited high heterogeneity across different groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that chemotherapy drove significant metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and macrophages. We identified two subtypes of macrophages: Anti-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+CD86+) and Pro-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+ARG +) and sorted them by flow cytometry. The proportion of Pro-mac cells in LUAD tissues increased significantly after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pro-mac cells promote tumor growth and angiogenesis and also suppress tumor immunity. Moreover, by analyzing the remodeling of T and B cells induced by neoadjuvant therapy, we noted that chemotherapy ignited a relatively more robust immune cytotoxic response toward tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that chemotherapy induces metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment of LUAD, particularly affecting the function and composition of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells. We believe our findings will offer insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide novel therapeutic targets for LUAD in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90029">Three-dimensional single-cell transcriptome imaging of thick tissues</a></h4>

              
                Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) allows genome-scale imaging of RNAs in individual cells in intact tissues. To date, MERFISH has been applied to image thin-tissue samples of ~10 µm thickness. Here, we present a thick-tissue three-dimensional (3D) MERFISH imaging method, which uses confocal microscopy for optical sectioning, deep learning for increasing imaging speed and quality, as well as sample preparation and imaging protocol optimized for thick samples. We demonstrated 3D MERFISH on mouse brain tissue sections of up to 200 µm thickness with high detection efficiency and accuracy. We anticipate that 3D thick-tissue MERFISH imaging will broaden the scope of questions that can be addressed by spatial genomics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96536">A transcription network underlies the dual genomic coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. However, aside from a handful transcription factors regulating specific subsets of mitochondrial genes, the overall architecture of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis remains to be elucidated. The mechanisms coordinating these two genomes are largely unknown. We performed a targeted RNAi screen in developing eyes with reduced mitochondrial DNA content, anticipating a synergistic disruption of tissue development due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deficiency. Among 638 transcription factors annotated in the <i>Drosophila</i> genome, 77 were identified as potential regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Utilizing published ChIP-seq data of positive hits, we constructed a regulatory network revealing the logic of the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple transcription factors in core layers had extensive connections, collectively governing the expression of nearly all mitochondrial genes, whereas factors sitting on the top layer may respond to cellular cues to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis through the underlying network. CG1603, a core component of the network, was found to be indispensable for the expression of most nuclear mitochondrial genes, including those required for mtDNA maintenance and gene expression, thus coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA activities in mitochondrial biogenesis. Additional genetic analyses validated YL-1, a transcription factor upstream of CG1603 in the network, as a regulator controlling CG1603 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97350">Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adapting pathogens and host immunity</a></h4>

              
                As pathogens spread in a population of hosts, immunity is built up, and the pool of susceptible individuals are depleted. This generates selective pressure, to which many human RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, respond with rapid antigenic evolution and frequent emergence of immune evasive variants. However, the host’s immune systems adapt, and older immune responses wane, such that escape variants only enjoy a growth advantage for a limited time. If variant growth dynamics and reshaping of host-immunity operate on comparable time scales, viral adaptation is determined by eco-evolutionary interactions that are not captured by models of rapid evolution in a fixed environment. Here, we use a Susceptible/Infected model to describe the interaction between an evolving viral population in a dynamic but immunologically diverse host population. We show that depending on strain cross-immunity, heterogeneity of the host population, and durability of immune responses, escape variants initially grow exponentially, but lose their growth advantage before reaching high frequencies. Their subsequent dynamics follows an anomalous random walk determined by future escape variants and results in variant trajectories that are unpredictable. This model can explain the apparent contradiction between the clearly adaptive nature of antigenic evolution and the quasi-neutral dynamics of high-frequency variants observed for influenza viruses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98349">Learning enhances behaviorally relevant representations in apical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Learning alters cortical representations and improves perception. Apical tuft dendrites in cortical layer 1, which are unique in their connectivity and biophysical properties, may be a key site of learning-induced plasticity. We used both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy to longitudinally track tuft-wide calcium spikes in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in barrel cortex as mice learned a tactile behavior. Mice were trained to discriminate two orthogonal directions of whisker stimulation. Reinforcement learning, but not repeated stimulus exposure, enhanced tuft selectivity for both directions equally, even though only one was associated with reward. Selective tufts emerged from initially unresponsive or low-selectivity populations. Animal movement and choice did not account for changes in stimulus selectivity. Enhanced selectivity persisted even after rewards were removed and animals ceased performing the task. We conclude that learning produces long-lasting realignment of apical dendrite tuft responses to behaviorally relevant dimensions of a task.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97228">N-acetylation of α-synuclein enhances synaptic vesicle clustering mediated by α-synuclein and lysophosphatidylcholine</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we reported that α-synuclein (α-syn) clusters synaptic vesicles (SV) Diao et al., 2013, and neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) can mediate this clustering Lai et al., 2023. Meanwhile, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α-syn such as acetylation and phosphorylation play important yet distinct roles in regulating α-syn conformation, membrane binding, and amyloid aggregation. However, how PTMs regulate α-syn function in presynaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, based on our previous findings, we further demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation, which occurs under physiological conditions and is irreversible in mammalian cells, significantly enhances the functional activity of α-syn in clustering SVs. Mechanistic studies reveal that this enhancement is caused by the N-acetylation-promoted insertion of α-syn’s N-terminus and increased intermolecular interactions on the LPC-containing membrane. N-acetylation in our work is shown to fine-tune the interaction between α-syn and LPC, mediating α-syn’s role in synaptic vesicle clustering.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102667">Target protein identification in live cells and organisms with a non-diffusive proximity tagging system</a></h4>

              
                Identifying target proteins for bioactive molecules is essential for understanding their mechanisms, developing improved derivatives, and minimizing off-target effects. Despite advances in target identification (target-ID) technologies, significant challenges remain, impeding drug development. Most target-ID methods use cell lysates, but maintaining an intact cellular context is vital for capturing specific drug–protein interactions, such as those with transient protein complexes and membrane-associated proteins. To address these limitations, we developed POST-IT (Pup-On-target for Small molecule Target Identification Technology), a non-diffusive proximity tagging system for live cells, orthogonal to the eukaryotic system. POST-IT utilizes an engineered fusion of proteasomal accessory factor A and HaloTag to transfer Pup to proximal proteins upon directly binding to the small molecule. After significant optimization to eliminate self-pupylation and polypupylation, minimize depupylation, and optimize chemical linkers, POST-IT successfully identified known targets and discovered a new binder, SEPHS2, for dasatinib, and VPS37C as a new target for hydroxychloroquine, enhancing our understanding these drugs’ mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrated the application of POST-IT in live zebrafish embryos, highlighting its potential for broad biological research and drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100011">Passive accumulation of alkaloids in inconspicuously colored frogs refines the evolutionary paradigm of acquired chemical defenses</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92741">TIPE drives a cancer stem-like phenotype by promoting glycolysis via PKM2/HIF-1α axis in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                TIPE (<i>TNFAIP8</i>) has been identified as an oncogene and participates in tumor biology. However, how its role in the metabolism of tumor cells during melanoma development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TIPE promoted glycolysis by interacting with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in melanoma. We found that TIPE-induced PKM2 dimerization, thereby facilitating its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. TIPE-mediated PKM2 dimerization consequently promoted HIF-1α activation and glycolysis, which contributed to melanoma progression and increased its stemness features. Notably, TIPE specifically phosphorylated PKM2 at Ser 37 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Consistently, the expression of TIPE was positively correlated with the levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in melanoma tissues from clinical samples and tumor bearing mice. In summary, our findings indicate that the TIPE/PKM2/HIF-1α signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in promoting CSC properties by facilitating the glycolysis, which would provide a promising therapeutic target for melanoma intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95106">Telomere length sensitive regulation of interleukin receptor 1 type 1 (IL1R1) by the shelterin protein TRF2 modulates immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Telomeres are crucial for cancer progression. Immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment has been shown to be very important in cancer prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which telomeres might affect tumour immune response remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that interleukin-1 signalling is telomere-length dependent in cancer cells. Mechanistically, non-telomeric TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) binding at the IL-1-receptor type-1 (IL1R1) promoter was found to be affected by telomere length. Enhanced TRF2 binding at the <i>IL1R1</i> promoter in cells with short telomeres directly recruited the histone-acetyl-transferase (HAT) p300, and consequent H3K27 acetylation activated IL1R1. This altered NF-kappa B signalling and affected downstream cytokines like <i>IL6, IL8,</i> and <i>TNF</i>. Further, <i>IL1R1</i> expression was telomere-sensitive in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) clinical samples. Infiltration of tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) was also sensitive to the length of tumour cell telomeres and highly correlated with <i>IL1R1</i> expression. The use of both IL1 Receptor antagonist (IL1RA) and <i>IL1R1</i> targeting ligands could abrogate M2 macrophage infiltration in TNBC tumour organoids. In summary, using TNBC cancer tissue (&gt;90 patients), tumour-derived organoids, cancer cells, and xenograft tumours with either long or short telomeres, we uncovered a heretofore undeciphered function of telomeres in modulating IL1 signalling and tumour immunity.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs) that significantly impact patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the application of brain stimulation techniques, including non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), as well as invasive approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explore the efficacy and safety profiles of these techniques in alleviating both motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, depression, and impulse control disorders. Current findings indicate that while non-invasive techniques present a favorable safety profile and are effective for milder symptoms, invasive methods like DBS provide significant relief for severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Future research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, establish robust clinical protocols, and expand the application of these technologies across various stages of PD. This review underscores the potential of brain stimulation as a vital therapeutic tool in managing PD, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: Spatial working memory is crucial for processing visual and spatial information, serving as a foundation for complex cognitive tasks. However, the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on its dynamics and underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the specific trends and neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory alterations during 36 h of acute sleep deprivation. Methods: Twenty participants underwent a 36 h protocol of acute sleep deprivation. Utilizing the spatial 2-back task for assessing spatial working memory, combined with event-related potential (ERP) technology, we compared behavioral and neural responses at four critical time points&amp;amp;mdash;before deprivation, and after 12, 24, and 36 h of sleep deprivation&amp;amp;mdash;to uncover dynamic cognitive changes. Results: The findings indicate that the impact of sleep deprivation on spatial working memory exhibits significant temporal dependence. After 24 h of deprivation, both behavioral performance and ERP component amplitudes showed significant declines. During the period from 24 to 36 h, the amplitudes of the P2, N2, and P3 components exhibited a recovery trend, potentially reflecting neural compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: The impact of 36 h acute sleep deprivation on spatial working memory is characterized by time-dependent and phase-specific effects. Initially, sleep deprivation leads to severe cognitive depletion, followed by an adaptive compensatory phase where neural mechanisms may partially restore function. These findings highlight the non-linear nature of cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation, involving complex self-regulatory and compensatory mechanisms, with implications for understanding cognitive resilience and adaptive processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic adults are more likely to be unemployed compared to neurotypical adults and those with disability. To address these poorer employment outcomes, it is important to consider factors that may be impacting on autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; employment outcomes. Anxiety is a common co-occurring condition for autistic adults; however, there is little research on how anxiety affects or influences autistic people&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience across the employment-seeking process. The aim of this study was to explore whether anxiety is perceived to affect autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to engage in employment-seeking tasks. Methods: Online, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 autistic adults (22&amp;amp;ndash;52 years) who were actively seeking employment or had sought employment in the last 18 months. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were generated from the data analysis. Theme 1, Finding the &amp;amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;amp;rdquo;, identified some level of anxiety&amp;amp;mdash;but not too much&amp;amp;mdash;was helpful in performing the employment-seeking tasks and this &amp;amp;ldquo;spot&amp;amp;rdquo; could vary depending on the person and the task. Theme 2, Anxiety affects the ability to perform and function, encapsulates the autistic person&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience when anxiety is too high. The third theme, The &amp;amp;ldquo;vicious cycle&amp;amp;rdquo; of anxiety and employment-seeking behaviours, explores participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ongoing experience of anxiety on their employment-seeking behaviours. Conclusions: The findings suggest that autistic job candidates would benefit from tailored accommodations and adjustments offered throughout the recruitment process, to reduce anxiety and improve employment-seeking outcomes for autistic candidates.</p>

	<p>Brain connectivity analysis plays a crucial role in unraveling the complex network dynamics of the human brain, providing insights into cognitive functions, behaviors, and neurological disorders. Traditional graph-theoretical methods, while foundational, often fall short in capturing the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of brain connectivity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful approach for this purpose, with the potential to improve diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized interventions. This review examines recent studies leveraging GNNs in brain connectivity analysis, focusing on key methodological advancements in multimodal data integration, dynamic connectivity, and interpretability across various imaging modalities, including fMRI, MRI, DTI, PET, and EEG. Findings reveal that GNNs excel in modeling complex, non-linear connectivity patterns and enable the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities to provide richer insights into both healthy and pathological brain networks. However, challenges remain, particularly in interpretability, data scarcity, and multimodal integration, limiting the full clinical utility of GNNs. Addressing these limitations through enhanced interpretability, optimized multimodal techniques, and expanded labeled datasets is crucial to fully harness the potential of GNNs for neuroscience research and clinical applications.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire version 2 (SSSQ2) is a brief clinical tool with six items designed to be used (1) as a measure for severity of sound sensitivity symptoms in general (based on its total score) and (2) as a checklist to screen different forms of sound sensitivity. The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SSSQ2. Method: This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 451 people completed the online survey. A total of 154 people completed the survey twice with a two-week interval to establish test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. The average age of the participants was 36.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the SSSQ2 is a one-factor questionnaire. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; was 0.80. The test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability was good for the total SSSQ2 score and was moderate for the sum of items 1 and 3 (indicating loudness hyperacusis), item 2 (for pain hyperacusis), item 4 (for misophonia), item 5 (for fear hyperacusis), and item 6 (for noise sensitivity). The minimum amount of change that constitutes a true change in the total SSSQ2 score is &amp;amp;ge;5 points. Conclusions: The SSSQ2 can be used in clinical practice or research setting to measure the severity of general sound sensitivity as a one-factor questionnaire with acceptable internal consistency and good reliability. In addition, the individual items in the SSSQ2 can be used as a checklist to screen for various forms of sound sensitivity.</p>

	<p>Background/objectives: Negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders are related to impaired social functioning and lower quality of life, making accurate assessment important. To date, most tools for assessing negative symptoms are observational, which can be influenced by the raters&amp;amp;rsquo; experience and opinion. Self-rating scales, like the Self-Evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS), could complement observer ratings by adding information from the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s perspective. Here, we aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dutch translation of the SNS and the relationship between the SNS and functional outcomes. Methods: The SNS was added to the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring Outcome Survey (PHAMOUS)-protocol for adults with a DSM-5 classification of a disorder in the psychosis spectrum. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the construct validity of the five subscales of the SNS. Correlational analyses were performed between the SNS and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Health of Nation Outcomes Scales (HoNOS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Functional Remission tool (FR) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (ManSA). Results: A total of 247 patients participated in this study. Internal consistency was good (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.87). CFA confirmed the five-factor structure of the SNS. The SNS was significantly correlated (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) with the PANSS positive (r = 0.31), PANSS negative (r = 0.33), HoNOS (r = 0.37), FR (r = 0.27) and the ManSA (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.40). Conclusions: The Dutch SNS shows good psychometric properties and is related to functional outcomes and quality of life. The SNS can be valuable in complementing current observational-based instruments, and future research may investigate whether the SNS can be used as a standalone measurement tool for the assessment of negative symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0209-24.2024?rss=1">Minimal Variation in Functional Connectivity in Relation to Daily Affect</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reported associations between functional connectivity and affective disorder symptoms are minimally reproducible, which can partially be attributed to difficulty capturing highly variable clinical symptoms in cross-sectional study designs. "Dense sampling" protocols, where participants are sampled across multiple sessions, can overcome this limitation by studying associations between functional connectivity and variable clinical states. Here, we characterized effect sizes for the association between functional connectivity and time-varying positive and negative daily affect in a nonclinical cohort. Data were analyzed from 24 adults who attended four research visits, where participants self-reported daily affect using the PANAS-X questionnaire and completed 39&nbsp;min of functional magnetic resonance imaging across three passive viewing conditions. We modeled positive and negative daily affect in relation to network-level functional connectivity, with hypotheses regarding within-network connectivity of the default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks and between-network connectivity of affective subcortical regions (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with both default mode and salience/cingulo-opercular networks. Effect sizes for associations between affect and network-level functional connectivity were small and nonsignificant across analyses. We additionally report that functional connectivity variance is largely attributable to individual identity with small relative variance (&lt;3%) accounted for by within-subject daily affect variation. These results support previous reports that functional connectivity is dominated by stable subject-specific connectivity patterns, while additionally suggesting relatively minimal influence of day-to-day affect. Researchers planning studies examining functional connectivity in relation to daily affect, or other varying stable states, should therefore anticipate small effect sizes and carefully consider power in study planning.</p>

                <p>Preterm infants are at risk for brain injury and neurodevelopmental impairment due, in part, to white matter injury following chronic hypoxia exposure. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which neonatal hypoxia disrupts early neurodevelopment are poorly understood. Here, we constructed a brain-wide map of the regenerative response to newborn brain injury using high-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics to analyze over 800,000 cells in a mouse model of chronic neonatal hypoxia. Additionally, we developed a new method for inferring condition-associated differences in cell type spatial proximity, enabling the identification of niche-specific changes in cellular architecture. We observed hypoxia-associated changes in region-specific cell states, cell type composition, and spatial organization. Importantly, our analysis revealed mechanisms underlying reparative neurogenesis and gliogenesis, while also nominating pathways that may impede circuit rewiring following neonatal hypoxia. Altogether, our work provides a comprehensive description of the molecular response to newborn brain injury.</p>

Diagnosing cancer subtypes is a prerequisite for precise treatment. Existing multi-omics data fusion-based diagnostic solutions build on the requisite of sufficient samples with complete multi-omics data, which is challenging to obtain in clinical applications. To address the bottleneck of collecting sufficient samples with complete data in clinical applications, we proposed a flexible integrative model (CancerSD) to diagnose cancer subtype using limited samples with incomplete multi-omics data. CancerSD designs contrastive learning tasks and masking-and-reconstruction tasks to reliably impute missing omics, and fuses available omics data with the imputed ones to accurately diagnose cancer subtypes. To address the issue of limited clinical samples, it introduces a category-level contrastive loss to extend the meta-learning framework, effectively transferring knowledge from external datasets to pretrain the diagnostic model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CancerSD not only gives accurate diagnosis, but also maintains a high authenticity and good interpretability. In addition, CancerSD identifies important molecular characteristics associated with cancer subtypes, and it defines the Integrated CancerSD Score that can serve as an independent predictive factor for patient prognosis.

                <p>by Rosalind Wenshan Pan, Tom Röschinger, Kian Faizi, Hernan G. Garcia, Rob Phillips</p>

For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRAs, we need a “theory of the experiment” to help us better understand the impact of various biological and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. These parameters include binding site copy number, where a large number of specific binding sites may titrate away transcription factors, as well as the presence of overlapping binding sites, which may affect analysis of the degree of mutual dependence between mutations in the regulatory region and expression levels. To that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic gene expression outputs for bacterial promoters using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics (information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the output of MPRAs and thus to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for developing a theory of transcription, but also for exploring regulatory evolution.

                <p>by Tal Gutman, Tamir Tuller</p>

The P-glycoprotein efflux pump, encoded by the <i>MDR1</i> gene, is an ATP-driven transporter capable of expelling a diverse array of compounds from cells. Overexpression of this protein is implicated in the multi-drug resistant phenotype observed in various cancers. Numerous studies have attempted to decipher the impact of genetic variants within <i>MDR1</i> on P-glycoprotein expression, functional activity, and clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Among these, three specific single nucleotide polymorphisms—<i>T1236C</i>, <i>T2677G</i>, and <i>T3435C</i> - have been the focus of extensive research efforts, primarily through in vitro cell line models and clinical cohort analyses. However, the findings from these studies have been remarkably contradictory. In this study, we employ a computational, data-driven approach to systematically evaluate the effects of these three variants on principal stages of the gene expression process. Leveraging current knowledge of gene regulatory mechanisms, we elucidate potential mechanisms by which these variants could modulate P-glycoprotein levels and function. Our findings suggest that all three variants significantly change the mRNA folding in their vicinity. This change in mRNA structure is predicted to increase local translation elongation rates, but not to change the protein expression. Nonetheless, the increased translation rate near <i>T3435C</i> is predicted to affect the protein’s co-translational folding trajectory in the region of the second ATP binding domain. This potentially impacts P-glycoprotein conformation and function. Our study demonstrates the value of computational approaches in elucidating the functional consequences of genetic variants. This framework provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of <i>MDR1</i> variants and their potential impact on cancer prognosis and treatment resistance. Furthermore, we introduce an approach which can be systematically applied to identify mutations potentially affecting mRNA folding in pathology. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on both ClinVar and TCGA and identify hundreds of disease related variants that modify mRNA folding at essential positions.

                <p>by Nikoleta E. Glynatsi, Vincent Knight, Marc Harper</p>

Researchers have explored the performance of Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma strategies for decades, from the celebrated performance of Tit for Tat to the introduction of the zero-determinant strategies and the use of sophisticated learning structures such as neural networks. Many new strategies have been introduced and tested in a variety of tournaments and population dynamics. Typical results in the literature, however, rely on performance against a small number of somewhat arbitrarily selected strategies, casting doubt on the generalizability of conclusions. In this work, we analyze a large collection of 195 strategies in thousands of computer tournaments, present the top performing strategies across multiple tournament types, and distill their salient features. The results show that there is not yet a single strategy that performs well in diverse Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma scenarios, nevertheless there are several properties that heavily influence the best performing strategies. This refines the properties described by Axelrod in light of recent and more diverse opponent populations to: be nice, be provocable and generous, be a little envious, be clever, and adapt to the environment. More precisely, we find that strategies perform best when their probability of cooperation matches the total tournament population’s aggregate cooperation probabilities. The features of high performing strategies help cast some light on why strategies such as Tit For Tat performed historically well in tournaments and why zero-determinant strategies typically do not fare well in tournament settings.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging is crucial in quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and thereby making an endovascular treatment (EVT) after large vessel occlusion. However, CTP is prone to overestimating the ischemic core. We sought to delineate the optimal regional CBF (rCBF) thresholds of pre-EVT CTP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected acute ischemic stroke patients due to large vessel occlusion who achieved successful recanalization with baseline CTP, immediate post-EVT diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 3 hours, and delayed post-EVT DWI between 24 and 196 hours. Core volumes estimated by CTP at various rCBF thresholds were validated against immediate and delayed DWI lesion volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 175 acute large vessel occlusion patients were included. Baseline CTP was taken in a median of 24 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 21–31 minutes) after arrival; after the CTP, groin puncture in a median of 37 minutes (IQR 28–52 minutes), immediate post-EVT DWI scans in a median of 1.6 hours (IQR 0.8–2.1 hours), and delayed DWI scans in a median of 89 hours (IQR 69–106 hours). The correlations between the rCBF thresholds were the best at rCBF &lt;22% for immediate DWI (0.64; 95% CI 0.55–0.73) and at rCBF &lt;30% for delayed DWI (0.69; 95% CI 0.61–0.76). The interval between CTP and recanalization was inversely correlated with the overestimation of ischemic core volume compared with the subsequent DWI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Optimal rCBF thresholds for estimating ischemic core using CTP depend significantly on the timing of DWI post-EVT and CTP to recanalization delay. The optimal rCBF thresholds for ischemic core estimation may vary depending on the clinical setting. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In keeping with the historical focus of this special issue of Hippocampus, this paper reviews the history of my development of the SPEAR model. The SPEAR model proposes that separate phases of encoding and retrieval (SPEAR) allow effective storage of multiple overlapping associative memories in the hippocampal formation and other cortical structures. The separate phases for encoding and retrieval are proposed to occur within different phases of theta rhythm with a cycle time on the order of 125 ms. The same framework applies to the slower transition between encoding and consolidation dynamics regulated by acetylcholine. The review includes description of the experimental data on acetylcholine and theta rhythm that motivated this model, the realization that existing associative memory models require these different dynamics, and the subsequent experimental data supporting these dynamics. The review also includes discussion of my work on the encoding of episodic memories as spatiotemporal trajectories, and some personal description of the episodic memories from my own spatiotemporal trajectory as I worked on this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23668?af=R">The Anatomy of Context</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For most of my career, I focused on understanding how and where spatial context, the place where things happen, is represented in the brain. My interest in this began in the early 1990's, during my postdoctoral training with David Amaral, when we defined the rodent homolog of the primate parahippocampal cortex, a region implicated in processing spatial and contextual information. We parceled out the caudal portion of the rat perirhinal cortex (PER) and called it the postrhinal cortex (POR). In my own lab at Brown University, I continued to study the anatomy of the PER, POR, and entorhinal cortices. I also began to characterize and differentiate the functions of these regions, particularly the newly defined POR and the redefined PER. Our electrophysiological and behavioral evidence supports a view of POR function that aligns with our anatomical evidence. Briefly, the POR integrates object and feature information from the PER with spatial information from the retrosplenial, posterior parietal, and secondary visual cortices and the pulvinar and uses this information to represent specific environmental contexts, including the spatial arrangement of objects and features within each context. In addition to maintaining a representation of the current context, the POR plays an attentional role by continually monitoring the context for changes and updating the context representation when changes occur. This context representation is accessible to other regions for cognitive processes, including binding life events with context to form episodic memories, guiding context-relevant behavior, and recognizing objects within scenes and contexts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23677?af=R">Towards an Understanding of the Dentate Gyrus Hilus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For many years, the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) was a mystery because anatomical data suggested a bewildering array of cells without clear organization. Moreover, some of the anatomical information led to more questions than answers. For example, it had been identified that one of the major cell types in the hilus, the mossy cell, innervates granule cells (GCs). However, mossy cells also targeted local GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, it was not yet clear if mossy cells were glutamatergic or GABAergic. This led to many debates about the role of mossy cells. However, it was clear that hilar neurons, including mossy cells, were likely to have very important functions because they provided strong input to GCs. Hilar neurons also attracted attention in epilepsy because pathological studies showed that hilar neurons were often lost, but GCs remained. Vulnerability of hilar neurons also occurred after traumatic brain injury and ischemia. These observations fueled an interest to understand hilar neurons and protect them, an interest that continues to this day. This article provides a historical and personal perspective into the ways that I sought to contribute to resolving some of the debates and moving the field forward. Despite several technical challenges the outcomes of the studies have been worth the effort with some surprising findings along the way. Given the growing interest in the hilus, and the advent of multiple techniques to selectively manipulate hilar neurons, there is a great opportunity for future research.</p>

                In pancreatic cancer, significant alterations occur in the local nervous system, including axonogenesis, neural remodeling, perineural invasion, and perineural neuritis. Pancreatic cancer can impact the central nervous system (CNS) through cancer cell-intrinsic factors or systemic factors, particularly in the context of cancer cachexia. These peripheral and central neuropathic changes exert substantial influence on cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is common in pancreatic cancer, causing peripheral nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction. Targeting the crosstalk between pancreatic cancer and the nervous system, either peripherally or centrally, holds promise in cancer treatment, pain relief, and improved quality of life. Here, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms behind these neuropathic changes in pancreatic cancer and discuss potential intervention strategies.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative technology with the potential to transform digital experiences, particularly in relation to mental health concerns such as anxiety. Therefore, this study investigates the potential of a newly designed VR experience to alleviate anxiety by focusing on the mediating role of VR-induced immersion. Methods: The study included 419 individuals aged 10 to 80 years, with 29 aged 10&amp;amp;ndash;15 years and 390 above 15 years, who were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups on the basis of project-defined criteria, including a random allocation to the wheelchair-using group. Both groups used goggles for virtual space navigation, with the experimental group employing a multijoint arm mounted on an aluminum frame and special algorithms to navigate without controllers. We assessed immersion in VR using the Polish adaptation of the Immersion Questionnaire and anxiety using the Polish adaptations of the State&amp;amp;ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X1) and its early adolescent version, the State&amp;amp;ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory&amp;amp;ndash;Children (STAI-C1). Results and Conclusions: The results indicate that individuals using the new VR device demonstrated increased immersion and reduced post-test anxiety levels, highlighting the significance of immersion in enhancing positive affect, mitigating the negative effects of VR technology, and offering insights for future development and refinement of VR solutions.</p>

	<p>Introduction. In women, smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period has important consequences for maternal and infant health, and interventions to assist smoking cessation during this period are essential. Although smoking has been associated with the presence of mental health problems, few studies addressing the factors associated with perinatal smoking have examined the role of stress. The aim of this review was to identify the relationships between the presence of stress and smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Method. A literature search of the PsycInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science databases was carried out to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and June 2024. A total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for review. Results. Twelve of the studies analysed the relationship between stress and smoking during pregnancy, two studies involved the postpartum period, and one study included both periods. Diverse instruments were used to assess stress, although the PSS-14 was the most commonly used. Eleven of the studies found a relationship between stress and smoking in the perinatal period, with stress being a predictor of smoking. Conclusions. The findings highlight the need to consider stress management when developing effective interventions to help women quit smoking during pregnancy and maintain abstinence in the postpartum period.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous research indicates that Ginkgo biloba extract (Gbe) may contribute to slowing down the progression of dementia. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association between Gbe prescriptions and the progression of dementia severity in a real-world setting. Methods: This study was conducted using data from patients with an initial diagnosis of mild or moderate dementia between January 2005 and December 2022 from the IQVIA&amp;amp;trade; Disease Analyzer database. The follow-up period was up to 10 years. The association between Gbe prescription and dementia severity progression was assessed by Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analysis and Cox regression, with adjustments made for age, sex, health insurance status, physician specialty, co-prescription of antidementia drugs, and co-diagnoses. Results: A total of 4765 patients were included, of whom 177 were prescribed Gbe. The cumulative incidence of dementia severity progression was 12.7% for patients with Gbe prescription and 22.1% for those without. Gbe prescription was associated with a significantly decreased risk of dementia severity progression (hazard ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27&amp;amp;ndash;0.95), both in patients with mild (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22&amp;amp;ndash;0.90) and moderate dementia (HR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.98). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that Gbe prescription is associated with a reduced risk of dementia severity progression in a real-world setting.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Cognitive dysfunctions are still very common in the chronic phase of stroke when patients are discharged from neurorehabilitation centers. Even individuals who appear to have made a full clinical recovery may exhibit new deficiencies at home. Here, we present evidence of a novel kind of therapy at home aimed at contrasting the heterogenic evolution of stroke patients using a multidomain cognitive approach. Methods: Eighteen ischemic stroke patients were assessed in a within-subject longitudinal design (age 62.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.1 years; eight men). Patients underwent the Tele-NeuroRehabilitation (TNR) multidomain cognitive training treatment using the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) five times a week for 1 h sessions for four consecutive weeks. The protocol included the stimulation of specific cognitive functions, such as logical skills, praxis skills, attention, executive functions, memory, space time orientation and perception, and speech therapy. To determine neuropsychological changes, patients were evaluated before the sessions (T0), at the end of the sessions (T1), and after six months (T2). Results: The multidomain cognitive training induced a significant improvement in the working memory and language abilities as well as depression symptoms and alleviated caregiver burden. Most of this cognitive enhancement persisted after six months (T2), with the exception of depression symptoms. Otherwise, a significant decline in attention abilities was reported, thus demonstrating a lack of effect in this function. Conclusions: Our results suggest that multidomain cognitive TNR is a suitable protocol for reducing some cognitive and behavioral alterations in patients with strokes, with a beneficial impact also on the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden distress management. Further RCTs are warranted to validate this new kind of approach.</p>

	<p>Background: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVAs) have several risk factors that are categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Periodontal diseases (PD) have a modifiable role in causing CVA, where several studies suggested direct or indirect correlations with systemic diseases. This study aims to summarize, evaluate and analyze all the evidence available in literature, to reach a better understanding of the relation between periodontitis, gingivitis, tooth loss and CVA. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for all meta-analyses assessing the effect of PD on CVA in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for umbrella reviews in March 2024. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used for quality assessment. Pooled analysis was performed to assess the effect of periodontitis, gingivitis and tooth loss on CVA, depending on the availability of data using Review Manager Version 5.2.11. Results: Seven of the identified meta-analyses were of high quality, and they were distributed in different countries. Periodontitis was generally associated with a significant increase in CVA risk (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.70, 3.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001 and RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.15&amp;amp;ndash;1.29, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001), same as tooth loss, but to a lower degree (0.78). However, the effect of gingivitis was insignificant in terms of CVA (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.56, p = 0.0008). Conclusions: This study confirms the effect of periodontitis and tooth loss on CVA, disregarding any significant role for gingivitis. The relation reached favors the suggested role of some inflammatory changes in the pathogenic pathway leading to atherosclerotic changes.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Remote identification of individuals with severe hyposmia may enable scalable recruitment of participants with underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation. We evaluated the performance of a staged screening paradigm using remote smell testing to enrich for abnormal dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (DAT-SPECT) and alpha-synuclein aggregation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) recruited participants for the prodromal cohort who were 60-years and older without a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Participants were invited to complete a University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) independently through an online portal. Hyposmic participants were invited to complete DAT-SPECT, which determined eligibility for enrollment in longitudinal assessments and further biomarker evaluation including cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (aSynSAA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As of January 29, 2024, 49,843 participants were sent an UPSIT and 31,293 (63%) completed it. Of UPSIT completers, 8,301 (27%) scored &lt;15th percentile. Of 1,546 who completed DAT-SPECT, 1,060 (69%) had DAT-SPECT binding &lt;100% expected for age and sex. Participants with an UPSIT &lt;10th percentile (n = 1,221) had greater likelihood of low DAT-SPECT binding compared to participants with an UPSIT in the 10th to 15th percentile (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85–4.91). Overall, 55% (198/363) of cases with UPSIT &lt;15th percentile and DAT-SPECT &lt;100% had positive aSynSAA, which increased to 70% (182/260) when selecting for more severe hyposmia (UPSIT &lt;10th percentile).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote screening for hyposmia and reduced DAT-SPECT binding identifies participants with a high proportion positive aSynSAA. Longitudinal data will be essential to define progression patterns in these individuals to ultimately inform recruitment into disease modification clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As requested by the editors of this special issue of Hippocampus on Scientific Histories of Hippocampal Research, this review provides a detailed personal perspective and historical background on the research involved in a number of findings. The review includes description of the development of the water maze and its use in providing evidence to support the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory function. The review also describes how the water maze was then used in further work to support the proposal that NMDA-dependent synaptic modification in the hippocampus mediates the encoding of new spatial memories. This personal history gives a perspective on the convergence of different streams of physiological, biochemical, theoretical and behavioral research that resulted in these findings on hippocampal function.</p>

Their results suggest that death-prone effector and survival-prone memory cells coexist in each subset at the peak of the response, after which the memory cells live and the effector cells perish.

                Zhou et al. reveal that microtopography regulates nuclear tension, driving site-specific chromatin accessibility and lineage-specific gene expression. Aligned substrates open neurogenic, myogenic, and tenogenic genes, while random substrates enhance osteogenic and chondrogenic gene accessibility. This study offers a novel framework for understanding how microtopographic cues shape stem cell fate.

	<p>Background/Objectives: &amp;amp;alpha;-Synuclein (&amp;amp;alpha;-syn) protein is a major pathological agent of familial Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and its levels and aggregations determine neurotoxicity in PD pathogenesis. Although the pathophysiological functions of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn have been extensively studied, its biological functions remain elusive, and there are reports of wild-type (WT) &amp;amp;alpha;-syn and two missense mutations of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn (A30P and A53T) inducing protective neuritogenesis through neurite outgrowth. However, the function of another &amp;amp;alpha;-syn mutation, E46K, has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we compared the effect of E46K &amp;amp;alpha;-syn with other types to identify the mechanisms underlying neurite outgrowth. Methods: We transfected SK-N-SH cells with WT and mutant (A53T and E46K) &amp;amp;alpha;-syn to investigate the effects of their overexpression on neurite outgrowth. Then, we compared the differential effects of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn on neurite outgrowth using microscopic analysis, including confocal microscopy. We also analyzed the differential regulation of cell division control 42 effector protein 2 (Cdc42EP2) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Finally, to confirm the implication of neurite outgrowth, we knocked down Cdc42EP2 using small interfering RNA. Results: Unlike WT and A53T &amp;amp;alpha;-syn, E46K &amp;amp;alpha;-syn failed to promote neurite outgrowth by not inducing Cdc42EP2 and subsequent &amp;amp;beta;III-tubulin expression. Cdc42EP2 knockdown impaired neurite outgrowth in WT and A53T &amp;amp;alpha;-syn transfectants. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that WT and mutant &amp;amp;alpha;-syn are linked to Cdc42EP2 production in neuritogenesis, implying &amp;amp;alpha;-syn involvement in the physiological function of axon growth and synapse formation. Thus, &amp;amp;alpha;-syn may be a potential therapeutic target for PD.</p>

	<p>Background: Motor imagery includes visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery, which are two strategies that exist for mental rotation and are currently widely studied. However, different mental rotation tests can lead to different strategic performances. There are also many research results where two different strategies appear simultaneously under the same task. Previous studies on the comparative brain mechanisms of kinesthetic imagery and visual imagery have not adopted consistent stimulus images or mature mental rotation paradigms, making it difficult to effectively compare these types of imagery. Methods: In this study, we utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the brain activation of sixty-seven young right-handed participants with different strategy preferences during hand lateral judgment tasks (HLJT). Results: The results showed that the accuracy of the kinesthetic imagery group was significantly higher than that of the visual imagery group, and the reaction time of the kinesthetic imagery group was significantly shorter than that of the visual imagery group. The areas significantly activated in the kinesthetic imagery group were wider than those in the visual imagery group, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9, 46), premotor cortex (BA6), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary motor cortex (BA4), and parietal cortex (BA7, 40). It is worth noting that the activation levels in the frontal eye fields (BA8), primary somatosensory cortex (BA1, 2, 3), primary motor cortex (BA4), and parietal cortex (BA40) of the kinesthetic imagery group were significantly higher than those in the visual imagery group. Conclusion: Therefore, we speculate that kinesthetic imagery has more advantages than visual imagery in the mental rotation of egocentric transformations.</p>

	<p>Background: Prolonged confinement in enclosed environments has raised concerns about its effects on both physical and mental health. Although increased rates of depression or anxiety during COVID-19 lockdowns have been reported, the effects of short-term restrictions on social activities and physical on brain function and structure remain poorly known. Methods: This study explored longitudinal changes in brain gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) immediately after and four months following a short-term lockdown in comparison to pre-lockdown conditions. MRI data were collected from 20 participants before the lockdown, from 29 participants (14 original, 15 new) two months post-lockdown, and from 27 out of the 29 participants four months post-lifting of the lockdown. Results: Results showed significant GMV reductions in the right gyrus rectus and cuneus post-lockdown, with further reductions observed four months after lifting the restrictions, affecting additional brain regions. Longitudinal FC trajectories revealed decreased connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and sensorimotor/attention networks post-lockdown, and recovery after four months post-lifting of the lockdown. Conclusions: The observed plasticity in brain FC indicates substantial recovery potential with the potential long-term effect of structural changes. Our findings offer insights into the effects of isolation on the human brain, potentially informing rehabilitation mechanisms and interventions for individuals in similar conditions.</p>

                VAPB is an adaptor protein known for its role as an anchor for other proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum. A mutant form of VAPB has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the underlying mechanisms resulting from this defect are studied by researchers in this area to uncover its implication in the disease. Here we have characterized six VAPB commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                The past decade has been marked by increased discussions on sustainability; some of the prominent accelerators being, mounting natural disasters, vocal climate activism, and the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interest has crossed over from deliberations in global summits to grassroots-level communication. Additionally, the literature points to the increasing usage of social media in the communication of sustainability with an increase of interest in this area among Asian researchers. This paper aims to understand the direction of sustainability communication and the usage of social media in the communication of sustainability, in the last decade (2013-2023), from an Asian perspective – researchers and respondents from Asia. A comprehensive search of the literature by Asian researchers on sustainability communication on social media in the past decade was conducted using the Scopus database. The studies were clustered around common directions and terminologies, basis an in-depth content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study presents prominent themes and the current direction of research in sustainability communication on social media. The studies analyzed in the scoping review affirm that sustainability communication on social media in Asia has substantial potential to improve the environmental awareness of the public and promote actual pro-environmental behavior both in terms of green purchase as well as conservation behavior. The review provides a holistic view of the recent trends and possible future directions for sustainability communication on social media.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 55.4% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 19.3% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Background Death due to hanging is commonly seen. Sometime the ligature mark will be very prominent and in some cases it might not. In those cases, the post-mortem examination with its gross morphological findings and histopathological analysis, becomes significantly important. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of epidemiological, gross morphological, and histopathological features in hanging cases. Methods The study was conducted on 46 cases of hanging. Their sociodemographic features were collected. Gross morphological analysis of the ligature mark and various measurements were taken. Later tissue from the ligature mark was sent for histopathological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected parameters. Results Significant male preponderance was observed in hanging cases. The maximum number of cases of hanging were observed in the fourth decade of life. Daily wage workers were the most significantly affected population. Depression was cited as the cause of suicide in most cases. Carotid intimal tears and injuries to bony and cartilaginous structures were present in smaller numbers. Vital reaction was observed in all 46 cases. Classification of fwound vitality showed a correlation to known time since injury. Conclusion The results of the present study showed that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in the circumstances leading to suicidal deaths.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100205">Constitutively active receptor ADGRA3 signaling induces adipose thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The induction of adipose thermogenesis plays a critical role in maintaining body temperature and improving metabolic homeostasis to combat obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <i>Adgra3</i> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers in mice. Conversely, <i>Adgra3</i> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis in mice without exogenous ligand. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige human or mouse adipocytes in vitro. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selective overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96312">A multisite validation of brain white matter pathways of resilience to chronic back pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic back pain (CBP) is a global health concern with significant societal and economic burden. While various predictors of back pain chronicity have been proposed, including demographic and psychosocial factors, neuroimaging studies have pointed to brain characteristics as predictors of CBP. However, large-scale, multisite validation of these predictors is currently lacking. In two independent longitudinal studies, we examined white matter diffusion imaging data and pain characteristics in patients with subacute back pain (SBP) over 6- and 12-month periods. Diffusion data from individuals with CBP and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed for comparison. Whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analyses revealed that a cluster in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) tract had larger fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients who recovered (SBPr) compared to those with persistent pain (SBPp), and predicted changes in pain severity. The SLF FA values accurately classified patients at baseline and follow-up in a third publicly available dataset (Area under the Receiver Operating Curve ~0.70). Notably, patients who recovered had FA values larger than those of HC suggesting a potential role of SLF integrity in resilience to CBP. Structural connectivity-based models also classified SBPp and SBPr patients from the three data sets (validation accuracy 67%). Our results validate the right SLF <i>as a robust predictor of CBP development, with potential for clinical translation</i>. Cognitive and behavioral processes dependent on the right SLF, such as proprioception and visuospatial attention, should be analyzed in subacute stages as they could prove important for back pain chronicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101248">Gasdermin D-mediated neutrophil pyroptosis drives inflammation in psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                Psoriasis is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Its pathogenesis involves abnormal accumulation of neutrophils and T-cell-related abnormalities. Pyroptosis is a type of regulated cell death associated with innate immunity, but its role in psoriasis is unclear. In this study, we found that <i>gasdermin D (GSDMD</i>) is higher in human psoriatic skin than that in normal skin, and in imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse skin, the expression of <i>Gsdmd</i> was most significantly altered in neutrophils and <i>Il1b</i> was also mainly expressed in neutrophils. Immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of skin lesions from psoriasis patients and healthy control also showed that GSDMD expression is higher in psoriasis lesion, especially in neutrophils. <i>Gsdmd</i> deficiency mitigates psoriasis-like inflammation in mice. GSDMD in neutrophils contributes to psoriasis-like inflammation, while <i>Gsdmd</i> depletion in neutrophils attenuates the development of skin inflammation in psoriasis and reduces the release of the inflammatory cytokines. We found that neutrophil pyroptosis is involved in and contributes to psoriasis inflammation, which provides new insights into the treatment of psoriasis by targeting neutrophil pyroptosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89638">Improving PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy for complete remission of lung cancer by nanoPDLIM2</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate <i>PDLIM2</i> genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96344">The satiety hormone cholecystokinin gates reproduction in fish by controlling gonadotropin secretion</a></h4>

              
                Life histories of oviparous species dictate high metabolic investment in the process of gonadal development leading to ovulation. In vertebrates, these two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), oversees both functions, the generation of loss-of-function fish challenged this view. Here, we reveal that the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is the primary regulator of this axis in zebrafish. We found that FSH cells express a CCK receptor, and our findings demonstrate that mutating this receptor results in a severe hindrance to ovarian development. Additionally, it causes a complete shutdown of both gonadotropins secretion. Using in-vivo and ex-vivo calcium imaging of gonadotrophs, we show that GnRH predominantly activates LH cells, whereas FSH cells respond to CCK stimulation, designating CCK as the bona fide FSH secretagogue. These findings indicate that the control of gametogenesis in fish was placed under different neural circuits, that are gated by CCK.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93646">CaBP1 and 2 enable sustained CaV1.3 calcium currents and synaptic transmission in inner hair cells</a></h4>

              
                To encode continuous sound stimuli, the inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses utilize calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs), which reduce the inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 calcium channels. Mutations in the <i>CABP2</i> gene underlie non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB93. Besides CaBP2, the structurally related CaBP1 is highly abundant in the IHCs. Here, we investigated how the two CaBPs cooperatively regulate IHC synaptic function. In <i>Cabp1/2</i> double-knockout mice, we find strongly enhanced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation, slowed recovery from inactivation and impaired sustained exocytosis. Already mild IHC activation further reduces the availability of channels to trigger synaptic transmission and may effectively silence synapses. Spontaneous and sound-evoked responses of spiral ganglion neurons in vivo are strikingly reduced and strongly depend on stimulation rates. Transgenic expression of CaBP2 leads to substantial recovery of IHC synaptic function and hearing sensitivity. We conclude that CaBP1 and 2 act together to suppress voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in order to support sufficient rate of exocytosis and enable fast, temporally precise and indefatigable sound encoding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93749">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release (<i>SR</i>) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high <i>SR</i> synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99833">Accurate predictions of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity from comprehensive analysis</a></h4>

              
                An unprecedented amount of SARS-CoV-2 data has been accumulated compared with previous infectious diseases, enabling insights into its evolutionary process and more thorough analyses. This study investigates SARS-CoV-2 features as it evolved to evaluate its infectivity. We examined viral sequences and identified the polarity of amino acids in the receptor binding motif (RBM) region. We detected an increased frequency of amino acid substitutions to lysine (K) and arginine (R) in variants of concern (VOCs). As the virus evolved to Omicron, commonly occurring mutations became fixed components of the new viral sequence. Furthermore, at specific positions of VOCs, only one type of amino acid substitution and a notable absence of mutations at D467 were detected. We found that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages to the ACE2 receptor was impacted by amino acid substitutions. Based on our discoveries, we developed APESS, an evaluation model evaluating infectivity from biochemical and mutational properties. In silico evaluation using real-world sequences and in vitro viral entry assays validated the accuracy of APESS and our discoveries. Using Machine Learning, we predicted mutations that had the potential to become more prominent. We created AIVE, a web-based system, accessible at <a href="https://ai-ve.org">https://ai-ve.org</a> to provide infectivity measurements of mutations entered by users. Ultimately, we established a clear link between specific viral properties and increased infectivity, enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and enabling more accurate predictions of the virus.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain function and govern various cognitive processes. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging advances offer the opportunity to study frequency-specific properties of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations at multiple frequency bands. However, most have focused on spontaneous brain activity in the resting state, leaving a gap in direct evidence regarding the specific activations of cognitive tasks across different frequency bands. We aim to address this gap by exploring the role of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations across multiple frequency bands in cognitive processes. We used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 339 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project to map the activation patterns of performing seven cognitive tasks at multiple frequency bands (ie slow-1 to slow-6). Our findings revealed that different frequency bands are associated with distinct task-activation patterns. Specifically, slow-1/2/3 oscillations primarily contribute to local sensory information processing, while slow-4 is crucial for various fundamental cognitive functions. Slow-5 is involved in cognitive processes that require greater memory load, integrated cognitive processing, and attention maintenance. This underscores the importance of analyzing a broad frequency range to capture the full spectrum of cognitive function, highlighting the diverse roles of different frequency bands in brain activity, shedding light on the underlying mechanism of brain–behavior associations.</span>

Behaviorally, Menks et al. (2024) showed that grammaticality judgment task performance increased steadily from 8 to 15.4 yr, after which age had no further effect. We show in the current study that this age-related grammaticality judgment task performance was negatively related to cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness in many clusters throughout the brain. Hippocampal volume was positively related to age-related grammaticality judgment task performance and L2 (English) vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, we found that grammaticality judgment task performance, L2 grammar proficiency, and L2 vocabulary knowledge were positively related to gray matter maturation within parietal regions, overlapping with the functional MRI clusters that were reported previously in Menks et al.
