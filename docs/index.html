              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02241">What makes a face looks like a hat: Decoupling low-level and high-level Visual Properties with Image Triplets</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In visual decision making, high-level features, such as object categories, have a strong influence on choice. However, the impact of low-level features on behavior is less understood partly due to the high correlation between high- and low-level features in the stimuli presented (e.g., objects of the same category are more likely to share low-level features). To disentangle these effects, we propose a method that de-correlates low- and high-level visual properties in a novel set of stimuli. Our method uses two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as candidate models of the ventral visual stream: the CORnet-S that has high neural predictivity in high-level, IT-like responses and the VGG-16 that has high neural predictivity in low-level responses. Triplets (root, image1, image2) of stimuli are parametrized by the level of low- and high-level similarity of images extracted from the different layers. These stimuli are then used in a decision-making task where participants are tasked to choose the most similar-to-the-root image. We found that different networks show differing abilities to predict the effects of low-versus-high-level similarity: while CORnet-S outperforms VGG-16 in explaining human choices based on high-level similarity, VGG-16 outperforms CORnet-S in explaining human choices based on low-level similarity. Using Brain-Score, we observed that the behavioral prediction abilities of different layers of these networks qualitatively corresponded to their ability to explain neural activity at different levels of the visual hierarchy. In summary, our algorithm for stimulus set generation enables the study of how different representations in the visual stream affect high-level cognitive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02674">Fibration symmetry-breaking supports functional transitions in a brain network engaged in language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his book 'A Beautiful Question', physicist Frank Wilczek argues that symmetry is 'nature's deep design,' governing the behavior of the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest structures. While symmetry is a cornerstone of physics, it has not yet been found widespread applicability to describe biological systems, particularly the human brain. In this context, we study the human brain network engaged in language and explore the relationship between the structural connectivity (connectome or structural network) and the emergent synchronization of the mesoscopic regions of interest (functional network). We explain this relationship through a different kind of symmetry than physical symmetry, derived from the categorical notion of Grothendieck fibrations. This introduces a new understanding of the human brain by proposing a local symmetry theory of the connectome, which accounts for how the structure of the brain's network determines its coherent activity. Among the allowed patterns of structural connectivity, synchronization elicits different symmetry subsets according to the functional engagement of the brain. We show that the resting state is a particular realization of the cerebral synchronization pattern characterized by a fibration symmetry that is broken in the transition from rest to language. Our findings suggest that the brain's network symmetry at the local level determines its coherent function, and we can understand this relationship from theoretical principles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02682">Symmetries and synchronization from whole-neural activity in {\it C. elegans} connectome: Integration of functional and structural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underly the synchronization of a system's units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the \textit{C.elegans} backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal's motor periphery, providing new testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a new door to exploring the structure-function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02684">Neural timescales from a computational perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timescales of neural activity are diverse across and within brain areas, and experimental observations suggest that neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, these observations do not specify how neural timescales are shaped, nor whether particular timescales are necessary for neural computations and brain function. Here, we take a complementary perspective and synthesize three directions where computational methods can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how data analysis methods allow us to capture different timescales of neural dynamics across different recording modalities, (ii) how computational models provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-optimized models in machine learning uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational approach, combined with empirical findings, would provide a more holistic understanding of how neural timescales capture the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.

                arXiv:2409.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective piece is the result of a Generative Adversarial Collaboration (GAC) tackling the question `How does neural activity represent probability distributions?'. We have addressed three major obstacles to progress on answering this question: first, we provide a unified language for defining competing hypotheses. Second, we explain the fundamentals of three prominent proposals for probabilistic computations -- Probabilistic Population Codes (PPCs), Distributed Distributional Codes (DDCs), and Neural Sampling Codes (NSCs) -- and describe similarities and differences in that common language. Third, we review key empirical data previously taken as evidence for at least one of these proposal, and describe how it may or may not be explainable by alternative proposals. Finally, we describe some key challenges in resolving the debate, and propose potential directions to address them through a combination of theory and experiments.

                arXiv:2409.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lesion-aware graph neural network (LEGNet) to predict language ability from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity in patients with post-stroke aphasia. Our model integrates three components: an edge-based learning module that encodes functional connectivity between brain regions, a lesion encoding module, and a subgraph learning module that leverages functional similarities for prediction. We use synthetic data derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for hyperparameter tuning and model pretraining. We then evaluate the performance using repeated 10-fold cross-validation on an in-house neuroimaging dataset of post-stroke aphasia. Our results demonstrate that LEGNet outperforms baseline deep learning methods in predicting language ability. LEGNet also exhibits superior generalization ability when tested on a second in-house dataset that was acquired under a slightly different neuroimaging protocol. Taken together, the results of this study highlight the potential of LEGNet in effectively learning the relationships between rs-fMRI connectivity and language ability in a patient cohort with brain lesions for improved post-stroke aphasia evaluation.

                arXiv:2409.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the fundamental neural correlates of biological intelligence, developing mathematical models, and conducting computational simulations are critical for advancing new paradigms in artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we implemented a comprehensive visual decision-making model that spans from visual input to behavioral output, using a neural dynamics modeling approach. Drawing inspiration from the key components of the dorsal visual pathway in primates, our model not only aligns closely with human behavior but also reflects neural activities in primates, and achieving accuracy comparable to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified key neuroimaging features such as structural connections and functional connectivity that are associated with performance in perceptual decision-making tasks. A neuroimaging-informed fine-tuning approach was introduced and applied to the model, leading to performance improvements that paralleled the behavioral variations observed among subjects. Compared to classical deep learning models, our model more accurately replicates the behavioral performance of biological intelligence, relying on the structural characteristics of biological neural networks rather than extensive training data, and demonstrating enhanced resilience to perturbation.

                arXiv:2409.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) simulators are essential tools to prototype biologically inspired models and neuromorphic hardware architectures and predict their performance. For such a tool, ease of use and flexibility are critical, but so is simulation speed especially given the complexity inherent to simulating SNN. Here, we present SNNAX, a JAX-based framework for simulating and training such models with PyTorch-like intuitiveness and JAX-like execution speed. SNNAX models are easily extended and customized to fit the desired model specifications and target neuromorphic hardware. Additionally, SNNAX offers key features for optimizing the training and deployment of SNNs such as flexible automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation. We evaluate and compare SNNAX to other commonly used machine learning (ML) frameworks used for programming SNNs. We provide key performance metrics, best practices, documented examples for simulating SNNs in SNNAX, and implement several benchmarks used in the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02146">Brain-Inspired Online Adaptation for Remote Sensing with Spiking Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02680">A Low-Cost Real-Time Spiking System for Obstacle Detection based on Ultrasonic Sensors and Rate Coding</a></h4>

Abstract: Since the advent of mobile robots, obstacle detection has been a topic of great interest. It has also been a subject of study in neuroscience, where flying insects and bats could be considered two of the most interesting cases in terms of vision-based and sound-based mechanisms for obstacle detection, respectively. Currently, many studies focus on vision-based obstacle detection, but not many can be found regarding sound-based obstacle detection. This work focuses on the latter approach, which also makes use of a Spiking Neural Network to exploit the advantages of these architectures and achieve an approach closer to biology. The complete system was tested through a series of experiments that confirm the validity of the spiking architecture for obstacle detection. It is empirically demonstrated that, when the distance between the robot and the obstacle decreases, the output firing rate of the system increases in response as expected, and vice versa. Therefore, there is a direct relation between the two. Furthermore, there is a distance threshold between detectable and undetectable objects which is also empirically measured in this work. An in-depth study on how this system works at low level based on the Inter-Spike Interval concept was performed, which may be useful in the future development of applications based on spiking filters.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by emulating the event-driven processing manner of the brain. Incorporating Transformers with SNNs has shown promise for accuracy. However, they struggle to learn high-frequency patterns, such as moving edges and pixel-level brightness changes, because they rely on the global self-attention mechanism. Learning these high-frequency representations is challenging but essential for SNN-based event-driven vision. To address this issue, we propose the Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), an attention-free architecture that effectively learns comprehensive spatial-frequency features in a spike-driven manner by leveraging the sparse wavelet transform. The critical component is a Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 1) spiking wavelet learner for spatial-frequency domain learning, 2) convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction, and 3) spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel information aggregation - with negative spike dynamics incorporated in 1) to enhance frequency representation. The FATM enables the SWformer to outperform vanilla Spiking Transformers in capturing high-frequency visual components, as evidenced by our empirical results. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate SWformer's effectiveness in capturing spatial-frequency patterns in a multiplication-free and event-driven fashion, outperforming state-of-the-art SNNs. SWformer achieves a 22.03% reduction in parameter count, and a 2.52% performance improvement on the ImageNet dataset compared to vanilla Spiking Transformers. The code is available at: https://github.com/bic-L/Spiking-Wavelet-Transformer.

Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on the MNIST benchmark.

Abstract: We propose a new high-performance activation function, Moderate Adaptive Linear Units (MoLU), for the deep neural network. The MoLU is a simple, beautiful and powerful activation function that can be a good main activation function among hundreds of activation functions. Because the MoLU is made up of the elementary functions, not only it is a diffeomorphism (i.e. analytic over whole domains), but also it reduces the training time.

Abstract: This study evaluates the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in fraud detection, finding that their effectiveness is context-dependent. We propose a quick decision rule using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the suitability of KAN: if data can be effectively separated in two dimensions using splines, KAN may outperform traditional models; otherwise, other methods could be more appropriate. We also introduce a heuristic approach to hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing computational costs. These findings suggest that while KAN has potential, its use should be guided by data-specific assessments.

	<p>Spatial orientation and navigation are complex cognitive functions that integrate sensory information, attention, and memory, enabling individuals to locate themselves in their environment. These abilities decline with age, signaling cognitive impairment in neurological patients, and significantly limit the autonomy of the elderly. Current neuropsychological assessments fall short in accurately measuring everyday wayfinding abilities, particularly in borderline cases of cognitive decline. This paper reviews various neuropsychological assessments, including Benton&amp;amp;rsquo;s Judgment of Line Orientation Test, the Almeria Spatial Memory Recognition Test, the Spatial Span subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Spatial Orientation in Immersive Virtual Environment Maze Test, evaluating their effectiveness in delineating spatial orientation and navigation skills. The review identifies significant gaps in the validity and reliability of these tests, particularly in their shortened versions, and highlights the potential of virtual reality environments as promising tools for improving diagnostic precision. The findings underscore the need for further research to refine these tools, ensuring they accurately capture cognitive decline and improve the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Such advancements hold promise for enhancing the quality of care and autonomy for the elderly.</p>

                <p>Monocular deprivation (MD) causes an initial decrease in synaptic responses to the deprived eye in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) through Hebbian long-term depression (LTD). This is followed by a homeostatic increase, which has been attributed either to synaptic scaling or to a slide threshold for Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) rather than scaling. We therefore asked in mice of all sexes whether the homeostatic increase during MD requires GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activity, which is required to slide the plasticity threshold but not for synaptic scaling. Selective GluN2B blockade from 2&ndash;6&nbsp;d after monocular lid suture prevented the homeostatic increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude in monocular V1 of acute slices and prevented the increase in visually evoked responses in binocular V1 in vivo<I>.</I> The decrease in mEPSC amplitude and visually evoked responses during the first 2&nbsp;d of MD also required GluN2B activity. Together, these results support the idea that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors first play a role in LTD immediately following eye closure and then promote homeostasis during prolonged MD by sliding the plasticity threshold in favor of LTP.</p>

                <p>Brain nuclei are traditionally defined by their anatomy, activity, and expression of specific markers. The hypothalamus contains discrete neuronal populations that coordinate fundamental behavioral functions, including sleep and wakefulness, in all vertebrates. Particularly, the diverse roles of hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-releasing neurons suggest functional heterogeneity among Hcrt neurons. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-resolution imaging of the adult male and female zebrafish hypothalamic periventricular zone, we identified 21 glutamatergic and 28 GABAergic cell types. Integration of zebrafish and mouse scRNA-seq revealed evolutionary conserved and divergent hypothalamic cell types. The expression of specific genes, including <I>npvf</I>, which encodes a sleep-regulating neuropeptide, was enriched in subsets of glutamatergic Hcrt neurons in both larval and adult zebrafish. The genetic profile, activity, and neurite processing of the neuronal subpopulation that coexpresses both Hcrt and Npvf (Hcrt+Npvf+) differ from other Hcrt neurons. These interspecies findings provide a unified annotation of hypothalamic cell types and suggest that the heterogeneity of Hcrt neurons enables multifunctionality, such as consolidation of both wake and sleep by the Hcrt- and Npvf-releasing neuronal subpopulation.</p>

                <p>The developed human brain shows remarkable plasticity following perceptual learning, resulting in improved visual sensitivity. However, such improvements commonly require extensive stimuli exposure. Here we show that efficiently enhancing visual perception with minimal stimuli exposure recruits distinct neural mechanisms relative to standard repetition-based learning. Participants (<I>n</I> = 20, 12 women, 8 men) encoded a visual discrimination task, followed by brief memory reactivations of only five trials each performed on separate days, demonstrating improvements comparable with standard repetition-based learning (<I>n</I> = 20, 12 women, 8 men). Reactivation-induced learning engaged increased bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity relative to repetition-based learning. Complementary evidence for differential learning processes was further provided by temporal&ndash;parietal resting functional connectivity changes, which correlated with behavioral improvements. The results suggest that efficiently enhancing visual perception with minimal stimuli exposure recruits distinct neural processes, engaging higher-order control and attentional resources while leading to similar perceptual gains. These unique brain mechanisms underlying improved perceptual learning efficiency may have important implications for daily life and in clinical conditions requiring relearning following brain damage.</p>

                <p>Contrary to its well-established role in declarative learning, the impact of sleep on motor memory consolidation remains a subject of debate. Current literature suggests that while motor skill learning benefits from sleep, consolidation of sensorimotor adaptation (SMA) depends solely on the passage of time. This has led to the proposal that SMA may be an exception to other types of memories. Here, we addressed this ongoing controversy in humans through three comprehensive experiments using the visuomotor adaptation paradigm (<I>N</I> = 290, 150 females). In Experiment 1, we investigated the impact of sleep on memory retention when the temporal gap between training and sleep was not controlled. In line with the previous literature, we found that memory consolidates with the passage of time. In Experiment 2, we used an anterograde interference protocol to determine the time window during which SMA memory is most fragile and, thus, potentially most sensitive to sleep intervention. Our results show that memory is most vulnerable during the initial hour post-training. Building on this insight, in Experiment 3, we investigated the impact of sleep when it coincided with the critical first hour of memory consolidation. This manipulation unveiled a benefit of sleep (30% memory enhancement) alongside an increase in spindle density and spindle&ndash;SO coupling during NREM sleep, two well-established neural markers of sleep consolidation. Our findings reconcile seemingly conflicting perspectives on the active role of sleep in motor learning and point to common mechanisms at the basis of memory formation.</p>

                <p>Cognitive flexibility represents the capacity to switch among different mental schemes, providing an adaptive advantage to a changing environment. The neural underpinnings of this executive function have been deeply studied in humans through fMRI, showing that the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) are crucial. Here, we investigated the inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance in these regions by means of -aminobutyric acid (GABA+) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx), measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, during a cognitive flexibility task and its relationship with the performance level and the local task-induced blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in 40 young (18&ndash;35&nbsp;years; 26 female) and 40 older (18&ndash;35&nbsp;years; 21 female) human adults. As the IFC and the IPL are richly connected regions, we also examined whole-brain effects associated with their local metabolic activity. Results did not show absolute metabolic modulations associated with flexibility performance, but the performance level was related to the direction of metabolic modulation in the IPL with opposite patterns in young and older individuals. The individual inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance modulation showed an inverse relationship with the local BOLD response in the IPL. Finally, the modulation of inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance in IPL was related to whole-brain effects only in older individuals. These findings show disparities in the metabolic mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in young and older adults and their association with the performance level and BOLD response. Such metabolic differences are likely to play a role in executive functioning during aging and specifically in cognitive flexibility.</p>

                <p>Multiple mutations in the <I>Rhodopsin</I> gene cause sector retinitis pigmentosa in humans and a corresponding light-exacerbated retinal degeneration (RD) in animal models. Previously we have shown that T4K rhodopsin requires photoactivation to exert its toxic effect. Here we further investigated the mechanisms involved in rod cell death caused by T4K rhodopsin in mixed male and female <I>Xenopus laevis</I>. In this model, RD was prevented by rearing animals in constant darkness but surprisingly also in constant light. RD was maximized by light cycles containing at least 1&nbsp;h of darkness and 20&nbsp;min of light exposure, light intensities &gt;750&nbsp;lux, and by a sudden light onset. Under conditions of frequent light cycling, RD occurred rapidly and synchronously, with massive shedding of ROS fragments into the RPE initiated within hours and subsequent death and phagocytosis of rod cell bodies. RD was minimized by reduced light levels, pretreatment with constant light, and gradual light onset. RD was prevented by genetic ablation of the retinal isomerohydrolase RPE65 and exacerbated by ablation of phototransduction components GNAT1, SAG, and GRK1. Our results indicate that photoactivated T4K rhodopsin is toxic, that cell death requires synchronized photoactivation of T4K rhodopsin, and that toxicity is mitigated by interaction with other rod outer segment proteins regardless of whether they participate in activation or shutoff of phototransduction. In contrast, RD caused by P23H rhodopsin does not require photoactivation of the mutant protein, as it was exacerbated by RPE65 ablation, suggesting that these phenotypically similar disorders may require different treatment strategies.</p>

                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucial for tracking various aspects of expected outcomes, thereby helping to guide choices and support learning. Our previous study showed that the effects of reward timing and size on the activity of single units in OFC were dissociable when these attributes were manipulated independently ( <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B9">Roesch et al., 2006</cross-ref>). However, in real-life decision-making scenarios, outcome features often change simultaneously, so here we investigated how OFC neurons in male rats integrate information about the timing and identity (flavor) of reward and respond to changes in these features, according to whether they were changed simultaneously or separately. We found that a substantial number of OFC neurons fired differentially to immediate versus delayed reward and to the different reward flavors. However, contrary to the previous study, selectivity for timing was strongly correlated with selectivity for identity. Taken together with the previous research, these results suggest that when reward features are correlated, OFC tends to "pack" them into unitary constructs, whereas when they are independent, OFC tends to "crack" them into separate constructs. Furthermore, we found that when both reward timing and flavor were changed, reward-responsive OFC neurons showed unique activity patterns preceding and during the omission of an expected reward. Interestingly, this OFC activity is similar and slightly preceded the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA DA) activity observed in a previous study ( <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Takahashi et al., 2023</cross-ref>), consistent with the role of OFC in providing predictive information to VTA DA neurons.</p>

                <p>An interoceptive homeostatic reflex monitors levels of CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> to maintain blood gas homeostasis and rapidly regulate tissue acid&ndash;base balance by driving lung ventilation and CO<SUB>2</SUB> excretion&mdash;this CO<SUB>2</SUB>-evoked increase in respiration is the hypercapnic ventilatory reflex (HCVR). Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons provide crucial excitatory drive to downstream respiratory rhythm/pattern-generating circuits, and their activity is directly modulated by changes in CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup>. RTN neurons express GPR4 and TASK-2, global deletion of which abrogates CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> activation of RTN neurons and the HCVR. It has not been determined if the intrinsic pH sensitivity of these proton detectors is required for these effects. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice with mutations in either of two pH-sensing histidine residues in GPR4 to determine effects on RTN neuronal CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity and the HCVR. In global GPR4(H81F) and GPR4(H167F) mice, CO<SUB>2</SUB>-stimulated breathing and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-induced RTN neuronal activation were strongly blunted, with no effect on hypoxia-stimulated breathing. In brainstem slices from GPR4(H81F) mice, peak firing of RTN neurons during bath acidification was significantly reduced compared with GPR4 wild-type mice, and a subpopulation of RTN neurons was rendered pH-insensitive, phenocopying previous results from GPR4-deleted mice. These effects were independent of changes in RTN number/distribution, neuronal excitability or transcript levels for GPR4 and TASK-2. CO<SUB>2</SUB>-stimulated breathing was reduced to a similar extent in GPR4(H81F) and TASK-2-deleted mice, with combined mutation yielding no additional deficit in the HCVR. Together, these data demonstrate that the intrinsic pH sensitivity of GPR4 is necessary for full elaboration of the HCVR.</p>

                <p>Acetylation of histone proteins by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and the resultant change in gene expression, is a well-established mechanism necessary for long-term memory (LTM) consolidation, which is not required for short-term memory (STM). However, we previously demonstrated that the HAT p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) also influences hippocampus (HPC)-dependent STM in male rats. In addition to their epigenetic activity, HATs acetylate nonhistone proteins involved in nongenomic cellular processes, such as estrogen receptors (ERs). Given that ERs have rapid, nongenomic effects on HPC-dependent STM, we investigated the potential interaction between ERs and PCAF for STM mediated by the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). Using a series of pharmacological agents administered directly into the dHPC, we reveal a functional interaction between PCAF and ER&alpha; in the facilitation of short-term object-in-place memory in male but not female rats. This interaction was specific to ER&alpha;, while ER&beta; agonism did not enhance STM. It was further specific to dHPC STM, as the effect was not present in the dHPC for LTM or in the perirhinal cortex. Further, while STM required local (i.e., dHPC) estrogen synthesis, the facilitatory interaction effect appeared independent of estrogens. Finally, western blot analyses demonstrated that PCAF activation in the dHPC rapidly (5 min) activated downstream estrogen-related cell signaling kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase). Collectively, these findings indicate that PCAF, which is typically implicated in LTM through epigenetic processes, also influences STM in the dHPC, possibly via nongenomic ER activity. Critically, this novel PCAF&ndash;ER interaction might exist as a male-specific mechanism supporting STM.</p>

                <p>While the influence of context on long-term memory (LTM) is well documented, its effects on the interaction between working memory (WM) and LTM remain less understood. In this study, we explored these interactions using a delayed match-to-sample task, where participants (6 males, 16 females) encountered the same target object across six consecutive trials, facilitating the transition from WM to LTM. During half of these target repetitions, the background color changed. We measured the WM storage of the target using the contralateral delay activity in electroencephalography. Our results reveal that task-irrelevant context changes trigger the reactivation of long-term memories in WM. This reactivation may be attributed to content&ndash;context binding in WM and hippocampal pattern separation.</p>

                <p>Sensory processing disruptions are a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurological disorders. The acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) are common metrics used to assess disruptions in sensory processing and sensorimotor gating in clinical studies and animal models. However, often there are inconsistent findings on ASD-related PPI deficits across different studies. Here, we used a novel method for assessing changes in startle and PPI in rodents, using the <I>Cntnap2</I> knock-out (KO) rat model for neurodevelopmental disorder/ASD that has consistently shown PPI disruptions in past studies. We discovered that not only sex and prepulse intensity but also the intensity of the startle stimulus profoundly impacts whether PPI deficits are evident in the <I>Cntnap2</I> KO rat or not. We show that rats do not universally exhibit a PPI deficit; instead, impaired PPI is contingent on specific testing conditions. Notably, at lower startle stimulus intensities, <I>Cntnap2</I> KO rats not only demonstrated intact PPI but also exhibited evidence of enhanced PPI compared with their wild-type counterparts. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering specific testing conditions when evaluating startle and PPI in the context of ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions and might explain some of the inconsistencies between different studies.</p>

                <p>Generalized epilepsy (GE) encompasses a heterogeneous group of hyperexcitability disorders that clinically manifest as seizures. At the whole-brain level, distinct seizure patterns as well as interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) reflect key signatures of hyperexcitability in magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) recordings. Moreover, it had been suggested that aperiodic activity, specifically the slope of the 1/<I>f<sup>x</sup></I> decay function of the power spectrum, might index neural excitability. However, it remained unclear if hyperexcitability as encountered at the cellular level directly translates to putative large-scale excitability signatures, amenable to M/EEG. In order to test whether the power spectrum is altered in hyperexcitable states, we recorded resting-state MEG from male and female GE patients (<I>n</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;51; 29 females; 28.82 &plusmn; 12.18&nbsp;years; mean &plusmn; SD) and age-matched healthy controls (<I>n</I> = 49; 22 females; 32.10 &plusmn; 12.09&nbsp;years). We parametrized the power spectra using FOOOF ("fitting oscillations and one over <I>f</I>") to separate oscillatory from aperiodic activity to directly test whether aperiodic activity is systematically altered in GE patients. We further identified IEDs to quantify the temporal dynamics of aperiodic activity around overt epileptic activity. The results demonstrate that aperiodic activity indexes hyperexcitability in GE at the whole-brain level, especially during epochs when no IEDs were present (<I>p</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0130; <I>d</I> = 0.52). Upon IEDs, large-scale circuits transiently shifted to a less excitable network state (<I>p</I> = 0.001; <I>d</I> = 0.68). In sum, these results uncover that MEG background activity might index hyperexcitability based on the current brain state and does not rely on the presence of epileptic waveforms.</p>

                <p>The accurate estimation of limb state is necessary for movement planning and execution. While state estimation requires both feedforward and feedback information, we focus here on the latter. Prior literature has shown that integrating visual and proprioceptive feedback improves estimates of static limb position. However, differences in visual and proprioceptive feedback delays suggest that multisensory integration could be disadvantageous when the limb is moving. We formalized this hypothesis by modeling feedback-based state estimation using the long-standing maximum likelihood estimation model of multisensory integration, which we updated to account for sensory delays. Our model predicted that the benefit of multisensory integration was largely lost when the limb was passively moving. We tested this hypothesis in a series of experiments in human subjects that compared the degree of interference created by discrepant visual or proprioceptive feedback when estimating limb position either statically at the end of the movement or dynamically at movement midpoint. In the static case, we observed significant interference: discrepant feedback in one modality systematically biased sensory estimates based on the other modality. However, no interference was seen in the dynamic case: participants could ignore sensory feedback from one modality and accurately reproduce the motion indicated by the other modality. Together, these findings suggest that the sensory feedback used to compute a state estimate differs depending on whether the limb is stationary or moving. While the former may tend toward multimodal integration, the latter is more likely to be based on feedback from a single sensory modality.</p>

                Background Agricultural waste sourced from various activities that occur along the agricultural supply chain including post-harvest, processing, and consumption processes, can pose a threat to ecosystem balance and community welfare. Data shows that agricultural by-products have the potential to be utilized because they contain antioxidant compounds. This systematic review study aims to identify and assess the antioxidant activity of agricultural by-products through various extraction methods. Methods This systematic review collected literature in the last 10 years (2013–2023) from Google Scholar, Semantic, and Scopus-indexed articles with the help of Publish or Perish. Using the help of boolean operators (AND) and (OR) in searching using keywords. The steps applied adapt the PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), including identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. Results Literature collection data shows that the dominant processing method used is the solvent extraction method to determine the antioxidant value of various agricultural waste by-products. Followed by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) methods. A wide range of antioxidant activity values were found depending on the type of agricultural waste and processing technique. One potential utilization of agricultural wastes rich in antioxidant content is as additives in formulations in the cosmetic industry. Conclusion Agricultural waste by-products have high potential of antioxidant content, depending on the type of waste and extraction method. The dominant agricultural waste used is by-products from the fruit group. The utilization of agricultural waste that is rich in antioxidants has the potential to be utilized in the cosmetic industry.

                Abstract* Backgrounds The retention of the maxillary complete denture may be influenced by adequate recording in the patient’s mouth, marking, and carving of the post-dam on the maxillary cast. Failure to do so may lead to loss of retention. Successful denture construction with patient’s comfort could be achieved by effective methods of recording, marking, and carving of the post-dam. The aim of the study was to assess Iraqi dentists in their knowledge and application of the post-dam in maxillary complete dentures. Methods Questionnaires were distributed randomly through online Google Forms and 118 Iraqi dentists with different academic degree participated in the study. A multinomial logistic regression model was also used to assess the nominal outcome variables. Results A High percentage of 90.7% of Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge about the vibrating lines and their location and 84.7% stated that they mark the post-dam on the master cast, while 15.3% stated that the dental technician marks it. More the half (52.5%) of the participants carved the post-dam, while 47.5% of the participants stated that the dental technician did it. For participants not marking the post-dam, 30.5% of the participants stated they depend on the dental technician in marking and/or carve the post-dam, while the fear of denture failure and loss of retention was observed in 25.4% of the participants, followed by 24.6% of participants forgetting to carve, 10.2% of participants had no information about carving, and 9.3% participants found it was difficult to carve. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study, most Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge on the location of vibrating lines. However, recording and carving the post-dam was influenced by the dentist’s personal preference and their dependency on the dental technician.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background: To minimize fracture risk, multimodal training regimens are recommended. However, their effectiveness in community settings remains uncertain. This study evaluated the feasibility of 19-weeks of multimodal training in a local community center with emphasis on musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. Methods: In a controlled trial, 28 postmenopausal women (53-68-years-old) were assigned to a multimodal training group (MMT, n=15) or a control group (CON, n=13). The training consisted of high- and odd-impact, resistance and balance-coordination training 1-2 hours weekly. The outcomes were attendance rate, regional and total bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers (BTM), body composition, functional muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance. All were determined at baseline and after 19 weeks of training. BTM was assessed after three weeks. Results: Overall, 22(79%) participants (MMT, n=9; CON, n=13) completed the study, and the mean attendance rate for MMT was 65.5% of the maximum sessions (2) offered. Only right trochanter BMD increased (p<0.05) by 1.0±1.1% in MMT, which was higher(p<0.05) than CON. While whole-body BMC was not changed at 19 weeks from baseline in MMT, it decreased (p<0.05) in CON resulting in a significant difference (p<0.05) in whole-body BMC delta values between the two groups. Compared to baseline, body fat percentage(%BF), fat mass(FM), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-mass and -volume were decreased (p<0.01) in MMT, and were larger (p<0.05) than CON. No significant changes were observed in BTM, muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance after 19 weeks. Conclusions: Nineteen weeks of multimodal training 1-2 hours per week in a local community had a health-enhancing effect on %BF, FM, and VAT, whereas the musculoskeletal health impact was modest. We hypothesize that the reason might be too low training volume and frequency and supposedly too low musculoskeletal training intensity for some participants. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05164679 (21/12/2021).

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background Learning to thinking critically about health information and choices can protect people from unnecessary suffering, harm, and resource waste. Earlier work revealed that children can learn these skills, but printing costs and curricula compatibility remain important barriers to school implementation. We aimed to develop a set of digital learning resources for students to think critically about health that were suitable for use in Kenyan, Rwandan, and Ugandan secondary schools. Methods We conducted work in two phases collaborating with teachers, students, schools, and national curriculum development offices using a human-centred design approach. First, we conducted context analyses and an overview of teaching strategies, prioritised content and collected examples. Next, we developed lessons and guidance iteratively, informed by data from user-testing, individual and group interviews, and school pilots. Results Final resources include online lesson plans, teachers’ guide, and extra resources, with lesson plans in two modes, for use in a classroom equipped with a blackboard/ﬂip-chart and a projector. The resources are accessible offline for use when electricity or Internet is lacking. Teachers preferred the projector mode, as it provided structure and a focal point for class attention. Feedback was largely positive, with teachers and students appreciating the learning and experiencing it as relevant. Four main challenges included time to teach lessons; incorrect comprehension; identifying suitable examples; and technical, logistical, and behavioural challenges with a student-computer mode that we piloted. We resolved challenges by simplifying and combining lessons; increasing opportunities for review and assessment; developing teacher training materials, creating a searchable set of examples; and deactivating the student-computer mode. Conclusion Using a human-centred design approach, we created digital resources for teaching secondary school students to think critically about health actions and for training teachers. Be smart about your health resources are open access and can be translated or adapted to other settings.

                Background The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing overtime, potentially leading to various severe health complications and mortality. Despite therapeutic agents have currently been developed, unexpected adverse effects are inevitable. Hence, safe and effective medications such as those of plant origin are critical to prevent unexpected complication in DM sufferers. Etlingera elatior has been widely used as spice and traditional medicine to treat diabetes in Aceh Province, Indonesia. However, study regarding α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of E. elatior growing in Gayo highlands, Aceh, Indonesia, is completely lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of E. elatior ethanol extracts (EEEE) growing in Gayo highlands, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Methods Antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH procedure, whereas α-glucosidase inhibition assay was carried out using spectrophotometric method. Data analysis was performed using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Duncan’s multiple range test at α=0.05. Results Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), and total tannin (TTC) content in all E. elatior plant parts, in which the highest TPC was found in the stem (158.38 GAE/g), whereas the highest TFC and TTC was obtained in the rhizome extracts. The extract of fruit showed the strongest antioxidant activities, followed by the stem and leaf, with IC50 of 2.381 μg/mL, 6.966 μg/mL, and 19.365 μg/mL, respectively. All E. elatior extracts revealed a significant inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase at the concentration of 500 μg/mL, in which the stem extract showed the most effective α-glucosidase inhibitory effect with IC50 value of 5.15 μg/mL, suggesting its promising potential as antidiabetic agent. Conclusions This study highlights E. elatior potency as a novel source of antioxidant and natural antidiabetic compounds that are useful for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

                The polysaccharides pectin and chitosan are derived from the fruit peels and exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects, respectively. Their biocompatibility and renewability make them suitable for use in food products. The size of the swelling and degradation of these cells can be controlled using different combinations. Pectin and chitosan are useful as medication delivery systems, where they can be integrated to control the dosages and residence times of pharmaceuticals. They have a wide range of applications such as wound dressings, body fat reducers, tissue engineering agents, and drug delivery agents. Addressing teeth loss with the use of dental implants is a critical element of dental care. In most cases, healing is time-consuming and painful. As a result of adding new materials to the implant surface, the healing process would accelerate, and medications would be delivered to the implant site with greater efficiency.

                <p>by Clémence Bergerot, Wolfram Barfuss, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Humans tend to give more weight to information confirming their beliefs than to information that disconfirms them. Nevertheless, this apparent irrationality has been shown to improve individual decision-making under uncertainty. However, little is known about this bias’ impact on decision-making in a social context. Here, we investigate the conditions under which confirmation bias is beneficial or detrimental to decision-making under social influence. To do so, we develop a Collective Asymmetric Reinforcement Learning (CARL) model in which artificial agents observe others’ actions and rewards, and update this information asymmetrically. We use agent-based simulations to study how confirmation bias affects collective performance on a two-armed bandit task, and how resource scarcity, group size and bias strength modulate this effect. We find that a confirmation bias benefits group learning across a wide range of resource-scarcity conditions. Moreover, we discover that, past a critical bias strength, resource abundance favors the emergence of two different performance regimes, one of which is suboptimal. In addition, we find that this regime bifurcation comes with polarization in small groups of agents. Overall, our results suggest the existence of an optimal, moderate level of confirmation bias for decision-making in a social context.

Accumulation processes, where many potentially coupled features are acquired over time, occur throughout the sciences, from evolutionary biology to disease progression, and particularly in the study of cancer progression. Existing methods for learning the dynamics of such systems typically assume limited (often pairwise) relationships between feature subsets, cross-sectional or untimed observations, small feature sets, or discrete orderings of events. Here we introduce HyperTraPS-CT (Hypercubic Transition Path Sampling in Continuous Time) to compute posterior distributions on continuous-time dynamics of many, arbitrarily coupled, traits in unrestricted state spaces, accounting for uncertainty in observations and their timings. We demonstrate the capacity of HyperTraPS-CT to deal with cross-sectional, longitudinal, and phylogenetic data, which may have no, uncertain, or precisely specified sampling times. HyperTraPS-CT allows positive and negative interactions between arbitrary subsets of features (not limited to pairwise interactions), supporting Bayesian and maximum-likelihood inference approaches to identify these interactions, consequent pathways, and predictions of future and unobserved features. We also introduce a range of visualisations for the inferred outputs of these processes and demonstrate model selection and regularisation for feature interactions. We apply this approach to case studies on the accumulation of mutations in cancer progression and the acquisition of anti-microbial resistance genes in tuberculosis, demonstrating its flexibility and capacity to produce predictions aligned with applied priorities.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in assistive exoskeletons; both passive and active devices have reduced metabolic costs near preferred walking speed by assisting muscle actions. Metabolic reductions at multiple speeds should thus also be attainable. Musculoskeletal simulation can potentially predict the interaction between assistive moments, muscle-tendon mechanics, and walking energetics. In this study, we simulated devices’ optimal assistive moments based on minimal muscle activations during walking with prescribed kinematics and dynamics. We used a generic musculoskeletal model with tuned muscle-tendon parameters and computed metabolic rates from muscle actions. We then simulated walking across multiple speeds and with two ideal actuation modes–motor-based and spring-based–to assist ankle plantarflexion, knee extension, hip flexion, and hip abduction and compared computed metabolic rates. We found that both actuation modes considerably reduced physiological joint moments but did not always reduce metabolic rates. Compared to unassisted conditions, motor-based ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion assistance reduced metabolic rates, and this effect was more pronounced as walking speed increased. Spring-based hip flexion and abduction assistance increased metabolic rates at some walking speeds despite a moderate decrease in some muscle activations. Both modes of knee extension assistance reduced metabolic rates to a small extent, even though the actuation contributed with practically the entire net knee extension moment during stance. Motor-based hip abduction assistance reduced metabolic rates more than spring-based assistance, though this reduction was relatively small. Our study also suggests that an assistive strategy based on minimal muscle activations might result in a suboptimal reduction of metabolic rates. Future work should experimentally validate the effects of assistive moments and refine modeling assumptions accordingly. Our computational workflow is freely available online.

Integrins are fundamental for cell adhesion and the formation of focal adhesions (FA). Accordingly, these receptors guide embryonic development, tissue maintenance, and haemostasis but are also involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. A detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that drive integrin activation, FA assembly, and downstream signalling cascades is critical. Here, we reveal a direct association of paxillin, a marker protein of FA sites, with the cytoplasmic tails of the integrin β1 and β3 subunits. The binding interface resides in paxillin’s LIM3 domain, where based on the NMR structure and functional analyses, a flexible, 7-amino acid loop engages the unstructured part of the integrin cytoplasmic tail. Genetic manipulation of the involved residues in either paxillin or integrin β3 compromises cell adhesion and motility of murine fibroblasts. This direct interaction between paxillin and the integrin cytoplasmic domain identifies an alternative, kindlin-independent mode of integrin outside-in signalling particularly important for integrin β3 function.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion/deletions syndrome (MDDS) comprises a group of diseases caused by primary autosomal defects of mtDNA maintenance. Our objective was to study the etiology of MDDS in 4 patients who lack pathogenic variants in known genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing of the probands was performed to identify pathogenic variants. We validated the mitochondrial defect by analyzing mtDNA, mitochondrial dNTP pools, respiratory chain activities, and GUK1 activity. To confirm pathogenicity of GUK1 deficiency, we expressed 2 GUK1 isoforms in patient cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic <i>GUK1</i> pathogenic variants in all 4 probands who presented with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and myopathic proximal limb weakness, as well as variable hepatopathy and altered T-lymphocyte profiles. Muscle biopsies from all probands showed mtDNA depletion, deletions, or both, as well as reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. <i>GUK1</i> encodes guanylate kinase, originally identified as a cytosolic enzyme. Long and short isoforms of GUK1 exist. We observed that the long isoform is intramitochondrial and the short is cytosolic. In probands’ fibroblasts, we noted decreased GUK1 activity causing unbalanced mitochondrial dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in both replicating and quiescent fibroblasts indicating that GUK1 deficiency impairs de novo and salvage nucleotide pathways. Proband fibroblasts treated with deoxyguanosine and/or forodesine, a purine phosphatase inhibitor, ameliorated mtDNA depletion, indicating potential pharmacological therapies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Primary GUK1 deficiency is a new and potentially treatable cause of MDDS. The cytosolic isoform of GUK1 may contribute to the T-lymphocyte abnormality, which has not been observed in other MDDS disorders. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Neuroinflammation is a feature of both neurodegenerative disease and normal brain aging. The roles of type I interferon (IFN-I) in the aged brain are incompletely understood. A recent article by Roy et al. reveals pervasive IFN-I activity in normal mouse brain aging, and highlights the importance of microglial IFN-I signaling in neuroinflammation.

                A workhorse tool of economic decision-making has long sought to get inside people’s heads through careful examination of their choices. In this issue of Neuron, Carandini flips the script, showing how it can model how the brain makes sensory choices.

                By establishing semaphorin 6D expression in the amygdala as a central coordinator of brain, metabolic, and immunologic function, the Neuron publication by Nakanishi et al. provides new insight to how primary brain deficiency impacts physiological systems beyond the brain.

                In this issue of Neuron, Torres-Berrío et al. show that stress-susceptible mice exhibit elevated H3K27me1 levels in nucleus accumbens neurons due to the action of the SUZ12 VEFS domain, strengthening the link between specific epigenetic changes and long-lasting stress-induced social, emotional, and cognitive alterations.

                Genetic risk for schizophrenia spans the entire genome. Borcuk et al. show that network neighbors of risk genes also harbor risk, most evidently in excitatory neurons. They leverage this property to propose potential risk genes that are “guilty by association.” Stem cell data support the link between these genes and schizophrenia risk.

                Proteasomes are essential molecular machines responsible for the degradation of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Altered proteasome activity has been linked to neurodegeneration, auto-immune disorders and cancer. Despite the relevance for human disease and drug development, no method currently exists to monitor proteasome composition and interactions in vivo in animal models. To fill this gap, we developed a strategy based on tagging of proteasomes with promiscuous biotin ligases and generated a new mouse model enabling the quantification of proteasome interactions by mass spectrometry. We show that biotin ligases can be incorporated in fully assembled proteasomes without negative impact on their activity. We demonstrate the utility of our method by identifying novel proteasome-interacting proteins, charting interactomes across mouse organs, and showing that proximity-labeling enables the identification of both endogenous and small-molecule-induced proteasome substrates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83838">White matter structural bases for phase accuracy during tapping synchronization</a></h4>

              
                We determined the intersubject association between the rhythmic entrainment abilities of human subjects during a synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) and the macro- and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (DWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the density of short-range fibers that run underneath the cortical mantle, interconnecting nearby cortical regions (U-fibers). Notably, individual differences in the density of U-fibers in the right audiomotor system were correlated with the degree of phase accuracy between the stimuli and taps across subjects. These correlations were specific to the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, a significant association was found between phase accuracy and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum, forming an interval-selective map where short and long intervals were behaviorally correlated with the anterior and posterior portions of the corpus callosum. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and DWM in the audiomotor system support the tapping synchronization abilities of subjects, as cortical U-fiber density is linked to the preferred tapping tempo and the bundle properties of the corpus callosum define an interval-selective topography.

">Modeling disorders of consciousness at the patient level reveals the network's influence on the diagnosis vs the local node parameters role in prognosis</a></h4>

              
                The study of disorders of consciousness (DoC) is very complex because patients are suffering from a wide variety of lesions, affected brain mechanisms, different symptom severity and are unable to communicate. Combining neuroimaging data and mathematical modeling can help us quantify and better describe some of these alterations. This study's goal is to provide a novel analysis and modeling pipeline for fMRI data leading to new diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers at the individual patient level. To do so, we project patient's fMRI data into a low dimension latent-space. We define the latent space's dimension as the smallest dimension able to maintain the complexity, non-linearities, and information carried by the data, according to different criteria that we detail in the first part. This dimensionality reduction procedure then allows us to build biologically inspired latent whole-brain models that can be calibrated at the single-patient level. In particular, we propose a new model inspired by the astrocyte regulation of neuronal activity in the brain. This modeling procedure leads to two types of model-based biomarkers (MBBs) that provide novel insight at different levels: (1) the connectivity matrices bring us information about the severity of the patient's diagnosis, and, (2) the local node parameters, correlate to the patient's etiology, age and prognosis.

">Neuronal autophagosomes are transported to astrocytes for degradation</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a vital catabolic process responsible for the degradation of cytosolic components, playing a key role in cellular homeostasis and survival. At synapses, autophagy is crucial for regulating neuronal activity and utilizes a specialized machinery. While considerable progress has been made in understanding the initiation of autophagy and autophagosome formation, the mechanisms governing the clearance of autophagosomes from synaptic sites remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a novel pathway in which astrocytes actively participate in the clearance of pre-synaptic autophagosomes. Using neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines expressing fluorescent autophagy markers and chimeric mouse models, we demonstrate that neuronal autophagosomal vesicles are physically transferred to astrocytes, a process that is enhanced when synaptic activity is suppressed. Autophagosome transfer does not require direct physical cellular contact, but it does require Dynamin and cholesterol-dependent endocytosis for the internalized neuronal autophagosomes to ultimately fuse with astrocytic lysosomes. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of neuronal autophagosome clearance that does not require slow axonal retrograde transport but their transfer to nearby astrocytes.

">Distinct neural manifolds and critical roles of primate caudate nucleus in multimodal decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decision-making is an important cognitive function involving distributed networks spanning cortico-subcortical levels, yet most studies only include single modality stimulus and reveal largely similar signals related with animal choice across areas, making it puzzling about individual's unique roles. Using a multimodal paradigm, here we showed dorsal medial striatum, namely caudate nucleus (CN) in primate, dramatically differs from association cortex in a reduced low-dimensional subspace. Specifically, bimodal neural state evolved towards nonvisual (vestibular) in CN, rather than towards visual as in frontal/parietal cortices. The distinct CN trajectories pattern may readily explain behaviors including close-to-vestibular but not visual reaction time under bimodal condition, or vestibular-overweighting during cue-conflict context. Further causal-link experiments including applying GABA-A-receptor agonist, and D1-receptor antagonist confirmed CN's essential role of dopaminergic input. Electrical-microstimulation also verified CN's sufficient contributions. Our results indicate beyond relay-station in cortico-striatal circuitry, CN plays distinct and critical roles in complex tasks with multimodal inputs.

">Sex-specific differences in brain activity dynamics of youth with a family history of substance use disorder</a></h4>

              
                An individual's risk of substance use disorder (SUD) is shaped by a complex interplay of potent biosocial factors. Current neurodevelopmental models posit vulnerability to SUD in youth is due to an overreactive reward system and reduced inhibitory control. Having a family history of SUD is a particularly strong risk factor, yet few studies have explored its impact on brain function and structure prior to substance exposure. Herein, we utilized a network control theory approach to quantify sex-specific differences in brain activity dynamics in youth with and without a family history of SUD, drawn from a large cohort of substance-naive youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. We summarize brain dynamics by calculating transition energy, which probes the ease with which a whole brain, region or network drives the brain towards a specific spatial pattern of activation (i.e., brain state). Our findings reveal that a family history of SUD is associated with alterations in the brain's dynamics wherein: i) independent of sex, certain regions' transition energies are higher in those with a family history of SUD and ii) there exist sex specific differences in SUD family history groups at multiple levels of transition energy (global, network, and regional). Family history-by-sex effects reveal that energetic demand is increased in females with a family history of SUD and decreased in males with a family history of SUD, compared to their same-sex counterparts with no SUD family history. Specifically, we localize these effects to higher energetic demands of the default mode network in females with a family history of SUD and lower energetic demands of attention networks in males with a family history of SUD. These results suggest a family history of SUD may increase reward saliency in males and decrease efficiency of top-down inhibitory control in females. This work could be used to inform personalized intervention strategies that may target differing cognitive mechanisms that predispose individuals to the development of SUD.

">Periventricular and Deep White Matter Hyperintensity Thresholds in Aging: Exponential Progression, Cognitive Decline, and Neuroanatomic Atrophy</a></h4>

              
                White matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are brain lesions associated with cerebral small vessel disease and aging, signify fiber loss and pruning. Analysis of T2-FLAIR MRI data from the NACC cohort, including cognitively normal (CN), cognitively impaired (CI), and Alzheimer's disease (CI-AD) subjects, revealed that a significant subset of participants, even those classified as CN, harbor substantial periventricular (PVWMH) and deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) loads, while others displayed minimal or no PVWMH and DWMH, across ages 50-94 years. In this study, we quantified the thresholds and progression kinetics of PVWMH and DWMH and their impact on cognitive performance and neuroanatomic changes in the aging cohort (NCN = 521, NCI = 146, NCI-AD = 319). Our findings explore the impact of PVWMH and DWMH loads on global and specific cognitive domains to determine whether cognitive impairments are directly induced by PVWMH and DWMH loads, or mediated through distinct neuroanatomic structures. PV and DWMH loads are higher in CI and CI-AD subjects compared to CN but the PVWMH and DWMH loads are not discriminative of CI and CI-AD. The progression kinetics of PVWMH and DWMH volume with age indicate an exponential rate of increase, with PVWMH escalating approximately twice as fast as DWMH particularly around an inflection point at 61 years of age. PVWMH load presents with increased probability of occurrence in frontal horn compared to occipital horn while DWMH is diffused and accumulates significantly at later age than that observed for PVWMH. Multivariate global regression suggested significant effect (p<0.01) of PVWMH on Trail making tests (TMTs)-A and B (executive function), animal naming tests (semantic memory), with no significant effects observed for DWMH load. Indeed, beyond a threshold of PVWMH volume >2.3 mL, significant deficits in TMTs were observed compared to the subjects without PVWMH load. A PVWMH volume >2.3 mL and DWMH >2.75 mL is significantly associated with impairments in attention & working memory (Digit Span Tests), and semantic memory. Noticeably, significant neuroanatomic atrophy in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, RMFG, precentral, and paracentral gyrus is observed for PVWMH load >2.3 mL, while DWMH load was not significantly associated with neuroanatomic loss. Furthermore, a mediation model employing neuroanatomic volumes as mediator, PVWMH load as predictor and cognitive tests as outcome suggested that PVWMH volume contributes significantly to deficits in TMT-B mediated through atrophy in precentral gyrus (64%), accumbens (39%), paracentral gyrus (32%), rostral middle frontal gyrus (31%), and lingual gyrus (30%), each contributing distinct proportions, alongside the direct effect. DWMH load did not emerge as a significant predictor (direct or indirect) for the cognitive deficits. Further, no significant neuroanatomic mediations from PVWMH load were observed for other cognitive tests indicative of direct involvement of PVWMH load. Global cognition like MMSE was affected only at a higher PVWMH accumulation (>6 ml).

We conducted a large-scale multi-site preregistered study (n > 260) to replicate and extend the findings underpinning this important relationship. We failed to replicate any of the major findings published previously in smaller studies. Musical training was related neither to enhanced spectral encoding strength of a speech stimulus (/da/) in babble nor to a stronger neural-stimulus correlation. Similarly, the strength of neural tracking of a speech sound with a time-varying pitch was not related to either years of musical training or age of onset of musical training. Our findings provide no evidence for plasticity of early auditory responses based on musical training and exposure.

">Cis-regulatory elements driving motor neuron-restricted viral payload expression within the mammalian spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Spinal motor neuron (MN) dysfunction is the cause of a number of clinically significant movement disorders. Despite the recent approval of gene therapeutics targeting these MN-related disorders, there are no viral delivery mechanisms that achieve MN-restricted transgene expression. In this study, chromatin accessibility profiling of genetically defined mouse MNs was used to identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) capable of driving MN-selective gene expression. Subsequent testing of these candidates identified two CREs that confer MN-selective gene expression in the spinal cord as well as reduced off-target expression in dorsal root ganglia. Within one of these candidate elements, we identified a compact core transcription factor (TF)-binding region that drives MN-selective gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that selective spinal cord expression of this mouse CRE is preserved in non-human primates. These findings suggest that the generation of cell-type-selective viral reagents, in which cell-type-selective CREs drive restricted gene expression, will be valuable research tools in mice and other mammalian species, with potentially significant therapeutic value in humans.

                <p>Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons provide direct input into several brain regions, including the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is important for image-forming vision, and the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), which is associated with nonimage-forming vision. Through both activity- and morphogen-dependent mechanisms, retinal inputs play important roles in the development of dLGN, including the refinement of retinal projections, morphological development of thalamocortical relay cells (TRCs), timing of corticogeniculate innervation, and recruitment and distribution of inhibitory interneurons. In contrast, little is known about the role of retinal inputs in the development of vLGN. Grossly, vLGN is divided into two domains, the retinorecipient external vLGN (vLGNe) and nonretinorecipient internal vLGN (vLGNi). Studies previously found that vLGNe consists of transcriptionally distinct GABAergic subtypes distributed into at least four adjacent laminae. At present, it remains unclear whether retinal inputs influence the development of these cell-type&ndash;specific neuronal laminae in vLGNe. Here, we elucidated the developmental timeline for these laminae in the mouse vLGNe, and results indicate that these laminae are specified at or before birth. We observed that mutant mice without retinal inputs have a normal laminar distribution of GABAergic cells at birth; however, after the first week of postnatal development, these mutants exhibited a dramatic disruption in the laminar organization of inhibitory neurons and clear boundaries between vLGNe and vLGNi. Overall, our results show that while the formation of cell-type&ndash;specific layers in mouse vLGNe does not depend on RGC inputs, retinal signals are critical for their maintenance.</p>

                Background White spot lesions (WSLs) are frequently linked with low microhardness and mineral content changes. several strategies have been employed to deal with these problems. This investigation aimed to analyze the microhardness and mineral content changes after remineralization with bioactive glass (BAG) and casein phospho-peptide-amorphous calcium phosphate with fluoride (CPP-ACPF). Methods Twenty sound maxillary first premolars extracted were used to obtain a total of one hundred enamel samples. forty enamel slabs were split into four experimental groups (n = 10 each): Group I, BAG; Group II, BAG+CPP-ACPF; Group III, CPP-ACPF varnish; and Group IV, artificial saliva (negative control). To create artificial WSLs, all samples were preserved in a prepared demineralizing agent for 72 h before treatment with remineralizing agents. Vickers microhardness test was performed. Additionally, 60 enamel samples were selected for analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and assigned to six experimental groups; the first four groups were similar to that used in the microhardness test along with Group V: WSLs, and Group VI: baseline. The statistical analyses employed in this study included Tukey’s HSD (p<0.05), one-way ANOVA, and Shapiro-Wilk. Result Regarding surface microhardness, the BAG+CPP-ACPF group showed the most favorable recovery, which was better than the outcomes of the BAG and CPP-ACPF groups. A statistically significant change (p <0.05) was not observed between them. Similarly, for mineral content change, the BAG+CPP-ACPF group demonstrated the greatest result, The BAG group came next, and the CPP-ACPF group came last. Conclusion The BAG+CPP-ACPF group might be regarded as the best course of treatment for enhancing both the surface microhardness and mineral content (Ca, P), while the control group (Artificial saliva) showed the least satisfactory results in comparison. After demineralization, mineral content and microhardness decreased in all samples. Therefore, BAG+CPP-ACPF significantly improved the surface microhardness and mineral content.

                Background Refurbishing encompasses the process of collecting used products, refurbishing them into new ones, and offering them to consumers. Within this framework, manufacturers can opt for either in-house refurbishing, managed internally, or outsource these operations to third parties and retailers. Methods Our study also takes into account the limited supply of remanufacturable products and incorporates customer behavior distinctions, differentiating between high-end and low-end customers in our models. The primary aim of this research is to formulate and analyze models for in-house refurbishing, refurbishing outsourcing to third parties, and refurbishing outsourcing to retailers. We seek to identify optimal solutions, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and implement strategies to maximize benefits. Additionally, we compare the in-house refurbishing model with the outsourcing refurbishing model. Leveraging multivariable function optimization techniques alongside the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker method, we endeavor to ascertain the optimal strategy, thereby facilitating a nuanced and methodical examination of the intricate dynamics governing profitability and sustainability within the refurbishing sector. Results Our study has applied rigorous mathematical modeling and optimization methodologies to identify optimal configurations for each model, aiming to enhance profitability across diverse parameters, including product quantities, quality selections, and pricing strategies. Conclusions Our analysis underscores that the in-house refurbishing approach tends to yield superior profits for profit-oriented enterprises, whereas outsourcing refurbishing to retailers is conducive to meeting environmental sustainability goals. Furthermore, our investigation has considered pivotal factors such as the constrained availability of remanufacturable products and consumer behavior, with a particular emphasis on discerning preferences among high-end and low-end clientele. We also perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of parameter variations on optimal outcomes. Our findings yield three distinct refurbishing models: the in-house refurbishing model, suitable for profit-driven companies under specific production cost parameters, and the outsourcing refurbishing to retailers model, tailored for environmentally-conscious companies, contingent upon particular production cost parameters.

Revealing the relationship between neural network structure and function is one central theme of neuroscience. In the context of working memory (WM), anatomical data suggested that the topological structure of microcircuits within WM gradient network may differ, and the impact of such structural heterogeneity on WM activity remains unknown. Here, we proposed a spiking neural network model that can replicate the fundamental characteristics of WM: delay-period neural activity involves association cortex but not sensory cortex. First, experimentally observed receptor expression gradient along the WM gradient network is reproduced by our network model. Second, by analyzing the correlation between different local structures and duration of WM activity, we demonstrated that small-worldness, excitation-inhibition balance, and cycle structures play crucial roles in sustaining WM-related activity. To elucidate the relationship between the structure and functionality of neural networks, structural circuit gradients in brain should also be subject to further measurement. Finally, combining anatomical data, we simulated the duration of WM activity across different brain regions, its maintenance relies on the interaction between local and distributed networks. Overall, network structural gradient and interaction between local and distributed networks are of great significance for WM.

                <p>by Zhichao Zhu, Yang Qi, Wenlian Lu, Jianfeng Feng</p>

Neural activity in the cortex exhibits a wide range of firing variability and rich correlation structures. Studies on neural coding indicate that correlated neural variability can influence the quality of neural codes, either beneficially or adversely. However, the mechanisms by which correlated neural variability is transformed and processed across neural populations to achieve meaningful computation remain largely unclear. Here we propose a theory of covariance computation with spiking neurons which offers a unifying perspective on neural representation and computation with correlated noise. We employ a recently proposed computational framework known as the moment neural network to resolve the nonlinear coupling of correlated neural variability with a task-driven approach to constructing neural network models for performing covariance-based perceptual tasks. In particular, we demonstrate how perceptual information initially encoded entirely within the covariance of upstream neurons’ spiking activity can be passed, in a near-lossless manner, to the mean firing rate of downstream neurons, which in turn can be used to inform inference. The proposed theory of covariance computation addresses an important question of how the brain extracts perceptual information from noisy sensory stimuli to generate a stable perceptual whole and indicates a more direct role that correlated variability plays in cortical information processing.

                <p>by Laura Collesano, Marta Łuksza, Michael Lässig</p>

Molecules of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) present short protein fragments on the cell surface, an important step in T cell immune recognition. MHC-I molecules process peptides from intracellular proteins; MHC-II molecules act in antigen-presenting cells and present peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Here we show that the sequence-dependent energy landscapes of MHC-peptide binding encode class-specific nonlinearities (epistasis). MHC-I has a smooth landscape with global epistasis; the binding energy is a simple deformation of an underlying linear trait. This form of epistasis enhances the discrimination between strong-binding peptides. In contrast, MHC-II has a rugged landscape with idiosyncratic epistasis: binding depends on detailed amino acid combinations at multiple positions of the peptide sequence. The form of epistasis affects the learning of energy landscapes from training data. For MHC-I, a low-complexity problem, we derive a simple matrix model of binding energies that outperforms current models trained by machine learning. For MHC-II, higher complexity prevents learning by simple regression methods. Epistasis also affects the energy and fitness effects of mutations in antigen-derived peptides (epitopes). In MHC-I, large-effect mutations occur predominantly in anchor positions of strong-binding epitopes. In MHC-II, large effects depend on the background epitope sequence but are broadly distributed over the epitope, generating a bigger target for escape mutations due to loss of presentation. Together, our analysis shows how an energy landscape of protein-protein binding constrains the target of escape mutations from T cell immunity, linking the complexity of the molecular interactions to the dynamics of adaptive immune response.

                <p>by Yujin Goto, Keiichi Kitajo</p>

Understanding the mechanism by which the brain achieves relatively consistent information processing contrary to its inherent inconsistency in activity is one of the major challenges in neuroscience. Recently, it has been reported that the consistency of neural responses to stimuli that are presented repeatedly is enhanced implicitly in an unsupervised way, and results in improved perceptual consistency. Here, we propose the term "selective consistency" to describe this input-dependent consistency and hypothesize that it will be acquired in a self-organizing manner by plasticity within the neural system. To test this, we investigated whether a reservoir-based plastic model could acquire selective consistency to repeated stimuli. We used white noise sequences randomly generated in each trial and referenced white noise sequences presented multiple times. The results showed that the plastic network was capable of acquiring selective consistency rapidly, with as little as five exposures to stimuli, even for white noise. The acquisition of selective consistency could occur independently of performance optimization, as the network’s time-series prediction accuracy for referenced stimuli did not improve with repeated exposure and optimization. Furthermore, the network could only achieve selective consistency when in the region between order and chaos. These findings suggest that the neural system can acquire selective consistency in a self-organizing manner and that this may serve as a mechanism for certain types of learning.

Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina. It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells, which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina. This calls for efficient methods, which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits. Here, we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility. STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings.

                <p>by Yanpeng Yang, Yanyi Zheng, Quan Zou, Jian Li, Hailin Feng</p>

The off-target activities within the CRISPR-Cas9 system remains a formidable barrier to its broader application and development. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of deep learning models in predicting these off-target effects, yet they encounter significant hurdles including imbalances within datasets and the intricacies associated with encoding schemes and model architectures. To surmount these challenges, our study innovatively introduces an Efficiency and Specificity-Based (ESB) class rebalancing strategy, specifically devised for datasets featuring mismatches-only off-target instances, marking a pioneering approach in this realm. Furthermore, through a meticulous evaluation of various One-hot encoding schemes alongside numerous hybrid neural network models, we discern that encoding and models of moderate complexity ideally balance performance and efficiency. On this foundation, we advance a novel hybrid model, the CRISPR-MCA, which capitalizes on multi-feature extraction to enhance predictive accuracy. The empirical results affirm that the ESB class rebalancing strategy surpasses five conventional methods in addressing extreme dataset imbalances, demonstrating superior efficacy and broader applicability across diverse models. Notably, the CRISPR-MCA model excels in off-target effect prediction across four distinct mismatches-only datasets and significantly outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art models in datasets comprising both mismatches and indels. In summation, the CRISPR-MCA model, coupled with the ESB rebalancing strategy, offers profound insights and a robust framework for future explorations in this field.

                <p>by Kath Nicholls, Paul D. W. Kirk, Chris Wallace</p>

Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields, with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction. Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error, but this is rarely used to inform the clustering. We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data. We cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures. We first introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this, DPMUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined. We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures, and clustering these patients using DPMUnc.

Joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) is a widely used statistical method that analyzes combined patterns of all species in a community, linking empirical data to ecological theory and enhancing community-wide prediction tasks. However, fitting JSDMs to large datasets is often computationally demanding and time-consuming. Recent studies have introduced new statistical and machine learning techniques to provide more scalable fitting algorithms, but extending these to complex JSDM structures that account for spatial dependencies or multi-level sampling designs remains challenging. In this study, we aim to enhance JSDM scalability by leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) resources for an existing fitting method. Our work focuses on the Hmsc R-package, a widely used JSDM framework that supports the integration of various dataset types into a single comprehensive model. We developed a GPU-compatible implementation of its model-fitting algorithm using Python and the TensorFlow library. Despite these changes, our enhanced framework retains the original user interface of the Hmsc R-package. We evaluated the performance of the proposed implementation across various model configurations and dataset sizes. Our results show a significant increase in model fitting speed for most models compared to the baseline Hmsc R-package. For the largest datasets, we achieved speed-ups of over 1000 times, demonstrating the substantial potential of GPU porting for previously CPU-bound JSDM software. This advancement opens promising opportunities for better utilizing the rapidly accumulating new biodiversity data resources for inference and prediction.

Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically. This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. However, it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. These nonlinear normal modes (NNM) are computable with a recently developed numerical <i>mode tool</i>. The goal was to compare the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems. In a user study consisting of three experiment parts, participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the NNM (Experiments 1 and 2) or purposefully arranged offset (Experiment 3). In all tested experiment variations, participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. Even for increased task accuracy (Experiment 2) and targets located away from the NNM (Experiment 3), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. Consequently, our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems. Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness.

                <p>by Rhian F. Walther, Courtney Lancaster, Jemima J. Burden, Franck Pichaud</p>

Cell shape remodeling is a principal driver of epithelial tissue morphogenesis. While progress continues to be made in our understanding of the pathways that control the apical (top) geometry of epithelial cells, we know comparatively little about those that control cell basal (bottom) geometry. To examine this, we used the <i>Drosophila</i> ommatidium, which is the basic visual unit of the compound eye. The ommatidium is shaped as a hexagonal prism, and generating this 3D structure requires ommatidial cells to adopt specific apical and basal polygonal geometries. Using this model system, we find that generating cell type–specific basal geometries starts with patterning of the basal extracellular matrix, whereby Laminin accumulates at discrete locations across the basal surface of the retina. We find the Dystroglycan receptor complex (DGC) is required for this patterning by promoting localized Laminin accumulation at the basal surface of cells. Moreover, our results reveal that localized accumulation of Laminin and the DGC are required for directing Integrin adhesion. This induces cell basal geometry remodeling by anchoring the basal surface of cells to the extracellular matrix at specific, Laminin-rich locations. We propose that patterning of a basal extracellular matrix by generating discrete Laminin domains can direct Integrin adhesion to induce cell shape remodeling in epithelial morphogenesis.

53BP1 is a well-established DNA damage repair factor that has recently emerged to critically regulate gene expression for tumor suppression and neural development. However, its precise function and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we showed that phosphorylation of 53BP1 at serine 25 by ATM is required for neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in cortical brain organoids. Dynamic phosphorylation of 53BP1-serine 25 controls 53BP1 target genes governing neuronal differentiation and function, cellular response to stress, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, ATM and RNF168 govern 53BP1’s binding to gene loci to directly affect gene regulation, especially at genes for neuronal differentiation and maturation. 53BP1 serine 25 phosphorylation effectively impedes its binding to bivalent or H3K27me3-occupied promoters, especially at genes regulating H3K4 methylation, neuronal functions, and cell proliferation. Beyond 53BP1, ATM-dependent phosphorylation displays wide-ranging effects, regulating factors in neuronal differentiation, cytoskeleton, p53 regulation, as well as key signaling pathways such as ATM, BDNF, and WNT during cortical organoid differentiation. Together, our data suggest that the interplay between 53BP1 and ATM orchestrates essential genetic programs for cell morphogenesis, tissue organization, and developmental pathways crucial for human cortical development.

<i>Vibrio coralliilyticus</i> is a pathogen of coral and shellfish, leading to devastating economic and ecological consequences worldwide. Although rising ocean temperatures correlate with increased <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> pathogenicity, the specific molecular mechanisms and determinants contributing to virulence remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a contact-dependent toxin delivery apparatus, in <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i>. We identified 2 omnipresent T6SSs that are activated at temperatures in which <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> becomes virulent; T6SS1 is an antibacterial system mediating interbacterial competition, whereas T6SS2 mediates anti-eukaryotic toxicity and contributes to mortality during infection of an aquatic model organism, <i>Artemia salina</i>. Using comparative proteomics, we identified the T6SS1 and T6SS2 toxin arsenals of 3 <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> strains with distinct disease etiologies. Remarkably, T6SS2 secretes at least 9 novel anti-eukaryotic toxins comprising core and accessory repertoires. We propose that T6SSs differently contribute to <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i>’s virulence: T6SS2 plays a direct role by targeting the host, while T6SS1 plays an indirect role by eliminating competitors.

<p>After anodal and sham transcranial direct current stimulation on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), changes in resting-state functional activity (fALFF) and L-DLPFC connectivity were assessed. fALFF changes were observed, alongside significant correlations between electric field magnitude and L-DLPFC connectivity, reaffirming tDCS effects in both proximal and distant cortical areas.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study investigated whether the electric field magnitude (E-field) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) changes resting-state brain activity and the L-DLPFC resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), given the variability in tDCS response and lack of understanding of how rsFC changes. Twenty-one healthy participants received either 2 mA anodal or sham tDCS targeting the L-DLPFC for 10 min. Brain imaging was conducted before and after stimulation. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), reflecting resting brain activity, and the L-DLPFC rsFC were analyzed to investigate the main effect of tDCS, main effect of time, and interaction effects. The E-field was estimated by modeling tDCS-induced individual electric fields and correlated with fALFF and L-DLPFC rsFC. Anodal tDCS increased fALFF in the left rostral middle frontal area and decreased fALFF in the midline frontal area (FWE <i>p</i> &lt; 0.050), whereas sham induced no changes. Overall rsFC decreased after sham (positive and negative connectivity, <i>p</i> = 0.001 and 0.020, respectively), with modest and nonsignificant changes after anodal tDCS (<i>p</i> = 0.063 and 0.069, respectively). No significant differences in local rsFC were observed among the conditions. Correlations were observed between the E-field and rsFC changes in the L-DLPFC (<i>r</i> = 0.385, <i>p</i> = 0.115), left inferior parietal area (<i>r</i> = 0.495, <i>p</i> = 0.037), and right lateral visual area (<i>r</i> = 0.683, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Single-session tDCS induced resting brain activity changes and may help maintain overall rsFC. The E-field in the L-DLPFC is associated with rsFC changes in both proximal and distally connected brain regions to the L-DLPFC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27073?af=R">Comparison of Perfusion Imaging Definitions of the No‐Reflow Phenomenon after Thrombectomy—What Is the Best Perfusion Imaging Definition?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The no-reflow phenomenon is a potential contributor to poor outcome despite successful thrombectomy. There are multiple proposed imaging-based definitions of no-reflow leading to wide variations in reported prevalence. We investigated the agreement between existing imaging definitions and compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients identified as having no-reflow.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an external validation of 4 existing published definitions of no-reflow in thrombectomy patients with extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale 2c to 3 (eTICI2c-3) angiographic reperfusion who underwent 24-hour perfusion imaging from 2 international randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA TNK part-1 and 2) and a multicenter prospective observational study. Receiver-operating-characteristic and Bayesian-information-criterion (BIC) analyses were performed with the outcome variable being dependent-or-dead at 90-days (modified Rankin Score [mRS] ≥3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 131 patients analyzed, the prevalence of no-reflow significantly varied between definitions (0.8–22.1%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was poor agreement between definitions (kappa 5/6 comparisons &lt;0.212). Among patients with no-reflow according to at least 1 definition, there were significant differences between definitions in the intralesional interside differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) (<i>p</i> = 0.006), cerebral blood volume (CBV) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and mean-transit-time (MTT) (<i>p</i> = 0.005). No-reflow defined by 3 definitions was associated with mRS ≥3 at 90 days. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry was the only definition that improved model fit on BIC analysis (ΔBIC = −8.105) and demonstrated an association between no-reflow and clinical outcome among patients with eTICI3 reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Existing imaging definitions of no-reflow varied significantly in prevalence and post-treatment perfusion imaging profile, potentially explaining the variable prevalence of no-reflow reported in literature. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry best discriminated for functional outcome at 90 days, including patients with eTICI3 reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                We describe the evolution of a bioinformatics national capacity from scattered professionals into a collaborative organisation, and advancements in the adoption of the bioinformatics infrastructure philosophy by the national community. The Romanian Society of Bioinformatics (RSBI), a national professional society, was founded in 2019 to accelerate the development of Romanian bioinformatics. Incrementally, RSBI expanded its role to include: i) developing a community and engaging the public and stakeholders, ii) a national training approach, including through increased interactions with European training resources, and iii) advocating national participation in European bioinformatics infrastructures. In a next step RSBI led the development of the national bioinformatics infrastructure, the Romanian Bioinformatics Cluster (CRB) with the mission to act as an ELIXIR National Node. In this paper we report both the successful projects in training, public engagement, and policy projects, as well as initiatives related to data federation that, while not successful, can serve as valuable learning experiences for future implementations. We explain CRB’s structure and the role such an entity can play in the national bioinformatics infrastructure for data, tools, and training. Finally, we offer insights into the evolving role of the bioinformatics professional society and the synergies and interactions with the National ELIXIR Node

                Background The consultancy industry, valued at £18.6 billion, faces evolving challenges and opportunities in the post-COVID era. Consultancy and bid writing firms play a critical role in helping businesses secure contracts and funding, particularly through the preparation of Pre-Qualification Questionnaires (PQQs) and Invitations to Tender (ITTs). Despite the importance of bid writing, there is limited literature on how it can be leveraged for lead generation and business growth. Methods A mixed-methods approach was employed in this study, combining qualitative and quantitative research. Secondary research involved the review of existing literature and data from government databases, internal company records, and published reports. Primary research included surveys and semi-structured interviews with professionals from the Facilities Management and Logistics sectors. A case study of a UK-based bid-writing consultancy was also used to support the analysis. Results The findings highlighted significant knowledge gaps in bid writing among businesses, with only 12.5% of survey respondents expressing confidence in their bid-writing abilities. Despite this, 83.1% showed interest in receiving bid-writing training. The study also revealed that expertise, relationships, and past work are prioritized by businesses when selecting consultancy firms. Additionally, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business operations was identified as a key factor for enhancing efficiency and maintaining competitiveness. Conclusions There is a clear opportunity for consultancy and bid-writing firms to address the knowledge gaps in bid writing by offering targeted training programs. Effective networking and a robust social media presence are essential for generating new business leads and maintaining client relationships. Furthermore, integrating AI technologies into business operations can provide consultancy firms with a competitive edge. This study provides actionable insights for consultancy and bid-writing firms to enhance their lead generation strategies and improve their market positioning.

                Background This study investigates the factors influencing rural women’s participation in credit programs in Gubalafto Wereda. Understanding these determinants is crucial for improving program effectiveness and supporting women’s economic empowerment in the region. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 364 rural women from four kebeles, selected through stratified random sampling based on agro-ecological characteristics. Data were collected via interviews and analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, and logit regression models to determine the significance of various factors affecting participation. Results Descriptive statistics revealed key associations between participation and factors such as household size, income level, educational status, perception of group collateral, skill training, and distance from lending offices. Chi-square tests showed significant relationships, while t-tests identified differences between participants and non-participants. Logit regression analysis indicated that household size, income level, educational status, group collateral, skill training, and proximity to lending offices significantly influenced credit participation at the 1% level (p<0.01). Experience with income-generating activities and perception of interest rates were significant at the 5% level (p<0.05). Market access was significant at the 10% level (p<0.10). Positive factors included household size and income level, while age, distance from lending offices, and perception of interest rates had negative effects. Conclusion The study highlights that specific factors significantly impact rural women’s participation in credit programs. To enhance program effectiveness, stakeholders should address these determinants and develop robust institutional frameworks with effective monitoring and evaluation systems.

                Several metabolites have been shown to have independent and at times unexpected biological effects outside of their metabolic pathways. These include succinate, lactate, fumarate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate. 2-Hydroxybutyrate (2HB) is a byproduct of endogenous cysteine synthesis, produced during periods of cellular stress. 2HB rises acutely after exercise; it also rises during infection and is also chronically increased in a number of metabolic disorders. We show here that 2HB inhibits branched-chain aminotransferase enzymes, which in turn triggers a SIRT4-dependent shift in the compartmental abundance of protein ADP-ribosylation. The 2HB-induced decrease in nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation leads to a C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional response in the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway. This response to 2HB exposure leads to an improved oxidative capacity in vitro. We found that repeated injection with 2HB can replicate the improvement to oxidative capacity that occurs following exercise training. Together, we show that 2-HB regulates fundamental aspects of skeletal muscle metabolism.

">Phonetic underpinnings of sound symbolism across multiple domains of meaning</a></h4>

              
                Sound symbolism occurs when the sound of a word alone can convey its meaning, e.g. balloon and spike sound rounded and pointed, respectively. Sound-symbolic correspondences are widespread in natural languages, but it is unclear how they are instantiated across different domains of meaning. Here, participants rated auditory pseudowords on opposing scales of seven different sound-symbolic domains: shape (rounded-pointed), texture (hard-soft), weight (light-heavy), size (small-big), brightness (bright-dark), arousal (calming-exciting), and valence (good-bad). Ratings showed cross-domain relationships, some mirroring those between corresponding physical domains, e.g. size and weight ratings were associated, reflecting a physical size-weight relationship, while others involved metaphorical mappings, e.g., bright/dark mapped onto good/bad, respectively. The phonetic features of the pseudowords formed unique sets with characteristic feature weightings for each domain and tended to follow the cross-domain ratings relationships. These results suggest that sound-symbolic correspondences rely on domain-specific patterns of phonetic features, with cross-domain correspondences reflecting physical or metaphorical relationships.

">Temporal proteomic and PTMomic atlas of cerebral organoid development</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral organoids (CBOs) are generated from pluripotent stem cells that undergo neuroectoderm specification and neuronal differentiation in three dimensions. The developing neurons in CBOs migrate and self-organize into cerebral cortex-like layers, mimicking human brain development. CBOs develop according to intrinsic signaling mechanisms and offer unique insights into mechanisms of early human brain development. This process requires coordinated spatiotemporal regulation of protein expression and function, where the latter can be achieved by post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins. Despite the importance of proteins in brain development and function, profiling of protein abundance and the involvement of PTMs in CBO development remain underexplored. To gain insight into protein and PTM abundance in CBOs, we performed a high-resolution temporal analysis of CBOs up to day 200 using proteomics, PTMomics and metabolomics. We quantified more than 9,300 proteins and various neurodevelopmentally relevant PTMs (including phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, sialylated N-glycosylation, and cysteine modifications). We demonstrate that protein abundance and dynamic PTMs show significant temporal changes during CBO development related to neuronal differentiation and energy metabolism, whereas calcium signaling is mainly regulated by dynamic PTMs. We further show that synaptic protein content correlated with neurotransmitter levels, and we detected astroglia beyond day 100. Lastly, comparative analysis showed proteomic similarities between CBOs and human fetal brain tissue, supporting the physiological relevance of CBOs. Overall, our study presents a temporal atlas of protein and PTM abundance in CBOs and provides a valuable resource for studying neurodevelopment in neural organoids.

">Predictive Coding of Reward in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental objective of the brain is to anticipate future outcomes. This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. The hippocampal cognitive map is believed to be one such internal model. However, evidence for predictive coding and reward sensitivity in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. In fact, it raises the question of what kind of spatial representation is most useful for learning and maximizing future rewards? Here, we track the evolution of reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. Our findings reveal a highly organized restructuring of hippocampal reward representations during the learning process. Specifically, we found multiple lines of evidence, both at the population and single-cell levels, that hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward over weeks. Namely, both population-level information about reward and the percentage of reward-tuned neurons decrease over time. At the same time, the representation of the animals' choice and reward approach period (the period between choice and reward) increased over time. By tracking individual reward cells across sessions, we found that neurons initially tuned for reward shifted their tuning towards choice and reward approach periods, indicating that reward cells backpropagate their tuning to anticipate reward with experience. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, highlighting their critical role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.

">Attention defines the context for implicit sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Movement errors are used to continuously recalibrate the sensorimotor map, a process known as sensorimotor adaptation. Here we examined how attention influences this automatic and obligatory learning process. Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which the visual feedback that provided information about the movement outcome was either attended or unattended. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of adaptation. We next used a dual-task methodology to examine the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Here, again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused or divided attention conditions. Interestingly, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: Attended stimuli serve as cues that define the context for learning. The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. Together, these results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.

">Cholinergic signaling differentially regulates song premotor circuits to stabilize songs in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic modulation plays an important role in motor skill learning, including vocal learning. In songbirds, song premotor nucleus RA simultaneously receives inputs from song nuclei HVC and LMAN, and then its projection neurons (RAPNs) generate song motor control output. Using electrophysiological and pharmacological methods, we found that cholinergic signaling can enhance song stability by reducing HVC-RAPN excitatory synaptic transmission in adult male zebra finches, mediated by mAChRs. Although nAChRs are not effective overall, cholinergic signaling can also decrease LMAN-RAPN excitatory synaptic transmission induced by electrical stimulation via nAChRs, suggesting the potential role of cholinergic regulation in song behavior through LMAN-RA pathway. On the contrary, in adult female zebra finches, only LMAN-RAPN synaptic transmission was reduced by cholinergic signaling via mAChRs. The role of differential cholinergic regulation of song premotor circuits in songbirds' singing provides insights into the neural processes of motor skill learning.

">Revealing the co-existence of written and spoken language coding neural populations in the left-ventral occipitotemporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Reading relies on the ability to map written symbols with speech sounds. The left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (left-vOT) plays a crucial role in this process. Through the automatization of the mapping ability, this specific part of the ventral visual pathway (a.k.a., the Visual Word Form Area) progressively becomes specialized in written word recognition. Yet, despite its key role in reading, the area also responds to speech. This observation raises questions about the actual nature of neural representations encoded in the left-vOT and, therefore, the underlying mechanism of the cross-modal responses. Here, we addressed this issue by applying fine-grained analyses of within- and cross-modal repetition suppression effects (RSEs) and Multi-Voxel Pattern Analyses in fMRI and sEEG experiments. Convergent evidence across analysis methods and protocols showed significant RSEs and successful decoding in both within-modal visual and auditory conditions suggesting that subpopulations of neurons within the left-vOT distinctly encode written and spoken language inputs. This functional organization of neural populations enables the area to respond to speech input directly and indirectly, i.e., after speech sounds are converted to orthographic representations. The finding opens further discussions on how the human brain may be prepared and adapted for an acquisition of a complex ability such as reading.

">The sodium leak channel NALCN is regulated by neuronal SNARE complex proteins</a></h4>

              
                The sodium leak channel NALCN is vital for the regulation of electrical activity in neurons and other excitable cells, and mutations in the channel or its auxiliary proteins lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that the neuronal SNARE complex proteins syntaxin and SNAP25, which enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system, inhibit the activity of the NALCN channel complex in both heterologous systems and primary neurons. The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signalling directly, and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction may offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein-containing complexes.

                Following ischemic stroke, Ccl5 mRNA expression increased, while miR-324-5p expression decreased in the peri-infract cortex of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. However, the roles of CCL5 and miR-324-5p in stroke remain unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CCL5 using antibodies or miR-324-5p not only reduced infarct area and preserved neurological function in MCAO mice but also attenuated astrocyte and microglia activation, protected dendritic structures, and maintained spine density. In an astrocyte-neuron co-culture system after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), knockdown astrocytic CCL5 expression by antibody or miR-324-5p decreased neuronal apoptosis and preserved dendritic architecture. Importantly, the suppression of CCL5 enhanced the activation of the ERK/CREB pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with these findings, the application of Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, reduced infarct size, decreased neuronal apoptosis, and upregulated the ERK/CREB pathway in neurons treated with OGD. In conclusion, targeting the CCL5 pathway via miR-324-5p represents a promising therapeutic strategy for alleviating ischemic stroke damage through modulation of neuronal CCR5/ERK/CREB pathway.

">Adolescent development of anxiety-related behavior and shifts in behavioral responsiveness to estradiol in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Early pubertal onset during adolescence is consistently linked with increased risk of anxiety and depression in girls. Although estradiol tends to have anxiolytic effects in adulthood, whether sensitivity to estradiol's anxiolytic actions increases during adolescence is not clear. Using a rodent model, the current study tested the hypothesis that a shift in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of estradiol occurs during adolescence. To test this hypothesis, prepubertal and adult C57BL/6 female mice were ovariectomized, implanted with vehicle- or estradiol-filled silastic capsules, and behavioral tested one week later in the open field and elevated zero maze. Our hypothesis predicted that estradiol would decrease anxiety-related behavior to a greater extent in adults than in adolescent females, however, our results did not support this hypothesis. In the open field, estradiol implants significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior in adolescent females (relative to vehicle) and had little to no effect on the behavior of adults. These data suggest that adolescence is associated with a downward shift in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of estradiol on behavior in the open field. In contrast, although estradiol treatment did not influence anxiety-like responses in the elevated zero maze in early adolescent or adult females, adolescent females displayed significantly higher levels of anxiety-like behavior than adults. These findings demonstrate that substantial changes in anxiety-related behavior occur during adolescence, including a context-dependent shift in behavioral responsiveness to estradiol.

">Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic input to the lateral habenula modulates consumption of palatable diet components in male Wistar rats</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenula (LHb), a small epithalamic nucleus, modifies downstream midbrain dopamine neuron output to regulate negative state and aversion. Furthermore, specific glutamatergic input, from, among others, lateral hypothalamus and central amygdala to LHb modulates consumption of (palatable) diet components. However, it is currently unclear if blockade of all glutamatergic input to the LHb is sufficient to alter eating behavior. Here, we used a pharmacological approach to inhibit all glutamatergic input to the LHb by bilateral infusion of either an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist (CNQX) or an NMDA receptor antagonist (AP5) in the LHb of male Wistars rats. We then measured consumption of various palatable diets a control diet, a free-choice high-fat diet (fcHFD), a free-choice high-sugar diet (fcHSD), and a free-choice high-fat high-sugar diet (fcHFHSD)] at various timepoints up to 24h following infusion. Rats consumed their respective diets for 14 days before infusion of vehicle, CNQX or AP5, performed in counter-balanced random order. Infusion of CNQX or AP5 did not acutely (i.e. 1, 3, or 6h following infusion) affect consumption of a fcHFHSD component. Infusion of AP5 decreased fat intake at later time points (i.e. 10 or 24h following infusion) in fcHFHSD- and fcHFD-fed, but not fcHSD-fed, rats. Combined infusion of CNQX and AP5 decreased sucrose water consumption at 24h following infusion in fcHFHSD-fed rats. Collectively, these observations indicate that blocking glutamatergic transmission in the LHb does not have a major impact on acute consumption of a palatable free-choice diet components. Nonetheless, more subtle long-term effects were observed, suggesting a modulatory role of LHb in eating behavior in the current experimental set-up.

                The communication between the brain and digestive tract is critical for optimising nutrient preference and food intake, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood1-7. Here, we show that a gut-brain-gut circuit loop gates sugar ingestion in flies. We discovered that brain neurons regulating food ingestion, IN18, receive excitatory input from enteric sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a stomach-like food storage organ. While IN1s are persistently activated upon ingestion of sugar-rich foods, enteric motor neurons are continuously inhibited, causing the crop muscles to relax and enabling flies to consume large volumes of sugar. Our findings reveal a key interoceptive mechanism that underlies the rapid sensory monitoring and motor control of sugar ingestion within the digestive tract, optimising the diet of flies across varying metabolic states.

                Mitochondria have developed a specialized mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) to maintain proteostasis and promote recovery under stress conditions. Research in simple organisms has demonstrated that UPRmt activation in glial cells promotes proteostasis through beneficial non-cell-autonomous communication with neurons. However, the role of mitochondrial stress responses in the human brain remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we profiled the cell type-specific roles of the UPRmt using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal and glial cultures and brain organoids. We found that UPRmt activation induces metabolic rewiring in human microglia, resulting in a senescence phenotype mediated by S-adenosylmethionine availability for polyamine synthesis. Additionally, UPRmt disrupted microglial intercellular communication, leading to microglia-mediated dysfunction of phagocytic pathways and increased inflammatory signaling. Using microglia-brain-assembloids, we observed distinct contributions by microglia to brain senescence and neurodegenerative disease processes driven by mitochondrial stress responses. These findings underscore the profound impact of defects in mitochondrial proteostasis on intercellular networks during brain aging and disease.

">Generation of motor program diversity and variability through inhibitory circuit motifs in the Drosophila larval locomotor system</a></h4>

              
                How do neural networks generate and regulate diversity and variability in motor outputs with finite cellular components? Here we examine this problem by exploring the role that inhibitory neuron motifs play in generating mixtures of motor programs in the segmentally organised Drosophila larval locomotor system. We developed a computational model that is constrained by experimental calcium imaging data. The model comprises single-compartment cells with a single voltage-gated calcium current, which are interconnected by graded excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Local excitatory and inhibitory neurons form conditional oscillators in each hemisegment. Surrounding architecture reflects key aspects of inter- and intrasegmental connectivity motifs identified in the literature. The model generates metachronal waves of activity that recapitulate key features of fictive forwards and backwards locomotion, as well as bilaterally asymmetric activity in anterior regions that represents fictive head sweeps. The statistics of inputs to competing command-like motifs, coupled with inhibitory motifs that detect activity across multiple segments generate network states that promote diversity in motor outputs, while at the same time preventing maladaptive overlap in motor programs. Overall, the model generates testable predictions for connectomics and physiological studies while providing a platform for uncovering how inhibitory circuit motifs underpin generation of diversity and variability in motor systems.

">Does transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation alter pupil dilation? A living Bayesian meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a promising technique to modulate autonomic functions, and pupil dilation has been recognized as a promising biomarker for tVNS-induced monoaminergic release. Nevertheless, studies on the effectiveness of various tVNS protocols have produced heterogeneous results on pupil dilatation to date. Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional continuous and pulsed stimulation protocols using Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either continuous or pulsed stimulation protocols. Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis that tVNS increases pupil size (g = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.29], BF01 = 2.5). Separating studies according to continuous vs. pulsed protocols revealed that results were driven by studies using pulsed taVNS (strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis: g = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.53], BF10 = 14.15) while continuous tVNS provided strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.01, CI = [-0.15, 0.16], BF01= 20.7). In conclusion, our meta-analysis highlights differential effects of continuous and pulsed tVNS protocols on pupil dilation. These findings underscore the relevance of tVNS protocols in optimizing its use for specific applications that may require modulation of tonic vs. phasic monoaminergic responses.

">Histamine interferes with the early visual processing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal's behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, even at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modelling analysis suggests neuronal circuit effects, such as gain modulation via the H1 receptors in the retina. As nocturnal animals, facilitation of visual processing at low histamine level will be ethologically beneficial for mice to respond faster to visual threats when animals are less active during daytime.

">Elucidating the Selection Mechanisms in Context-Dependent Computation through Low-Rank Neural Network Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals exhibit a remarkable ability to selectively filter out irrelevant information based on context. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this context-dependent selection process remain elusive. Recently, the issue of discriminating between two prevalent selection mechanisms--input modulation versus selection vector modulation--with neural activity data has been highlighted as one of the major challenges in the study of individual variability underlying context-dependent decision-making (CDM). Here, we investigated these selection mechanisms through low-rank neural network modeling of the CDM task. We first showed that only input modulation was allowed in rank-one neural networks and additional dimensions of network connectivity were required to endow neural networks with selection vector modulation. Through rigorous information flow analysis, we gained a mechanistic understanding of why additional dimensions are required for selection vector modulation and how additional dimensions specifically contribute to selection vector modulation. This new understanding then led to the identification of novel neural dynamical signatures for selection vector modulation at both single neuron and population levels readily testable in experiments. Together, our results provide a rigorous theoretical framework linking network connectivity, neural dynamics and selection mechanisms, paving the way towards elucidating the circuit mechanisms when studying individual variability in context-dependent computation.

">Multisensory approach in Mental Imagery: ALE meta-analyses comparing Motor, Visual and Auditory Imagery</a></h4>

              
                Mental Imagery is a topic of longstanding and widespread scientific interest. Individual studies have typically focused on a single modality (e.g. Motor, Visual, Auditory) of Mental Imagery. Relatively little work has considered directly comparing and contrasting the brain networks associated with these different modalities of Imagery. The present study integrates data from 439 neuroimaging experiments to identify both modality-specific and shared neural networks involved in Mental Imagery. Comparing the networks involved in Motor, Visual, and Auditory Imagery identified a pattern whereby each form of Imagery preferentially recruited "higher level" associative brain regions involved in the associated "real" experience. Results also indicate significant overlap in a left-lateralized network including the pre-supplementary motor area, ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule. This pattern of results supports the existence of a "core" network that supports the attentional, spatial, and decision-making demands of Mental Imagery. Together these results offer new insights into the brain networks underlying human imagination.

">An Efficient Direct Conversion Strategy to Generate Functional Astrocytes from Human Adult Fibroblasts</a></h4>

              
                Direct reprogramming approaches offer an attractive alternative to stem-cell-derived models, allowing the retention of epigenetic information and age-associated cellular phenotypes, and providing an expedited method to generate target cell types. Several groups have previously generated multiple neuronal subtypes, neural progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and other cell types directly from fibroblasts. However, while some groups have had success at the efficient conversion of embryonic fibroblasts to astrocytes, they have not yet achieved similar conversion efficiency for adult human fibroblasts. To generate astrocytes for the study of adult-stage disorders, we developed an improved direct conversion strategy employing a combination of small molecules to activate specific pathways that induce trans-differentiation of human adult fibroblasts to astrocytes. We demonstrate that this method produces mature GFAP+/S100{beta}+ cells at high efficiency (40-45%), comparable to previous studies utilizing embryonic fibroblasts. Further, Fibroblast-derived induced Astrocytes (FdiAs) are enriched for markers of astrocyte functionality, including ion-channel buffering, gap-junction communication, and glutamate uptake; and exhibit astrocyte-like calcium signaling and neuroinflammatory phenotypes. RNA-Seq analysis indicates a close correlation to human brain astrocytes and iPSC-derived astrocyte models. Fibroblast-derived induced astrocytes provide a useful tool in studying the adult brain and complement existing in vitro models of induced neurons (iNs), providing an additional platform to study adult-stage brain disorders.

">Refining Brain Stimulation Therapies: An Active Learning Approach to Personalization</a></h4>

              
                Brain stimulation holds promise for treating brain disorders, but personalizing therapy remains challenging. Effective treatment requires establishing a functional link between stimulation parameters and brain response, yet traditional methods like random sampling (RS) are inefficient and costly. To overcome this, we developed an active learning (AL) framework that identifies optimal relationships between stimulation parameters and brain response with fewer experiments. We validated this framework through three experiments: (1) in silico modeling with synthetic data from a Parkinson's disease model, (2) in silico modeling with real data from a non-human primate, and (3) in vivo modeling with a real-time rat optogenetic stimulation experiment. In each experiment, we compared AL models to RS models, using various query strategies and stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency, pulse width). AL models consistently outperformed RS models, achieving lower error on unseen test data in silico (p<0.0056, N=1,000) and in vivo (p=0.0036, N=20). This approach represents a significant advancement in brain stimulation, potentially improving both research and clinical applications by making them more efficient and effective. Our findings suggest that AL can substantially reduce the cost and time required for developing personalized brain stimulation therapies, paving the way for more effective and accessible treatments for brain disorders.

">Motor decision-making under uncertainty and time pressure</a></h4>

              
                Purposeful movement often requires selection of a particular action from a range of alternatives, but how does the brain represent potential actions so that they can be compared for selection, and how are motor commands generated if movement is initiated before the final goal is identified? According to one hypothesis, the brain averages partially prepared motor plans to generate movement when there is goal uncertainty. This is consistent with the idea that motor decision making unfolds through competition between internal representations of alternative actions. An alternative hypothesis holds that only one movement, which is optimised for task performance, is prepared for execution at any time. Under this conception, decisions about the best motor goal given current information are completed upstream from neural circuits that perform motor planning. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we modified Alhussein and Smith (2021) experiment in which participants had to start reaching toward targets associated with opposite curl force-fields prior to knowing the correct target to reach. Crucially, we forced the participants to initiate movement immediately after target presentation (i.e. mean reaction times [~]250ms) so that they had limited opportunity to deliberate between the available alternatives. We found that the reaching dynamics reflected only those learnt for the selected reach direction, rather than a combination of those for the alternative targets presented, irrespective of the time available to initiate movement. The data are consistent with the conclusion that reaching dynamics were specified downstream of action selection under the target uncertainty conditions of this study.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYHere we found no evidence of "motor averaging" of reach dynamics for multiple potential actions when people had to respond as quickly as possible to uncertain target location cues. People exerted forces appropriate for the specific reach direction they selected irrespective of movement initiation time, suggesting that reaching dynamics were specified downstream of action selection.

">Four SpsP neurons are an integrating sleep regulation hub in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is an essential and conserved behavior, yet the mechanisms underlying sleep regulation remain largely unknown. To address the neural mechanisms of sleep drive, here we carry out whole brain calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) imaging of Drosophila and show that the activity of the protocerebral bridge (PB), a part of the central complex, correlates with sleep drive. Through a neural activation screen followed by anatomical and functional connectivity assays, we further narrow down the key player of sleep regulation in the PB to a three-layer circuit composed of 4 SpsP neurons and their upstream and downstream synaptic partners: the 4 SpsP neurons act as an integrating hub by responding to ellipsoid body (EB) signals from EPG neurons, and by sending signals back to the EB through PEcG neurons. Moreover, sleep deprivation enriches the presynaptic active zones of SpsP neurons and strengthens the connections of the EPG-SpsP-PEcG circuit, indicating plasticity gating in the circuit in response to sleep drive change. As the SpsP neurons also receive input from the sensorimotor brain region and given their known role in navigation, these neurons potentially further integrate sleep drive with other sensorimotor cues. The data taken together indicate that the four SpsP neurons and their sleep regulatory circuit play an important and dynamic role in sleep regulation.

">FaPDA: Facial paralysis detection algorithm applied in mice</a></h4>

              
                Facial paralysis is characterized by an injury to the facial nerve, causing the loss of the functions of the structures that it innervates and changes in the central nervous system in the motor cortex. Therefore, it is important to use experimental models to further the neurophysiological study. Currently, the models have some limitations for the study of facial paralysis. Therefore, the development of an algorithm capable of automatically detecting facial paralysis and overcoming the existing limitations is proposed. C57/BL6 mice were used, which produced irreversible facial paralysis with permanent effects and reversible facial paralysis, where the effects of the paralysis disappear within the first 15 days after the nerve injury. Video recordings were made of the faces of paralyzed mice to develop the algorithm for detecting facial paralysis applied to mice, which allows us to detect the presence of reversible and irreversible facial paralysis automatically. At the same time, the algorithm was used to track facial movement during oral stimulation with sucrose and extracellular electrophysiological recordings in the anterolateral motor cortex. In the basal state, mice can make facial expressions associated with a pleasurable state, and the algorithm detects this movement; at the same time, the movement correlates with the activation in the cortical area. In the presence of facial paralysis, the algorithm can not detect movement. Therefore, it concludes that the condition exists, and the neuronal activity in the cortex is affected with respect to the evolution of facial paralysis. Therefore, the facial paralysis detection algorithm applied to mice allows deduce the presence of experimental facial paralysis, in the presence of oral stimulation or without it, at the same time that cortical electrophysiological recordings can be made for the neurophysiological study of facial paralysis.

">Neural population dynamics during sleep in a songbird vocal circuit resemble sharp wave ripple activity</a></h4>

              
                During vocal learning, juvenile songbirds use auditory feedback and trial-and-error motor learning to transition from acoustically simple, highly variable songs to complex and stereotypical adult songs. Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during offline sleep periods. In this work, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate neural activity in the AFP during offline periods of natural sleep. We found that neurons in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) transitioned from sparse synchronous firing to asynchronous firing during sleep, which corresponded to slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, respectively. SWS periods were associated with increased spiking variability for LMAN neurons, but not for neurons in the striatal region Area X (proper name). Coinciding with the increased spiking variability, we observed that populations of LMAN neurons were co-activated at specific time points during sleep in bursting events that were characterized by a negative deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. Overall, the LMAN population bursting events were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong cross-area field coherence between LMAN and Area X, although individual LMAN-Area X LFP pairs did show coherence > 0.5. These results provide the first description of cross-area dynamics within the AFP during sleep. Furthermore, the observation of SWR-like events during sleep in LMAN suggests that large-scale population events have diverse functions across vertebrates.

	<p>Altered sensory processing especially in the auditory system is considered a typical observation in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Auditory temporal processing is known to be impaired in ASD children. Although research suggests that auditory temporal processing abnormalities could be responsible for the core aspects of ASD, few studies have examined early time processing and their results have been conflicting. The present event-related potential (ERP) study investigated the early neural responses to duration and inter-stimulus interval (ISI) deviants in nonspeech contexts in children with ASD and a control group of typically developing (TD) children matched in terms of age and IQ. A passive auditory oddball paradigm was employed to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN) for change detection considering both the duration and ISI-based stimulus. The MMN results showed that the ASD group had a relatively diminished amplitude and significant delayed latency in response to duration deviants. The findings are finally discussed in terms of hyper-hyposensitivity of auditory processing and the fact that the observed patterns may potentially act as risk factors for ASD development within the research domain criteria (RDoC) framework.</p>

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-997/v1?src=rss">A practical approach to febrile cancer patients:  Diagnostic stewardship in Oncology units [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Cancer and cytotoxic chemotherapy used for its treatment predispose to severe and often fatal infections. Prompt diagnosis and timely antibiotic therapy are crucial, with delays in therapy initiation having high mortality. Complete blood count (CBC) is an inexpensive, standardized, and preliminary investigation for the management and follow-up of cancer patients with diagnostic and prognostic value. Method We studied the types of infections associated with various cancers treated with chemotherapy, their etiologies and susceptibility patterns, and the hematological profile of these patients as predictors of infection. Results A total of 21 patients (12 solid and 9 hematological malignancies) presented with 31 febrile episodes. White Blood cell count (2079 cells/cu. mm), percentage of neutrophils (52.9%), absolute neutrophil (137.5 cells/cu. mm), and platelet count (1,77,507 cells/cu. mm) were significantly lower in the 11 patients with febrile neutropenia. The absolute lymphocyte count (412.7 cells/cu. mm) was reduced with a strikingly low Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (6.07) in patients with neutropenia. Laboratory and radiological evidence were present in 14/15 episodes of hematological malignancies (p-0.218) whereas unexplained clinical sepsis was common in solid malignancies (p-0.0202). The majority of documented infections were bacterial, caused by gram-negative bacilli, often showing multi-drug resistance. Infectious etiologies were identified in 71.4% of the patients with febrile neutropenia for >5days. Bacterial infections developed within 2 days of neutropenia, whereas viral and fungal infections manifested in prolonged neutropenia. Multi-site infections and higher mortality rates were observed in patients with febrile neutropenia. (p<0.04) Conclusion Febrile neutropenia is a common complication among patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is key to prompt intervention. Hematological parameters such as Total Leukocyte count, platelet count, NLR, and Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio are promising biomarkers in conjunction with morphological changes in neutrophils, thus proving that CBC and peripheral smears are simple, easily available, cost-effective, and highly dependable screening tools, especially in resource-poor settings.

                Background Dental radiology has significantly benefited from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) because of its compact size and low radiation exposure. Canal tracking is an important application of CBCT for determining the relationship between the inferior alveolar nerve and third molar. Usually, canal tacking is performed manually, which takes a lot of time. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate classification of the mandibular canal in relation to the third molar. Methods This retrospective study was conducted using 434 CBCT images. 3D slicer software was used to annotate and classify the data into lingual, buccal, and inferior categories. Two convolution neural network models, AlexNet and ResNet50, were developed to classify this relationship. The study included 262 images for training and 172 images for testing, with the model performance evaluated by sensitivity, precision, and F1 score. Results The performance of the two models was evaluated using a 3 × 3 confusion matrix, with the data categorized into 3 clases: lingual, buccal, and inferior. The mandibular canal and third molar have a close anatomical relationship, highlighting the need for precise imaging in dental and surgical settings. To accurately classify the mandibular canal in relation to the third molar, both AlexNet and ResNet50 demonstrated high accuracy, with F1 scores ranging from 0.64 to 0.92 for different classes, with accuracy of 81% and 83%, respectively, for accurately classifying the mandibular canal in relation to the third molar. Conclusion The present study developed and evaluated AI models to accurately classify and establish the relationship between the mandibular canal and third molars using CBCT images with a higher accuracy rate.

                Objectives : The interface of dementia and physical disability is poorly characterized in the elderly population. We used the 2017-2018 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) (PKPR71FL) to investigate the prevalence and interface of dementia and physical disability in Pakistan. Study design : A cross-sectional study design was used by analyzing the latest DHS conducted for Pakistan from 22 November 2017 to 30 April 2018. Methods : We used Gamma correlation to evaluate the effects of several demographic and socioeconomic factors on dementia and physical disability in 2,899 males and 2,284 females. Results : The prevalence of both forms of disabilities increased with advancing age with a higher preponderance among females. Being unmarried, not educated, having a smaller household, and poverty was associated with a greater disability. Having four or more children was associated with a higher disability in men but lower disability in women. The prevalence of disability was highest in Punjab and lowest in Balochistan. Conclusion : Altogether, we describe several factors associated with the burden of disability in Pakistan. Community-based interventions are recommended to reduce the disability of the elderly in Pakistan.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

                Shewanella is an emerging human pathogen. It mostly causes skin and soft tissue infections. Osteosynthesis-associated infection involving Shewanella are rare and in most cases are secondary to direct contamination following open fractures in aquatic environments. Here, we present a rare case of hematogenous osteosynthesis-associated infection involving Shewanella algae affecting an 18-year-old patient who was operated on for 12th thoracic vertebrae and 4th lumbar vertebrae fractures occurring in an aquatic environment. We performed surgical debridement with subsequent double course parenteral antibiotherapy that was then adapted to bacteria sensitivities for three weeks. After a follow-up of six months, the patient had no signs of recurrent infection. The presence of infected dermabrasions and the concordance between germs isolated in operative samples and in blood cultures presumes that the contamination was hematogenous.

                Background This paper focuses upon prayer for sickness. What do individuals suffering from illness, their families and the wider community pray for? How do they deal with unanswered prayer? Do they pray for cure, to guide medical professionals or to cope with their sickness? What rationalisations do they proffer for unanswered prayer? Methods Based on a critical literature review and deploying secondary data from the Twenty First Century Evangelical research programme, the data suggest that prayers for guiding medical professionals and coping are more common than for cure, at least in Global North countries such as the UK and US. But why do those who believe in miracles not ask God for divine healing? Furthermore, unanswered prayer can conflict with Christian views of God as omnipotent and all loving. Results Respondents use a number of theodical rationalisations to resolve this conflict. Conclusions The results are discussed in relation to cognitive dissonance theory, learned helplessness, the need to conserve a relationship with the Divine, and desire to manage risk of disappointment and reduce consequent emotional pain.

                Sudden deafness is a common cause of emergency consultation in otology. Usually, despite investigations, no etiology is known. Intracochlear hemorrhage is a rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and may be associated with various labyrinthine disorders. In such cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clef of the diagnosis. We report the case of a 70-year-old patient who was referred to our department for sudden hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Otoscopic and neurological examinations were normal, and pure-tone audiometry revealed left profound sensorineural hearing loss. Videonystagmography (VNG) revealed left vestibular deficit. MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity inside the cochlea on unenhanced T1-weighted images, and no other abnormalities were found; in particular, no enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. No etiology was identified. Vertigo disappeared rapidly with corticosteroid treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but hearing did not improve. Intra-labyrinthine hemorrhage causing SSNHL is rare, and the hearing prognosis is poor.

                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID 19 infections and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 infections. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 infection, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 infections at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

                Background The potential of Islamic crowdfunding to encourage the development of Islamic fintech globally, even in countries with non-Muslim majority populations, needs to be examined in a literature study on this issue. More extensive research is needed regarding the factors that most reliably predict the success of Islamic crowdfunding, such as compliance with Islamic crowdfunding laws, sustainability, and the potential of Islamic finance. This article describes a comprehensive and systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding papers published in the field of Islamic crowdfunding. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of Islamic crowdfunding, provide useful information for practitioners, and stimulate further research in the field to increase the success of Islamic crowdfunding. Methods We conducted a review of selected papers to identify gaps and significant issues in Islamic crowdfunding, providing guidance for future researchers. This article review was based on 704 articles retrieved using the keyword “Islamic crowdfunding” from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2022. To minimize bias, we formulated 5 research questions to guide our analysis: RQ1: How do publication and citation rates vary annually? RQ2: How can we determine the most influential studies based on citation counts for each keyword? RQ3: What are the most common subject areas addressed in Islamic crowdfunding literature from 2013 to 2022? RQ4: What are the most frequently used keywords in Scopus documents? RQ5: How are Islamic values discussed in articles related to Islamic crowdfunding? Results The findings of this research demonstrate that Islamic crowdfunding, characterized by interdisciplinary scholarship, has emerged as an increasingly significant alternative for aiding society and the economy. It contributes to poverty alleviation and the development of specific sectors through channels such as crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises and social projects tailored to meet the diverse needs of Muslims. However, the challenge facing the future development of Sharia crowdfunding is that, despite its benefit of increasing community participation in projects aligned with religious values, it also carries the potential risk of investment losses and non-compliance with Sharia principles. Ways to address the current scarcity of Sharia fintech are also needed, ensuring its broader acceptance across all societal levels, and enhancing Muslims’ understanding of compliance with Islamic religious rules, particularly Fiqh law. Conclusion Urgently needed are specific fiqh regulatory guidelines to ensure that Sharia-compliant crowdfunding adheres to Islamic principles. Government support, particularly through legislation in countries where the majority of the population is Muslim, is crucial to enhance public participation and trust in Sharia crowdfunding.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

                Background While Boko Haram insurgency’s dangers are well documented, existing research lacks methods for effective monitoring and prediction, of their activities. This study addresses this gap by analyzing data from Nigerian Security Tracker website (https://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483) from year 2011 to 2023 and geolocated information on Boko Haram activity. Methods The research employs a mixed-methods approach. It uses descriptive statistics to understand attack trends and time series models (ARIMA/SARIMA) to forecast future attacks. Additionally, control charts identify periods of heightened insurgency. Results The findings confirm the Northeast region, as the epicenter of Boko Haram activities. The average monthly attack rate was 18 incidents, leading to 682 deaths over 12 years. 2014 and 2015 witnessed the peak of the insurgency. The forecasting models suggest a potential decrease in attack frequency in the coming years, with an average of nine attacks per month. This predicted decline might be linked to intervention efforts. Control charts reveal periods where attacks surpassed expected levels, highlighting critical moments for intensified counter-insurgency measures. These periods include July 2012-May 2014 and June 2014-August 2015, with a period of regained control. Conclusion This research provides valuable insights for stakeholders working to fight against Boko Haram’s insurgency. It offers forecasting capabilities and identifies critical periods, potentially informing targeted interventions and improving overall counter-insurgency strategies.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-988/v1?src=rss">Enhancing quantitative capacity for the health sector in post-Ebola Liberia, a tracer study of a locally developed and owned coding and biostatistics program [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the demonstrated value of quantitative research in understanding and responding to public health events, analytics capability is not always prioritized or available in settings that would greatly benefit from it. In Liberia, there are no university degree-granting programs in biostatistics or mathematical modeling, promoting dependence on external technical assistance. To address the gap, a local NGO, Quantitative-Data for Decision-Making (Q4D), was founded to enhance capacity and opportunities for analyzing quantitative data among Liberians. Methods To understand the relevance, utility, and impact of the skills being taught at Q4D, a tracer study was undertaken with current and former students. Participants completed an online survey that evaluated how often and in what ways they are applying course skills, as well as any personal or professional advancement they have attributed to their learning of coding and/or biostatistics through the program. Results Among 43 participants, 81% reported a high level of confidence in independently applying skills learned through Q4D classes in their jobs and/or academic programs. Most participants (81%) responded that they were actively demonstrating the skills they acquired; 74% were teaching the skills to others. Among the 83% of employed participants who reported using the skills currently in their jobs, 56% rated the skills they learned as very or extremely useful in their current positions. Several students attributed salary increments, consultancy opportunities, and scholarships to the skills gained through the program. Conclusions Program skills are being applied by students employed in health-related sectors, suggesting that the training content is relevant and useful for addressing some of the workforce’s analysis needs. Moreover, skills built through the program have positively impacted students by preparing them with the skills required for additional employment and training opportunities to advance in-country health research capacity and reduce inequities.

                Background Current treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) mainly focused on treating symptoms. Exosome from Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (Ad-MSC) have been shown to delay degenerative process. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological and histological impact of combined intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) and exosome Ad-MSCs in-vivo using a larger animal model with low-grade OA. Methods Eighteen male Ovies aries sheep underwent total lateral meniscectomy and conventional radiography was performed to confirm low-grade OA after 6 weeks. The sheep were divided into three groups, Group 1 (G1; n=6) received thrice exosome injections, G2 (n=6) received twice HA injection, and G3 (n=6) received both treatments with a 1-week interval after 10 days of meniscectomy. Clinical evaluations were conducted using the Clinical Lameness Score (CLS), radiographic with X-ray using OA score by Innes et al, while macroscopic evaluation by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Results Lameness parameter scored lowest in G3 significantly (2.0±0.0 VS 2.7±0.52 VS 2.7±0.52; p=0.024) at the second month although the overall CLS score did not significantly differ at the 3rd month. The best improvement of conventional total OA radiographic score at the 3rd month compared to all groups (5.2±1.17 vs 6.3±0.82 vs 6.7±1.03; p=0.053). Macroscopic OARSI evaluation showed no difference (p=0.711). Conclusions Combined repeated exosome Ad-MSC and HA IA injection proven to delay OA progression, however longer duration of follow up is required to evaluate its long-term effect.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-987/v1?src=rss">The emergence of a modern paradigm for urban health [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The importance of urban health in achieving global and planetary health goals is increasingly recognized. Cities offer important opportunities to improve health while also presenting significant challenges. As our understanding of and evidence for the importance of determinants of health beyond health care have grown, the need for urban health policies and actions that transcend disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and involve multiple stakeholders in urban decision-making has become clearer. Current urban health practice builds on decades of conceptual and operational work. This paper traces the evolution of the urban health paradigm through research, policy and practice in recent decades. We suggest that, despite the proven utility of urban health as a paradigm and its conceptual and practical evolution for effective urban health governance, significant challenges remain, especially related to implementing the systems approaches needed to improve health amidst the complexity of urban dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23636?af=R">Hippocampal storage and recall of neocortical “What”–“Where” representations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A key question for understanding the function of the hippocampus in memory is how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This was investigated in a neuronal network model of the hippocampal system in which “What” and “Where” neuronal firing rate vectors were applied to separate neocortical modules, which then activated entorhinal cortex “What” and “Where” modules, then the dentate gyrus, then CA3, then CA1, then the entorhinal cortex, and then the backprojections to the neocortex. A rate model showed that the whole system could be trained to recall “Where” in the neocortex from “What” applied as a retrieval cue to the neocortex, and could in principle be trained up towards the theoretical capacity determined largely by the number of synapses onto any one neuron divided by the sparseness of the representation. The trained synaptic weights were then imported into an integrate-and-fire simulation of the same architecture, which showed that the time from presenting a retrieval cue to a neocortex module to recall the whole memory in the neocortex is approximately 100 ms. This is sufficiently fast for the backprojection synapses to be trained onto the still active neocortical neurons during storage of the episodic memory, and this is needed for recall to operate correctly to the neocortex. These simulations also showed that the long loop neocortex–hippocampus–neocortex that operates continuously in time may contribute to complete recall in the neocortex; but that this positive feedback long loop makes the whole dynamical system inherently liable to a pathological increase in neuronal activity. Important factors that contributed to stability included increased inhibition in CA3 and CA1 to keep the firing rates low; and temporal adaptation of the neuronal firing and of active synapses, which are proposed to make an important contribution to stabilizing runaway excitation in cortical circuits in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99263">Differential regulation of the proteome and phosphosproteome along the dorso-ventral axis of the early Drosophila embryo</a></h4>

              
                The initially homogeneous epithelium of the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo differentiates into regional subpopulations with different behaviours and physical properties that are needed for morphogenesis. The factors at top of the genetic hierarchy that control these behaviours are known, but many of their targets are not. To understand how proteins work together to mediate differential cellular activities, we studied in an unbiased manner the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of the three main cell populations along the dorso-ventral axis during gastrulation using mutant embryos that represent the different populations. We detected 6111 protein groups and 6259 phosphosites of which 3398 and 3433 respectively, were differentially regulated. The changes in phosphosite abundance did not correlate with changes in host protein abundance, showing phosphorylation to be a regulatory step during gastrulation. Hierarchical clustering of protein groups and phosphosites identified clusters that contain known fate determinants such as Doc1, Sog, Snail and Twist. The recovery of the appropriate known marker proteins in each of the different mutants we used validated the approach, but also revealed that two mutations that both interfere with the dorsal fate pathway, <i>Toll<sup>10B</sup></i> and <i>serpin27a<sup>ex</sup></i> do this in very different manners. Diffused network analyses within each cluster point to microtubule components as one of the main groups of regulated proteins. Functional studies on the role of microtubules provide the proof of principle that microtubules have different functions in different domains along the DV axis of the embryo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94485">Future movement plans interact in sequential arm movements</a></h4>

              
                Real-world actions often comprise a series of movements that cannot be entirely planned before initiation. When these actions are executed rapidly, the planning of multiple future movements needs to occur simultaneously with the ongoing action. How the brain solves this task remains unknown. Here, we address this question with a new sequential arm reaching paradigm that manipulates how many future reaches are available for planning while controlling execution of the ongoing reach. We show that participants plan at least two future reaches simultaneously with an ongoing reach. Further, the planning processes of the two future reaches are not independent of one another. Evidence that the planning processes interact is twofold. First, correcting for a visual perturbation of the ongoing reach target is slower when more future reaches are planned. Second, the curvature of the current reach is modified based on the next reach only when their planning processes temporally overlap. These interactions between future planning processes may enable smooth production of sequential actions by linking individual segments of a long sequence at the level of motor planning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96832">The Arthropoda-specific Tramtrack group BTB protein domains use previously unknown interface to form hexamers</a></h4>

              
                BTB (Bric-a-brack, Tramtrack and Broad Complex) is a diverse group of protein-protein interaction domains found within metazoan proteins. Transcription factors contain a dimerizing BTB subtype with a characteristic N-terminal extension. The Tramtrack group (TTK) is a distinct type of BTB domain, which can multimerize. Single-particle cryo-EM microscopy revealed that the TTK-type BTB domains assemble into a hexameric structure consisting of three canonical BTB dimers connected through a previously uncharacterized interface. We demonstrated that the TTK-type BTB domains are found only in Arthropods and have undergone lineage-specific expansion in modern insects. The <i>Drosophila</i> genome encodes 24 transcription factors with TTK-type BTB domains, whereas only four have non‑TTK‑type BTB domains. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the TTK-type BTB domains have an unusually broad potential for heteromeric associations presumably through dimer-dimer interaction interface. Thus, the TTK-type BTB domains are a structurally and functionally distinct group of protein domains specific to Arthropodan transcription factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96699">Additional feedforward mechanism of Parkin activation via binding of phospho-UBL and RING0 in trans</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function Parkin mutations lead to early-onset of Parkinson’s disease. Parkin is an auto-inhibited ubiquitin E3 ligase activated by dual phosphorylation of its ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and ubiquitin by the PINK1 kinase. Herein, we demonstrate a competitive binding of the phospho-Ubl and RING2 domains towards the RING0 domain, which regulates Parkin activity. We show that phosphorylated Parkin can complex with native Parkin, leading to the activation of autoinhibited native Parkin in <i>trans</i>. Furthermore, we show that the activator element (ACT) of Parkin is required to maintain the enzyme kinetics, and the removal of ACT slows the enzyme catalysis. We also demonstrate that ACT can activate Parkin in <i>trans</i> but less efficiently than when present in the <i>cis</i> molecule. Furthermore, the crystal structure reveals a donor ubiquitin binding pocket in the linker connecting REP and RING2, which plays a crucial role in Parkin activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94972">The genetic architecture of the load linked to dominant and recessive self-incompatibility alleles in Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis lyrata</a></h4>

              
                The long-term balancing selection acting on mating types or sex-determining genes is expected to lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the tightly linked chromosomal segments that are locally ‘sheltered’ from purifying selection. However, the factors determining the extent of this accumulation are poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of variations in the intensity of balancing selection along a dominance hierarchy formed by alleles at the sporophytic self-incompatibility system of the Brassicaceae to compare the pace at which linked deleterious mutations accumulate among them. We first experimentally measured the phenotypic manifestation of the linked load at three different levels of the dominance hierarchy. We then sequenced and phased polymorphisms in the chromosomal regions linked to 126 distinct copies of <i>S</i>-alleles in two populations of <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> and three populations of <i>Arabidopsis lyrata</i>. We find that linkage to the <i>S</i>-locus locally distorts phylogenies over about 10–30 kb along the chromosome. The more intense balancing selection on dominant <i>S</i>-alleles results in greater fixation of linked deleterious mutations, while recessive <i>S</i>-alleles accumulate more linked deleterious mutations that are segregating. Hence, the structure rather than the overall magnitude of the linked genetic load differs between dominant and recessive <i>S</i>-alleles. Our results have consequences for the long-term evolution of new <i>S</i>-alleles, the evolution of dominance modifiers between them, and raise the question of why the non-recombining regions of some sex and mating type chromosomes expand over evolutionary times while others, such as the <i>S</i>-locus of the Brassicaceae, remain restricted to small chromosomal regions.

PCC 6803, encoding bidirectional hydrogenase responsible for H<sub>2</sub> production, is transcriptionally upregulated under microoxic conditions. Although several regulators for <i>hox</i> transcription have been identified, their dynamics and higher-order DNA structure of <i>hox</i> region in microoxic conditions remain elusive. We focused on key regulators for the <i>hox</i> operon: cyAbrB2, a conserved regulator in cyanobacteria, and SigE, an alternative sigma factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that cyAbrB2 binds to the <i>hox</i> promoter region under aerobic conditions, with its binding being flattened in microoxic conditions. Concurrently, SigE exhibited increased localization to the <i>hox</i> promoter under microoxic conditions. Genome-wide analysis revealed that cyAbrB2 binds broadly to AT-rich genome regions and represses gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated the physical interactions of the <i>hox</i> promoter region with its distal genomic loci. Both the transition to microoxic conditions and the absence of cyAbrB2 influenced the chromosomal interaction. From these results, we propose that cyAbrB2 is a cyanobacterial nucleoid-associated protein (NAP), modulating chromosomal conformation, which blocks RNA polymerase from the <i>hox</i> promoter in aerobic conditions. We further infer that cyAbrB2, with altered localization pattern upon microoxic conditions, modifies chromosomal conformation in microoxic conditions, which allows SigE-containing RNA polymerase to access the <i>hox</i> promoter. The coordinated actions of this NAP and the alternative sigma factor are crucial for the proper <i>hox</i> expression in microoxic conditions. Our results highlight the impact of cyanobacterial chromosome conformation and NAPs on transcription, which have been insufficiently investigated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90851">Structure and dynamics of cholesterol-mediated aquaporin-0 arrays and implications for lipid rafts</a></h4>

              
                Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) tetramers form square arrays in lens membranes through a yet unknown mechanism, but lens membranes are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Here, we determined electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 in sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish that the observed cholesterol positions represent those seen around an isolated AQP0 tetramer and that the AQP0 tetramer largely defines the location and orientation of most of its associated cholesterol molecules. At a high concentration, cholesterol increases the hydrophobic thickness of the annular lipid shell around AQP0 tetramers, which may thus cluster to mitigate the resulting hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, neighboring AQP0 tetramers sandwich a cholesterol deep in the center of the membrane. MD simulations show that the association of two AQP0 tetramers is necessary to maintain the deep cholesterol in its position and that the deep cholesterol increases the force required to laterally detach two AQP0 tetramers, not only due to protein–protein contacts but also due to increased lipid–protein complementarity. Since each tetramer interacts with four such ‘glue’ cholesterols, avidity effects may stabilize larger arrays. The principles proposed to drive AQP0 array formation could also underlie protein clustering in lipid rafts.

	<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been widely used to study the mechanisms that underlie motor output. Yet, the extent to which TMS acts upon the cortical neurons implicated in volitional motor commands and the focal limitations of TMS remain subject to debate. Previous research links TMS to improved subject performance in behavioral tasks, including a bias in phoneme discrimination. Our study replicates this result, which implies a causal relationship between electro-magnetic stimulation and psychomotor activity, and tests whether TMS-facilitated psychomotor activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) may thus serve as a superior input for neural decoding. First, we illustrate that site-specific TMS elicits a double dissociation in discrimination ability for two phoneme categories. Next, we perform a classification analysis on the EEG signals recorded during TMS and find a dissociation between the stimulation site and decoding accuracy that parallels the behavioral results. We observe weak to moderate evidence for the alternative hypothesis in a Bayesian analysis of group means, with more robust results upon stimulation to a brain region governing multiple phoneme features. Overall, task accuracy was a significant predictor of decoding accuracy for phoneme categories (F(1,135) = 11.51, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0009) and individual phonemes (F(1,119) = 13.56, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0003), providing new evidence for a causal link between TMS, neural function, and behavior.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A large body of evidence implicates dipeptide repeats (DPRs) proteins as one of the main drivers of neuronal injury in cell and animal models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pure repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD was generated. Embryonic and adult transgenic zebrafish lysates were investigated for the presence of RAN-translated DPR species and adult-onset motor deficits. Using C9orf72 cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish, hypothermic-therapeutic temperature management (TTM) was explored as a potential therapeutic option for C9orf72-ALS/FTD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a pure RAN translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD that exhibits significant RAN-translated DPR pathology and progressive motor decline. We further demonstrate that hypothermic-TTM results in a profound reduction in DPR species in C9orf72-ALS/FTD cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The transgenic model detailed in this paper provides a medium throughput in vivo research tool to further investigate the role of RAN-translation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD and further understand the mechanisms that underpin neuroprotective strategies. Hypothermic-TTM presents a viable therapeutic avenue to explore in the context of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27072?af=R">Fetal Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Imaging Patterns, Etiology, and Outcomes: A Single Center Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study examines associations among fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) injury patterns, etiologies, and outcomes in fetal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of IPH diagnosed on fetal MRI (1996–2022). IPH and associated abnormalities were categorized by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists; electronic medical records were reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists to classify etiology and outcomes including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, developmental delay, and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-four fetuses with IPH were identified (34 singleton and 10 twin gestations) with MRI at median 24 weeks gestation (interquartile range [IQR] = 22–28 weeks). IPH was commonly supratentorial (84%) and focal (50%) or focal with diffuse injury (43%) and was often associated with germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH; 75%) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 52%). An etiology was identified in 75%, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, n = 10), COL4A1/2 variants (n = 8), or other fetal/maternal conditions (n = 15). COL4A1/2 variants were associated with focal IPH and the presence of hemorrhagic porencephaly, and intrauterine transfusion was associated with infratentorial hemorrhage. Twenty-two fetuses were liveborn, and 18 pregnancies were terminated. Among those with follow-up ≥ 12 months (median = 7 years), 12 of 13 had cerebral palsy, 6 of 13 had developmental delay, and 5 of 13 had epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>An etiology for fetal IPH with or without GMH-IVH is identified in most cases in our cohort and is commonly TTTS, COL4A1/2 variants, or other maternal/fetal comorbidities. Pattern of fetal IPH on MRI is associated with etiology. Cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment were common in liveborn infants. Genetic studies should be considered in cases of fetal IPH without an otherwise apparent cause. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer simulations, and virtual reality (VR) are increasingly becoming accessible tools that can be leveraged to implement training protocols and educational resources. Typical assessment tools related to sensory and neural processing associated with task performance in virtual environments often rely on self-reported surveys, unlike electroencephalography (EEG), which is often used to compare the effects of different types of sensory feedback (e.g., auditory, visual, and haptic) in simulation environments in an objective manner. However, it can be challenging to know which aspects of the EEG signal represent the impact of different types of sensory feedback on neural processing. Machine learning approaches offer a promising direction for identifying EEG signal features that differentiate the impact of different types of sensory feedback during simulation training. For the current study, machine learning techniques were applied to differentiate neural circuitry associated with haptic and non-haptic feedback in a simulated drilling task. Nine EEG channels were selected and analyzed, extracting different time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features, where 360 features were tested (40 features per channel). A feature selection stage identified the most relevant features, including the Hurst exponent of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz, kurtosis of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, power spectral density of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, variance of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, and spectral entropy of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz. Using those five features, trials with haptic feedback were correctly identified from those without haptic feedback with an accuracy exceeding 90%, increasing to 99% when using 10 features. These results show promise for the future application of machine learning approaches to predict the impact of haptic feedback on neural processing during VR protocols involving drilling tasks, which can inform future applications of VR and simulation for occupational skill acquisition.</p>

	<p>During the period in which children learn to read and write, a gradual shift from right to left hemisphere dominance for language is typically seen. However, in children with dyslexia, a deviant pattern is described in the literature. As part of a larger longitudinal study (The Bergen Longitudinal Dyslexia Study), the present study aimed to assess this development from an early age before children learn to read and write. Dichotic listening (DL), which is a non-invasive test, was used to assess the development of brain laterality in a Typical group and a Dyslexia group. The participants received yearly sessions of evidence-based literacy training at ages 5 to 7. The Typical group showed increasing ear scores and a shift from no ear advantage in the Pre-literacy stage (age 6), indicative of no hemisphere dominance, to a right ear advantage, indicative of a left hemisphere dominance, in the Emergent literacy stage (age 8) and the Literacy stage (age 11). The Dyslexia group showed a different pattern, with a significant right ear advantage at age 6, indicative of a right hemisphere dominance, and increasing ear scores at ages 8 and 11; however, no ear dominance was observed in the Literacy stage. The results point to an effect of relevant, evidence-based training affecting both right and left hemispheres in dyslexia, which should form a basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is associated with seizures. We examined the impact of repeated seizures on the behavioral and molecular changes in male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Methods: Seizures were induced by administering three flurothyl seizures per day across postnatal days (PD) 7&amp;amp;ndash;11, for a total of 15 seizures. In adulthood, mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tasks to assess long-term behavioral deficits. Results: The two-hit impact of a Fmr1 knockout and seizures resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test and a longer latency to their first nose poke (repetitive behavior). Seizures resulted in decreased activity, decreased repetitive behavior (grooming and rearings), and decreased social behavior, while they also increased habituation to auditory stimuli and increased freezing in delayed fear conditioning in both KO and control mice. KO mice displayed increased repetitive behavior in the open field task (clockwise revolutions) and repeated nose pokes, and decreased anxiety in the open field test. No differences in mTOR signaling were found. Conclusions: These findings further illuminate the long-term effects of synergistic impact of two hits on the developing brain.</p>

	<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been suggested as a possible treatment method for cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (pwAD), similar to multidomain cognitive training (CT). The effectiveness, however, of combining these techniques for pwAD remains controversial due to the variability in rTMS parameters, differences in CT protocol designs&amp;amp;mdash;many of which neglect the language domain&amp;amp;mdash;and the inclusion of patients at various stages of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) and with different types of dementia. The current review aims to evaluate the cognitive benefits of combining rTMS with CT, including language training, for individuals with mild to moderate AD. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library with relevant terms, resulting in nine studies with a total of 290 participants [190 in the Active Group (AG) and 100 in the Control Group (CG)]. The comprehensive review of the articles revealed that the combined treatment improved global cognitive function, as well as neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life in the AG. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously, given the relatively small number of existing studies on this specific combination.</p>

	<p>Anhedonia constitutes a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) mediating the ultimate goal of MDD treatment: functional remission. Anhedonia is also present in other clinical populations, including patients with chronic pain. Recent data links anhedonia to insulin resistance (IR). Some researchers have underlined a different dimension of anhedonia as a temperament/personality trait. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to explore the links between anhedonia (main outcome) and (1) IR, (2) temperamental, personality, and schizotypy traits (exposures). The study population included patients with MDD, fibromyalgia, and healthy controls. Participants were split into groups: (1) insulin resistant (IR[+] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;ge; 2.1) and (2) insulin sensitive (IR[&amp;amp;minus;] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;lt; 2.1). Anhedonia was significantly higher in the IR[+] group than the IR[&amp;amp;minus;] group. IR was a predictor of higher anhedonia levels. IR[+] vs. IR[&amp;amp;minus;] participants showed higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of hyperthymic affective temperaments, as well as conscientiousness and emotional stability personality traits. Depressive, irritable, and anxious temperaments, cognitive disorganization, and introvertive anhedonia positively predicted anhedonia, while hyperthymic temperament, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability traits negatively predicted anhedonia. IR partially mediated the relationship between depressive temperament and anhedonia. In sum, IR, affective temperaments, and personality traits are predictors of anhedonia.</p>

                Background Motorcycle accidents can be particularly hazardous, as riders are exposed to various risk factors, such as high speeds, lack of protective enclosures, and limited safety features. Aim of the study To describe the ocular injuries associated with motorcycled accidents presented to tertiary hospitals and forensic centers in Iraq. Patients and methods The study was conducted in three Teaching hospitals and forensic centers in Baghdad and Al-Qadisiyah in Iraq. Information regarding ocular injuries, recorded and classified according to the International Ocular Trauma Classification, was gathered from motorcycle crash injuries that were presented to the emergency departments of these facilities from June 1, 2019, to June 1, 2023 Results The study involved 335 ophthalmological accidents; the mean age of the patients was 27.84± 9.6 years, most of them were males (96.7%), and there were only 11 females as passengers, 39 (11.6%) had injuries in both eyes. Lesions involving the periorbita, lids, and conjunctiva comprised most of the findings. There were 60.9% of patients with lid lacerations with or without sub-conjunctival bleeding, 22.1% with corneoscleral injury, and 17.9% with commotio retinae. It was the leading cause of decreased visual acuity, with 9% having lens capsule damage with or without iris prolapse and 8.1% having a ruptured capsule, 55.82% of patients had a mild injury, 27.16% had a moderate injury, and 17.01% had a severe injury. Conclusion Eye injury associated with motorcycle accidents mainly affects males in their youth age and has serious outcomes, sometimes ending with blindness.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The main purpose of this study was to explore experiences of women who survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital, 2021. Design: An institution-based exploratory qualitative study with a descriptive phenomenological study design Setting: The present study was conducted in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital from March 03 to May 18, 2021. Participants: A total of 17 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with women who experienced and survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis using Atlas-ti software. Result: The present study revealed that women’s level of awareness on raised blood pressure and or convulsion occurring during pregnancy was poor. Barriers that limit pregnant women from getting treatment at the earliest point included misconception, lack of insight, failure to accept counseling from health care providers, low income, and influence from husbands. Discussions with the women in this study showed that these mothers were not counseled on danger signs during antenatal care check-ups. Almost all of the women were very concerned and frustrated due to their diagnosis. Conclusions: Women’s awareness of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was poor and antenatal care was not offered as per expected quality. Improving awareness of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and enhancing the quality of antenatal care is essential.

                Background This study delved into the experiences and approaches employed by junior teachers in facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences during the teaching and learning process. In South Africa, Grade 7 marks the final year of primary school education, with learners typically aged between 11 to 13. The researchers noted significant challenges faced by junior Grade 7 teachers in preparing, organizing, and carrying out practical work within the context of teaching and learning in Natural Sciences. Methods In the present study, a qualitative multiple-case study design was employed. Three grade 7 Natural Sciences junior-level teachers were purposefully selected as participants. Data was gathered through classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. Results The study findings revealed that certain grade 7 junior Natural Sciences teachers found it challenging to manage practical work during teaching and learning. Some teachers also faced difficulties in maintaining discipline during practical work and demonstrations, both inside and outside the classroom. To cope with the demands of facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences teaching and learning, teachers employed various approaches, such as group work, observations, demonstrations, illustrations, projects, and inquiry-based scientific investigations. Conclusion It is recommended that teachers should receive professional training on effectively facilitating practical work to support the new teaching and learning methods outlined in the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement. They should also be equipped with pedagogical content knowledge to help them achieve the goals of practical work in teaching and learning Natural Sciences.

                Rationale This study critically examines Nigeria’s journey towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since their inception. Nigeria, a United Nations member state and a major oil producer, faces challenges like socio-economic disparities, political instability, corruption, and prevalent poverty, despite its cultural richness and natural resources. Objectives The primary aim is to evaluate Nigeria’s alignment with the SDGs within its national development frameworks, highlighting the significance of these goals in addressing the country’s multifaceted developmental challenges. These challenges span various sectors including poverty, health, education, and environmental sustainability. Methods The study conducts a detailed analysis of Nigeria’s background, including its cultural diversity and developmental hurdles. It reviews national policies and initiatives, notably the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), and the role of the Ministry of Budget and National Planning in coordinating SDG efforts. Results Findings suggest partial progress in SDG integration within Nigeria’s development plans. While some strides have been made in areas like policy alignment and strategic planning, challenges persist in effective implementation and tackling systemic issues like inequality and corruption. Conclusion The analysis reveals that, while Nigeria has made efforts to incorporate the SDGs into national policies, significant gaps remain in addressing key challenges. The complexity of Nigeria’s socio-economic and political landscape presents both hurdles and opportunities for sustainable development. Recommendations The study advocates for more robust policy implementation, enhanced stakeholder engagement, and targeted strategies to overcome specific challenges. By addressing these areas, Nigeria can accelerate its progress towards the SDGs, paving the way for comprehensive and sustainable national development.

                Background Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) encompass a heterogenous group of auto-immune diseases. The identification of myositis specific antibodies (MSA) and their associations with distinct phenotypes has improved the categorization of these conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to describe and report the clinical and immunological characteristics of IIM among Tunisian patients. Method A retrospective study conducted in the internal medicine department at the Rabta University Hospital Center over 22 years, including adult patients with IIM according to the American college of rheumatology/European league against rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria and Connors’ criteria for anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS). Inclusion body myositis and myositis associated with other conditions were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics were analyzed and compared. Results Ninety-seven patients were included (Male/female ratio= 0.36, mean age = 48.4 +- 13.8 years). Muscular involvement was present in 88% of patients, affecting locomotor muscles (88%), gastrointestinal (43%), laryngeal (10%), cardiac (8%), and respiratory (1%) systems. Muscle weakness was primarily noted in the pelvic girdle (81%), scapular region (74%), axial muscles (20%), and distal muscles (5%). Myolysis was observed in 77% of patients, and histological evidence of myositis in 73%. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia (DIP) was present in 45% of patients, cutaneous involvement in 85%, and articular involvement in 48%. MSAs were detected in 52% of patients. Analysis revealed significantly higher frequencies of amyopathic forms, DIP, palmar hyperkeratosis, and articular involvement in the ASS group. The DM group exhibited higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, photosensitive rashes, ulcerations, and skin necrosis. The NAM group had higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, myolysis, and lower frequencies of DIP and cutaneous involvement. Conclusion Our findings corroborate previously established clinico-immunological associations reported in the literature underscoring the need for a combined clinico-serological approach in classifying IIM.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-98/v4?src=rss">Metabolomic characterization of human glioblastomas and patient plasma: a pilot study [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-857/v2?src=rss">Hormonal Influences on ADC Values in Breast Tissues: A Scoping Review of DWI in Pre- and Post-menopausal Women [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O’Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.
