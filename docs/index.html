	<p>This paper reviews the principles identified in analytic neuroscience that could be used in the setup of an international project, &amp;amp;ldquo;Hippocrates&amp;amp;rdquo; (H-project), named after the author of the endocrine theory of temperaments. The H-project can aim to summarize the findings in functional neurochemistry of consistent behavioural patterns (CBPs) in health (such as temperament traits) and psychopathology (symptoms of psychiatric disorders); to have systematically structured neurochemical investigations; to have an analysis of CBPs that include all ranges of behavioural histories and to have these modules complemented by regional contrasts related to climate, diets and other bio-environmental factors. The review highlights the benefits of constructivism and illustrates the contrast between constructivism and current approaches in terms of analytic and methodological aspects. (1) &amp;amp;ldquo;Where&amp;amp;rdquo; the neurochemical biomarkers should be measured: the review expands the range of needed measurements to out-of-brain systems, including environmental factors, and explores the concept of Specialized Extended Phenotype. (2) &amp;amp;ldquo;What&amp;amp;rdquo; should be measured but is missing: the review points to the need for measurement of the &amp;amp;ldquo;Throw &amp;amp;amp; Catch&amp;amp;rdquo; neurochemical relays; behavioural and neuronal events contributing to the consistency of the CBPs but not documented in measurements. (3) Structuring the H-project&amp;amp;rsquo;s setup: the paper briefly describes a proposed earlier neurochemical framework, Functional Ensemble of Temperament that that accommodates the neurochemical continuum between temperament and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. This framework is in line with documented &amp;amp;ldquo;Throw &amp;amp;amp; Catch&amp;amp;rdquo; neurochemical relays and can also be used to organize data about the personal and professional history of an individual.</p>

	<p>It is generally believed that working memory (WM) is dysfunctional in depression. However, whether this impaired performance originates from impaired encoding, maintenance or both stages is still unclear. Here, we aimed to decompose the abnormal characteristics of encoding and maintenance in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). Thirty patients and thirty-nine healthy controls completed a spatial working memory task where the encoding time and the retention time could vary under different load levels. Encoding performance was assessed by comparing accuracies between short and long encoding times, and maintenance performance was assessed by comparing accuracies between short and long retention times. The results show a lower performance in depression than the controls. However, while the decreased accuracy by long retention (vs. short retention) was increased by a short encoding time in the control group, the retention performance of the depression group did not further suffer from the short encoding time. The generally impaired encoding, together with limited maintenance of immunity against the constrained encoding time, suggests a common bias for fixed internal processing over external processing in recurrent MDD. The paradigm provided in this study can be a convenient and efficient clinical test for assessing the WM encoding and maintenance function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sounding the Alarm: Sex Differences in Rat Ultrasonic Vocalizations during Pavlovian Fear Conditioning and Extinction</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pavlovian fear conditioning is a prevalent tool in the study of aversive learning, which is a key component of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Adult rats can exhibit various threat-related behaviors, including freezing, motor responses, and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). While these responses can all signal aversion, we know little about how they relate to one another. Here we characterize USVs emitted by male and female rats during cued fear acquisition and extinction, and assess the relationship between different threat-related behaviors. We found that males consistently emitted &gt;22 kHz calls (referred to here as "alarm calls") than females, and that alarm call frequency in males, but not females, related to the intensity of the shock stimulus. Interestingly, 25% of males and 45% of females did not emit any alarm calls at all. Males that did make alarm calls had significantly higher levels of freezing than males who did not, while no differences in freezing were observed between female Alarm callers and Non-alarm callers. Alarm call emission was also affected by the predictability of the shock; when unpaired from a tone cue, both males and females started emitting alarm calls significantly later. During extinction learning and retrieval sessions, males were again more likely than females to emit alarm calls, which followed an extinction-like reduction in frequency. Collectively these data suggest sex dependence in how behavioral readouts relate to innate and conditioned threat responses. Importantly, we suggest that the same behaviors can signal sex-dependent features of aversion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Using SuperClomeleon to Measure Changes in Intracellular Chloride during Development and after Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intraneuronal chloride concentrations ([Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB>) decrease during development resulting in a shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA responses via chloride-permeable GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors. This GABA shift plays a pivotal role in postnatal brain development, and can be strongly influenced by early life experience. Here, we assessed the applicability of the recently developed fluorescent SuperClomeleon (SClm) sensor to examine changes in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> using two-photon microscopy in brain slices. We used SClm mice of both sexes to monitor the developmental decrease in neuronal chloride levels in organotypic hippocampal cultures. We could discern a clear reduction in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> between day <I>in vitro</I> (DIV)3 and DIV9 (equivalent to the second postnatal week <I>in vivo</I>) and a further decrease in some cells until DIV22. In addition, we assessed alterations in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of postnatal day (P)9 male SClm mouse pups after early life stress (ELS). ELS was induced by limiting nesting material between P2 and P9. ELS induced a shift toward higher (i.e., immature) chloride levels in layer 2/3 cells in the mPFC. Although conversion from SClm fluorescence to absolute chloride concentrations proved difficult, our study underscores that the SClm sensor is a powerful tool to measure physiological changes in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> in brain slices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The performance of lipid profiles and ratios as a predictor of arterial stiffness measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in type 2 diabetic patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early identification of arterial stiffness in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients before the manifestation of atherosclerosis would be clinically beneficial. Our study aimed to explore the correlation of lipid profiles and ratios with arterial stiffness, and construct a predictive model for arterial stiffness in T2DM patients using those parameters. Methods: One hundred and eighty-four adult T2DM patients in the diabetes outpatient clinic at the Dr. Soetomo general academic hospital were enrolled in this cross-sectional study in 2015 and 2019. Sociodemographic, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) data were collected from all subjects. The subjects were divided into a group with arterial stiffness (ba-PWV > 18 m/sec) and without arterial stiffness (ba-PWV ≤ 18 m/sec). A correlation test was used to evaluate the association, and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves analysis were used to determine the cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity. The risk analysis model was calculated using bivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The group with arterial stiffness had higher lipid profiles: total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and lipid ratios. A significant positive correlation was found between TC, TG, LDL-C, and all lipid ratios with ba-PWV. A negative correlation was found between HDL-C and ba-PWV. All lipid ratio parameters can be used as predictors of arterial stiffness, especially non-HDL-C with cut-off value: 150 mg/dL (sensitivity 96.8% and specificity 52.9%) and TG/HDL-C ratio with cut-off value: 4.51 (sensitivity 81.0% and specificity 74.2%). Elevated TG/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C displayed higher risk (OR: 12.293 and 16.312; p < 0.05) of having arterial stiffness compared to other lipid ratios. Conclusions: Lipid profiles and lipid ratios, especially TG/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C, are potential biochemical markers for arterial stiffness in T2DM patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Health literacy on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Health literacy on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects people’s capability to ascertain their health and health care quality during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of health literacy about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccinations (Vaccines and Vaccinations literacy-VL) in the Indonesian adult general population, assessing the perceptions of the respondents about current adult immunization and beliefs about vaccinations in general, and analyzing correlations of these variables with the VL levels. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a rapid survey was administered via the Internet. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics; the internal consistency of the VL scales was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient; the inter-correlation between the functional and interactive-critical VL questions, the underlying components (factors) and each question’s load on the components were identified using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An alpha level lesser than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Responses to functional- and interactive/ critical- VL questions were acceptable and showed internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.817 and 0.699, respectively), lowest values observed were 0.806 for functional scale and 0.640 for the interactive-critical scale. The PCA demonstrated that there were two components accounting for 52.45% of the total variability. Approximately 60% of respondents were females (n=686). Almost all respondents used the internet to seek information regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations. Many used at least one social media actively with 74.4% of respondents sometimes believing the validity of this information. Conclusions: High scores were observed in both functional- and interactive/ critical-VL, and were quite in a balance between sexes in the prior VL and higher in females for the latter; these were also closely related to the educational level and age group. It is crucial to increase public health literacy in managing the pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Helicobacter pylori prevalence in Indonesia: Higher infection risk in Eastern region population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection status in Indonesia might be higher than the actual prevalence. A comprehensive epidemiologic study is necessary to explore infection susceptibility by demographic characteristics, especially between Indonesia’s Eastern and Western regions. Methods: We included our recent survey and data from our previous studies with 1,172 endoscopic examinations from 19 cities throughout Indonesia from January 2014 to March 2017. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on the combination of four different tests. Using a criterion of one positive result between four tests, we found that 190 subjects (190/1,158; 16.4%) were H. pylori positive. A total of 939 subjects were analyzed for risk factors of sociodemographic characteristics to H. pylori infection. Results: Prevalence was slightly higher in the Eastern region compared with the Western region of Indonesia (79/277; 59.4% vs. 54/529; 40.6%). Living in the Eastern region imposes a higher risk of infection (OR 5.33, 95%CI 1.17–24.26). Timor ethnicity had the highest prevalence (15/28; 53.6%), followed by Buginese ethnic (21/74; 28.4%), and Papuan ethnic (18/64; 28.1%) in the Eastern region. As an ethnicity with a high prevalence (37/109; 33.9%), Batak was an outlier among the low prevalence areas in the Western region. In general, age, living in the Eastern region, Batak ethnicity, Protestant, Catholic, and alcohol drinking were independent risk factors associated with H. pylori infection in Indonesia (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.02–1.05; OR 5.33, 95%CI 1.17–24.26; OR 5.89, 95%CI 1.58–21.94; OR 5.47, 95%CI 2.16–13.86; OR 5.05, 95%CI 1.43–17.80; OR 2.30, 95%CI 1.14–4.61, respectively). Conclusions: Several ethnicities and habits were concluded to increase the risk of infection as the interaction of host, agent, and environment is inseparable in affecting disease susceptibility.

While many eukaryotic genome assemblies already include computational gene predictions, these predictions can benefit from review and refinement through manual gene annotation. The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://thegep.org/) developed a structural annotation protocol for protein-coding genes that enables undergraduate student and faculty researchers to create high-quality gene annotations that can be utilized in subsequent scientific investigations. For example, this protocol has been utilized by the GEP faculty to engage undergraduate students in the comparative annotation of genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway in 27 Drosophila species, using D. melanogaster as the reference genome. Students construct gene models using multiple lines of computational and empirical evidence including expression data (e.g., RNA-Seq), sequence similarity (e.g., BLAST and multiple sequence alignment), and computational gene predictions. Quality control measures require each gene be annotated by at least two students working independently, followed by reconciliation of the submitted gene models by a more experienced student. This article provides an overview of the annotation protocol and describes how discrepancies in student submitted gene models are resolved to produce a final, high-quality gene set suitable for subsequent analyses. The protocol can be adapted to other scientific questions (e.g., expansion of the Drosophila Muller F element) and species (e.g., parasitoid wasps) to provide additional opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in genomics research. These student annotation efforts can substantially improve the quality of gene annotations in publicly available genomic databases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Expression of Fascin and SALL4 in odontogenic cysts and tumors: an immunohistochemical appraisal. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods: Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results: Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which is an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions: Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection and identification of cyclops in well’s water, Jabal Awliya locality, Khartoum, Sudan 2021 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dracunculus medinensis or "Guinea-worm" is the parasitic worm that causes Dracunculiasis disease. The Cyclops (Meso and Micro Cyclops), which is only spread through drinking from water sources in endemic areas, carries this worm. This study aimed to detect and identify Cyclops in wells water, Jabal Awliya locality Khartoum state, Sudan 2021 Methods: This is a cross sectional study held in Jabal Awliya locality which is located in Khartoum state Sudan from 2021-2022. The locality is one of the seven localities in the state which is considered as the main gate for the refugees from South Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia where Dracunculus medinensis has not been eradicated yet. The population is 274,321. Results: A total of 264 samples were collected,132 from well’s water and 132 from post wells water sources. Well’s water contamination with cyclops was found to be 2.4% while post well’s contamination was found to be 8.9%. The species reported by microscopy are: Afrocyclops, Mesocyclops and Microcyclops. Significant statistical difference between well’s and post well’s contamination was found (p-value 0.02). Conclusions: In conclusion, it is apparent that well’s water as well as dam water are contaminated with copepods (Afro-, Meso- and Microcyclops). Hence Residents in the research regions are at hazard for Dracunculus infection whenever larvae make their way to the water sources since mesocyclops and microcyclops are recognized Guinea worm vectors. Since no apparent water treatment system has been found in the areas under study, it is crucial that water sources in this area be treated before consumption in order to reduce the risk of illness.  Awareness by the worm as well as the disease should be raised in order to ensure that the larvae from the hosts will not be carried to the wells.

                Background: This article presents findings from research conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on companies located in the Zurich airport region of Switzerland, regarding the needs for global business travel and its impacts. Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01). And thirdly supporting Ha(5), corporate social responsibility had a significant relationship with global business travel (91%). Ho(2) and Ho(3) were accepted. The case study found that smart corporate travel policies and regulations should be instantiated to enhance our environment, which would also benefit employee wellbeing. Travel can be reduced significantly despite being demonstrated that physical co-presence is important for building trust. The case study suggests tools to support the monitoring and management of global business travel by organizations. Conclusions: COVID-19 has impacted travel for business significantly, and future research will be necessary to assess its impact. The article explores the ongoing research in this area, and several relevant implications are proposed for future leaders. The case study found willingness to pay both corporate and individual green taxes, and a deficiency in corporate communication around the environment. Business travel is needed to build trust; however, it can be reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between polymorphisms within the gene coding for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha with outcomes of treatment in a sample of Iraqi patients with ankylosing spondylitis taking etanercept: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a progressive, chronic inflammatory illness with an unclear etiology that explicitly targets the vertebral column, peripheral joints, and extraarticular tissues. The purpose of this research was to investigate if the existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene at positions -1031T/C (rs199964), -857C/T (rs1799724) and -806C/T (rs4248158) in a sample of Iraqi AS patients could influence the patients' outcomes with etanercept. Methods: Sixty patients with established AS receiving only etanercept were selected to enroll in this study, with a mean age of 40.75±8.67 years; 51 patients were male. Patients were classed as "responders" if they obtained a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 clinical response and as "non-responders" if they did not achieve a BASDAI 50 clinical improvement after at least six months of treatment. After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product amplification of the purified blood DNA, the promoter region of TNF-α gene SNPs was established by Sanger sequencing. Results: This research found a significant difference in the TT genotype of rs1799964, P = 0.02, in the responder group, in contrast to the TC genotype of rs1799964, which was significantly more frequent in the non-responder group, P = 0.01. The wild TT genotype of rs1799964 seemed to enhance the probability of being a responder. Nevertheless, the heterozygote TC genotype of rs1799964 showed a negative and significant correlation for responsiveness to etanercept. Conclusion: The TT genotype of rs1799964 is associated with a higher likelihood of responding to ETN, suggesting that it is a valuable diagnostic for predicting response in Iraqi AS patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">CHARACTERIZATION OF BY-PRODUCTS WITH HIGH FAT CONTENT DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTION OF BOVINE GELATIN [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gelatin is a protein obtained by partial hydrolysis of collagen contained in skins, connective tissue and/or animal bones, which are by-products of the meat industry. The main raw material to produce bovine gelatin is the dermis of the skin, but there is a variation in fat and moisture content depending on the bovine skin origin. As a contribution to the circular economy and sustainability, these by-products with high fat content and the fat released from them during the gelatin production process can be managed for food industries, mainly in the development or formulation of animal feed. Methods: For the initial physicochemical characterization, moisture, fat, protein and ashes content were determined. Once the by-products with high fat content were identified, alteration parameters such as acidity, peroxide and saponification indexes were evaluated. Additionally, thermal, rheological and fatty acid composition characterization was carried out in order to study the possible applications of the by-products. Results and Discussion: The results showed that some of the by-products presented fat content values lower than 15.0%, so the viability of their use is limited. On the other hand, some by-products have more than 30% fat content, however, they can only be removed manually, and the efficiency of this process is low. By-products removed from the supernatant in the extractors presented 99.9 and 98.9% of fat, and there is the possibility of conditioning a mechanical method for their extraction. The determination of alteration and oxidation parameters, thermal and rheological characterization, fatty acid profile and solid fat content were carried out only on these by-products. According to the characterization, these by-products could be valued and used in the formulation of animal feed, however, they present some limitations for some applications such as biodiesel production or food industry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors contributing to moral distress among intensive care nurses: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a busy and complex workplace, and several work-related and personal factors are known to make ICU nurses more vulnerable to moral distress than other healthcare professionals. It is crucial to identify these factors to guide future studies and preventive strategies. This scoping review explores such factors to present current knowledge on the factors that trigger moral distress and to guide future research by reviewing studies to explore and summarize factors that trigger moral distress in ICU nurses.   Methods: The PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published between 2011 to 2022. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed studies published in English that provided results regarding factors causes or correlated to moral distress in ICU nurses. After removing 63 duplicates, 371 papers were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 47 articles for full-text screening. A further 30 articles were excluded as their outcomes did not include factors that caused moral distress, or were not specific to ICU nurses, so 17 studies were eventually analysed using qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach. The findings of the articles were extracted and coded independently by two authors, and data were grouped and categorized. Results: The content categories of factors contributing to ICU nurses' moral distress were organized into themes and subthemes. Four major themes were identified: Powerlessness, end-of-life care, ineffective teamwork, and personal characteristics of ICU nurses.   Conclusions: This review highlights the factors that contribute to moral distress in critical care nurses, which are mainly attributable to the organizational climate and the nature of the ICU clinical environment. Descriptive and intervention studies (experimental or action research) must investigate causality between identified variables to inform management strategies to improve support for ICU nurses’ coping relative to moral distress.

                Background: The goal was to determine the thickness and width of the knee joint meniscus at their different regions. The objective was to compare the dimensions at these regions and over the right- and left-sided specimens. Methods: The present study included 50 adult cadaveric knee joints, and 100 menisci (50 medial menisci and 50 lateral menisci) were studied. The meniscus was distributed into anterior, middle and posterior parts. Thickness and width at the mid-point of these three parts were determined by using the Vernier caliper. Results: The breadth of the medial meniscus was 8.38 ± 1.64 mm, 7.68 ± 1.92 mm and 13.93 ± 2.69 mm at the anterior, middle and posterior one-third regions. Same measurements for the lateral menisci at these regions were 9.84 ± 1.78 mm, 8.82 ± 2.01 mm and 10.18 ± 2.23 mm, respectively. The thickness of the medial meniscus was 4.49 ± 0.78 mm, 4.07 ± 0.81 mm and 4.79 ± 0.93 mm at these regions. The lateral meniscus thickness was 3.82 ± 0.69 mm, 4.43 ± 0.98 mm and 4.36 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. Conclusion: It is believed that this data is enlightening to the arthroscopic surgeon during the meniscus transplantation either by using synthetic material or allograft as the proper sizing of the meniscus is important to prevent complications due to inaccurate sizing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of serum leptin and adiponectin levels on breast cancer in postmenopausal Iraqi women: an observational Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and the second most significant cause of death for women in Iraq, behind cardiovascular diseases. Obesity has been linked to a substantial increase in the risk of breast cancer. Adipose tissue functions as an endocrine gland, controlling the body's metabolism by secreting adipokines, which play a significant role in metabolism and inflammatory reactions. Methods: Overall, 90 postmenopausal women participated in this research. Of these, 60 patients with breast cancer were recruited at Baghdad's Oncology Teaching Hospital between October 2021 and February 2022: 30 were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of > 30 kg/m2 (group 1), and 30 were not obese (group 2). The third group consisted of 30 participants without breast cancer or obesity (group 3). Each person donated five milliliters of venous blood. The blood levels of adiponectin and leptin are determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: Control individuals who were not obese (group 3) had greater blood adiponectin levels than patients with cancer who were both obese and non-obese (groups 1 and 2), with no significant difference in serum adiponectin levels seen between groups 1 and 2. The findings also showed that group 1 (patients with breast cancer and obesity) had greater serum leptin levels than both group 2 (patients with breast cancer without obesity) and the control group (group 3), with no significant difference in serum leptin levels between groups 2 and 3. Conclusions: Adiponectin levels in the blood of women with breast cancer and obesity were low which may be due to high BMI, which reduces adiponectin's protective effects. Conversely, Leptin levels were more significant in the blood of women with breast cancer and obesity than in the control group, which may be due to its pro-inflammatory effects in obesity, among other variables.

                Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common oral cancers with a high mortality rate. The biodiversity source in Indonesia makes areca nut a potential antioxidant in treating disease. Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the chemotherapeutic effect of areca nut extract in 4-nutriquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)-tumor-induced rats. Methods:  Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 served as the control group, group 2 was 4NQO-induced rats without treatment, and groups 3 and 4 were given 4NQO-tumor inducer with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract, respectively. The rats in groups 2,3, and 4 received 30 ppm of 4NQO tumor inducer in drinking water for 12 weeks. In the end, all rats were euthanized and the tongue was removed. The body, liver, kidney, heart, and lungs weights were measured. Tongue tumor volume and dysplasia lesions were analyzed. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stromal area were scored semi-quantitatively associating the infiltrate grade (0-3) and analyzed histologically. Results: There were significant differences in body weight loss between the initial and final phases in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The areca nut at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the tumor size compared with groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The incidence of OSCC in rats with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract after 22 weeks was 0%, but the dysplasia lesions were observed at 28.57% and 85.71%, respectively. The highest mean of stromal TILs was in group 3 and there were significant differences in stromal TILs between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Conclusion: Areca nut extract exerts a chemotherapeutic activity in 4NQO-induced rats by inducing infiltrating lymphocytes in the stromal tumor area on the OSCC lesion of the tongue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Turning any bed into an intensive care unit with the Internet of things and artificial intelligence technology. Presenting the enhanced mechanical ventilator [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic displayed weaknesses in the healthcare infrastructures worldwide and exposed a lack of specialized personnel to cover the demands of a massive calamity. We have developed a portable ventilator that uses real-time vitals read from the patient to estimate -- through artificial intelligence -- the optimal operation point. The ventilator has redundant telecommunication capabilities; therefore, the remote assistance model can protect specialists and relatives from highly contagious agents. Additionally, we have designed a system that automatically publishes information in a proprietary cloud centralizer to keep physicians and relatives informed. The system was tested in a residential last-mile connection, and transaction times below the second were registered. The timing scheme allows us to operate up to 200 devices concurrently on these lowest-specification transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) services, promptly transmitting data for online processing and reporting. The ventilator is a proof of concept of automation that has behavioral and cognitive inputs to cheaply, yet reliably, extend the installed capacity of the healthcare systems and multiply the response of the skilled medical personnel to cover high-demanding scenarios and improve service quality.

     alt="Immunohistochemical characterization of bipolar cells in four distantly related avian species"/>
<p>In the vertebrate retina, bipolar cells are the only interneurons that project from the outer to the inner retina. Here, we systematically tested 12 antibodies for their ability to label individual bipolar cells in the bird retina and compared the eight most suitable antibodies across distantly related species, namely domestic chicken, domestic pigeon, common buzzard, and European robin. In addition, we also analyzed the photoreceptor connectivity of selected bipolar cell types in the European robin retina, which may not only process visual but also magnetic signals.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual (and probably also magnetic) signal processing starts at the first synapse, at which photoreceptors contact different types of bipolar cells, thereby feeding information into different processing channels. In the chicken retina, 15 and 22 different bipolar cell types have been identified based on serial electron microscopy and single-cell transcriptomics, respectively. However, immunohistochemical markers for avian bipolar cells were only anecdotally described so far. Here, we systematically tested 12 antibodies for their ability to label individual bipolar cells in the bird retina and compared the eight most suitable antibodies across distantly related species, namely domestic chicken, domestic pigeon, common buzzard, and European robin, and across retinal regions. While two markers (GNB3 and EGFR) labeled specifically ON bipolar cells, most markers labeled in addition to bipolar cells also other cell types in the avian retina. Staining pattern of four markers (CD15, PKCα, PKCβ, secretagogin) was species-specific. Two markers (calbindin and secretagogin) showed a different expression pattern in central and peripheral retina. For the chicken and European robin, we found slightly more ON bipolar cell somata in the inner nuclear layer than OFF bipolar cell somata. In contrast, OFF bipolar cells made more ribbon synapses than ON bipolar cells in the inner plexiform layer of these species. Finally, we also analyzed the photoreceptor connectivity of selected bipolar cell types in the European robin retina. In summary, we provide a catalog of bipolar cell markers for different bird species, which will greatly facilitate analyzing the retinal circuitry of birds on a larger scale.</p>

                α-Synuclein belongs to a family of highly conserved proteins that includes β- and γ-synucleins [1]. α-Synuclein is highly expressed throughout the brain and is particularly enriched in the synaptic terminals of neurons [2,3]. It has gained notoriety due to its link to PD and other neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies [4]. Therefore, research on the pathological role of α-synuclein has grown rapidly, while fewer studies have focused on the physiological function(s) of α-synuclein. Multiple therapeutic strategies aim at reducing α-synuclein levels but have failed so far in clinical trials, indicating a need for better understanding of α-synuclein’s biology and pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optogenetics and electron tomography for structure-function analysis of cochlear ribbon synapses</a></h4>

              
                Ribbon synapses of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) are specialized to indefatigably transmit sound information at high rates. To understand the underlying mechanisms, structure-function analysis of the active zone (AZ) of these synapses is essential. Previous electron microscopy studies of synaptic vesicle (SV) dynamics at the IHC AZ used potassium stimulation, which limited the temporal resolution to minutes. Here, we established optogenetic IHC stimulation followed by quick freezing within milliseconds and electron tomography to study the ultrastructure of functional synapse states with good temporal resolution in mice. We characterized optogenetic IHC stimulation by patch-clamp recordings from IHCs and postsynaptic boutons revealing robust IHC depolarization and transmitter release. Ultrastructurally, the number of docked SVs increased upon short (17-25 ms) and long (48-76 ms) light stimulation paradigms. We did not observe enlarged SVs or other morphological correlates of homotypic fusion events. Our results indicate a rapid recruitment of SVs to the docked state upon stimulation and suggest that univesicular release prevails as the quantal mechanism of exocytosis at IHC ribbon synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">On the origin of universal cell shape variability in a confluent epithelial monolayer</a></h4>

              
                Cell shape is fundamental in biology. The average cell shape can influence crucial biological functions, such as cell fate and division orientation. But cell-to-cell shape variability is often regarded as noise. In contrast, recent works reveal that shape variability in diverse epithelial monolayers follows a nearly universal distribution. However, the origin and implications of this universality remain unclear. Here, assuming contractility and adhesion are crucial for cell shape, characterized via aspect ratio (r), we develop a mean-field analytical theory for shape variability. We find that all the system-specific details combine into a single parameter α that governs the probability distribution function (PDF) of r; this leads to a universal relation between the standard deviation and the average of r. The PDF for the scaled r is not strictly but nearly universal. In addition, we obtain the scaled area distribution, described by the parameter μ, α and μ together can distinguish the effects of changing physical conditions, such as maturation, on different system properties. We have verified the theory via simulations of two distinct models of epithelial monolayers and with existing experiments on diverse systems. We demonstrate that in a confluent monolayer, average shape determines both the shape variability and dynamics. Our results imply that cell shape distribution is inevitable, where a single parameter describes both statics and dynamics and provides a framework to analyze and compare diverse epithelial systems. In contrast to existing theories, our work shows that the universal properties are consequences of a mathematical property and should be valid in general, even in the fluid regime.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fan cells in lateral entorhinal cortex directly influence medial entorhinal cortex through synaptic connections in layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Standard models for spatial and episodic memory suggest that the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) send parallel independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching the hippocampus. We demonstrate that, in mice, fan cells in layer 2 (L2) of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of the MEC. Activation of inputs from fan cells evokes monosynaptic glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow components mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively. Inputs from fan cells also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2 of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for integration of 'what' and 'where' components of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary divergence in the conformational landscapes of Tyrosine vs Serine/Threonine Kinases</a></h4>

              
                Inactive conformations of protein kinase catalytic domains where the DFG motif has a 'DFG-out' orientation and the activation loop is folded present a druggable binding pocket that is targeted by FDA-approved 'type-II inhibitors' in the treatment of cancers. Tyrosine Kinases (TKs) typically show strong binding affinity with a wide spectrum of type-II inhibitors while Serine/Threonine Kinases (STKs) usually bind more weakly which we suggest here is due to differences in the folded to extended conformational equilibrium of the activation loop between TKs vs. STKs. To investigate this, we use sequence covariation analysis with a Potts Hamiltonian statistical energy model to guide absolute binding free-energy molecular dynamics simulations of 74 protein-ligand complexes. Using the calculated binding free energies together with experimental values, we estimated free-energy costs for the large-scale (~17-20Å) conformational change of the activation loop by an indirect approach, circumventing the very challenging problem of simulating the conformational change directly. We also used the Potts statistical potential to thread large sequence ensembles over active and inactive kinase states. The structure-based and sequence-based analyses are consistent; together they suggest TKs evolved to have free-energy penalties for the classical 'folded activation loop' DFG-out conformation relative to the active conformation that is, on average, 4-6 kcal/mol smaller than the corresponding values for STKs. Potts statistical energy analysis suggests a molecular basis for this observation, wherein the activation loops of TKs are more weakly 'anchored' against the catalytic loop motif in the active conformation, and form more stable substrate-mimicking interactions in the inactive conformation. These results provide insights into the molecular basis for the divergent functional properties of TKs and STKs, and have pharmacological implications for the target selectivity of type-II inhibitors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical activity during naturalistic music listening reflects short-range predictions based on long-term experience</a></h4>

              
                Expectations shape our experience of music. However, the internal model upon which listeners form melodic expectations is still debated. Do expectations stem from Gestalt-like principles or statistical learning? If the latter, does long-term experience play an important role, or are short-term regularities sufficient? And finally, what length of context informs contextual expectations? To answer these questions, we presented human listeners with diverse naturalistic compositions from Western classical music, while recording neural activity using MEG. We quantified note-level melodic surprise and uncertainty using various computational models of music, including a state-of-the-art transformer neural network. A time-resolved regression analysis revealed that neural activity over fronto-temporal sensors tracked melodic surprise particularly around 200 ms and 300–500 ms after note onset. This neural surprise response was dissociated from sensory-acoustic and adaptation effects. Neural surprise was best predicted by computational models that incorporated long-term statistical learning – rather than by simple, Gestalt-like principles. Yet, intriguingly, the surprise reflected primarily short-range musical contexts of less than ten notes. We present a full replication of our novel MEG results in an openly available EEG dataset. Together, these results elucidate the internal model that shapes melodic predictions during naturalistic music listening.

                A wide range of neurological diseases with impaired motor functioning of the upper extremities are accompanied by impairments of somatosensory functioning, which are often undescribed but can provide crucial information for diagnostics, treatment selection, and follow-up. Therefore, a reliable description of the functional representation of the digits in the somatosensory cortex would be a highly valuable, but currently lacking, tool in the clinical context. Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of passive tactile stimulation provides an indirect, but valid description of the layout of the digit map in the primary somatosensory cortex. However, to fulfill the specific requirements for clinical application, the presently established approaches need to be adapted and subsequently assessed for feasibility and retest reliability, in order to provide informative parameters for the description of the evoked digit activations. Accordingly, the present high-field 3T fMRI study compares the performance of two established digit mapping designs - travelling wave (TW) and blocked design (BD) - for passive tactile stimulation of the five digits, adapted to reduce the time requirements to just below 15 minutes. To be able to assess the retest reliability unaffected by any clinical conditions, the study was performed on neurotypical participants. The results show that both stimulation designs evoke significant and distinct activation clusters in the primary somatosensory cortex of all participants for all five digits. The average spatial locations of the center of gravities across participants show the common succession of distinct digit representation along the central sulcus. The cortical extent elicited activation, which is generally larger for the thumb and the index finger, also shows comparable average values across the two approaches. Less overlap of activation between neighboring digits was obtained in BD, consistent with the distinct single digit neuronal representations. A high retest reliability was obtained for the location of the digit activation, displaying stable center of gravity locations across sessions for both stimulation designs. This is contrasted by only medium to low retest reliability for the extent and overlap of the digit activations, indicating discrepancies across sessions. These results demonstrate the capacity of shortened fMRI digit mapping approaches (both TW and BD) to obtain the full layout of single digit cortical activations on the level of the individual, which together with the high reliability of the location of the digit representation over time indicates both approaches are clinically applicable.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability of resting-state functional connectivity in the human spinal cord: assessing the impact of distinct noise sources</a></h4>

              
                The investigation of spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has recently been extended from the brain to the spinal cord, where it has also generated initial interest from a clinical perspective. A number of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated robust functional connectivity between the time-series of BOLD fluctuations in bilateral dorsal horns and between those in bilateral ventral horns, in line with the functional neuroanatomy of the spinal cord. A necessary step prior to extension to clinical studies is assessing the reliability of such resting-state signals, which we aimed to do here in a group of 45 healthy young adults at the clinically prevalent field-strength of 3T. When investigating connectivity in the entire cervical spinal cord, we observed fair to good reliability for dorsal-dorsal and ventral-ventral connectivity, whereas reliability was poor for within- and between-hemicord dorsal-ventral connectivity. Considering how prone spinal cord fMRI is to noise, we extensively investigated the impact of distinct noise sources and made two crucial observations: removal of physiological noise led to a reduction in functional connectivity strength and reliability - due to the removal of stable and participant-specific noise patterns - whereas removal of thermal noise considerably increased the detectability of functional connectivity without a clear influence on reliability. Finally, we also assessed connectivity within spinal cord segments and observed that while the pattern of connectivity was similar to that of whole cervical cord, reliability at the level of single segments was consistently poor. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of reliable resting-state functional connectivity in the human spinal cord even after thoroughly accounting for physiological and thermal noise, but at the same time urge caution if focal changes in connectivity (e.g. due to segmental lesions) are to be studied, especially in a longitudinal manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Membrane association is required for Stmn2-mediated axon protection</a></h4>

              
                Axon integrity is essential for functional connectivity in the nervous system. The degeneration of stressed or damaged axons is a common and sometimes initiating event in neurodegenerative disorders. Cellular factors that preserve axon integrity have an important influence on the fate of a damaged axon. Stathmin-2 (Stmn2) is an axon maintenance factor that is depleted in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and replenishment of Stmn2 can restore neurite outgrowth in diseased neurons. Stathmins have a well-documented role in microtubule dynamics during neurodevelopment, yet mechanisms responsible for Stmn2-mediated axon maintenance in injured neurons are not known. We demonstrate that membrane association of Stmn2 is critical for its axon-protective activity. Axonal enrichment of Stmn2 is driven by palmitoylation as well as tubulin interaction. We discover that another Stathmin, Stmn3, co-migrates with Stmn2-containing vesicles and undergoes regulated degradation through DLK-JNK signaling. The Stmn2 membrane targeting domain is both necessary and sufficient for localization to a specific vesicle population and confers sensitivity to DLK-dependent degradation. Our findings reveal a broader role for DLK in tuning the local abundance of palmitoylated Stathmins in axon segments. Moreover, palmitoylation is a critical component of Stathmin-mediated axon protection and defining the Stmn2-containing vesicle population will provide important clues toward mechanisms of axon maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Somatomotor Beta Bursts Mediate the Negative Impact of PTSD Severity on Conflict Monitoring</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control deficits are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may explain how reminders of past traumatic events intrude upon daily experiences of people who have experienced trauma. Lateralized somatomotor beta-band desynchronization, an electrophysiological signature of controlled movement, indexes the downstream output of cognitive control processes. Recent evidence suggests that somatomotor beta activity does not manifest as rhythmic oscillations, but instead as discrete and stochastic burst-like events. Here, we quantified the rates of lateralized somatomotor beta bursts (beta burst rates; BBR) evoked during a flanker cognitive control paradigm among United States military veterans from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom (OEF/OIF) who show varying degrees of PTSD. We found BBR reflected both response direction and conflict monitoring during processing of stimuli that evoked response conflict. Impaired behavioral performance and increased peri-response BBR were related to greater posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS). Critically, increased BBR mediated the link between PTSS and decreased conflict monitoring accuracy. Results suggest that poor cognitive control in PTSS reflects a failure to adaptively disinhibit target motor representations, rather than a failure to inhibit distractor representations. Thus, BBR reveal limited representation of target stimuli as a primary contributor to impaired cognitive control in PTSD. Because BBR were robustly associated with behavioral performance and exhibited high statistical reliability the index may carry utility for appraising individual differences in cognitive control in other brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in the effects of salience and reward on impulse control and action selection</a></h4>

              
                Impulse control and adequate decision making are vital functions when it comes to detection and adherence to societal rules, especially in critical circumstances such as the Covid pandemic. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that increasing the salience of environmental cues would be most effective in improving impulse control, as assessed in a stop-signal task, in subjects with low environmental susceptibility as indexed by low pre-stimulus EEG alpha power. In addition, we anticipated that an external-reward intervention improves performance during a Go/No go task, especially in individuals with low task-induced motivation as indexed by low theta/ beta power ratios. High salience of stop signals enhanced stopping performance but there was no difference in responsivity to the salience intervention between participants with high and low EEG alpha power. Individuals with low theta/ beta power ratios responded more accurately when rewards were at stake. Together these results suggest that increasing the salience of external cues may help impulse control in general, whereas the effectiveness of external-reward interventions is higher in individuals with low task-induced motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial Evolution of Information Dynamics in the Primary Motor Cortex During Reach</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be spatially organized in terms of muscles and body parts, notwithstanding some overlap. However, the classical view is largely static, neglecting potential representational changes on a fast time scale. To address potential representational dynamics, we probed the mutual information between M1 signals recorded across the cortical sheet and electromyography (EMG) activity from a set of muscles while a macaque monkey performed planar reaches. Here, we demonstrated that the spatial organization of the M1 encoding was in fact quite dynamic throughout the course of a reaching movement such that a given cortical site maximally encoded different muscles at different times. Despite these rapid representational changes, a proximal-to-distal gradient of the upper limb representation was preserved particularly close to movement onset. Representation was most stable close to movement onset, with characteristic topographic maps, possibly serving functional needs. This study bridges the important gap between flexible motor encoding and static motor maps, emphasizing the importance of considering space and time together in motor representation studies.

                Human memory is selective and not all experiences are remembered. Both monetary rewards/incentives and curiosity have been found to motivate and facilitate learning by dopaminergic midbrain projections to the hippocampus during encoding. In this study, we examined potential brain mechanisms during early consolidation period that jointly or independently contribute to these facilitating effects. Participants (N = 50) watched 36 videos of magic tricks and rated their "subjective feelings of curiosity" while the availability of extrinsic incentives was manipulated between groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired before, during, and after learning, and memory for magic tricks was assessed one week after. Our analysis focused on the change in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the dopaminergic midbrain and the anterior hippocampus, a dopaminergic consolidation mechanism previously reported in the context of extrinsically motivated learning. Changes in RSFC were correlated with behavioural measures of learning, i.e., the total number of items encoded and the curiosity-driven memory benefit. We found that brain-behaviour correlations differed depending on the availability of extrinsic incentives. More specifically, the correlation between the total number of items encoded and RSFC change was significantly different in the incentivised compared to the control group. The curiosity-driven memory benefit, however, did not correlate with changes in RSFC in either of the groups. In sum, this suggests that curiosity-motivated learning might be supported by different consolidation mechanisms compared to extrinsically motivated learning and that extrinsic incentives influence consolidation mechanisms supporting learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How much data do we need? Lower bounds of brain activation states to predict human cognitive ability</a></h4>

              
                Human functional brain connectivity can be temporally decomposed into states of high and low cofluctuation, defined as coactivation of brain regions over time. Despite their low frequency of occurrence, states of particularly high cofluctuation have been shown to reflect fundamentals of intrinsic functional network architecture (derived from resting-state fMRI) and to be highly subject-specific. However, it is currently unclear whether such network-defining states of high cofluctuation also contribute to individual variations in cognitive abilities, which strongly rely on the interactions among distributed brain regions. By introducing CMEP, an eigenvector-based prediction framework, we show that functional connectivity estimates from as few as 20 temporally separated time frames (< 3% of a 10 min resting-state fMRI scan) are significantly predictive of individual differences in intelligence (N = 281, p < .001). In contrast and against previous expectations, individual's network-defining time frames of particularly high cofluctuation do not achieve significant prediction of intelligence. Multiple functional brain networks contribute to the prediction, and all results replicate in an independent sample (N = 831). Our results suggest that although fundamentals of person-specific functional connectomes can be derived from few time frames of highest brain connectivity, temporally distributed information is necessary to extract information about cognitive abilities from functional connectivity time series. This information, however, is not restricted to specific connectivity states, like network-defining high-cofluctuation states, but rather reflected across the entire length of the brain connectivity time series.

                Gap junction gene GJB2 (Cx26) mutations cause >50% of nonsyndromic hearing loss. Its recessive hetero-mutation carriers, who have no deafness, occupy ~10-20% of the general population. Here, we report an unexpected finding that these heterozygote carriers have hearing over-sensitivity and active cochlear amplification increased. Mouse models show that Cx26 hetero-deletion reduced endocochlear potential (EP) generation in the cochlear lateral wall and caused outer hair cell electromotor protein prestin compensatively upregulated to increase active cochlear amplification and hearing sensitivity. The increase of active cochlear amplification also increased sensitivity to noise; exposure of daily-level noise could cause Cx26+/- mice permanent hearing threshold shift leading to hearing loss. This study demonstrate that Cx26 recessive heterozygous mutations are not harmless for hearing as previously considered and can cause hyperacusis-like hearing over-sensitivity. The data also indicate that GJB2 hetero-mutation carriers are vulnerable to noise and should avoid noise exposure in daily-life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unraveling the therapeutic mechanism of deep-brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from otherwise therapy-resistant psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. Modulation of cortico-striatal circuits has been suggested as a mechanism of action. To gain mechanistic insight, we monitored neuronal activity in cortico-striatal regions in a mouse model for compulsive behavior, while systematically varying clinically-relevant parameters of internal-capsule DBS. DBS showed dose-dependent effects on both brain and behavior: An increasing, yet balanced, number of excited and inhibited neurons was recruited, scattered throughout cortico-striatal regions, while compulsive grooming decreased. Such neuronal recruitment did not alter basic brain function such as resting-state activity, and only occurred in awake animals, indicating a dependency on network activity. In addition to these widespread effects, we observed specific involvement of the medial orbitofrontal cortex in therapeutic outcomes, which was corroborated by optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects on compulsive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential and overlapping effects between exogenous and endogenous attention shape perceptual facilitation during visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Visuospatial attention is not a monolithic process and can be divided into different functional systems. In this framework, exogenous attention reflects the involuntary orienting of attention resources following a salient event, whereas endogenous attention corresponds to voluntary orienting based on the goals and intentions of individuals. Previous work shows that these attention processes map onto distinct functional systems, yet evidence suggests that they are not fully independent. In the current work, we investigated the differential and overlapping effects of exogenous and endogenous on visual processing of sensory events. Specifically, we combined spatial cueing of visuospatial attention, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine where and when the effects of exogenous and endogenous attention were maximally different and maximally similar. Critically, MVPA provided new insights by examining whether classifiers trained to decode the cueing effect for one attention process (e.g., exogenous attention) can successfully decode the cueing effect for the other attention process (e.g., endogenous attention), and vice versa. These analyses revealed differential effects between exogenous and endogenous early after target onset (<200ms post-target). In turn, both shared similar processing later (~300ms post-target). We combined principal component analyses, single-trial event-related potentials, and mediation analysis to determine whether these effects contribute to the facilitation effects observed at the behavioral level after exogenous and endogenous spatial cueing. We uncovered that three EEG components (i.e., a posterior ipsilateral component, a posterior contralateral one, and a central one) shape the cueing effects of exogenous and endogenous attention at various times after target onset. Altogether, our study combines the strengths of MVPA, single-trial analysis, and meditation modelling to provide a comprehensive account about overlapping and differential processes of endogenous and exogenous, and how these dynamics relate to perceptual facilitation in the context of visuospatial attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A combined DTI-fMRI approach for optimizing the delineation of posteromedial vs. anterolateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subdivision using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a discrete border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct connectivity patterns: While pmEC showed increased connectivity preferentially with the default mode network, the alEC exhibited increased connectivity with regions in the dorsal attention and salience networks. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.

                Epigenetic changes can bring insight into gene regulatory mechanisms associated with disease pathogenicity, including chronicity and increased vulnerability. To date, we are yet to identify genes sensitive to epigenetic regulation that contribute to the maintenance of chronic pain and with an epigenetic landscape indicative of the susceptibility to persistent pain. Such genes would provide a novel opportunity for better pain management, as their epigenetic profile could be targeted for the treatment of chronic pain or used as an indication of vulnerability for prevention strategies. Here, we investigated the epigenetic profile of the gene FKBP5 for this potential, using targeted bisulphite sequencing in rodent pre-clinical models of chronic and latent hypersensitive states. The FKBP5 promoter DNA methylation (DNAm) signature in the CNS was significantly different between models of persistent pain and there was a significant correlation between CNS and peripheral blood FKBP5 DNAm, indicating that further exploration of FKBP5 promoter DNAm as a biomarker of chronic pain pathogenic origin is warranted. We also found that maternal separation, which promotes the persistency of inflammatory pain in adulthood, was accompanied by long-lasting reduction in FKBP5 DNAm, suggesting that FKPB5 DNAm profile may indicate the increased vulnerability to chronic pain in individuals exposed to trauma in early life. Overall, our data demonstrate that the FKBP5 promoter DNAm landscape brings novel insight into the differing pathogenic origins of chronic pain, may be able to diagnose and stratify patients, and predict the susceptibility to chronic pain.

                Regions in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) that are involved in visual recognition of categories like words and faces, undergo differential development during childhood. However, categories are also represented in distributed responses across VTC. How do distributed category representations develop and relate to behavioral changes in recognition? Here, we used fMRI to longitudinally measure the development of distributed responses across VTC to 10 categories in school-age children over several years. Our results reveal both strengthening and weakening of category representations with age, which was mainly driven by changes across category-selective voxels. Representations became particularly more distinct for words in the left hemisphere and for faces bilaterally. Critically, distinctiveness for words and faces across category-selective voxels in left and right lateral VTC, respectively, predicted individual children's word and face recognition performance. These results suggest that the development of distributed VTC representations has behavioral ramifications and advance our understanding of prolonged cortical development during childhood.

                Several discrete groups of feeding-regulated neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) suppress food intake, including aversion-promoting neurons that express Cck (NTSCck cells) and distinct Lepr- and Calcr-expressing neurons (NTSLepr and NTSCalcr cells, respectively) that suppress food intake without promoting aversion. To test synergies among these cell groups we manipulated multiple NTS cell populations simultaneously. We found that activating multiple sets of NTS neurons (e.g., NTSLepr plus NTSCalcr (NTSLC), or NTSLC plus NTSCck (NTSLCK)) suppressed feeding more robustly than activating single populations. While activating groups of cells that include NTSCck neurons promoted conditioned taste avoidance (CTA), NTSLC activation produced no CTA despite abrogating feeding. Thus, the ability to promote CTA formation represents a dominant effect, but activating multiple non-aversive populations additively suppresses food intake without provoking aversion. Although silencing multiple NTS neuron groups augmented food intake and body weight more dramatically than silencing single populations, feeding activated many non-NTSLCK neurons and silencing NTSLCK neurons failed to blunt the weight loss response to vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). Hence, while each of these NTS neuron populations plays crucial and additive roles in the control of energy balance, as-yet undefined cell types must make additional contributions to the control of feeding and the response to VSG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracellular vesicle-associated cholesterol dictates the regenerative functions of macrophages in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Macrophages play major roles in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, being involved in seemingly opposing processes such as lesion progression and resolution. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that drive their harmful and benign effector functions remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by repair-associated macrophages (RAMs) enhance remyelination ex vivo and in vivo by promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Guided by lipidomic analysis and applying cholesterol depletion and enrichment strategies, we find that EVs released by RAMs show markedly elevated cholesterol levels and that cholestserol abundance controls their reparative impact on OPC maturation and remyelination. Mechanistically, EV-associated cholesterol was found to promote OPC differentiation through direct membrane fusion. Collectively, our findings highlight that EVs are essential for cholesterol trafficking in the brain and that changes in cholesterol abundance dictate the reparative impact of EVs released by macrophages in the brain, potentially having broad implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting repair in neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence suggesting creatine as a new central neurotransmitter: presence in synaptic vesicles, release upon stimulation, effects on cortical neurons and uptake into synaptosomes and synaptic vesicles</a></h4>

              
                It has never been easy to discover a new neurotransmitter, especially one in the central nervous system (CNS). We have been searching for new neurotransmitters for 12 years. We detected creatine (Cr) in synaptic vesicles (SVs), at a level lower than glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but higher than acetylcholine (ACh) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). SV Cr was reduced in mice lacking either arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, a Cr synthetase) or SLC6A8, a Cr transporter with mutations among the most common causes of intellectual disability (ID) in men. Calcium-dependent release of Cr was detected after stimulation in brain slices. Cr release was reduced in SLC6A8 and AGAT mutants. Cr inhibited neocortical pyramidal neurons. SLC6A8 was necessary for Cr uptake into synaptosomes. Cr was found by us to be taken up into SVs in an ATP dependent manner. Thus, our biochemical, chemical, genetic and electrophysiological results suggest Cr as a neurotransmitter, illustrate a novel approach to discover neurotransmitters and provide a new basis for ID pathogenesis.

                Successful explicit memory encoding is associated with inferior temporal activations and medial parietal deactivations, which are attenuated in aging. Here we used Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to elucidate the information flow between hippocampus, parahippocampal place area (PPA) and precuneus during encoding of novel visual scenes. In 117 young adults, DCM revealed pronounced activating input from the PPA to the hippocampus and inhibitory connectivity from the PPA to the precuneus during novelty processing, with both being further up-regulated during successful encoding. This pattern could be replicated in two cohorts (N = 141 and 148) of young and older adults. In both cohorts, older adults selectively exhibited attenuated (negative) PPA-precuneus connectivity, which correlated negatively with memory performance. Our results provide insight into network dynamics underlying explicit memory encoding and suggest that age-related differences in memory-related network activity manifest in altered temporo-parietal neocortical rather than hippocampal connectivity.

                The development of novel frameworks to understand the properties of unconscious representations and how they differ from the conscious counterparts may be critical to make progress in the neuroscience of vision consciousness. Here we re-analysed data from a within-subject, high-precision, highly-sampled fMRI study (N=7) coupled with model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) in order to provide an information-based approach to study the representation of conscious and unconscious visual contents The standard whole-brain searchlight RSA revealed that the hidden representations of convolutional neural network models explained brain activity patterns in response to unconscious contents in the ventral visual pathway in the majority of the observers, particularly for models that ranked high in explaining the variance of the visual cortex (i.e., VGGNet and ResNet50). Also five of seven subjects showed brain activity patterns that correlated with the model in frontoparietal areas in the unconscious trials. However, the results of an encoding-based RSA analyses in the unconscious condition were mixed and somehow difficult to interpret, including negative correlations between the representations of the computer vision models and the brain activity in frontal areas in a substantial amount of the observers.

                Neuroimaging data analysis often requires purpose-built software, which can be difficult to install and may produce different results across computing environments. Beyond being a roadblock to neuroscientists, these issues of accessibility and portability can hamper the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analysis pipelines. Here, we introduce the Neurodesk platform, which offers a sustainable, flexible solution; harnessing software containers to support a comprehensive and growing suite of neuroimaging software (https://www.neurodesk.org/). Neurodesk includes both a browser-accessible virtual desktop environment and a command line interface, mediating access to containerised neuroimaging software libraries from multiple systems; including personal computers, cloud computing, high-performance computers, and Jupyter notebooks. This community-driven, open-source platform represents a paradigm shift for neuroimaging data analysis, allowing for accessible, fully reproducible and portable data analysis pipelines, which can be redeployed in perpetuity, in any computing environment, with ease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tau depletion in human neurons mitigates A beta-driven toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers-disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative condition and the most common type of dementia, characterised by pathological accumulation of extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that mainly consist of amyloid-beta (A beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, respectively. Previous studies in mouse models with a targeted knock-out of the microtubule-associated protein tau (Mapt) gene demonstrated that A beta-driven toxicity is tau-dependent. However, human cellular models with chronic tau lowering remain unstudied. In this study, we generated stable tau-depleted human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) isogenic panels from two healthy individuals using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We then differentiated these iPSCs into cortical neurons in vitro in co-culture with primary rat cortical astrocytes before conducting electrophysiological and imaging experiments for a wide range of disease-relevant phenotypes. Both AD brain derived and recombinant A beta were used in this study to elicit toxic responses from the iPSC-derived cortical neurons. We showed that tau depletion in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons caused considerable reductions in neuronal activity without affecting synaptic density. We also observed neurite outgrowth impairments in two of the tau-depleted lines used. We found axonal transport of mitochondria, mitochondrial function, and cortical neuron differentiation propensity remained unaffected regardless of tau expression levels. Finally, tau depletion protected neurons from adverse effects mitigating the impact of exogenous A{beta}-induced hyperactivity, deficits in retrograde axonal transport of mitochondria, and neurodegeneration. Our study established stable human iPSC isogenic panels with chronic tau depletion from two healthy individuals. Cortical neurons derived from these iPSC lines showed that tau is essential in A beta-driven hyperactivity, axonal transport deficits, and neurodegeneration, consistent with studies conducted in Mapt-/- mouse models. These findings highlight the protective effects of chronic tau lowering strategies in AD pathogenesis and reinforce the potential in clinical settings. The tau-depleted human iPSC models can now be applied at scale to investigate the involvement of tau in disease-relevant pathways and cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leveraging the resting brain to predict memory decline after temporal lobectomy</a></h4>

              
                Objectives Anterior temporal lobectomy as a treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with a variable degree of postoperative memory decline, and estimating this decline for individual patients is a critical step of preoperative planning. Presently, predicting memory morbidity relies on indices of preoperative temporal lobe structural and functional integrity. However, epilepsy is increasingly understood as a network disorder, and memory a network phenomenon. We aimed to assess the utility of functional network measures to predict postoperative memory changes. Methods Patients with left and right temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were recruited from an epilepsy clinic. Patients underwent preoperative resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and pre- and postoperative neuropsychological assessment approximately one year after surgery. We compared functional connectivity throughout the memory network of each patient to a healthy control template based on 19 individuals to identify differences in global organization. A second metric indicated the degree of integration of the to-be-resected temporal lobe with the rest of the memory network. We included these measures in a linear regression model alongside standard clinical and demographic variables as predictors of memory change after surgery. Results Seventy-two adults with TLE were included in this study (37 left/35 right). Left TLE patients with more abnormal memory networks, and with greater functional integration of the to-be-resected region with the rest of the memory network preoperatively, experienced the greatest decline in verbal memory after surgery. Together, these two measures explained 44% of variance in verbal memory change (F(2,31)=12.01, p=0.0001), outperforming standard clinical and demographic variables. None of the variables examined in this study were associated with visuospatial memory change in patients with right TLE. Conclusion Resting-state connectivity provides valuable information concerning both the integrity of to-be-resected tissue as well as functional reserve across memory-relevant regions outside of the to-be-resected tissue. Intrinsic functional connectivity has the potential to be useful for clinical decision-making regarding memory outcomes in left TLE, and more work is needed to identify the factors responsible for differences seen in right TLE.

                Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus plays an important role for pattern separation, the process of separating similar inputs and forming distinct neural representations. Estradiol modulates neurogenesis and hippocampus function, but to date no examination of the effect of estradiol on pattern separation have been conducted. Here, we examined estrogenic regulation of adult neurogenesis and functional connectivity in the hippocampus after the spatial pattern separation task in female rats. Ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats received daily injections of vehicle, 0.32 g (Low) or 5 g (High) of estradiol benzoate until the end of experiment. A single bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected one day after initiation of hormone or vehicle treatment and rats were tested in the delayed nonmatching to position spatial pattern separation task in the 8-arm radial maze for 14 days beginning two weeks after BrdU injection. Rats were perfused 90 minutes after the final trial and brain sections were immunohistochemically stained for BrdU/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (new neurons), Ki67 (cell proliferation), and the immediate early gene, zif268 (activation). Results showed that only high estradiol reduced the density of BrdU/NeuN-ir cells and had significant inter-regional correlations of zif268-ir cell density in the hippocampus following pattern separation. Estradiol treatment did not influence pattern separation performance or strategy use. These results show that higher doses of estradiol can reduce neurogenesis but at the same time increases correlations of activity of neurons within the hippocampus during spatial pattern separation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exogenous attention interferes with endogenous attention processing via lateralized alpha power</a></h4>

              
                Current theories of attention differentiate exogenous (bottom-up) from endogenous (top- down) orienting of visuospatial attention. While both forms of attentional processing engage different processes, endogenous and exogenous attention are thought to share processing resources, as shown by recent empirical evidence of their functional interactions. Here, we aim to uncover the neurobiological basis of how salient events that drive exogenous attention disrupts endogenous attention processes. We hypothesize that interference from exogenous attention over endogenous attention involves alpha-band activity, a neural marker of visuospatial attention. To test this hypothesis, we contrast the effects of endogenous attention across two experimental conditions: a single cueing condition where endogenous attention is engaged in isolation, and a double cueing condition where endogenous attention is concurrently engaged with exogenous attention. Our results are consistent with previous work and show that the concurrent engagement of exogenous attention interferes with endogenous attention processes. Importantly, we evaluate our main hypothesis using a moderated mediation model. We found that changes in alpha-band activity mediate the relationship between endogenous attention and its benefits on task performance, and that the interference of exogenous attention on endogenous attention occurs via the moderation of this indirect effect. Altogether, our results substantiate a model of attention, whereby top-down and bottom-up attentional processes compete for shared neurophysiological resources. This model accounts for the observed patterns of interference between exogenous and endogenous attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biologically plausible phosphene simulation forthe differentiable optimization of visual corticalprostheses</a></h4>

              
                Blindness affects millions of people around the world, and is expected to become increasingly prevalent in the years to come. For some blind individuals, a promising solution to restore a form of vision are cortical visual prostheses, which convert camera input to electrical stimulation of the cortex to bypass part of the impaired visual system. Due to the constrained number of electrodes that can be implanted, the artificially induced visual percept (a pattern of localized light flashes, or 'phosphenes') is of limited resolution, and a great portion of the field's research attention is devoted to optimizing the efficacy, efficiency, and practical usefulness of the encoding of visual information. A commonly exploited method is the non-invasive functional evaluation in sighted subjects or with computational models by making use of simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) pipelines. Although the SPV literature has provided us with some fundamental insights, an important drawback that researchers and clinicians may encounter is the lack of realism in the simulation of cortical prosthetic vision, which limits the validity for real-life applications. Moreover, none of the existing simulators address the specific practical requirements for the electrical stimulation parameters. In this study, we developed a PyTorch-based, fast and fully differentiable phosphene simulator. Our simulator transforms specific electrode stimulation patterns into biologically plausible representations of the artificial visual percepts that the prosthesis wearer is expected to see. The simulator integrates a wide range of both classical and recent clinical results with neurophysiological evidence in humans and non-human primates. The implemented pipeline includes a model of the retinotopic organisation and cortical magnification of the visual cortex. Moreover, the quantitative effect of stimulation strength, duration, and frequency on phosphene size and brightness as well as the temporal characteristics of phosphenes are incorporated in the simulator. Our results demonstrate the suitability of the simulator for both computational applications such as end-to-end deep learning-based prosthetic vision optimization as well as behavioural experiments. The modular approach of our work makes it ideal for further integrating new insights in artificial vision as well as for hypothesis testing. In summary, we present an open-source, fully differentiable, biologically plausible phosphene simulator as a tool for computational, clinical and behavioural neuroscientists working on visual neuroprosthetics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal-immune Axis Alters Pain and Sensory Afferent Damage During Dental Pulp Injury</a></h4>

              
                Dental pulp tissue is densely innervated by afferent fibers of the trigeminal ganglion. When bacteria cause dental decay near the pulpal tissue, a strong neuronal and immune response occur, creating pulpitis, which is associated with severe pain and pulp tissue damage. Neuro-immune interactions have the potential to modulate both the pain and pathological outcome of pulpitis. We first investigated the role of the neuropeptide calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), released from peptidergic sensory afferents, in dental pain and immune responses by using calca knock out (calca-/-) and wild type (calca+/+) mice, in a model of pulpitis by creating a mechanical exposure of the dental pulp horn. While CGRP did not contribute to facial mechanical hypersensitivity, at an early time point, it did contribute to spontaneous pain-like behavior. We also found that CGRP contributed to recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, while not clearly affecting the progression of pulpal pathology histologically. When we depleted neutrophils and monocytes, we found that there was more sensory afferent loss, tissue damage and deeper spread of bacteria into the pulp tissue, while there was a reduction in facial mechanical hypersensitivity compared to control animals at a later time point. Overall, we showed that there is a crosstalk between peptidergic neurons and neutrophils in the pulp, modulating the pain and inflammatory outcomes of the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robotically-induced auditory-verbal hallucinations: combining self-monitoring and strong perceptual priors</a></h4>

              
                Inducing hallucinations under controlled experimental conditions in non-hallucinating individuals represents a novel research avenue oriented towards understanding complex hallucinatory phenomena, avoiding confounds observed in patients. Auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH) are one of the most common and distressing psychotic symptoms, whose etiology remains largely unknown. Two prominent accounts portray AVH either as a deficit in auditory-verbal self-monitoring, or as a result of overly strong perceptual priors. In order to test both theoretical models and evaluate their potential integration, we developed a robotic procedure able to induce self-monitoring perturbations (consisting of sensorimotor conflicts between poking movements and corresponding tactile feedback) and a perceptual prior associated with otherness sensations (i.e., feeling the presence of a non-existing another person). Here, in two independent studies, we show that this robotic procedure led to AVH-like phenomena in healthy individuals, which was further associated with delusional ideation. Specifically, a condition with stronger sensorimotor conflicts induced more AVH-like sensations (self-monitoring), while, in the otherness-related experimental condition, there were more AVH-like sensations when participants were detecting other-voice stimuli, compared to detecting self-voice stimuli (strong-priors). By demonstrating an experimental procedure able to induce AVH-like sensations in non-hallucinating individuals, we shed new light on AVH phenomenology, thereby integrating self-monitoring and strong-priors accounts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variance (un)explained: Experimental conditions and temporal dependencies explain similarly small proportions of reaction time variability in perceptual and cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Any series of sensorimotor actions shows fluctuations in speed and accuracy from repetition to repetition, even when the sensory input and the motor output requirements remain identical over time. Such fluctuations are particularly prominent in reaction time (RT) series from laboratory neurocognitive tasks. Despite their omnipresent nature, trial-to-trial fluctuations remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analysed RT series from various neurocognitive tasks, quantifying how much of the total trial-to-trial RT variance can be explained by three sources of variability that are frequently investigated in behavioural and neuroscientific research: 1) the experimental conditions, which are commonly employed to induce systematic patterns in variability, 2) short-term temporal dependencies such as the autocorrelation between subsequent trials, and 3) long-term temporal trends over entire experimental blocks and sessions. Furthermore, we examined to what extent the explained variances by these sources are shared or unique. In total we analysed 1913 unique RT series from 30 different cognitive control and perception-based tasks. On average, the three sources together explained only about 8-17% of the total variance. The experimental conditions explained on average about 2.5-3.5%, but did not share explained variance with temporal dependencies. Thus, the largest part of the trial-to-trial fluctuations in RT remained unexplained by the three variability sources that are typically analysed here. These may be attributable to observable endogenous factors, such as ongoing fluctuations in brain activity and bodily states, though some extent of randomness may be a feature of behaviour rather than just nuisance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discovering individual-specific gait signatures from data-driven models of neuromechanical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion results from the interactions of highly nonlinear neural and biomechanical dynamics. Accordingly, understanding gait dynamics across behavioral conditions and individuals based on detailed modeling of the underlying neuromechanical system has proven difficult. Here, we develop a data-driven and generative modeling approach that recapitulates the dynamical features of gait behaviors to enable more holistic and interpretable characterizations and comparisons of gait dynamics. Specifically, gait dynamics of multiple individuals are predicted by a dynamical model that defines a common, low-dimensional, latent space to compare group and individual differences. We find that highly individualized dynamics - i.e., gait signatures - for healthy older adults and stroke survivors during treadmill walking are conserved across gait speed. Gait signatures further reveal individual differences in gait dynamics, even in individuals with similar functional deficits. Moreover, components of gait signatures can be biomechanically interpreted and manipulated to reveal their relationships to observed spatiotemporal joint coordination patterns. Lastly, the gait dynamics model can predict the time evolution of joint coordination based on an initial static posture. Our gait signatures framework thus provides a generalizable, holistic method for characterizing and predicting cyclic, dynamical motor behavior that may generalize across species, pathologies, and gait perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serine-129 phosphorylation of α-synuclein is a trigger for physiologic protein-protein interactions and synaptic function</a></h4>

              
                Phosphorylation of -synuclein at the Serine-129 site (-syn Ser129P) is an established pathologic hallmark of synucleinopathies, and also a therapeutic target. In physiologic states, only a small fraction of total -syn is phosphorylated at this site, and consequently, almost all studies to date have focused on putative pathologic roles of this post-translational modification. We noticed that unlike native (total) -syn that is widely expressed throughout the brain, the overall pattern of -syn Ser129P is restricted, suggesting intrinsic regulation and putative physiologic roles. Surprisingly, preventing phosphorylation at the Ser-129 site blocked the ability of -syn to attenuate activity-dependent synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling; widely thought to reflect its normal function. Exploring mechanisms, we found that neuronal activity augments -syn Ser-129P, and this phosphorylation is required for -syn binding to VAMP2 and synapsin - two functional binding-partners that are necessary for -syn function. AlphaFold2-driven modeling suggests a scenario where Ser129P induces conformational changes in the C-terminus that stabilizes this region and facilitates protein-protein interactions. Our experiments indicate that the pathology-associated Ser129P is an unexpected physiologic trigger of -syn function, which has broad implications for pathophysiology and drug-development.

	<p>Previous studies have reported that stroke patients have difficulty recalling the motor imagery (MI) of a task, also known as MI vividness. Research on combining MI with action observation is gaining importance as a method to improve MI vividness. We enrolled 10 right-handed stroke patients and compared MI vividness and cortical activity under different presentation methods (no inverted image, inverted image of another individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s hand, and an inverted image of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s nonparalyzed hand) using near-infrared spectroscopy. Images of the nonparalyzed upper limb were inverted to make the paralyzed upper limb appear as if it were moving. Three tasks (non inverted image, AO + MI (other hand), AO + MI (own hand)) were randomly performed on 10 stroke patients. MI vividness was significantly higher when the inverted image of the nonparalyzed upper limb was presented compared to the other conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The activity of the cortical regions was also significantly enhanced (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Our study highlights the potential application of inverted images of a stroke patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s own nonparalyzed hand in mental practice to promote the motor recovery of stroke patients. This technique achieved higher levels of MI vividness and cortical activity when performing motor tasks.</p>

	<p>Many patients show poor outcomes following endovascular reperfusion therapy (ERT), and poor cortical venous outflow is a risk factor for these poor outcomes. We investigated the association between the outflow of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and baseline cortical venous outflow and the outcomes after ERT. We retrospectively enrolled 78 patients diagnosed with an acute anterior circulation stroke and successful ERT. Poor IJV outflow on the affected side was defined as stenosis &amp;amp;ge;50% or occlusion of ipsilateral IJV, and poor outflow of bilateral IJVs was defined as stenosis &amp;amp;ge;50% or occlusion of both IJVs. Poor cortical venous outflow was defined as a cortical vein opacification score (COVES) of 0 on admission. Multivariate analysis showed that poor outflow of IJV on the affected side was an independent predictor for hemorrhagic transformation. The poor outflow of bilateral IJVs was an independent risk factor for poor clinical outcomes. These patients also had numerical trends of a higher incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift &amp;amp;gt;10 mm, and in-hospital mortality; however, statistical significance was not observed. Additionally, poor IJV outflow was an independent determinant of poor cortical venous outflow. For acute large vessel occlusion patients, poor IJV outflow is associated with poor baseline cortical venous outflow and outcomes after successful ERT.</p>

	<p>There is currently no simple, widely available screening method for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), partly because the diagnosis of AD is complex and typically involves expensive and sometimes invasive tests not commonly available outside highly specialized clinical settings. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered end-to-end system to detect AD and predict its severity directly from voice recordings. At the core of our system is the pre-trained data2vec model, the first high-performance self-supervised algorithm that works for speech, vision, and text. Our model was internally evaluated on the ADReSSo (Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech only) dataset containing voice recordings of subjects describing the Cookie Theft picture, and externally validated on a test dataset from DementiaBank. The AI model can detect AD with average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846 and 0.835 on held-out and external test set, respectively. The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.9616). Moreover, the model can reliably predict the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive testing score solely based on raw voice recordings. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using the AI-powered end-to-end model for early AD diagnosis and severity prediction directly based on voice, showing its potential for screening Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease in a community setting.</p>

	<p>Chronic dysimmune neuropathies encompass a group of neuropathies that share immune-mediated pathomechanism. Chronic dysimmune antibody-related neuropathies include anti-MAG neuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and neuropathies related to immune attack against paranodal antigens. Such neuropathies exhibit distinguishing pathomechanism, clinical and response to therapy features with respect to chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and its variants, which represent the most frequent form of chronic dysimmune neuropathy. This narrative review provides an overview of pathomechanism; clinical, electrophysiological, and biochemical features; and treatment response of the antibody-mediated neuropathies, aiming to establish when and why to look for antibodies in chronic dysimmune neuropathies.</p>

	<p>Attachment security and dependency play a decisive role for children&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental health. From a family systems perspective, reciprocal effects of dyadic attachment to each parent within the same family on child symptomatology may well offer additional insights in developmental processes as parents and children influence each other consistently. This study examined the influence of child-mother as well as child&amp;amp;ndash;father attachment security and dependency on maternal, paternal, and observed ratings of children&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional and behavioral problems. A total of 124 families with preschool children participated in this study. Attachment security, dependency, and symptomatology of the children were independently observed during home visits. Furthermore, mothers and fathers rated child symptoms. Results revealed promotive effects of attachment security to both parents on observed child symptoms. Furthermore, we found a significant actor effect of child-mother attachment security, as well as a significant partner effect of child&amp;amp;ndash;father dependency on maternal ratings of child symptomatology. Attachment security to both parents is promotive for child mental health. The family systems perspective clarifies the meaning of child&amp;amp;ndash;father relationships for maternal perception of the own child.</p>

	<p>Amongst individuals with a mental health disorder, a comorbid diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) is associated with numerous adverse consequences, including more severe symptom profiles, poorer treatment response, and reduced psychosocial functioning. Contingency management (CM), a method to specifically reinforce target behavior attainment (e.g., substance use abstinence), may provide an effective intervention in treating cannabis use in patients with a dual diagnosis of CUD and a mental health disorder. A systematic search examining the effects of CM on cannabis use, clinical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes in patients with a mental health disorder on PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases up to November 2022 was performed. Six studies met inclusion criteria for our review. We found CM to be efficacious in producing cannabis use reductions and abstinence amongst individuals with a psychotic-spectrum or major depressive disorder. Additional longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes, other psychiatric populations, and longer follow-up periods are needed to evaluate the sustained effects of CM.</p>

	<p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare but severe neurological syndrome that may stem from the use of some medications. Although its mechanism is not well-known, hypertension and endothelial dysfunction have been mentioned in previous literature as being related. Lenvatinib serves as a neoplastic agent that inhibits the tyrosine kinase of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR). VEGFR inhibitors result in endothelial dysfunction and consequent hypertension by nitric oxide pathway suppression and endothelin (ET)-1 stimulation. We hypothesized that VEGFR inhibitors would cause PRES. Herein, we report the case of a 40-year-old man with olfactory neuroblastoma who developed PRES while undergoing treatment with lenvatinib, 7 months after initiation. The symptoms included loss of consciousness and seizures. Fortunately, the symptoms and presence of PRES in imaging resolved, 7 days and 1 month, respectively, after cessation of lenvatinib.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The Embodied Sense-of-Self Scale (ESSS) is the only validated measure for self-assessing embodiment abnormalities, which differentiate people with anomalous embodied self-representations such as schizophrenic patients from controls. The aim of the current study was to translate the ESSS from English to Italian and to examine its factor structure, reliability, and validity in the Italian context. (2) Methods: We tested the fit of the original three-factor structure (agency, ownership, and narrative identity) across a community sample (N = 269) and the reliability as well as the convergent and divergent validity of the ESSS. (3) Results: The three-factor structure of the ESSS was confirmed. However, three different factors have emerged from our analysis (self-recognition, self-consistence, and self-awareness). Higher internal consistency of the ESSS was obtained by removing six items that seemed problematic. The three ESSS scales show highly intercorrelated constructs. The measure was reliable and positively correlated with schizotypy (via the Perceptual Aberration Scale) and aberrant salience (via the Aberrant Salience Inventory), and negatively correlated with empathy (via the Italian Short Empathy Quotient scale), generalized self-efficacy (via the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale), and social self-efficacy (via the Perceived Social Self-Efficacy Scale). (4) Conclusions: The 19-item Italian version of the ESSS is a suitable measure with which to assess embodiment abnormalities in Italian samples.</p>

	<p>Proprioception is critical to motor control and functional status but has received limited study early after stroke. Patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for stroke (n = 18, mean(&amp;amp;plusmn;SD) 12.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.6 days from stroke) and older healthy controls (n = 19) completed the Wrist Position Sense Test (WPST), a validated, quantitative measure of wrist proprioception, as well as motor and cognitive testing. Patients were serially tested when available (n = 12, mean 11 days between assessments). In controls, mean(&amp;amp;plusmn;SD) WPST error was 9.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.5&amp;amp;deg; in the dominant wrist and 8.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.8&amp;amp;deg; in the nondominant wrist (p = 0.31). In patients with stroke, WPST error was 18.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9&amp;amp;deg; in the more-affected wrist, with abnormal values present in 88.2%; and 11.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.6&amp;amp;deg; in the less-affected wrist, with abnormal values present in 72.2%. Error in the more-affected wrist was higher than in the less-affected wrist (p = 0.003) or in the dominant (p = 0.001) and nondominant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) wrist of controls. Age and BBT performance correlated with dominant hand WPST error in controls. WPST error in either wrist after stroke was not related to age, BBT, MoCA, or Fugl-Meyer scores. WPST error did not significantly change in retested patients. Wrist proprioception deficits are common, bilateral, and persistent in subacute stroke and not explained by cognitive or motor deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Function of Excitatory Periaqueductal Gray Synapses in the Ventral Tegmental Area following Inflammatory Injury</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Manipulating the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons can drive nocifensive reflexes, and their firing rates are reduced following noxious stimuli. However, the pain-relevant inputs to the VTA remain incompletely understood. In this study, we used male and female mice in combination with identified dopamine and GABA neurons in the VTA that receive excitatory inputs from the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a nexus of ascending pain information. We tested whether PAG&ndash;VTA synapses undergo functional plasticity in response to a pain model using optical stimulation in conjunction with slice electrophysiology. We found that acute carrageenan inflammation does not significantly affect the strength of excitatory PAG synapses onto VTA DA neurons. However, at the PAG synapses on VTA GABA neurons, the subunit composition of NMDA receptors is altered; the complement of NR2D subunits at synaptic sites appears to be lost. Thus, our data support a model in which injury initially alters synapses on VTA GABA neurons. Over time, these alterations may increase tonic inhibition of VTA DA neurons leading to their reduced firing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Localization of TRP Channels in Healthy Oral Mucosa from Human Donors</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The oral cavity is exposed to a remarkable range of noxious and innocuous conditions, including temperature fluctuations, mechanical forces, inflammation, and environmental and endogenous chemicals. How such changes in the oral environment are sensed is not completely understood. Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are a diverse family of molecular receptors that are activated by chemicals, temperature changes, and tissue damage. In non-neuronal cells, TRP channels play roles in inflammation, tissue development, and maintenance. In somatosensory neurons, TRP channels mediate nociception, thermosensation, and chemosensation. To assess whether TRP channels might be involved in environmental sensing in the human oral cavity, we investigated their distribution in human tongue and hard palate biopsies. TRPV3 and TRPV4 were expressed in epithelial cells with inverse expression patterns where they likely contribute to epithelial development and integrity. TRPA1 immunoreactivity was present in fibroblasts, immune cells, and neuronal afferents, consistent with known roles of TRPA1 in sensory transduction and response to damage and inflammation. TRPM8 immunoreactivity was found in lamina propria and neuronal subpopulations including within the end bulbs of Krause, consistent with a role in thermal sensation. TRPV1 immunoreactivity was identified in intraepithelial nerve fibers and end bulbs of Krause, consistent with roles in nociception and thermosensation. TRPM8 and TRPV1 immunoreactivity in end bulbs of Krause suggest that these structures contain a variety of neuronal afferents, including those that mediate nociception, thermosensation, and mechanotransduction. Collectively, these studies support the role of TRP channels in oral environmental surveillance and response.</p>

                Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs), genetic interactions in which the simultaneous inactivation of two genes leads to a lethal phenotype, are promising targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer, as exemplified by the recent success of PARP inhibitors in treating BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. We present SL-Cloud, a new component of the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC), that provides an integrated framework of cloud-hosted data resources and curated workflows to enable facile prediction of SLIs. This resource addresses two main challenges related to SLI inference: the need to wrangle and preprocess large multi-omic datasets and the availability of multiple comparable prediction approaches. SL-Cloud enables customizable computational inference of SLIs and testing of prediction approaches across multiple datasets. We anticipate that cancer researchers will find utility in this tool for discovery of SLIs to support further investigation into potential drug targets for anticancer therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perception of nurses, medical laboratory scientists, and midwives toward coronavirus vaccination in Khartoum State, 2021—a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nurses, medical laboratory scientists and midwives comprise a large portion of healthcare personnel. Healthcare personnel have an important role in guiding and encouraging patients and communities, and showing role modeling behavior. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and explore the perception of nurses, medical laboratory scientists, and midwives toward coronavirus vaccination. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional facility-based study was conducted. Data were collected using an online Google form questionnaire. Demographic variables were analyzed using frequencies and percentages. The association between independent variables and the decision of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated by binary logistic regression and Chi-square test. Results: In this study, 375 responses were collected, of which 324 (86.4%) were female. The majority of the participants (73.9%) were aged between 20 and 30 years. There were 160 (42.7%) medical laboratory scientists, 145 (38.7%) nurses, and 70 (18.7%) midwives. More than half of the participants (53.6%) accepted receiving vaccination against COVID-19. Results showed a positive correlation of vaccine acceptance with nurses, medical laboratory scientists, and midwives, suggesting that they are more likely to be vaccinated. Conclusion: There was a good perception towards COVID-19 vaccination, as 53.4% of the participants accepted receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, which is a good rate for acceptance. This finding has a positive impact on the whole vaccination process, as the recommendations of medical laboratory scientists, nurses, and midwives affect the behavior of the general population toward vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Functional tic-like presentations differ strikingly from Provisional Tic Disorder [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in new “tic” cases in teens and young adults. These individuals often present with fulminant onset of symptoms not commonly seen in Tourette syndrome (TS) and are often diagnosed with Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FND-tic). However, some authors have questioned whether this illness truly differs from typical Provisional Tic Disorder (PTD) and TS. Previous studies have compared FND-tic, usually a few months after symptom onset, to patients with TS, usually years after symptom onset. We sought to test whether the presenting symptoms of FND-tic differ substantially from those in patients at a similar duration of symptoms who are later diagnosed with TS. Methods: This comparative study examines clinical features summarized from published reports of FND-tic with novel data from a longitudinal study of PTD. This study came from a referral center for TS and tic disorders and included 89 children with tics whose first tic occurred a median of 3.6 months earlier, nearly all of whom were diagnosed with a chronic tic disorder at follow-up. Specifically, we examine clinical features identified in a recent literature review as supporting a diagnosis of FND-tic, including symptom characteristics, course, severity and comorbidity. Results: Several clinical features dramatically distinguish the patients diagnosed with FND-tic from those diagnosed with typical PTD. For example, coprophenomena are reported at or shortly after symptom onset in over half of FND-tic patients, whereas even several months after onset, coprophenomena had occurred in only 1 of 89 children with PTD. Six clinical features each have a positive predictive value over 90% for FND-tic diagnosis if prior probability is 50%. Conclusions: These new data provide strong evidence supporting the diagnostic validity of FND-tic as distinct from TS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating the circulating sphingolipidome response to a single high-intensity interval training session within healthy females and males in their twenties (SphingoHIIT): Protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Growing scientific evidence indicates that sphingolipids predict cardiometabolic risk, independently of and beyond traditional biomarkers such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. To date, it remains largely unknown if and how exercise, a simple, low-cost, and patient-empowering modality to optimise cardiometabolic health, influences sphingolipid levels. The SphingoHIIT study aims to assess the response of circulating sphingolipid species to a single session of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Methods: This single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will last 11 days per participant and aim to include 32 young and healthy individuals aged 20-29 (50% females). Participants will be randomly allocated to the HIIT (n= 16) or control groups (physical rest, n= 16). Participants will self-sample fasted dried blood spots for three consecutive days before the intervention (HIIT versus rest) to determine baseline sphingolipid levels. Dried blood spots will also be collected at five time points (2, 15, 30, 60min, and 24h) following the intervention (HIIT versus rest). To minimise the dietary influence, participants will receive a standardised diet for four days, starting 24 hours before the first dried blood sampling. For females, interventions will be timed to fall within the early follicular phase to minimise the menstrual cycle's influence on sphingolipid levels. Finally, physical activity will be monitored for the whole study duration using a wrist accelerometer. Ethics and dissemination: The Ethics Committee of Northwest and Central Switzerland approved this protocol (ID 2022–00513). Findings will be disseminated in scientific journals and meetings. Trial Registration The trial was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05390866, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05390866) on May 25, 2022.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictors of unwillingness or inaccessibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccination among persons with disabilities in Bangladesh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Persons with disabilities (PWDs) are among the most vulnerable communities to suffer the serious consequences of COVID-19, and accepting COVID-19 vaccination is one of the recommended health advisories for them. Unwillingness to receive vaccines is a concerning issue, especially in the countries of Southeast Asia. The study aims to find out the COVID-19 vaccination rate of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Bangladesh, the rate of unwillingness or inaccessibility of vaccination for PWDs, and predict the possible reasons for unwillingness. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional survey of PWDs aged 12 years or more was conducted in 12 rehabilitation centers in Bangladesh between February 2022 and May 2022. A self-developed structured questionnaire on socio-demographic, disability, and health indicators, acceptance and accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines, and knowledge and attitude towards vaccination was used for the survey. The study has been conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for a cross-sectional survey. Results With a 69% response rate, 241 PWDs participated in the study. PWDs with a spinal cord injury were the major respondents (62.7%). A total of 186 (77.2%) PWDs had taken one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccines of three doses supplied, and 55 (22.8%) were unwilling to have a vaccination. All vaccine recipients reported good accessibility to vaccination booths. The predictive factors of unwillingness were spinal cord injury type of disability (OR .36, P<.01), people coming to the rehabilitation center from rural areas (OR .44, P<.01), poor knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination (OR .78, P<.01), and dependency on mobility (OR.24, P<.001). Conclusion More than one-fifth of the persons with disabilities aged between 12 and 80 years were unwilling to receive the COVID-19 vaccination despite the accessibility of information and availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, mainly due to poor knowledge and mobility issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Goji berry (Lycium barbarum) inhibits the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of oral cancer cells by inhibiting the ERK, AKT, and CyclinD cell signaling pathways: an in-vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), popularly referred to as Goji berry, is a promising herb known for its powerful anti-antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine due to its powerful antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It has also shown good anti-cancer properties and has been tested against liver, colon, prostate, breast, and cervical cancers. However, no study has yet evaluated the role of goji berries against oral cancer. Hence, the present paper aims to evaluate the anticancer properties of L. barbarum against oral squamous cell carcinoma. Method: Ethanolic extract of L. barbarum (EELB) was tested for its anticancer properties by performing the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony formation, cell proliferation, and scratch wound test. The impact of EELB on the signaling transduction pathways of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase (AKT1), cyclin D1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also assessed by western blot. Results: The results showed that EELB can impede CAL-27 cell growth, proliferation and migration in-vitro.. It even reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT1 with concomitant downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cadherin 2 (CDH2), and vimentin (VIM) and upregulation of cadherin 1 (CDH1) expression suggesting its anti-proliferative and anti-EMT effects in oral cancer. Conclusion: Goji berry has good antiproliferative and anti-invasive properties. It affects potential EMT markers and signaling transduction pathways involved in oral cancers. Hence goji berry can be tried as a potential anticancer agent to manage oral squamous cell carcinoma.

                Background: People are more aware of halal products in commodity markets. Halal meat is an essential commodity for society in the Islamic commodity market in particular. The objective of this study was to analyze differences in research trends related to halal meat in published papers indexed by Scopus and Web of Science. The objective is to observe how was halal meat as commodity become the trend of research written by Indonesian authors, as well as what was the novelty of the research trend related to such tiopic. Methods: This study used purposive sampling with a bibliometric approach in collecting the samples. The samples were published papers from the Scopus and Web of Science (SCI) databases from 2006 to 25th October 2021. The were 154 samples found from cSopus and 50 samples in Web of Science (SCI). Analysis was performed by VOSviewer and biblioshiny. Results: Overall, 154 papers from Scopus and 50 from SCI were analyzed. Scopus and SCI exhibited different research trends. Moreover, papers from Scopus were dominated by Indonesian authors; those from SCI were not. The source growth of published papers in SCI was more dynamic than that in Scopus. The research trends in papers from SCI were more focused on the types of meat and the source itself. This was different to papers in Scopus, which placed greater emphasis on the supply chain. Conclusions: This paper can act as a reference for continued research into halal meat in commodity markets, especially in Islamic countries. This paper is the first to compare the research trends in halal meat in the commodity market by comparing the differences in two major indexes, Scopus and SCI.

                Background: The main factors that affect the success of an endodontic infection are effective cleaning and shaping of the root canal system including complete disinfection by using chemical irrigating solutions and obturation with an endodontic sealer to provide a fluid-tight seal. Using rotary and hand instruments for shaping and cleaning the root canal along with irrigants produces a smear layer on the surface of root dentin affecting the penetration of the endodontic sealer into the dentinal tubules. This smear is difficult to remove with the use of only endodontic irrigants, hence, chelating agents were introduced in adjunct with irrigating solutions for irrigation protocol for effective removal of smear layer which effect the penetration of endodontic sealers into the dentinal tubules. Methods: 32 mandibular premolar teeth were used. The biomechanical preparation was done till Protaper F3 size. Irrigation was done with 2.5 mL sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution after each instrumentation change for 1 min. Samples were then divided into 4 groups according to the irrigating solution used as the final rinse used with passive ultrasonic agitation. The groups were: Group I: 5 ml of saline, Group II: 5ml of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Group III: 5 ml of 10% citric acid, Group IV: 5 ml of 7% maleic acid each for one minute. All the canals were obturated with BioRoottmRCS with gutta-percha using the ultrasonic condensation technique. For staining the samples for Confocal LASER microscopy, BioRoottmRCS was mixed with Rhodamine B dye. Results: The maximum penetration of bio-ceramic sealer was observed in the coronal region. At the apical third, the maximum sealer penetration was seen with 7% maleic acid. Conclusions: Maximum sealer penetration was seen in the coronal section followed by the middle and apical section. Maximum sealer penetration was seen with 7 % maleic acid at the apical third.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mesoscopic description of hippocampal replay and metastability in spiking neural networks with short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bastian Pietras, Valentin Schmutz, Tilo Schwalger</p>

Bottom-up models of functionally relevant patterns of neural activity provide an explicit link between neuronal dynamics and computation. A prime example of functional activity patterns are propagating bursts of place-cell activities called hippocampal replay, which is critical for memory consolidation. The sudden and repeated occurrences of these burst states during ongoing neural activity suggest metastable neural circuit dynamics. As metastability has been attributed to noise and/or slow fatigue mechanisms, we propose a concise mesoscopic model which accounts for both. Crucially, our model is bottom-up: it is analytically derived from the dynamics of finite-size networks of Linear-Nonlinear Poisson neurons with short-term synaptic depression. As such, noise is explicitly linked to stochastic spiking and network size, and fatigue is explicitly linked to synaptic dynamics. To derive the mesoscopic model, we first consider a homogeneous spiking neural network and follow the temporal coarse-graining approach of Gillespie to obtain a “chemical Langevin equation”, which can be naturally interpreted as a stochastic neural mass model. The Langevin equation is computationally inexpensive to simulate and enables a thorough study of metastable dynamics in classical setups (population spikes and Up-Down-states dynamics) by means of phase-plane analysis. An extension of the Langevin equation for small network sizes is also presented. The stochastic neural mass model constitutes the basic component of our mesoscopic model for replay. We show that the mesoscopic model faithfully captures the statistical structure of individual replayed trajectories in microscopic simulations and in previously reported experimental data. Moreover, compared to the deterministic Romani-Tsodyks model of place-cell dynamics, it exhibits a higher level of variability regarding order, direction and timing of replayed trajectories, which seems biologically more plausible and could be functionally desirable. This variability is the product of a new dynamical regime where metastability emerges from a complex interplay between finite-size fluctuations and local fatigue.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mechanistic model for human brain metabolism and its connection to the neurovascular coupling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolas Sundqvist, Sebastian Sten, Peter Thompson, Benjamin Jan Andersson, Maria Engström, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

The neurovascular and neurometabolic couplings (NVC and NMC) connect cerebral activity, blood flow, and metabolism. This interconnection is used in for instance functional imaging, which analyses the blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal. The mechanisms underlying the NVC are complex, which warrants a model-based analysis of data. We have previously developed a mechanistically detailed model for the NVC, and others have proposed detailed models for cerebral metabolism. However, existing metabolic models are still not fully utilizing available magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data and are not connected to detailed models for NVC. Therefore, we herein present a new model that integrates mechanistic modelling of both MRS and BOLD data. The metabolic model covers central metabolism, using a minimal set of interactions, and can describe time-series data for glucose, lactate, aspartate, and glutamate, measured after visual stimuli. Statistical tests confirm that the model can describe both estimation data and predict independent validation data, not used for model training. The interconnected NVC model can simultaneously describe BOLD data and can be used to predict expected metabolic responses in experiments where metabolism has not been measured. This model is a step towards a useful and mechanistically detailed model for cerebral blood flow and metabolism, with potential applications in both basic research and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The effects of base rate neglect on sequential belief updating and real-world beliefs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brandon K. Ashinoff, Justin Buck, Michael Woodford, Guillermo Horga</p>

Base-rate neglect is a pervasive bias in judgment that is conceptualized as underweighting of prior information and can have serious consequences in real-world scenarios. This bias is thought to reflect variability in inferential processes but empirical support for a cohesive theory of base-rate neglect with sufficient explanatory power to account for longer-term and real-world beliefs is lacking. A Bayesian formalization of base-rate neglect in the context of sequential belief updating predicts that belief trajectories should exhibit dynamic patterns of dependence on the order in which evidence is presented and its consistency with prior beliefs. To test this, we developed a novel ‘urn-and-beads’ task that systematically manipulated the order of colored bead sequences and elicited beliefs via an incentive-compatible procedure. Our results in two independent online studies confirmed the predictions of the sequential base-rate neglect model: people exhibited beliefs that are more influenced by recent evidence and by evidence inconsistent with prior beliefs. We further found support for a noisy-sampling inference model whereby base-rate neglect results from rational discounting of noisy internal representations of prior beliefs. Finally, we found that model-derived indices of base-rate neglect—including noisier prior representation—correlated with propensity for unusual beliefs outside the laboratory. Our work supports the relevance of Bayesian accounts of sequential base-rate neglect to real-world beliefs and hints at strategies to minimize deleterious consequences of this pervasive bias.

                <p>by Yi-Heng Zhu, Chengxin Zhang, Dong-Jun Yu, Yang Zhang</p>

Accurate identification of protein function is critical to elucidate life mechanisms and design new drugs. We proposed a novel deep-learning method, ATGO, to predict Gene Ontology (GO) attributes of proteins through a triplet neural-network architecture embedded with pre-trained language models from protein sequences. The method was systematically tested on 1068 non-redundant benchmarking proteins and 3328 targets from the third Critical Assessment of Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Experimental results showed that ATGO achieved a significant increase of the GO prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Detailed data analyses showed that the major advantage of ATGO lies in the utilization of pre-trained transformer language models which can extract discriminative functional pattern from the feature embeddings. Meanwhile, the proposed triplet network helps enhance the association of functional similarity with feature similarity in the sequence embedding space. In addition, it was found that the combination of the network scores with the complementary homology-based inferences could further improve the accuracy of the predicted models. These results demonstrated a new avenue for high-accuracy deep-learning function prediction that is applicable to large-scale protein function annotations from sequence alone.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The catecholamine precursor Tyrosine reduces autonomic arousal and decreases decision thresholds in reinforcement learning and temporal discounting</a></h4>

Supplementation with the catecholamine precursor L-Tyrosine might enhance cognitive performance, but overall findings are mixed. Here, we investigate the effect of a single dose of tyrosine (2g) vs. placebo on two catecholamine-dependent trans-diagnostic traits: model-based control during reinforcement learning (2-step task) and temporal discounting, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design (n = 28 healthy male participants). We leveraged drift diffusion models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to jointly model participants’ choices and response times in both tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive autonomic monitoring (heart rate, heart rate variability, pupillometry, spontaneous eye-blink rate) was performed both pre- and post-supplementation, to explore potential physiological effects of supplementation. Across tasks, tyrosine consistently reduced participants’ RTs without deteriorating task-performance. Diffusion modeling linked this effect to attenuated decision-thresholds in both tasks and further revealed increased model-based control (2-step task) and (if anything) attenuated temporal discounting. On the physiological level, participants’ pupil dilation was predictive of the individual degree of temporal discounting. Tyrosine supplementation reduced physiological arousal as revealed by increases in pupil dilation variability and reductions in heart rate. Supplementation-related changes in physiological arousal predicted individual changes in temporal discounting. Our findings provide first evidence that tyrosine supplementation might impact psychophysiological parameters, and suggest that modeling approaches based on sequential sampling models can yield novel insights into latent cognitive processes modulated by amino-acid supplementation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An individualized causal framework for learning intercellular communication networks that define microenvironments of individual tumors</a></h4>

Cells within a tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically communicate and influence each other’s cellular states through an intercellular communication network (ICN). In cancers, intercellular communications underlie immune evasion mechanisms of individual tumors. We developed an individualized causal analysis framework for discovering tumor specific ICNs. Using head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors as a testbed, we first mined single-cell RNA-sequencing data to discover gene expression modules (GEMs) that reflect the states of transcriptomic processes within tumor and stromal single cells. By deconvoluting bulk transcriptomes of HNSCC tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we estimated the activation states of these transcriptomic processes in individual tumors. Finally, we applied individualized causal network learning to discover an ICN within each tumor. Our results show that cellular states of cells in TMEs are coordinated through ICNs that enable multi-way communications among epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, and immune cells. Further analyses of individual ICNs revealed structural patterns that were shared across subsets of tumors, leading to the discovery of 4 different subtypes of networks that underlie disparate TMEs of HNSCC. Patients with distinct TMEs exhibited significantly different clinical outcomes. Our results show that the capability of estimating individual ICNs reveals heterogeneity of ICNs and sheds light on the importance of intercellular communication in impacting disease development and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Threat management priorities for conserving Antarctic biodiversity</a></h4>

Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity faces multiple threats, from invasive species to climate change. Yet no large-scale assessments of threat management strategies exist. Applying a structured participatory approach, we demonstrate that existing conservation efforts are insufficient in a changing world, estimating that 65% (at best 37%, at worst 97%) of native terrestrial taxa and land-associated seabirds are likely to decline by 2100 under current trajectories. Emperor penguins are identified as the most vulnerable taxon, followed by other seabirds and dry soil nematodes. We find that implementing 10 key threat management strategies in parallel, at an estimated present-day equivalent annual cost of US$23 million, could benefit up to 84% of Antarctic taxa. Climate change is identified as the most pervasive threat to Antarctic biodiversity and influencing global policy to effectively limit climate change is the most beneficial conservation strategy. However, minimising impacts of human activities and improved planning and management of new infrastructure projects are cost-effective and will help to minimise regional threats. Simultaneous global and regional efforts are critical to secure Antarctic biodiversity for future generations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multispecies biofilm architecture determines bacterial exposure to phages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James B. Winans, Benjamin R. Wucher, Carey D. Nadell</p>

Numerous ecological interactions among microbes—for example, competition for space and resources, or interaction among phages and their bacterial hosts—are likely to occur simultaneously in multispecies biofilm communities. While biofilms formed by just a single species occur, multispecies biofilms are thought to be more typical of microbial communities in the natural environment. Previous work has shown that multispecies biofilms can increase, decrease, or have no measurable impact on phage exposure of a host bacterium living alongside another species that the phages cannot target. The reasons underlying this variability are not well understood, and how phage–host encounters change within multispecies biofilms remains mostly unexplored at the cellular spatial scale. Here, we study how the cellular scale architecture of model 2-species biofilms impacts cell–cell and cell–phage interactions controlling larger scale population and community dynamics. Our system consists of dual culture biofilms of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> under exposure to T7 phages, which we study using microfluidic culture, high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging, and detailed image analysis. As shown previously, sufficiently mature biofilms of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> can protect themselves from phage exposure via their curli matrix. Before this stage of biofilm structural maturity, <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> is highly susceptible to phages; however, we show that these bacteria can gain lasting protection against phage exposure if they have become embedded in the bottom layers of highly packed groups of <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> in co-culture. This protection, in turn, is dependent on the cell packing architecture controlled by <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> biofilm matrix secretion. In this manner, <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> cells that are otherwise susceptible to phage-mediated killing can survive phage exposure in the absence of de novo resistance evolution. While co-culture biofilm formation with <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> can confer phage protection to <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, it comes at the cost of competing with <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> and a disruption of normal curli-mediated protection for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> even in dual species biofilms grown over long time scales. This work highlights the critical importance of studying multispecies biofilm architecture and its influence on the community dynamics of bacteria and phages.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">APOE2 Exacerbates TDP‐43 Related Toxicity in the Absence of Alzheimer Pathology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent evidence supports a link between increased TDP-43 burden and the presence of an <i>APOE4</i> gene allele in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it is difficult to conclude the direct effect of <i>APOE</i> on TDP-43 pathology due to the presence of mixed AD pathologies. The goal of this study is to address how APOE isoforms impact TDP-43 pathology and related neurodegeneration in the absence of typical AD pathologies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We overexpressed human TDP-43 via viral transduction in humanized <i>APOE2</i>, <i>APOE3</i>, <i>APOE4</i> mice, and murine <i>Apoe</i>-knockout (<i>Apoe</i>-KO) mice. Behavior tests were performed across ages. Animals were harvested at 11 months of age and TDP-43 overexpression-related neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed. To further address the human relevance, we analyzed the association of <i>APOE</i> with TDP-43 pathology in 160 postmortem brains from autopsy-confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) in the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that TDP-43 overexpression induced motor function deficits, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the motor cortex, especially in <i>APOE2</i> mice, with much milder or absent effects in <i>APOE3</i>, <i>APOE4</i>, or <i>Apoe</i>-KO mice. In the motor cortex of the ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem human brains, we found that the <i>APOE</i>2 allele was associated with more severe TDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest a genotype-specific effect of <i>APOE</i> on TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration in the absence of AD pathology, with the strongest association seen with <i>APOE2</i>.</p>

<p>The pathophysiological relevance of dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive interneurons (Parv+) was investigated in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia using in vivo optogenetic inhibition. While there were no effects on the development of dystonic signs or locomotor behavior, genotype-related changes in neuronal activity indicate striatal malfunction and an abnormal response to optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ in DYT1 knock-in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathophysiology of early-onset torsion dystonia (TOR1A/DYT1) remains unclear. Like 70% of human mutation carriers, rodent models with ΔGAG mutation such as DYT1 knock-in (KI) mice do not show overt dystonia but have subtle sensorimotor deficits and pattern of abnormal synaptic plasticity within the striatal microcircuits. There is evidence that dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive (Parv+) fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can be involved in dystonic signs. To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity. Optogenetic fibers were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal striatum of male DYT1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) littermates expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in Parv+ interneurons. While stimulations with yellow light pulses for up to 60 min at different pulse durations and interval lengths did not induce abnormal movements, such as dystonic signs, immunohistochemical examinations revealed genotype-dependent differences. In contrast to WT mice, stimulated DYT1 KI showed decreased striatal neuronal activity, that is, less c-Fos reactive neurons, and increased activation of cholinergic interneurons after optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ interneurons. These findings suggest an involvement of Parv+ interneurons in an impaired striatal network in DYT1 KI mice, but at least short-term inhibition of these GABAergic interneurons is not sufficient to trigger a dystonic phenotype, similar to previously shown optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation for missing data recovery in phasor measurement unit (PMU) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Smart grid systems require high-quality phasor measurement unit (PMU) data for proper operation, control, and decision-making. Missing PMU data may lead to improper actions or even blackouts. While the conventional cubic interpolation methods based on the solution of a set of linear equations to solve for the cubic spline coefficients have been applied by many researchers for the interpolation of missing data, the computational complexity increases non-linearly with increasing data size. Methods: In this work, a modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation procedure for recovering missing PMU data is proposed. The recurrent equation-based method makes the computations of spline constants simpler. Using PMU data from the State Load Despatch Center (SLDC) in Madhya Pradesh, India, a comparison of the root mean square error (RMSE) values and time of calculation (ToC) is calculated for both methods. Results: The modified recurrent relation method could retrieve missing values 10 times faster when compared to the conventional cubic interpolation method based on the solution of a set of linear equations.  The RMSE values have shown the proposed method is effective even for special cases of missing values (edges, continuous missing values). Conclusions: The proposed method can retrieve any number of missing values at any location using observed data with a minimal number of calculations.

                Background: In Neurospora crassa, the circadian clock controls rhythmic mRNA translation initiation through regulation of the eIF2α kinase CPC-3 (the homolog of yeast and mammalian GCN2). Active CPC-3 phosphorylates and inactivates eIF2α, leading to higher phosphorylated eIF2α (P-eIF2α) levels and reduced translation initiation during the subjective day. This daytime activation of CPC-3 is driven by its binding to uncharged tRNA, and uncharged tRNA levels peak during the day under control of the circadian clock. The daily rhythm in uncharged tRNA levels could arise from rhythmic amino acid levels or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRSs) levels. Methods: To determine if and how the clock potentially controls rhythms in aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS), both observed to be rhythmic in circadian genomic datasets, transcriptional and translational fusions to luciferase were generated. These luciferase reporter fusions were examined in wild type (WT), clock mutant Δfrq, and clock-controlled transcription factor deletion strains. Results: Translational and transcriptional fusions of AspRS and GlnRS to luciferase confirmed that their protein levels are clock-controlled with peak levels at night. Moreover, clock-controlled transcription factors NCU00275 and ADV-1 drive robust rhythmic protein expression of AspRS and GlnRS, respectively. Conclusions: These data support a model whereby coordinate clock control of select aaRSs drives rhythms in uncharged tRNAs, leading to rhythmic CPC-3 activation, and rhythms in translation of specific mRNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The relationship between climate change and malaria in South-East Asia: A systematic review of the evidence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Climatic change is an inescapable fact that implies alterations in seasons where weather occurrences have their schedules shift from the regular and magnitudes intensify to more extreme variations over a multi-year period. Southeast Asia is one of the many regions experiencing changes in climate and concurrently still has endemicities of malaria. Given that previous studies have suggested the influence of climate on malaria’s vector the Anopheles mosquitoes and parasite the Plasmodium group, this study was conducted to review the evidence of associations made between malaria cases and climatic variables in Southeast Asia throughout a multi-year period. Methods: Our systematic literature review was informed by the PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO: CRD42022301826 on 5th February 2022. We searched for original articles in English and Indonesian that focused on the associations between climatic variables and malaria cases. Results: The initial identification stage resulted in 535 records of possible relevance and after abstract screening and eligibility assessment we included 19 research articles for the systematic review. Based on the reviewed articles, changing temperatures, precipitation, humidity and windspeed were considered for statistical association across a multi-year period and are correlated with malaria cases in various regions throughout Southeast Asia. Conclusions: According to the review of evidence, climatic variables that exhibited a statistically significant correlation with malaria cases include temperatures, precipitation, and humidity. The strength of each climatic variable varies across studies. Our systematic review of the limited evidence indicates that further research for the Southeast Asia region remains to be explored.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism underlying desensitization of the proton-activated chloride channel PAC</a></h4>

              
                Desensitization is a common property of membrane receptors, including ion channels. The newly identified proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel plays an important role in regulating the pH and size of organelles in the endocytic pathway, and is also involved in acid-induced cell death. However, how the PAC channel desensitizes is largely unknown. Here, we show by patch-clamp electrophysiological studies that PAC (also known as TMEM206/ASOR) undergoes pH-dependent desensitization upon prolonged acid exposure. Through structure-guided and comprehensive mutagenesis, we identified several residues critical for PAC desensitization, including histidine (H) 98, glutamic acid (E) 94, and aspartic acid (D) 91 at the extracellular extension of the transmembrane helix 1 (TM1), as well as E107, D109, and E250 at the extracellular domain (ECD)–transmembrane domain (TMD) interface. Structural analysis and molecular dynamic simulations revealed extensive interactions between residues at the TM1 extension and those at the ECD–TMD interface. These interactions likely facilitate PAC desensitization by stabilizing the desensitized conformation of TM1, which undergoes a characteristic rotational movement from the resting and activated states to the desensitized state. Our studies establish a new paradigm of channel desensitization in this ubiquitously expressed ion channel and pave the way for future investigation of its relevance in cellular physiology and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation dynamics between copy-number and point mutations</a></h4>

              
                Together, copy-number and point mutations form the basis for most evolutionary novelty, through the process of gene duplication and divergence. While a plethora of genomic data reveals the long-term fate of diverging coding sequences and their <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, little is known about the early dynamics around the duplication event itself. In microorganisms, selection for increased gene expression often drives the expansion of gene copy-number mutations, which serves as a crude adaptation, prior to divergence through refining point mutations. Using a simple synthetic genetic reporter system that can distinguish between copy-number and point mutations, we study their early and transient adaptive dynamics in real-time in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find two qualitatively different routes of adaptation, depending on the level of functional improvement needed. In conditions of high gene expression demand, the two mutation types occur as a combination. However, under low gene expression demand, copy-number and point mutations are mutually exclusive; here, owing to their higher frequency, adaptation is dominated by copy-number mutations, in a process we term Amplification Hindrance. Ultimately, due to high reversal rates and pleiotropic cost, copy-number mutations may not only serve as a crude and transient adaptation, but also constrain sequence divergence over evolutionary time scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A generalizable brain extraction net (BEN) for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans</a></h4>

              
                Accurate brain tissue extraction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for analyzing brain structure and function. While several conventional tools have been optimized to handle human brain data, there have been no generalizable methods to extract brain tissues for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Therefore, developing a flexible and generalizable method for extracting whole brain tissue across species would allow researchers to analyze and compare experiment results more efficiently. Here, we propose a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network, named the Brain Extraction Net (BEN), to extract brain tissues across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. We have evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4,601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. Compared to conventional toolboxes, the superiority of BEN is illustrated by its robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. Our proposed method not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting the downstream processing tasks. As a novel fully automated deep-learning method, BEN is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long non-coding RNA Neat1 and paraspeckle components are translational regulators in hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) drive translation initiation during stress. In response to hypoxia, (lymph)angiogenic factors responsible for tissue revascularization in ischemic diseases are induced by the IRES-dependent mechanism. Here we searched for IRES <i>trans</i>-acting factors (ITAFs) active in early hypoxia in mouse cardiomyocytes. Using knock-down and proteomics approaches, we show a link between a stressed-induced nuclear body, the paraspeckle, and IRES-dependent translation. Furthermore, smiFISH experiments demonstrate the recruitment of IRES-containing mRNA into paraspeckle during hypoxia. Our data reveal that the long non-coding RNA <i>Neat1</i>, an essential paraspeckle component, is a key translational regulator, active on IRESs of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factor mRNAs. In addition, paraspeckle proteins p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSPC1 as well as nucleolin and RPS2, two p54<sup>nrb</sup>-interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry, are ITAFs for IRES subgroups. Paraspeckle thus appears as a platform to recruit IRES-containing mRNAs and possibly host IRESome assembly. Polysome PCR array shows that <i>Neat1</i> isoforms regulate IRES-dependent translation and, more widely, translation of mRNAs involved in stress response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Children Develop Adult-Like Visual Sensitivity to Image Memorability by the Age of Four</a></h4>

              
                Adults have been shown to consistently remember and forget certain images despite large individual differences, suggesting a population-wide sensitivity to an image's intrinsic memorability--a measure of how successfully an image is remembered. While a decade of research has focused on image memorability among adults, the developmental trajectory of these consistencies in memory is understudied. Here, we investigate by what age children gain adult-like sensitivity to the image memorability effect. We utilized data from Saragosa-Harris et al. (2021), where 137 children aged between 3 and 5 years old encoded animal-scene image pairs and then after a 5-minute, 24-hour, or 1-week delay performed a cued recognition task for each scene target given its animal cue. We tested adults' memory of the same scene images using ResMem (Needell & Bainbridge, 2022), a pre-trained deep neural network that predicts adult image memorability scores, and using an online behavioral continuous recognition task (N = 116). Results showed that ResMem predictions, as a proxy of adults' memory, predicted scene memory of children by the age of 4 and were the most predictive of children's memory across ages after a long, 1-week delay. Children at age 3 show non-adult-like consistent memory patterns, implying that the non-adult-like memory patterns were not due to poor memory performance. Instead, 3-year-olds may have consistently used certain visual memory strategies that become less optimal as they age. Our results suggest that adult-like sensitivity to image memorability emerges by the age of 4 through experience.

                Background: The contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and local exposure to neurotoxins in the gut offers the most in-depth explanation of Parkinson's disease (PD) etiopathogenesis through abnormal accumulation and spreading of alpha-synuclein (-syn) aggregates from the gut to the brain. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate whether dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mediated colitis may have lasting effects on dopaminergic pathways in the brain and whether or not colitis exacerbated susceptibility to later exposure to the neurotoxin rotenone. Methods: To induce chronic colitis, 10 months old C57BL/6 mice were pre-exposed to 3 cycles of 7 days of 1% (w/v) DSS administration in drinking water followed by 14 days of regular drinking water. After colitis-induction, animals received a low dose of intragastric rotenone for the next 8 weeks, followed by testing for Parkinsonian behavior and GI phenotypes of inflammation. At the end of the 8th week after colitis, colon, brain stem, and midbrain tissue were isolated and analyzed for -syn, inflammatory markers, and dopaminergic neuronal loss. Gut microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Results: We found that local rotenone exposure for 8 weeks did not affect colitis severity and colonic tight junction (TJ) protein expression (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1). On the other hand, we found that while eight weeks of chronic rotenone administration led to an increase in inflammatory markers, the presence of pre-existing colitis resulted in a considerable change in gut microbiota composition and a decrease in TJ's protein expression. In addition, the administration of rotenone in mice post-colitis caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances. Itworsened rotenone-induced -syn pathology in the colon, which extended upward and resulted in severe dopaminergic neuron loss and significant astroglia activation in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), locus coeruleus, substantia nigra as well as in striatum. Interestingly, in the case of rotenone alone, we found that -syn induced ChAT+ neuronal death is restricted to the DMV. These findings indicate that long-term rotenone exposure in conjunction with early inflammatory intestinal milieu exacerbates the progression of -syn pathology and aggravates neurodegeneration in the intragastric mouse PD model. Conclusions: This work provides detailed insight into the involvement of GI inflammation triggered after a neurotoxic insult in the colon and explores their potential to impact central dopaminergic degeneration in PD. This way, we can identify potential therapeutic targets that stop the enteric inflammatory processes involved in progressing PD.

                The development of automatic methods for image and video quality assessment that correlate well with the perception of human observers is a very challenging open problem in vision science, with numerous practical applications in disciplines such as image processing and computer vision, as well as in the media industry. In the past two decades, the goal of image quality research has been to improve upon classical metrics by developing models that emulate some aspects of the visual system, and while the progress has been considerable, state-of-the-art quality assessment methods still share a number of shortcomings, like their performance dropping considerably when they are tested on a database that is quite different from the one used to train them, or their significant limitations in predicting observer scores for high framerate videos. In this work we propose a novel objective method for image and video quality assessment that is based on the recently introduced Intrinsically Non-linear Receptive Field (INRF) formulation, a neural summation model that has been shown to be better at predicting neural activity and visual perception phenomena than the classical linear receptive field. Here we start by optimizing, on a classic image quality database, the four parameters of a very simple INRF-based metric, and proceed to test this metric on three other databases, showing that its performance equals or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art methods, some of them having millions of parameters. Next, we extend to the temporal domain this INRF image quality metric, and test it on a very recent video dataset of high definition, high-quality videos, of standard as well as high framerate, processed at different compression levels, and with thousands of human quality scores. Our results show that the proposed INRF-based video quality metric consistently outperforms, often by a wide margin, the state-of-the-art in video quality metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">E/I unbalance and aberrant oscillation dynamics predict preclinical Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia linked with severe decrement of cognitive functions. Animal models and presence of epileptiform activity (subclinical/clinical) suggest that neuronal hyper-excitability could play a role in the continuum of AD. The prevalence of amyloid pathology is thought to impact GABAergic terminals potentially disrupting the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance and causing network dysfunction and cognitive impairment. However, there is no direct neurophysiological evidence in humans of such mechanism throughout the different stages of the disease, nor reliable markers to predict its earliest manifestations (i.e., subjective cognitive decline, SCD). Here, we use novel metrics for directly testing the hypothesis that alterations in the brain temporal coordination and non-linear dynamics should reflect underlying changes in the E/I balance. To that aim, we measured brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a cross-sectional cohort of 343 participants (116 neurotypical controls (NC), 85 SCD, and 142 MCI). We quantified non-linear dynamics as power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in brain oscillations, a well-known proxy for brain criticality. We demonstrate that attenuations in LRTCs and changes in their spectral profile reliably dissociate NC, SCD, and MCI individuals and that such disrupted brain dynamics are caused by exacerbated excitation shifting the dynamical regime toward a supercritical phase. Additionally, we show that aberrant non-linear dynamics predict conversion from MCI to AD using data from a longitudinal cohort. Machine learning modeling with k-nearest neighbors classification demonstrated the ability of LRTCs and E/I estimates to discriminate early-stage AD patients with better accuracy than classical structural features, highlighting their potential role as early biomarkers of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional genomic mechanisms of opioids: a systematic review of animal and human studies</a></h4>

              
                In the past two decades, over-prescription of opioids for pain management has driven a steep increase in opioid use disorder (OUD) and death by overdose, exerting a dramatic toll on western countries. OUD is a chronic relapsing disease associated with a lifetime struggle to control drug consumption, suggesting that opioids trigger long-lasting brain adaptations, notably through functional genomic and epigenomic mechanisms. Current understanding of these processes, however, remain scarce, and have not been previously reviewed systematically. To do so, the goal of the present work was to synthesize current knowledge on genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms of opioid action, in primate and rodent species. Using a prospectively registered methodology, comprehensive literature searches were completed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Of the 2705 articles identified, 69 met our inclusion criteria and were considered for qualitative analysis. Focusing on the 5 most studied nervous system structures (nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, whole striatum, dorsal striatum, spinal cord; 44 articles), we also conducted a quantitative analysis of differentially expressed genes, in an effort to identify a putative core transcriptional signature of opioids. Only one gene, Cdkn1a, was replicated in six studies and, globally, our results unveil surprisingly low consistency across published work, even when considering most recent single-cell approaches. Analysis of putative sources for this poor reproducibility suggest contributions from species, brain structures, duration of opioid exposure, as well as batch effects. To go beyond those limitations, we leveraged threshold-free methods to illustrate how genome-wide comparisons may generate new findings and hypotheses. Finally, we discuss current methodological development in the field, and their implication for future research and, ultimately, better care.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Is short sleep bad for the brain? Brain structure and cognitive function in short sleepers</a></h4>

              
                Many sleep less than recommended without experiencing daytime tiredness. According to prevailing views, short sleep increases risk of lower brain health and cognitive function. Chronic mild sleep deprivation could cause undetected sleep debt, negatively affecting cognitive function and brain health. However, it is possible that some have less sleep needs and are more resistant to negative effects of sleep loss. We investigated this question using a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal sample of 47,029 participants (age 20-89 years) with measures of self-reported sleep, including 51,295 MRIs of the brain and cognitive tests. 701 participants who reported to sleep < 6 hours did not experience any daytime tiredness or sleep problems. These short sleepers showed on average larger regional brain volumes and only slightly lower general cognitive function compared to a group of 7-8 hours healthy sleepers (n = 3754). In contrast, short sleepers reporting excessive daytime tiredness and sleep problems (n = 1619) had smaller brain volumes and lower cognitive scores. Analyses using accelerometer-estimated sleep duration confirmed the findings, and the associations remained after controlling for body mass index, depression symptoms, income and education. The results suggest that some people can cope with less sleep without obvious negative consequences for brain health, in line with a view on sleep need as individualized. Tiredness and sleep problems seem to be more relevant for neurocognitive function than sleep duration per se.

                Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar A[beta]; peptides upon and within the cerebral vasculature, which leads to loss of vascular integrity and contributes to disease progression in Alzheimers disease (AD). We investigate the structure of human-derived A[beta]40 fibrils obtained from patients diagnosed with sporadic or familial Dutch-type (E22Q) CAA. Using cryo-EM, two primary structures are identified containing elements that have not been observed in in vitro A[beta]40 fibril structures. One population has an ordered N-terminal fold comprised of two [beta]-strands stabilized by electrostatic interactions involving D1, E22, D23 and K28. This charged cluster is disrupted in the second population, which exhibits a disordered N-terminus and is favored in fibrils derived from the familial Dutch-type CAA patient. These results illustrate differences between human-derived CAA and AD fibrils, and how familial CAA mutations guide fibril formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nucleus accumbens acetylcholine receptors modulate the balance of flexible and inflexible cue-directed motivation</a></h4>

              
                Sign-tracking is a conditioned response where animals interact with reward-predictive cues and can be used as a means to approximate a cue's motivational value. The nucleus accumbens core (NAc) has been highly implicated in mediating the sign-tracking response. Additionally, acetylcholine (ACh) transmission throughout the striatum broadly has been attributed to both incentive motivation and behavioral flexibility. Here, we show that sign-tracking responses are indeed flexible in the face of a contingency changes in the form of an omission schedule, and that this flexibility is mediated by NAc ACh. Using behavioral and pharmacological methods, we show that blockade of NAc nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) augmented sign-tracking persistence, while blockade of muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) enhanced response flexibility following introduction of the omission schedule. Further, we detail how mAChR or nAChR antagonism impacted the microstructure of sign-tracking responses. These results indicate that NAc ACh receptors have opposing roles in the regulation of sign-tracking response flexibility without altering the motivational value of the cue.

                Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) syndrome is a well-recognized naturally occurring disease in aged dogs, with a remarkably similar disease course, both in its clinical presentation and neuropathological changes, as humans with Alzheimers disease (AD). Similar to human AD patients this naturally occurring disease is found in the aging canine population however, there is little understanding of how the canine brain ages pathologically. It is well known that in neurodegenerative diseases, there is an increase in inflamed glial cells as well as an accumulation of hyperphosphorylation of tau (P-tau) and amyloid beta (Amyloid beta 1-42). These pathologies increase neurotoxic signaling and eventual neuronal loss. We assessed these brain pathologies in aged canines and found an increase in the number of glial cells, both astrocytes and microglia, and the activation of astrocytes indicative of neuroinflammation. A rise in the aggregated protein Amyloid beta 1-42 and hyperphosphorylated tau, at Threonine 181 and 217, in the cortical brain regions of aging canines is seen. We then asked if any of these aged canines had CCD utilizing the only current diagnostic, owner questionnaires, verifying positive or severe CCD had pathologies of gliosis and accumulation of Amyloid beta1-42 like their aged matched controls. However uniquely the CCD dogs had P-tau at T217. Therefore, this phosphorylation site of tau at threonine 217 may be a predictor for CCD

                Cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms affect up to half of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and are often more detrimental to their quality of life than the seizures themselves. Evidence indicates that the neurobiology of epileptogenesis shares common pathophysiological mechanisms with psychiatric comorbidities. However, these mechanisms and how they relate to specific behavioral alterations are unclear. We hypothesized that a dysfunctional communication between the hippocampus (HPC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as a consequence of epileptogenesis, would be linked to behavioral and cognitive symptoms observed in the comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we performed a multilevel study to investigate behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neurochemical long-term consequences of early-life Status Epilepticus in male rats. We found that adult animals submitted to early-life seizure (ELS) presented behavioral alterations typically found in animal models of psychosis, such as hyperlocomotion, reduction in sensorimotor gating, working memory deficits, and sensitivity to psychostimulants. Noteworthy, ELS rats did not exhibit neuronal loss. Instead, sensorimotor alterations were associated with increased neuroinflammation, as verified by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and altered dopamine neurotransmission. Surprisingly, cognitive deficits were linked to an aberrant increase in HPC-PFC long-term potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, ELS rats displayed an abnormal brain state during active behavior characterized by oscillatory dynamics oddly similar to REM sleep. Our results point to impaired hippocampal-prefrontal network dynamics as a possible pathophysiological mechanism by which an epileptogenic insult can cause behavioral changes without neuronal loss. These convergent patterns of dysfunctional activity between epileptogenesis and psychosis bear translational implications for understanding psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities in epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic inactivation of the USP19 deubiquitinase regulates a-synuclein ubiquitination and inhibits accumulation of Lewy body like aggregates in mice</a></h4>

              
                The USP19 deubiquitinase is found in a locus associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD), interacts with heat shock proteins and promotes secretion of a-synuclein (a-syn) through the misfolding associated protein secretion (MAPS) pathway. Since these processes might modulate the processing of a-syn aggregates during the progression of PD, we tested the effect of USP19 knockout (KO) in mice expressing the A53T mutation of a-syn and in whom a-syn preformed fibrils (PFF) had been injected in the striatum. Compared to WT, KO brains showed decreased accumulation of phospho-synuclein (pSyn) positive aggregates. The improved pathology was associated with less activation of microglia, higher levels of synaptic marker proteins and improved performance in a tail suspension test. Exposure of primary neurons from WT and KO mice to PFF in vitro also led to decreased accumulation of pSyn aggregates. KO did not affect uptake of PFF in the cultured neurons. It also did not affect the propagation of aggregates as assessed by exposing WT or KO neurons to PFF and measuring pSyn positive aggregates in non-exposed adjacent neurons separated using a microfluidics device. We conclude that USP19 instead modulates intracellular dynamics of aggregates. Indeed, at the early time following PFF injection when the number of pSyn positive neurons were similar in WT and KO brains, the KO neurons contained less aggregates. KO brain aggregates stained more intensely with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of soluble proteins from primary neurons exposed to PFF with antibodies to ubiquitin or pSyn showed higher levels of ubiquitinated a-syn oligomeric species in the KO neurons. We propose that the improved pathology in USP19 KO brains may arise from decreased formation or enhanced clearance of the more ubiquitinated aggregates and/or enhanced disassembly towards more soluble oligomeric species. USP19 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach that targets the intracellular dynamics of a-syn complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How does perceptual discriminability relate to neuronal receptive fields?</a></h4>

              
                Perception is an outcome of neuronal computations. Our perception changes only when the underlying neuronal responses change. Because visual neurons preferentially respond to adjustments in some pixel values of an image more than others, our perception has greater sensitivity in detecting change to some pixel combinations more than others. Here, we examined how perceptual discriminability varies to arbitrary image perturbations assuming different models of neuronal responses. In particular, we investigated that under the assumption of different neuronal computations, how perceptual discriminability relates to neuronal receptive fields - the change in pixel combinations that invokes the largest increase in neuronal responses. We assumed that perceptual discriminability reflects the magnitude of change (the L2 norm) in neuronal responses, and the L2 norm assumption gained empirical support. We examined how perceptual discriminability relates to deterministic and stochastic neuronal computations. In the case of deterministic neuronal computations, perceptual discriminability is completely determined by neuronal receptive fields. For multiple layers of canonical linear-nonlinear (LN) computations in particular (which is a feed-forward neural network), neuronal receptive fields are linear transforms of the first-layer neurons' image filters. When one image is presented to the neural network, the first layer neurons' filters and the linear transform completely determine neuronal receptive fields across all layers, and perceptual discriminability to arbitrary distortions to the image. We expanded our analysis to examine stochastic neuronal computations, in which case perceptual discriminability can be summarized as the magnitude of change in stochastic neuronal responses, with the L2 norm being replaced by a Fisher-information computation. Using a practical lower bound on Fisher information, we showed that for stochastic neuronal computations, perceptual discriminability is completely determined by neuronal receptive fields, together with how responses co-variate across neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Category-induced global effects of feature-based attention in human visual system</a></h4>

              
                Global effects of FBA are generally limited to stimuli sharing the same or similar features, as hypothesized in the "feature-similarity gain model". Visual perception, however, often reflects categories acquired via experience; whether the global-FBA effect can be induced by the categorized features remains unclear. Here human subjects were trained to classify motion-directions into two discrete categories and performed a classical motion-based attention task. We found a category-induced global-FBA effect in both the MT+ and frontoparietal areas, where attention to a motion-direction globally spread to unattended motion-directions within the same category, but not to those in a different category. Effective connectivity analysis showed that the category-induced global-FBA effect in MT+ was derived by feedback from the IFJ. Altogether, our results reveal for the first time a category-induced global-FBA effect and identify a source for this effect in human prefrontal cortex, implying that FBA is of greater ecological significance than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combining Aperiodic 1/f Slopes and Brain Simulation: An EEG/MEG Proxy Marker of Excitation/Inhibition Imbalance in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation and interaction of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau proteins during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are shown to tilt neuronal circuits away from balanced excitation/inhibition (E/I). Current available techniques for noninvasive interrogation of E/I in the intact human brain, e.g., magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are highly restrictive (i.e., limited spatial extent), have low temporal and spatial resolution and suffer from the limited ability to distinguish accurately between different neurotransmitters complicating its interpretation. As such, these methods alone offer an incomplete explanation of E/I. Recently, the aperiodic component of neural power spectrum, often referred to in the literature as the '1/f slope', has been described as a promising and scalable biomarker that can track disruptions in E/I potentially underlying a spectrum of clinical conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, as well as developmental E/I changes as seen in aging. Using 1/f slopes from resting-state spectral data and computational modelling we developed a new method for inferring E/I alterations in AD. We tested our method on recent freely and publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets of patients with AD or prodromal disease and demonstrated the method's potential for uncovering regional patterns of abnormal excitatory and inhibitory parameters. Our results provide a general framework for investigating circuit-level disorders in AD and developing therapeutic interventions that aim to restore the balance between excitation and inhibition.

                Background: The reproducible beneficial effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in hemiparetic stroke patients makes it a good model to study brain plasticity during rehabilitation procedures. Objective: Assess the functional brain reorganization induced by each of the two components of CIMT: (i) non-affected upper-limb constraint and (ii) intensive training of the paretic arm. Methods: Brain activity of a right hemiparetic chronic stroke patient and of 10 healthy controls was recorded with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a finger opposition task. For the patient, a total of 8 assessments were performed, before and after each component of CIMT. At each time point, brain activity during movement was compared with rest. Patient's results were first compared to the control group and then correlated to motor performance across sessions. Results: Constraint-therapy-related improvement was correlated with a decrease of cerebral activity in sensory-motor regions of both the affected and the non-affected hemispheres. Intensive-therapy-related improvement was correlated with the recruitment of pre-motor cortices and cerebellum in both hemispheres. Conclusions: Two different patterns of brain activity underlie the effects of intensive training and constraint which could account for the respective effect of each component of the therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral vs. Core Body Temperature as Hypocretin/Orexin Neurons Degenerate: Exercise Mitigates Increased Heat Loss</a></h4>

              
                Hypocretins/Orexins (Hcrt/Ox) are hypothalamic neuropeptides implicated in diverse functions, including body temperature regulation through modulation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. In the current study, we measured subcutaneous (Tsc) and core (Tb) body temperature as well as activity in a conditional transgenic mouse strain that allows the inducible ablation of Hcrt/Ox-containing neurons by removal of doxycycline (DOX) from their diet (orexin-DTA mice). Measurements were made during a baseline, when mice were being maintained on food containing DOX, and over 42 days while the mice were fed normal chow which resulted in Hcrt/Ox neuron degeneration. The home cages of the orexin-DTA mice were equipped with running wheels that were either locked or unlocked. In the presence of a locked running wheel, Tsc progressively decreased on days 28 and 42 in the DOX(-) condition, primarily during the dark phase (the major active period for rodents). This nocturnal reduction in Tsc was mitigated when mice had access to unlocked running wheels. In contrast to Tsc, Tb was largely maintained until day 42 in the DOX(-) condition even when the running wheel was locked. Acute changes in both Tsc and Tb were observed preceding, during, and following cataplexy. Our results suggest that ablation of Hcrt/Ox-containing neurons results in elevated heat loss, likely through reduced sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, and that exercise may have some therapeutic benefit to patients with narcolepsy, a disorder caused by Hcrt/Ox deficiency. Acute changes in body temperature may facilitate prediction of cataplexy onset and lead to interventions to mitigate its occurrence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prenatal methadone exposure selectively alters protein expression in primary motor cortex: implications for synaptic function</a></h4>

              
                As problematic opioid use has reached epidemic levels over the past two decades, the annual prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women has also increased 333%. Yet, how opioids affect the developing brain of offspring from mothers experiencing OUD remains understudied and not fully understood. Animal models of prenatal opioid exposure have discovered many deficits in the offspring of prenatal opioid exposed mothers, such as delays in the development of sensorimotor function and long-term locomotive hyperactivity. In attempt to further understand these deficits and link them with protein changes driven by prenatal opioid exposure, we used a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME) and preformed an unbiased multi-omic analysis across many sensoriomotor brain regions known to interact with opioid exposure. The effects of PME exposure on the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) were assessed using quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics. PME drove many changes in protein and phosphopeptide abundance across all brain regions sampled. Gene and gene ontology enrichments were used to assess how protein and phosphopeptide changes in each brain region were altered. Our findings showed that M1 was uniquely affected by PME in comparison to other brain regions. PME uniquely drove changes in M1 glutamatergic synapses and synaptic function. Immunohistochemical analysis also identified anatomical differences in M1 for upregulating the density of glutamatergic and downregulating the density of GABAergic synapses due to PME. Lastly, comparisons between M1 and non-M1 multi-omics revealed conserved brain wide changes in phosphopeptides associated with synaptic activity and assembly, but only specific protein changes in synapse activity and assembly were represented in M1. Together, our studies show that lasting changes in synaptic function driven by PME are largely represented by protein and anatomical changes in M1, which may serve as a starting point for future experimental and translational interventions that aim to reverse the adverse effects of PME on offspring.

                Recent advancements in network neuroscience are pointing in the direction of considering the brain as a small-world system with segregated regions integrated to facilitate different cognitive tasks and functions. In this context, community detection is a pivotal issue in computational neuroscience. In this paper we explore community detection within brain connectomes using the power of quantum annealers, and in particular the Leap's Hybrid Solver. Our results shows that quantum annealers can achieve higher modularity index compared to classical annealer while computing communities of brain connectomes. Those promising preliminary results points out that quantum annealers might be the better choice compared to classical computing optimization process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectome-based predictive modeling shows sex differences in brain-based predictors of memory performance</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) takes a more aggressive course in women than men, with higher prevalence and faster progression. Amnestic AD specifically targets the default mode network (DMN), which subserves short-term memory; past research shows relative hyperconnectivity in the posterior DMN in aging women. Higher reliance on this network during memory tasks may contribute to women's elevated AD risk. Here, we applied connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a robust linear machine-learning approach, to the Lifespan Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-A) dataset (n=579). We sought to characterize sex-based predictors of memory performance in aging, with particular attention to the DMN. Models were evaluated using cross-validation both across the whole group and for each sex separately. Whole-group models predicted short-term memory performance with accuracies ranging from rho=0.21-0.45. The best-performing models were derived from an associative memory task-based scan. Sex-specific models revealed significant differences in connectome-based predictors for men and women. DMN activity contributed more to predicted memory scores in women, while within- and between- visual network activity contributed more to predicted memory scores in men. While men showed more segregation of visual networks, women showed more segregation of the DMN. We demonstrate that women and men recruit different circuitry when performing memory tasks, with women relying more on intra-DMN activity and men relying more on visual circuitry. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that women draw more heavily upon the DMN for recollective memory, potentially contributing to women's elevated risk of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiologic and nanoscale distinctions define glutamatergic synapses in tonic vs phasic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons exhibit a striking degree of functional diversity, each one tuned to the needs of the circuitry in which it is embedded. A fundamental functional dichotomy occurs in activity patterns, with some neurons firing at a relatively constant tonic rate, while others fire in bursts - a phasic pattern. Synapses formed by tonic vs phasic neurons are also functionally differentiated, yet the bases of their distinctive properties remain enigmatic. A major challenge towards illuminating the synaptic differences between tonic and phasic neurons is the difficulty in isolating their physiological properties. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), most muscle fibers are co-innervated by two motor neurons, the tonic MN-Ib and phasic MN-Is. Here, we employed selective expression of a newly developed botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT-C) transgene to silence tonic or phasic motor neurons. This approach revealed major differences in their neurotransmitter release properties, including probability, short-term plasticity, and vesicle pools. Furthermore, calcium imaging demonstrated ~two-fold greater calcium influx at phasic neuron release sites relative to tonic, along with enhanced synaptic vesicle coupling. Finally, confocal and super resolution imaging revealed that phasic neuron release sites are organized in a more compact arrangement, with enhanced stoichiometry of voltage-gated calcium channels relative to other active zone scaffolds. These data suggest that distinctions in active zone nano-architecture and calcium influx collaborate to differentially tune glutamate release at synapses of tonic vs phasic neuronal subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuit mechanisms for transforming learned olfactory valences into wind-oriented movement</a></h4>

              
                How memories are used by the brain to guide future action is poorly understood. In olfactory associative learning in Drosophila, multiple compartments of the mushroom body act in parallel to assign valence to a stimulus. Here, we show that appetitive memories stored in different compartments induce different levels of upwind locomotion. Using a photoactivation screen of a new collection of split-GAL4 drivers and EM connectomics, we identified a cluster of neurons postsynaptic to the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that can trigger robust upwind steering. These UpWind Neurons (UpWiNs) integrate inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs from MBONs of appetitive and aversive memory compartments, respectively. After training, disinhibition from the appetitive-memory MBONs enhances the response of UpWiNs to reward-predicting odors. Blocking UpWiNs impaired appetitive memory and reduced upwind locomotion during retrieval. Photoactivation of UpWiNs also increased the chance of returning to a location where activation was initiated, suggesting an additional role in olfactory navigation. Thus, our results provide insight into how learned abstract valences are gradually transformed into concrete memory-driven actions through divergent and convergent networks, a neuronal architecture that is commonly found in the vertebrate and invertebrate brains.

                Human cognitive abilities, and particularly hippocampus-dependent memory performance typically decline with increasing age. Immunosenescence, the age-related disintegration of the immune system are increasingly coming into the focus of research as a considerable factor contributing to cognitive decline. In the present study, we investigated potential associations between plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and learning and memory performance as well as hippocampal anatomy in young and older adults. Plasma concentrations of the inflammation marker CRP as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}1 were measured in 142 healthy adults (57 young, 24.47 +/- 4.48 years; 85 older, 63.66 +/- 7.32 years) who performed tests of explicit memory (Verbal Learning and Memory Test, VLMT; Wechsler Memory Scale, Logical Memory, WMS) with an additional delayed recall test after 24 hours. Hippocampal volumetry and hippocampal subfield segmentation were performed using FreeSurfer, based on T1-weighted and high-resolution T2-weighted MR images. When investigating the relationship between memory performance, hippocampal structure, and plasma cytokine levels, we found that TGF-{beta}1 concentrations were positively correlated with the volumes of the hippocampal CA4-dentate gyrus region in older adults. These volumes were in turn positively associated with better performance in the WMS, particularly in the delayed memory test. Our results support the notion that endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms may act as protective factor in neurocognitive aging.

                The periaqueductal grey (PAG) is a small midbrain structure that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, regulates brain-body communication, and is often studied for its role in "fight-or-flight" defense responses. We used ultra-high field 7-Tesla fMRI to resolve the PAG in humans and distinguish it from the cerebral aqueduct, examining its in vivo function in humans during a working memory task (N = 87)--i.e., a setting that required physiological mobilization, but no "threat". During both low and moderate task-elicited cognitive demand, we observed BOLD signal intensity increases in bilateral ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), consistent with the columnar organization of PAG function identified in non-human animal research. Changes in physiological activity during the task (phasic skin conductance response (SCR) amplitudes, cardiac interbeat interval, respiratory rate) were correlated with PAG BOLD estimates across subjects, and showed some evidence of spatial organization within the PAG, but no spatial organization overlapping with the task-elicited increase in bilateral vlPAG. These findings suggest that the PAG coordinates and regulates bodily activity, even in the absence of threat.

                Hippocampal ripples are highly synchronous neural events critical for memory consolidation and retrieval. A minority of strong ripples has been shown to be of particular importance in situations of increased memory demands. The propagation dynamics of strong ripples inside the hippocampal formation are, however, still opaque. We analyzed ripple propagation within the hippocampal formation in a large open access dataset comprising 267 Neuropixel recordings in 49 awake, head-fixed mice. Surprisingly, strong ripples (top 10% in ripple strength) propagate differentially depending on their generation point along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. The septal hippocampal pole is able to generate longer ripples that engage more neurons and elicit spiking activity for an extended time even at considerable distances. Accordingly, a substantial portion of the variance in strong ripple duration (R2 = 0.463) is explained by the ripple generation location on the longitudinal axis. Our results are consistent with a possible distinctive role of the hippocampal septal pole in conditions of high memory demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Test-Retest Reliability of the Human Connectome: An OPM-MEG study</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography with optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG) offers a new way to record electrophysiological brain function, with significant advantages over conventional MEG including adaptability to head shape/size, free movement during scanning, better spatial resolution, increased signal, and no reliance on cryogenics. However, OPM-MEG remains in its infancy, with significant questions to be answered regarding optimal system design and robustness. Here, we present an open-source dataset acquired using a newly constructed OPM-MEG system with a triaxial sensor design averaging 168 channels. Using OPM-optimised magnetic shielding and active background-field control, we measure the test-retest reliability of the human connectome. We employ amplitude envelope correlation to measure whole-brain functional connectivity in 10 individuals whilst they watch a 600 s move clip. Our results show high repeatability between experimental runs at the group level, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 in the theta, 0.93 in alpha and 0.94 in beta frequency ranges. At the individual subject level, we found marked differences between individuals, but high within-subject robustness (correlations of 0.56 {+/-} 0.25, 0.72 {+/-} 0.15 and 0.78 {+/-} 0.13 in theta, alpha and beta respectively). These results compare well to previously reported findings using conventional MEG; they show that OPM-MEG is a viable way to characterise whole brain connectivity and add significant weight to a growing argument that OPMs can overtake cryogenic sensors as the fundamental building block of MEG systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Promoting Axon Regeneration By Inhibiting RNA N6-methyladenosine Demethylase ALKBH5</a></h4>

              
                A key limiting factor of successful axon regeneration is the intrinsic regenerative ability in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). Previous studies have identified axon regeneration regulators that act on gene expression in injured neurons. However, it is less known if RNA modifications play a role in this process. Here, we systematically screened the functions of all common m6A modification-related enzymes in axon regeneration and report ALKBH5, an evolutionarily conserved RNA m6A demethylase, as a regulator of axonal regeneration. In PNS, knockdown of ALKBH5 enhanced sensory axonal regeneration, whereas overexpressing ALKBH5 impaired axonal regeneration in an m6A-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 increased the stability of Lpin2 mRNA and thus limited regenerative growth associated lipid metabolism in DRG neurons. Moreover, in CNS, knockdown of ALKBH5 enhanced the survival and axonal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve injury. Together, our results suggest a novel mechanism regulating axon regeneration and point ALKBH5 as a potential target for promoting axon regeneration in both PNS and CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale unsupervised discovery of excitatory morphological cell types in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the neocortex exhibit astonishing morphological diversity which is critical for properly wiring neural circuits and giving neurons their functional properties. The extent to which the morphological diversity of excitatory neurons forms a continuum or is built from distinct clusters of cell types remains an open question. Here we took a data-driven approach using graph-based machine learning methods to obtain a low-dimensional morphological "bar code" describing more than 30,000 excitatory neurons in mouse visual areas V1, AL and RL that were reconstructed from a millimeter scale serial-section electron microscopy volume. We found a set of principles that captured the morphological diversity of the dendrites of excitatory neurons. First, their morphologies varied with respect to three major axes: soma depth, total apical and basal skeletal length. Second, neurons in layer 2/3 showed a strong trend of a decreasing width of their dendritic arbor and a smaller tuft with increasing cortical depth. Third, in layer 4, atufted neurons were primarily located in the primary visual cortex, while tufted neurons were more abundant in higher visual areas. Fourth, we discovered layer 4 neurons in V1 on the border to layer 5 which showed a tendency towards avoiding deeper layers with their dendrites. In summary, excitatory neurons exhibited a substantial degree of dendritic morphological variation, both within and across cortical layers, but this variation mostly formed a continuum, with only a few notable exceptions in deeper layers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivation of early-life stress-sensitive neuronal ensembles contributes to lifelong stress hypersensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS) is one of the strongest lifetime risk factors for depression, anxiety, suicide, and other psychiatric disorders, particularly after facing additional stressful events later in life. Human and animal studies demonstrate that ELS sensitizes individuals to subsequent stress. However, the neurobiological basis of such stress sensitization remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS-induced stress sensitization would be detectable at the level of neuronal ensembles, such that cells activated by ELS would be more reactive to adult stress. To test this, we leveraged transgenic mice to genetically tag, track, and manipulate experience-activated neurons. We found that in both male and female mice, ELS-activated neurons within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and to a lesser-extent the medial prefrontal cortex, were preferentially reactivated by adult stress. To test whether reactivation of ELS-activated ensembles in the NAc contributes to stress hypersensitivity, we expressed hM4Dis receptor in control or ELS-activated neurons of pups and chemogenetically inhibited their activity during experience of adult stress. Inhibition of ELS-activated NAc neurons, but not control-tagged neurons, ameliorated social avoidance behavior following chronic social defeat stress in males. These data provide evidence that ELS-induced stress hypersensitivity is encoded at the level of corticolimbic neuronal ensembles.

	<p>Prior evidence suggests domain-specific working memory (WM) buffers for maintaining phonological (i.e., speech sound) and semantic (i.e., meaning) information. The phonological WM buffer&amp;amp;rsquo;s proposed location is in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), whereas semantic WM has been related to the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and the angular gyrus (AG). However, less is known about the white matter correlates of phonological and semantic WM. We tested 45 individuals with left hemisphere brain damage on single word processing, phonological WM, and semantic WM tasks and obtained T1 and diffusion weighted neuroimaging. Virtual dissections were performed for each participants&amp;amp;rsquo; arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), middle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and uncinate fasciculus (UF), which connect the proposed domain-specific WM buffers with perceptual or processing regions. The results showed that the left ILF, MLF, IFOF, and the direct segment of the AF were related to semantic WM performance. Phonological WM was related to both the left ILF and the MLF. This work informs our understanding of the white matter correlates of WM, especially semantic WM, which has not previously been investigated. In addition, this work helps to adjudicate between theories of verbal WM, providing some evidence for separate pathways supporting phonological and semantic WM.</p>

	<p>Early detection of autism provides access to early intervention and subsequently fewer lifelong challenges. However, disparities in screening have been associated with socioeconomic status (SES) and race, and disparities in surveillance have been associated with clinician knowledge and beliefs about autism identification. The present study examines associations between demographic variables and clinician beliefs, and agreement between screening results and clinician surveillance. Surveillance included activities used by the primary care clinicians (PCCs) to assess risk for autism. PCCs reported their beliefs about autism screening and identification, their sex, race, years in practice, and racial distribution of their patient population. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s demographic information was also collected. PCCs identified children as having, or not having, an increased likelihood of autism, and parents of children completed an autism screener. Agreement between screening and surveillance results were examined across PCC, practice, and child demographics. Higher confidence in autism knowledge and screening resources, female PCC sex, and majority White practice patient demographics all predicted agreement between screening and surveillance. Female child sex and higher maternal education also predicted agreement between screening and surveillance. These findings highlight the importance of PCC screening beliefs and child and PCC demographics on the autism identification process.</p>

	<p>It is hypothesized that factors associated with bipolar disorder could, uer defined conditions, produce adaptive behaviors. The aim is to verify whether a genetic feature associated with bipolar disorder can be found in people without bipolar disorder but with hyperactivity/exploration traits. Healthy old adults (N = 40) recruited for a previous study on exercise were subdivided using a previously validated tool into those with and without hyperactivity/exploration traits and compared with a group of old patients with bipolar disorder (N = 21). The genetic variant RS1006737 of CACNA1C was analyzed using blood samples, DNA extraction, real-time PCR, FRET probes, and SANGER method sequencing. People with hyperactivity/exploration traits and without bipolar disorder were like people with bipolar disorder regarding the frequency of the genetic variant (OR = 0.79, CI95%: 0.21&amp;amp;ndash;2.95), but were different from people without either hyperactivity/exploration traits and bipolar disorder (OR = 4.75, CI95%: 1.19&amp;amp;ndash;18.91). The combined group of people with hyperactivity/exploration traits without bipolar disorder plus people with bipolar disorder had a higher frequency of the variant than people without either hyperactivity/exploration traits or bipolar disorder (OR = 4.25, CI95%: 1.24&amp;amp;ndash;14.4). To consider the genetic profile of bipolar disorder not an aberrant condition opens the way to a new approach in which the adaptive potential would be a central point in psychosocial treatment in addition to drug therapy. Future research can confirm the results of our study.</p>
