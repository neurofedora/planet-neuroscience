              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuroimaging of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and its relation to Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep without atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. This disorder is considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), where it affects more than 50% of PD patients. The underlying pathology of RBD has been generally understood to involve the pontine nuclei within the brainstem. However, the complete pathophysiology beyond the brainstem remains unclear as does its relationship with PD pathology. Therefore, this review aims to survey the neuroimaging literature involving PET, SPECT, and MR imaging techniques to provide an updated understanding of the neuro-chemical, structural, and functional changes in both RBD and PD patients comorbid with RBD. This review found neuroimaging evidence that indicate alterations to the dopaminergic and cholinergic system, blood perfusion, and glucose metabolism in both RBD patients and PD patients with RBD. Beyond the brainstem, structural and functional changes were found to involve the nigrostriatal system, limbic system, and the cortex—suggesting that RBD is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative process. Future investigations are encouraged to follow RBD patients longitudinally using multimodal imaging techniques to enhance our understanding of this parasomnia disorder. Uncovering which individuals are most likely to develop an alpha-synuclein disorder in the prodromal phase will improve patient outcomes and potentially aid in the development of novel treatments for patients affected by RBD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Controlling SARS-CoV-2 in schools using repetitive testing strategies</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 remains a worldwide emergency. While vaccines have been approved and are widely administered, there is an ongoing debate whether children should be vaccinated or prioritized for vaccination. Therefore, in order to mitigate the spread of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants among children, the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still warranted. We investigate the impact of different testing strategies on the SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in a primary school environment, using an individual-based modelling approach. Specifically, we consider three testing strategies: (1) <i>symptomatic isolation</i>, where we test symptomatic individuals and isolate them when they test positive, (2) <i>reactive screening</i>, where a class is screened once one symptomatic individual was identified, and (3) <i>repetitive screening</i>, where the school in its entirety is screened on regular time intervals. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that repetitive testing strategies can significantly reduce the attack rate in schools, contrary to a reactive screening or a symptomatic isolation approach. However, when a repetitive testing strategy is in place, more cases will be detected and class and school closures are more easily triggered, leading to a higher number of school days lost per child. While maintaining the epidemic under control with a repetitive testing strategy, we show that absenteeism can be reduced by relaxing class and school closure thresholds.

                Adapting our actions to changing goals and environments is central to intelligent behavior. There is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in reinforcing actions that have led to favorable outcomes. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying action adaptation following unfavorable outcomes when change is warranted. Here, we recorded electrophysiological activity and applied bursts of electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a core area of the basal ganglia, in patients with Parkinsons disease using deep brain stimulation electrodes. During a task where patients continuously had to adapt their force depending on changing action-value associations, decreases in STN beta (13-30 Hz) activity in two critical time windows were associated with poorer outcomes and stronger action adaptation. STN stimulation reduced beta activity and led to stronger action adaptation if applied within the time windows when STN activity reflected action evaluation and adaptation. These results suggest that dynamic modulation of STN activity facilitates adaptive behavior.

                Sufficiency measures are potentially decisive for the decarbonisation of energy systems but rarely considered in energy policy and modelling. Just as efficiency and renewable energies, the diffusion of demand-side solutions to climate change also relies on policy-making. Our extensive literature review of European and national sufficiency policies fills a gap in existing databases. We present almost 300 policy instruments clustered into relevant categories and publish them as "Energy Sufficiency Policy Database". This paper provides a description of the data clustering, the set-up of the database and an analysis of the policy instruments. A key insight is that sufficiency policy includes much more than bans of products or information tools leaving the responsibility to individuals. It is a comprehensive instrument mix of all policy types, not only enabling sufficiency action, but also reducing currently existing barriers. A policy database can serve as a good starting point for policy recommendations and modelling, further research is needed on barriers and demand-reduction potentials of sufficiency policy instruments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Robustness of the aging effect of smiling against vertical facial orientation [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous studies have shown that the association between smiling and youth is a misconception; smiling faces have been estimated to be older than neutral faces. Previous studies have indicated that this aging effect of smiling (AES) is due to eye wrinkles caused by the facial action of smiling. However, whether holistic processing for facial expressions is involved in AES has not been investigated. The present study aimed to clarify these issues. Methods: Participants were recruited to participate in an online experiment that had a 3 (facial expression: smiling/neutral/surprised) × 2 (facial orientation: upright/inverted) mixed design. Participants were presented with an upright or inverted face for each expression (neutral, smiling, and surprised) and were asked to estimate the individual’s age. Results: In total, 104 participants were included in the analysis. The results show that smiling faces were estimated to be older than neutral faces, whereas there was no significant difference between upright and inverted faces. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AES is not dependent on holistic processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Temporomandibular joint disorders prevalence and awareness of appropriate clinical practices, among Al-Madinah community: A prospective cross sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Painful temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are of musculoskeletal origin and are considered the most common cause of non-odontogenic pain in the orofacial region.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and awareness of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders in Almadinah Almunawwarah community. Methods: A prospective observational cross-sectional study with convenience sampling was conducted. A translated Arabic version of Fonseca's questionnaire was employed. The questionnaire asked about the participant's personal information, if they thought they had TMDs, and who to visit for therapy if necessary. These were followed by 10 items from Fonseca's questionnaire, each with a three-point scale. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 598 people. Females made up 57.1% of the participants. TMDs were present in 61% of the population, with varying degrees of severity. Males (44.3%) were less affected than females (55.7%). The difference, however, was not statistically significant (P = 0.354). Out of the 61% TMDs Positive patients, 74.1% had mild TMDs symptoms, while 20.8% and 5.1%, respectively, had moderate and severe TMDs symptoms (P = 0.05). The severity of the symptoms was unaffected by demographic data (P > 0.05). Only 40% seek care, with 64.6% selecting for a dentist and 24.6% preferring for an orthopaedic specialist (P= 0.008). Conclusions: Participants from Al-Madinah had a greater prevalence of mild TMDs. The majority of the participants had no idea who to go to for treatment. The findings of this study highlight the importance of educational activities to enhance public awareness

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between dermatoglyphic patterns and growth patterns of subjects with skeletal class I relation: A cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To assess the relationship between dermatoglyphic patterns and various growth patterns of the mandible. Methods: Patients with Class I Skeletal relation were selected after clinical diagnosis followed by digitally tracing the cephalogram. The patients were subdivided into three groups of mandibular divergence patterns ie Average, Horizontal and Vertical. 90 samples ie 30 in each group were selected for the study. The fingerprints of all the selected subjects were then extracted digitally and analysed for the most dominant pattern in each hand. Results: For the left hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average and Vertical Growers. For the right hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average Growers. A significant association (P<0.05) between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern was also found when average growers were compared to vertical growers. Conclusions: Horizontal growers had 80% frequency of appearance of whorls in their left hand and 67% in their right hand. Horizontal growers could easily be differentiated from the average and vertical growers because of the dominance of whorl pattern in their hands. Composite and arch pattern were more frequent in vertical growers when compared to horizontal and average growers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence for yeast artificial synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 genomic sequences [version 5; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should also be considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 significantly diverge from other SARS-like coronaviruses through short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain; for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast origin covering the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose an artificial synthesis model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential yeast sequence patterns congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support yeast artificial synthesis. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain sequence information that points to their artificial synthesis in genetically modified yeast cells. Our data specifically allow the identification of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a potential recombination donor for the critical furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neural crest cell-placodal neuron interactions are mediated by Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin during early chick trigeminal ganglion assembly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Arising at distinct positions in the head, the cranial ganglia are crucial for integrating various sensory inputs. The largest of these ganglia is the trigeminal ganglion, which relays pain, touch and temperature information through its three primary nerve branches to the central nervous system. The trigeminal ganglion and its nerves are composed of derivatives of two critical embryonic cell types, neural crest cells and placode cells, that migrate from different anatomical locations, coalesce together, and differentiate to form trigeminal sensory neurons and supporting glia. While the dual cellular origin of the trigeminal ganglion has been known for over 60 years, molecules expressed by neural crest cells and placode cells that regulate initial ganglion assembly remain obscure. Prior studies revealed the importance of cell surface cadherin proteins during early trigeminal gangliogenesis, with Cadherin-7 and neural cadherin (N-cadherin) expressed in neural crest cells and placode cells, respectively. Although cadherins typically interact in a homophilic (i.e., like) fashion, the presence of different cadherins on these intermingling cell populations raises the question as to whether heterophilic cadherin interactions may also be occurring during initial trigeminal ganglion formation, which was the aim of this study. Methods: To assess potential interactions between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin, we used biochemistry and innovative imaging assays conducted in vitro and in vivo, including in the forming chick trigeminal ganglion. Results: Our data revealed a physical interaction between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin. Conclusions: These studies identify a new molecular basis by which neural crest cells and placode cells can aggregate in vivo to build the trigeminal ganglion during embryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methylene blue sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer learning curve in the COVID-19 era: How many cases are enough? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now the gold standard procedure for early breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes (N0). According to the Indonesian Board-Certified oncologist surgeon, the learning curve for evaluating fellow breast surgeons to achieve this competency could have been shorter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to see if the learning curve for sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification can be shortened and if imprint cytology (IC) can replace frozen sections (FS) for intraoperative analysis. Methods: Fellow breast surgeons were taught to perform SLNB on breast cancer patients. Intraoperative assessment and completion of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were performed in the first setting for standardization with the attending surgeon. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification was plotted on cumulative sum chart (CUSUM) limitations for evaluating the variability competency between attending surgeon and fellow surgeon based on a target identification rate of 85%. In addition, the accuracy of imprint cytology versus frozen section for identifying lymph node metastases was compared. Results: Consecutive 50 SLNBs were conducted during this period with attending and trainees split into two groups. After 13 consecutive tests, the CUSUM plot positively identified SLN as a significant achievement level of competency. Imprint cytology was shown to be inferior to frozen section cytology. The accuracy of imprint cytology is 91.8%, while the accuracy of frozen sections is 95.9%. Conclusion: According to a CUSUM chart based on a reasonable set of parameters, the learning curve for SLNB using methylene blue dye is reached after 13 consecutive positively detected SLN. Meanwhile, the frozen section is still the gold standard for determining the disorder of axillary lymph nodes, but the accuracy between the two methods can be comparable.

                The position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix, is the commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and software tools in regulatory genomics, including computational prediction of the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power" if applied to the analysis of regulatory variants studied with a newly developed experimental method, SNP-SELEX. Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can adequately quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The potential utility of an augmented data collection approach in understanding the journey to care of pregnant women for maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across all 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1st November 2018 and 30th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled <5 km (26.9%) and 10-29 minutes (38.0%). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.

                The most common adrenal lesion is an adrenal adenoma in adults. Adrenal adenomas can have a variety of imaging features due to their widespread prevalence. As a result, distinguishing between typical and atypical imaging features of adrenal adenomas is critical, as is distinguishing atypical adrenal adenomas from potentially malignant lesions. Here, we present a case of adrenal adenoma with atypical imaging findings presenting as Cushing’s syndrome.

                Background: This study was done to describe the pattern of personal protective equipment (PPE) use, associated factors, and adverse events among obstetricians and obstetric nurses in obstetrics & gynecology departments.  Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in Obstetrics & Gynecology departments in three hospitals (physician & nurses n=252) using an online Google form including demographic and occupational health data, type of available personal protective equipment during usual care, CS and emergency labor, infection control measures and hazards of full PPE use. Results Full PPE use was 37.7% during CS and 34.9% during emergency labor. The significant predictors of wearing full PPE during CS were daily work hours > 8 hours and receiving formal training about PPE use. During CS & emergency labor most of HCws used sterile gloves and sterile fluid resistant gowns and surgical mask.to less extent used face shields or tight fitting googles and one tenth (11.8%) only used N95. The most common health effects of full PPE use was sense of heat (79.5%). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic more vigorous respiratory (N95 mask) and eye protection is required during aerosol-generating procedures. Formal training is an evident predictor for full PPE use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">“Exclusivity” and quantifier float in bakari [version 2; peer review: 4 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents a descriptive study that analyzes the semantic meaning of toritate focus particle bakari. It has been pointed out that while bakari expresses exclusivity, it seemingly possesses the characteristic of allowing non-applicable cases. This phenomenon may be examined when one argues against the position that bakari expresses exclusivity. Contrary to this view, the current study shows that when bakari co-occurs with floating quantifiers, non-applicable cases cannot be included in the quantity of the item indicated by the quantifier in question, thereby arguing that the meaning of bakari should be taken as exclusivity. Based on the previous studies, we clarify the following two points. First, when bakari is used, apart from a pre-established objective set reflecting the world, a subjective set rooted in the speaker's experience is established, and when a floating quantifier co-occurs with bakari, the quantifier in question expresses the quantity of the subjective set. Second, toritate focus particle bakari represents exclusivity, and the non-applicable cases can exist only outside of the set that bakari is concerned with.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Contributions by metaplasticity to solving the Catastrophic Forgetting Problem</a></h4>

              
                Catastrophic forgetting (CF) refers to the sudden and severe loss of prior information in learning systems when acquiring new information. CF has been an Achilles heel of standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) when learning multiple tasks sequentially. The brain, by contrast, has solved this problem during evolution. Modellers now use a variety of strategies to overcome CF, many of which have parallels to cellular and circuit functions in the brain. One common strategy, based on metaplasticity phenomena, controls the future rate of change at key connections to help retain previously learned information.

                T cells play a critical role in the adaptive immune response, recognizing peptide antigens presented on the cell surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. While assessing peptides for MHC binding is an important component of probing these interactions, traditional assays for testing peptides of interest for MHC binding are limited in throughput. Here we present a yeast display-based platform for assessing the binding of tens of thousands of user-defined peptides in a high throughput manner. We apply this approach to assess a tiled library covering the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and four dengue virus serotypes for binding to human class II MHCs, including HLA-DR401, -DR402, and -DR404. While the peptide datasets show broad agreement with previously described MHC-binding motifs, they additionally reveal experimentally validated computational false positives and false negatives. We therefore present this approach as able to complement current experimental datasets and computational predictions. Further, our yeast display approach underlines design considerations for epitope identification experiments and serves as a framework for examining relationships between viral conservation and MHC binding, which can be used to identify potentially high-interest peptide binders from viral proteins. These results demonstrate the utility of our approach to determine peptide-MHC binding interactions in a manner that can supplement and potentially enhance current algorithm-based approaches.

Monitoring release of these chemicals has traditionally been difficult to carry out at spatial and temporal scales relevant to neuron function. To understand chemical neurotransmission more fully, we need to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements for neurotransmitter release. To address this, we engineered a chemi-sensitive, two-dimensional composite nanofilm that facilitates visualization of the release and diffusion of the neurochemical dopamine with synaptic resolution, quantal sensitivity, and simultaneously from hundreds of release sites. Using this technology, we were able to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of dopamine release in dendritic processes, a poorly understood phenomenon. We found that dopamine release is broadcast from a subset of dendritic processes as hotspots that have a mean spatial spread of 3.2 µm (full width at half maximum) and are observed with a mean spatial frequency of 1 hotspot per 7.5 µm of dendritic length. Major dendrites of dopamine neurons and fine dendritic processes, as well as dendritic arbors and dendrites with no apparent varicose morphology participated in dopamine release. Remarkably, these release hotspots colocalized with Bassoon, suggesting that Bassoon may contribute to organizing active zones in dendrites, similar to its role in axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancestral acetylcholine receptor β-subunit forms homopentamers that prime before opening spontaneously</a></h4>

              
                Human adult muscle-type acetylcholine receptors are heteropentameric ion channels formed from two α-subunits, and one each of the β-, d-, and e-subunits. To form functional channels, the subunits must assemble with one another in a precise stoichiometry and arrangement. Despite being different, the four subunits share a common ancestor that is presumed to have formed homopentamers. The extent to which the properties of the modern-day receptor result from its subunit complexity is unknown. Here we discover that a reconstructed ancestral muscle-type β-subunit can form homopentameric ion channels. These homopentamers open spontaneously and display single-channel hallmarks of muscle-type acetylcholine receptor activity. Our findings attest to the homopentameric origin of the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor, and demonstrate that signature features of its function are both independent of agonist and do not necessitate the complex heteropentameric architecture of the modern-day protein.

                ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S are approved vaccines inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans by expressing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed protein content and protein composition of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S by biochemical methods and by mass-spectrometry. Four out of four tested lots of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 contained significantly higher than expected levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) and of free viral proteins. The most abundant contaminating HCPs belonged to the heat-shock protein (HSP) and cytoskeletal protein families. The HCP content exceeded the 400 ng specification limit per vaccine dose, as set by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for this vaccine, by at least 25-fold and the manufacturer's batch-release data in some of the lots by several hundred-fold. In contrast, three tested lots of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine contained only very low amounts of HCPs. As shown for Ad26.COV2.S production of clinical grade adenovirus vaccines of high purity is feasible at an industrial scale. Correspondingly, purification procedures of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine should be modified to remove protein impurities as good as possible. Our data also indicate that standard quality assays, as they are used in the manufacturing of proteins, have to be adapted for vectored vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Therapeutic deep brain stimulation disrupts movement-related subthalamic nucleus activity in Parkinsonian mice</a></h4>

              
                Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) relieves many motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD), but its underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Since its advent, three major theories have been proposed: (1) DBS inhibits the STN and basal ganglia output; (2) DBS antidromically activates motor cortex; and (3) DBS disrupts firing dynamics within the STN. Previously, stimulation-related electrical artifacts limited mechanistic investigations using electrophysiology. We used electrical artifact-free GCaMP fiber photometry to investigate activity in basal ganglia nuclei during STN DBS in parkinsonian mice. To test whether the observed changes in activity were sufficient to relieve motor symptoms, we then combined electrophysiological recording with targeted optical DBS protocols. Our findings suggest that STN DBS exerts its therapeutic effect through the disruption of movement-related STN activity, rather than inhibition or antidromic activation. These results provide insight into optimizing PD treatments and establish an approach for investigating DBS in other neuropsychiatric conditions.

                The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment wherein we sampled fluids within the BLA and observed behavioral responses of male and female mice while presenting highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint behaviors. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, the ACh and DA release patterns to mating playback were similar to males. Estrous females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Across these groups, increased ACh concentration was correlated with an increase in defensive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound-analyzing BLA neurons that modulates their output to downstream brain regions responsible for appropriate behavioral outcomes.

                Using brain activity directly as input for assistive tool control can circumvent muscular dysfunction and increase functional independence for physically impaired people. Most invasive motor decoding studies focus on decoding neural signals from the primary motor cortex, which provides a rich but superficial and spatially local signal. Initial non-primary motor cortex decoding endeavors have used distributed recordings to demonstrate decoding of motor activity by grouping electrodes in mesoscale brain regions. While these studies show that there is relevant and decodable movement related information outside the primary motor cortex, these methods are still exclusionary to other mesoscale areas, and do not capture the full informational content of the motor system. In this work, we recorded intracranial EEG of 8 epilepsy patients, including all electrode contacts except those contacts in or adjacent to the central sulcus. We show that executed and imagined movements can be decoded from non-motor areas; combining all non-motor contacts into a lower dimensional representation provides enough information for a Riemannian decoder to reach an area under the curve of 0.83 {+/-} 0.11. Additionally, by training our decoder on executed and testing on imagined movements, we demonstrate that between these two conditions there exists shared distributed information in the beta frequency range. By combining relevant information from all areas into a lower dimensional representation, the decoder was able to achieve high decoding results without information from the primary motor cortex. This representation makes the decoder more robust to perturbations, signal non-stationarities and neural tissue degradation. Our results indicate to look beyond the motor cortex and open up the way towards more robust and more versatile brain-computer interfaces.

                Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) is the most common nosocomial pathogen in preterm infants and associated with increased risk of cognitive delay, however, underlying mechanisms are unknown. We employed morphological, transcriptomic and physiological methods to extensively characterize microglia in the immature hippocampus following S. epidermidis infection. 3D morphological analysis revealed activation of microglia after S. epidermidis. Differential expression combined with network analysis identified NOD-receptor signalling and trans-endothelial leukocyte trafficking as major mechanisms in microglia. In support, active caspase-1 was increased in the hippocampus and using the LysM-eGFP knock-in transgenic mouse, we demonstrate infiltration of leukocytes to the brain together with disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Our findings identify activation of microglia inflammasome as a major mechanism underlying neuroinflammation following infection. The results demonstrate that neonatal S. epidermidis infection share analogies with S. aureus and neurological diseases, suggesting a previously unrecognized important role in neurodevelopmental disorders in preterm born children.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A quantitative rule to explain multi-spine plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neurons receive thousands of inputs onto their dendritic arbour, where individual synapses undergo activity-dependent changes in strength. The durable forms of synaptic strength change, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), require calcium entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) that triggers downstream protein signalling cascades in the dendrite. Intriguingly, sLTP and sLTD are not necessarily restricted to the active, targeted synapses (homosynapses), and the changes in synaptic strength can spread and affect the strengths of inactive or non-stimulated synapses (heterosynapses) on the same cell. Precisely how neurons allocate resources for implementing the changes in strength at individual synapses depending on their proximity to activity across space and time remains an open question. In order to gain insights into the elementary processes underlying heterosynaptic plasticity and their interplay with homosynaptic plasticity, we have combined experimental and mathematical modelling approaches. On the one hand, we used glutamate uncaging to precisely and systematically stimulate variable numbers of homosynapses sharing the same dendritic branch whilst monitoring tens of other heterosynapses on the same dendrite. Homosynaptic potentiation of clusters of dendritic spines leads to heterosynaptic changes that are NMDAR-dependent, requiring CaMKII and calcineurin activity. On the other hand, inspired by the calcium levels hypothesis where different amounts of calcium lead to either growth or shrinkage of spines, we have built a model based on a dual-role calcium-dependent protein that induces spine shrinkage or potentiation dynamics. Comparing our experimental results with model predictions, we find that (i) both collaboration and competition among spines for protein resources are key drivers of heterosynaptic plasticity and (ii) the temporal and spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated spines impact the resulting spine dynamics. Moreover, our model can reconcile a number of disparate and sometimes contradictory experimental reports of heterosynaptic sLTP or sLTD at homo and heterosynaptic spines. Our results provide a quantitative description of the heterosynaptic footprint unfolding across minutes and hours post-stimulation across tens of microns of dendritic space. This broadens our knowledge about the operation of non-linear dendritic summation rules and how they impact spiking decisions.

                The power spectrum of brain activity is composed by peaks at characteristic frequencies superimposed to a background that decays as a power law of the frequency, f-{beta} with an exponent {beta} close to 1 (pink noise). This exponent is predicted to be connected with the exponent {gamma} related to the scaling of the average size with the duration of avalanches of activity. "Mean field" models of neural dynamics predict exponents {beta} and {gamma} equal or near 2 at criticality (brown noise), including the simple branching model and the fully connected stochastic Wilson Cowan model. We here show that a 2D version of the stochastic Wilson Cowan model, where neuron connections decay exponentially with the distance, is characterized by exponents {beta} and {gamma} markedly different from those of mean field, respectively around 1 and 1.3. The exponents  and {tau} of avalanche size and duration distributions, equal to 1.5 and 2 in mean field, decrease respectively to 1.29 {+/-} 0.01 and 1.37 {+/-} 0.01. This seems to suggest the possibility of a different universality class for the model in finite dimension.

                In contrast to most parts of the vertebrate nervous system, the ganglion cell axons in the retina typically lack any myelination. Ganglion cell axons of most species only become myelinated once they leave the retina to form the optic nerve. The avian retina is a well known exception in that ganglion cell axons are partly myelinated in the retinal nerve fiber layer. However, the functional and structural properties of myelination in the nerve fiber layer remain elusive. Here, we used large-scale multi-electrode array recordings in combination with immunohisto-chemistry and fluorescence microscopy of European quail and pigeon retinas to investigate myelination of retinal ganglion cell axons. Intraretinal myelination was accompanied by the formation of nodes of Ranvier. The internode length was positively correlated with the axon diameter. The variability of internode lengths along each axon was significantly smaller than across axons. Saltatory conduction of action potentials was observed in a large population of recorded cells. On average, myelinated axons had higher conduction velocities than unmyelinated axons. However, both groups showed a significant overlap at low velocities. The number of simultaneously active nodes was positively correlated with the conduction velocity. In contrast, the internode length and the time it took a node to activate were weak predictors for the conduction velocity. However, the conduction velocity was well described by the number of activated nodes, the internode length, and the activation time in concert.

                Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a neurologic disease caused by vitamin B1 or thiamine deficiency (TD), being the alcohol use disorder (AUD) its main risk factor. WE patients present limiting motor, cognitive and emotional alterations related to a selective cerebral vulnerability. Neuroinflammation has been proposed as one of the phenomena contributing to brain damage. Our previous studies provide evidence for the involvement of the innate immune receptor Toll-like (TLR) 4 in the inflammatory response induced in the frontal cortex and cerebellum in TD animal models (animals fed with TD diet and receiving pyrithiamine). However, the effects of the combination of chronic alcohol consumption and TD on TLR4 and their specific contribution to the pathogenesis of WE are currently unknown. Additionally, no studies on TLR4 have been conducted on WE patients since brains from these patients are difficult to achieve. Here, we used rat models of chronic alcohol (CA; 9 months of forced consumption of 20% (w/v) alcohol), TD hit (TDD; TD diet + daily 0.25 mg/kg i.p. pyrithiamine during 12 days), or a combined treatment (CA+TDD) to check the activation of the proinflammatory TLR4/MyD88 pathway and related markers in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum. In addition, we characterized for the first time the TLR4 and its co-receptor MyD88 signature, along with other markers of this proinflammatory signaling such as phospo-NFkappaB; p65 and IkappaB, in the post-mortem human frontal cortex and cerebellum (gray and white matter) of an alcohol-induced WE patient, comparing it with negative (no disease) and positive (aged brain with Alzheimer disease) control subjects for neuroinflammation. We found an increase in the cortical TLR4 and its adaptor molecule MyD88, together with an upregulation of the proinflammatory signaling molecules p-NFkappaB and IkappaB in the CA+TDD animal model. In the patient diagnosed with alcohol-induced WE we observed cortical and cerebellar upregulation of the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Thus, our findings provide evidence, both in the animal model and the human postmortem brain, of the upregulation of the TLR4/MyD88 proinflammatory pathway in WE related to alcohol consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signatures of contextual interference in implicit sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Contextual interference refers to the phenomenon whereby a blocked practice schedule results in faster acquisition but poorer retention of new motor skills compared to a random practice schedule. While contextual interference has been observed under a broad range of tasks, it remains unclear if this effect generalizes to the implicit and automatic recalibration of an overlearned motor skill. To address this question, we compared blocked and random practice schedules on a reaching task in which we used a feedback perturbation method that isolates implicit adaptation. The degree of implicit adaptation was quantified as the change in hand angle in the opposite direction of the perturbation, and retention was quantified as the percent of adaptation remaining after visual feedback was extinguished. In two experiments, participants tested under a random practice schedule exhibited slower implicit adaptation, but better retention compared to participants tested under a blocked practice schedule, the signature of contextual interference. These results indicate that contextual interference is not limited to the acquisition of new motor skills but also applies to the implicit adaptation of established motor skills.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local neuroplasticity in adult glaucomatous visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The degree to which the adult human visual cortex retains the ability to functionally adapt to damage at the level of the eye remains ill-understood. Previous studies on cortical neuroplasticity primarily focused on the consequences of foveal visual field defects (VFD), yet these findings may not generalize to peripheral defects such as occur in glaucoma. Moreover, recent findings on neuroplasticity are often based on population receptive field (pRF) mapping, but interpreting these results is complicated in the absence of appropriate control conditions. Here, we used fMRI-based neural modeling to assess putative changes in pRFs associated with glaucomatous VFD. We compared the fMRI-signals and pRF estimates in participants with glaucoma to those of controls with case-matched simulated VFD. We found that the amplitude of the fMRI-signal is reduced in glaucoma compared to control participants and correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, while coarse retinotopic structure is maintained in all participants with glaucoma, we observed local pRF shifts and enlargements in early visual areas, relative to control participants. These differences imply that the adult brain retains local neuroplasticity. This finding has translational relevance, as it is consistent with VFD masking, which prevents glaucoma patients from noticing their VFD and seeking timely treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Specialized neuronal modules for economic and single-attribute choice in the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                An important aspect of biological intelligence is the ability of quick task switching. Such ability may be realized through a neural system equipped with functionally specialized modules subserving each task. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) harbors a persistent circuit supporting economic decisions under different contexts. To examine the specialization of this circuit, we contrasted the coding of the same neurons in the OFC of rhesus monkeys under economic choice (EC) and single-attribute choice (SC). In EC, OFC neurons largely encoded offer value, chosen value and choice outcome in goods space. Strikingly, these neurons were tuned out in SC while a complementary set of neurons encoded SC-related variables in a spatial reference frame. Moreover, in EC, neurons encoding the same value-related variable are anatomically clustered and the noise correlation among these neurons dropped significantly when the animal switched from EC to SC, suggesting altered functional organization. Thus, dedicated modules in the OFC may support cognitive flexibility in choice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration and evaluation of magnetic stimulation in physiology setups</a></h4>

              
                A large number of behavioral experiments have demonstrated the existence of a magnetic sense in many animal species. Further, studies with immediate gene expression markers have identified putative brain regions involved in magnetic information processing. In contrast, very little is known about the physiology of the magnetic sense and how the magnetic field is neuronally encoded. In vivo electrophysiological studies reporting neuronal correlates of the magnetic sense either have turned out to be irreproducible for lack of appropriate artifact controls or still await independent replication. Thus far, the research field of magnetoreception has little exploited the power of ex vivo physiological studies, which hold great promise for enabling stringent controls. However, tight space constraints in a recording setup and the presence of magnetizable materials in setup components and microscope objectives make it demanding to generate well-defined magnetic stimuli at the location of the biological specimen. Here, we present a solution based on a miniature vector magnetometer, a coil driver, and a calibration routine for the coil system to compensate for magnetic distortions in the setup. The magnetometer fits in common physiology recording chambers and has a sufficiently small spatial integration area to allow for probing spatial inhomogeneities. The coil-driver allows for the generation of defined non-stationary fast changing magnetic stimuli. Our ex vivo multielectrode array recordings from avian retinal ganglion cells show that artifacts induced by rapid magnetic stimulus changes can mimic the waveform of biological spikes on single electrodes. However, induction artifacts can be separated clearly from biological responses if the spatio-temporal characteristics of the artifact on multiple electrodes is taken into account. We provide the complete hardware design data and software resources for the integrated magnetic stimulation system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual-tasking reveals the attentional cost of resolving sensory conflict induced by perturbed optic flow during treadmill walking</a></h4>

              
                The precise role of cognitive control in the processing of optic flow has been rarely investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether coping with unreliable visual inputs during walking requires cognitive resources. Twenty-four healthy young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill in a virtual environment under two optic flow conditions: normal (congruent) and perturbed (continuous mediolateral pseudo-random oscillations). Each condition was performed under single-task and dual-task conditions of increasing difficulty (1-, 2-, 3-back). Foot placement kinematics (200 Hz) and surface electromyography (EMG) of soleus and gluteus medius (1000 Hz) were recorded. Means, standard deviations (variability), statistical persistence and step-to-step error correction were computed from gait time series in lateral and anteroposterior directions. For EMG variables, duration and variability of muscle activation were calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the variance ratio, respectively. N-back task performance was expressed by the d prime and response time. Cognitive performance decreased as cognitive load increased (p<.001) but remained preserved under dual-task walking. Kinematics variability and EMG variance ratio increased under optic flow perturbation (p<.001). However, dual-tasking reduced the impact of the optic flow disturbance on the kinematics variability. Persistence of step width and antipersistence of step velocity decreased as cognitive load increased. Lastly, FWHM of soleus muscle increased with dual-task (p=.01). The results indicated that cognitive dual-tasking decreased the optic flow effect, demonstrating that resolving conflicting visual cues was attentionally costly. Also, in dual-task conditions, individuals adopted a rigid and controlled walking pattern in order to succeed N-back task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atypical intrinsic neural timescales in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common drug-resistant epilepsy in adults. Here, we aimed to profile local neural function in TLE in vivo, building on prior evidence that has identified widespread structural alterations. Using multimodal MRI, we mapped intrinsic neural timescales (INT) at rest, examined associations to TLE-related structural compromise, and evaluated the clinical utility of INT. Methods: We studied 46 TLE patients and 44 healthy controls from two independent sites, and mapped INT changes in patients relative to controls across hippocampal, subcortical, and neocortical regions. We examined region-specific associations to structural alterations and explored effects of age and epilepsy duration. A supervised machine learning paradigm assessed utility of INT for classifying patients-vs-controls and seizure focus lateralization. Results: Relative to controls, TLE showed marked INT reductions across multiple regions bilaterally, indexing faster changing resting activity, with strongest effects in ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal regions, and sensorimotor cortices. Findings were consistent in each site and robust, albeit with reduced effect sizes, when correcting for structural alterations. TLE-related INT reductions increased with advancing disease duration, yet findings differed from aging effects seen in controls. Classifiers based on INT distinguished patients-vs-controls (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 76+-2.65%, cross-site, 72-83%) and lateralized the focus in TLE (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 96+-2.10%; cross-site, 95-97%) with high accuracies and generalization. Conclusions: Our findings robustly demonstrate atypical macroscale function in TLE in a topography that extends beyond mesiotemporal epicenters. INT measurements can assist in TLE diagnosis, seizure focus lateralization, and monitoring of disease progression, which suggests clinical utility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural population dynamics in dorsal premotor cortex underlying a reach decision</a></h4>

              
                We investigated if a dynamical systems approach could help understand the link between decision-related neural activity and decision-making behavior, a fundamentally unresolved problem. The dynamical systems approach posits that neural dynamics can be parameterized by a state equation that has different initial conditions and evolves in time by combining at each time step, recurrent dynamics and inputs. For decisions, the two key predictions of the dynamical systems approach are that 1) initial conditions substantially predict subsequent dynamics and behavior and 2) inputs should combine with initial conditions to lead to different choice-related dynamics. We tested these predictions by investigating neural population dynamics in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of monkeys performing a red-green reaction time (RT) checkerboard discrimination task where we varied the sensory evidence (i.e., the inputs). Prestimulus neural state, a proxy for the initial condition, predicted poststimulus neural trajectories and showed organized covariation with RT. Furthermore, faster RTs were associated with faster pre- and poststimulus dynamics as compared to slower RTs, with these effects observed within a stimulus difficulty. Poststimulus dynamics depended on both the sensory evidence and initial condition, with easier stimuli and "fast" initial conditions leading to the fastest choice-related dynamics whereas harder stimuli and "slow" initial conditions led to the slowest dynamics. Finally, changes in initial condition were related to the outcome of the previous trial, with slower pre- and poststimulus population dynamics and RTs on trials following an error as compared to trials following a correct response. Together these results suggest that decision-related activity in PMd is well described by a dynamical system where inputs combine with initial conditions that covary with eventual RT and previous outcome, to induce decision-related dynamics.

                As the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) regulates both arousal and stress responses. However, how local neuromodulatory inputs contribute to LC function remains unresolved. Here we identify a network of transcriptionally and functionally diverse GABAergic neurons in the LC dendritic field that integrate distant inputs and modulate modes of LC firing to control arousal. We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC and peri-LC cell types. We identify several cell types which underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary approaches in behaving mice. Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons comprise transcriptionally and functionally heterogenous neuronal populations, alongside anatomically segregated features which coordinate specific influences on behavioral arousal and avoidance states. Defining the molecular, cellular and functional diversity in the LC provides a road map for understanding the neurobiological basis of arousal alongside hyperarousal-related neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain dynamics predictive of response to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin therapy for depression has started to show promise, yet the underlying causal mechanisms are not currently known. Here we leveraged the differential outcome in responders and non-responders to psilocybin (10mg and 25mg, 7 days apart) therapy for depression - to gain new insights into regions and networks implicated in the restoration of healthy brain dynamics. We used whole-brain modelling to fit the spatiotemporal brain dynamics at rest in both responders and non-responders before treatment. Dynamic sensitivity analysis of systematic perturbation of these models enabled us to identify specific brain regions implicated in a transition from a depressive brain state to a heathy one. Binarizing the sample into treatment responders (>50% reduction in depressive symptoms) versus non-responders enabled us to identify a subset of regions implicated in this change. Interestingly, these regions correlate with in vivo density maps of serotonin receptors 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A, which psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, has an appreciable affinity for, and where it acts as a full-to-partial agonist. Serotonergic transmission has long been associated with depression and our findings provide causal mechanistic evidence for the role of brain regions in the recovery from depression via psilocybin.

                Contrary to traditional professional sports, there are few standardized metrics in professional esports (competitive multiplayer video games) for assessing a player's skill and ability. To begin to address this, we assessed the performance of professional-level players in Aim Lab, a first-person shooter training and assessment game, within two separate target-shooting tasks. These tasks differed primarily in the relative incentive for fast and imprecise shots versus slow and precise shots. Each player's motor acuity was measured by characterizing the speed-accuracy trade-off in shot behavior: shot frequency and shot spatial error (distance from center of a target). We also characterized the fine-grained kinematics of players' mouse movements. Our findings demonstrate that: 1) movement kinematics depended on task demands; and 2) individual differences in motor acuity were significantly correlated with both kinematics and the number of movements needed to hit a target. We demonstrate the importance of transforming from orientation in the virtual environment to centimeters on the mouse pad, as well as accounting for differences in mouse sensitivity across players, for characterizing human performance in first-person shooter games. This approach to measuring motor acuity has widespread application not only in esports assessment and training, but also in basic (motor psychophysics) and clinical (gamified rehabilitation) research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context and Domain Matter: The Error-Related Negativity in Peer Presence Predicts Fear of Negative Evaluation, not Global Social Anxiety, in Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social anxiety symptoms are most likely to emerge during adolescence, a developmental window marked by heightened concern over peer evaluation. However, the neurocognitive mechanism(s) underlying adolescent social anxiety remain unclear. Emerging work points to the error-related negativity (ERN/{Delta}ERN) as a potential neural marker of exaggerated self/error-monitoring in social anxiety, particularly for errors committed in front of peers. However, social anxiety symptoms are marked by heterogeneity and it remains unclear exactly what domain(s) of social anxiety symptoms are associated with ERN/{Delta}ERN variation in peer presence, particularly within the adolescent period. Methods: To advance and deepen the mechanistic understanding of the ERN/{Delta}ERN's putative role as a neural marker for social anxiety in adolescence, we leveraged a social manipulation procedure and assessed a developmentally-salient domain of social anxiety during adolescence-Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE). Adolescents residing in Hanzhong, a small city in the southwestern region of mainland China, had EEG recorded while performing a flanker task, twice (peer presence/absence); FNE, as well as global social anxiety symptoms were assessed. Results: Overall ERN increases in peer presence. FNE specifically, but not global levels of social anxiety symptoms, predicted {Delta}ERN in peer presence. Conclusions: These data are the first demonstration that the {Delta}ERN relates to a specific domain of social anxiety in adolescents, as well as the first evidence of such relations within a non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) sample. Results have important implications for theory and research into adolescent social anxiety.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synchronous high-amplitude co-fluctuations of functional brain networks during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that functional connectivity can be decomposed into its exact framewise contributions, revealing short-lived, infrequent, and high-amplitude time points referred to as "events." Although events contribute disproportionately to the time-averaged connectivity pattern, improve identifiability and brain-behavior associations, and differences in their expression have been linked to endogenous hormonal fluctuations and autism, their origins remain unclear. Here, we address this question using two independently-acquired imaging datasets in which participants passively watched movies. We find that events synchronize across individuals and based on the level of synchronization, can be categorized into three distinct classes: those that synchronize at the boundaries between movies, those that synchronize during movies, and those that do not synchronize at all. We find that boundary events, compared to the other categories, exhibit greater amplitude, distinct co-fluctuation patterns, and temporal propagation. We show that underlying boundary events is a specific mode of co-fluctuation involving the activation of control and salience systems alongside the deactivation of visual systems. Finally, we find a strong positive relationship between the similarity of time-locked co-fluctuation patterns and the propensity for those time-locked frames to involve synchronous events. In other words, the inter-subject similarity of brain networks during passive movie-watching is strongly related both to the moment in the movie when they occur, and the likelihood that this moment evoked an event. Collectively, our results suggest that the spatiotemporal properties of events during passive movie-watching are non-random and locked to time-varying stimuli.

                While some state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems in computer vision are strikingly accurate models of the corresponding primate visual processing, there are still many discrepancies between these models and the behavior of primates on object recognition tasks. Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model "IT" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing the efficacy of data-driven denoising methods for a multi-echo fMRI acquisition at 7T</a></h4>

              
                In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain the signal is dominated by (physiological) noise. Imaging at ultrahigh field strength is becoming increasingly popular as it offers increased spatial accuracy. The latter is of particular benefit in brainstem neuroimaging given the small cross-sectional area of most nuclei. Physiological noise scales with field strength in fMRI acquisitions, however. Although this problem is in part solved by decreasing voxel size, it is clear that adequate physiological denoising is of utmost importance in brainstem-focused fMRI experiments. Multi-echo sequences have been reported to facilitate highly effective denoising through TE-dependence of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals, in a denoising method referred to as multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA). It has not been explored previously how ME-ICA compares to other data-driven denoising approaches at ultrahigh field strength. In the current study, we compared the efficacy of several denoising methods, including anatomical component based correction (aCompCor), Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA-AROMA), ME-ICA, and a combination of ME-ICA and aCompCor. We assessed several data quality metrics, including temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), delta variation signal (DVARS) and spectral density of the global signal. Moreover, we looked at the ability of each method to uncouple the global signal and respiration. In line with previous reports at lower field strengths, we demonstrate that after applying ME-ICA, the data is best post-processed in order to remove spatially diffuse noise with a method such as aCompCor. Our findings indicate that ME-ICA combined with aCompCor and ICA-AROMA are highly effective denoising approaches for multi-echo data acquired at 7T. ME-ICA combined with aCompCor potentially preserves more signal-of-interest as compared to ICA-AROMA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network predictions sharpen the representation of visual features for categorization</a></h4>

              
                Models of visual cognition assume that brain networks predict the contents of a stimulus to facilitate its subsequent categorization. However, the specific network mechanisms of this facilitation remain unclear. Here, we studied them in 11 individual participants cued to the spatial location (left vs. right) and contents (Low vs. High Spatial Frequency, LSF vs. HSF) of an upcoming Gabor stimulus that they categorized. Using concurrent MEG recordings, we reconstructed in each participant the network that communicates the predicted contents and the network that represents these contents from the stimulus for categorization. We show that predictions of LSF vs. HSF propagate top-down from temporal to contra-lateral occipital cortex, with modulatory supervision from frontal cortex. In occipital cortex, predictions sharpen bottom-up stimulus LSF vs. HSF representations, leading to faster categorizations. Our results therefore reveal functional networks that predict visual contents to sharpen their representations from the stimulus to facilitate categorization behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Packetization improves communication efficiency in brain networks with rapid and cost-effective propagation strategies</a></h4>

              
                Methodological developments in neuroscience and neuroimaging have allowed mapping large-scale networks of white matter structural connections across the whole brain. Many computational studies have built dynamic models of cortical communication processes in these networks to gain insights into generative mechanisms of complex brain functions. When modeling the communication dynamics in brain networks, various approximations have been applied to the manner of cortical signal propagation. For example, existing communication models assume that cortical signals propagate over the network by following, e.g., random walk and shortest path strategies. Recent studies argue that propagation strategies that enable rapid communication but only need a small information cost for reaching the destination are physiologically plausible. Another approximation lies in the assumption of whether cortical signals are packetized or not during propagation (in analogy to packet switching or message switching, respectively, in the context of telecommunications). Most previous models rely on the approximation that message switching is used; however, the plausibility of both switching architectures has not been as extensively studied as that of propagation strategies. To address this issue, we evaluate the plausibility of switching architectures by examining in simulations which of them achieves faster (more efficient) communication in brain networks with the plausible propagation strategies. We performed discrete-event simulations on a macaque brain network and compared the communication efficiency between message switching and packet switching for several propagation strategies. We find that packet switching leads to better communication efficiency when the signals propagate over brain networks under rapid and cost-effective strategies, such as informed and biased versions of random walks. This result suggests that packet switching is more plausible for building brain network communication models. Our study provides novel insights into how to approximate the communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Habitual weekly exercise affects gait adaptation in healthy young adults</a></h4>

              
                Changing movement patterns in response to environmental perturbations is a critical aspect of gait and is related to reducing the energetic cost of the movement. Aerobic exercise improves energetic capacity for submaximal exercise and may affect how people adapt movement to reach an energetic minimum. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in recreational aerobic exercise training influence gait adaptation in healthy young adults. Active (n=19) and Inactive (n=13) young adults walked on a split-belt treadmill with one belt moving twice the speed of the other belt for 10 minutes. Step length asymmetry (SLA) and mechanical work done by each leg were measured over each stride. Nonlinear mixed effects models compared the timecourse of adaptation between Active and Inactive young adults, and t-tests compared net work at the end of adaptation between Active and Inactive young adults. Compared to Inactive young adults, Active young adults initially adapted SLA and positive work by the fast leg quickly, and continued to gradually adapt them over the duration of split-belt treadmill walking. There was no effect of exercise on adaptation of negative work by the fast leg or on net mechanical work. Young adults who regularly participate in aerobic exercise respond more quickly to the onset of a perturbation, and throughout the perturbation they continue to explore movement strategies to reduce energetic cost.

                Cryogenic electron microscopy has revealed unprecedented molecular insight into the conformation of {beta}-sheet-rich protein amyloids linked to neurodegenerative diseases. It remains unknown how a protein can adopt a diversity of folds and form multiple distinct fibrillar structures. Here we develop an in silico alanine scan method to estimate the relative energetic contribution of each amino acid in an amyloid assembly. We apply our method to twenty-seven ex vivo and in vitro fibril structural polymorphs of the microtubule-associated protein tau. We uncover networks of energetically important interactions involving amyloid-forming motifs that stabilize the different fibril folds. We test our predictions in cellular and in vitro aggregation assays. Using a machine learning approach, we classify the structures based on residue energetics to identify distinguishing and unifying features. Our energetic profiling suggests that minimal sequence elements that control the stability of tau fibrils, allowing future design of protein sequences that fold into unique structures.

	<p>Background: A variety of functional disorders can be caused after stroke, among which impairment of respiratory function is a frequent and serious complication of stroke patients. The aim of this study was to examine diaphragmatic function after stroke by diaphragm ultrasonography and then to apply to explore its correlation with extremity motor function and balance function of the hemiplegia patients. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study recruited 48 hemiplegic patients after stroke and 20 matched healthy participants. The data of demographic and ultrasonographic assessment of all healthy subjects were recorded, and 45 patients successfully underwent baseline data assessment in the first 48 h following admission, including post-stroke duration, stroke type, hemiplegia side, pipeline feeding, pulmonary infection, ultrasonographic assessment for diaphragm, Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer Motor Function Assessment Scale (FMA Scale), and Berg Balance Scale assessment. Ultrasonographic assessment parameters included diaphragm mobility under quiet and deep breathing, diaphragm thickness at end-inspiratory and end-expiratory, and calculated thickening fraction of the diaphragm. The aim was to analyze the diaphragm function of hemiplegic patients after stroke and to explore its correlation with extremity motor function and balance function. Results: The incidence of diaphragmatic dysfunction under deep breath was 46.67% in 45 hemiplegia patients after stroke at the convalescent phase. The paralyzed hemidiaphragm had major impairments, and the mobility of the hemiplegic diaphragm was significantly reduced during deep breathing (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, the thickness fraction of hemiplegic side was extremely diminished when contrasted with the healthy control and non-hemiplegic side (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). We respectively compared the diaphragm mobility under deep breath on the hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic side of patients with left and right hemiplegia and found there was no significant difference between the hemiplegic side of right and left hemiplegia (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), but the non-hemiplegic side of right hemiplegia was significantly weaker than that of left hemiplegia patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The diaphragm mobility of stroke patients under quiet breath was positively correlated with age and FMA Scale score (R2 = 0.296, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and significant positive correlations were found between the diaphragm mobility under deep breath and Berg Balance Scale score (R2= 0.11, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), diaphragm thickness at end-inspiratory and FMA Scale score (R2 = 0.152, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and end-expiratory thickness and FMA Scale score (R2 = 0.204, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The mobility and thickness fraction of the hemiplegic diaphragm after stroke by diaphragm ultrasonography were significantly reduced during deep breathing. Diaphragm mobility on bilateral sides of the right hemiplegia patients were reduced during deep breathing. Moreover, the hemiplegic diaphragmatic function was positively correlated with extremity motor and balance function of the hemiplegia patients.</p>

	<p>The surgical methods for treating spasmodic torticollis include the denervation and myotomy (DAM) of the affected muscles and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This study reports on the long-term efficacy, prognostic factors, safety, and hospitalization costs following these two procedures. We collected data from 94 patients with spasmodic torticollis, of whom 41 and 53 were treated with DAM and DBS, respectively, from June 2008 to December 2020 at the Chinese People&amp;amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army General Hospital. We used the Tsui scale and the global outcome score of the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) to evaluate the preoperative and postoperative clinical conditions in all patients. We also determined the costs of hospitalization, prognostic factors, and serious adverse events following the two surgical procedures. The mean follow-up time was 68.83 months (range = 13&amp;amp;ndash;116). Both resection surgery and DBS showed good results in terms of Tsui (Z = &amp;amp;minus;5.103, p = 0.000; Z = &amp;amp;minus;6.210, p = 0.000) and TWSTRS scores (t = 8.762, p = 0.000; Z = &amp;amp;minus;6.308, p = 0.000). Compared with the DAM group, the preoperative (47.71, range 24&amp;amp;ndash;67.25) and postoperative (18.57, range 0&amp;amp;ndash;53) TWSTRS scores in the DBS group were significantly higher (Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.161, p = 0.002). We found no correlation between prognostic factors and patient age, gender, or disease duration for either surgical procedure. However, prognostic factors were related to the length of the postoperative follow-up period in the DBS surgery group (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.068, p = 0.039; Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.287, p = 0.001). The mean hospitalization cost in the DBS group was 6.85 times that found in the resection group (Z = &amp;amp;minus;8.284, p = 0.000). The total complication rate was 4.26%. We found both resection surgery and DBS showed good results in the patients with spasmodic torticollis. Compared with DAM, DBS had a greater improvement in TWSTRS score; however, it was more expensive. Prognostic factors were related to the length of the postoperative follow-up period in patients who underwent DBS surgery.</p>

	<p>Background: Tic disorders (TDs), including Tourette syndrome, are childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics that commonly affect children&amp;amp;rsquo;s physical and mental health. The pathogenesis of TDs may be related to abnormal neurotransmitters in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry, especially dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic neurotransmitters. The purpose of this study was to preliminarily investigate the differences in the three types of neurotransmitters in plasma and urine between children with TD and healthy children. Methods: We collected 94 samples of plasma and 69 samples of urine from 3&amp;amp;ndash;12-year-old Chinese Han children with TD before treatment. The plasma and urine of the same number of healthy Chinese Han children, matched for age and sex, participating in a physical examination, were collected. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the three types of neurotransmitters in the above samples. Results: The plasma levels of norepinephrine, glutamic acid, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid, and the urine levels of normetanephrine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were higher in the TD children than in healthy children. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the above neurotransmitters in plasma and urine analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were all higher than 0.6, with significant differences. Among them, the combined AUC of dopamine, norepinephrine, normetanephrine, glutamic acid, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid in the 8&amp;amp;ndash;12-year-old subgroup was 0.930, and the sensitivity and specificity for TD were 0.821 and 0.974, respectively (p = 0.000). Conclusions: There are differences in plasma and urine neurotransmitters between TD children and healthy children, which lays a foundation for further research on the pathogenesis of TD.</p>

	<p>Hippocampal-sparing radiotherapy (HSR) is a promising approach to alleviate cognitive side effects following cranial radiotherapy. Microstructural brain changes after irradiation have been demonstrated using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). However, evidence is conflicting for certain parameters and anatomic structures. This study examines the effects of radiation on white matter and hippocampal microstructure using DTI and evaluates whether these may be mitigated using HSR. A total of 35 tumor patients undergoing a prospective randomized controlled trial receiving either conventional or HSR underwent DTI before as well as 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 (&amp;amp;plusmn;3) months after radiotherapy. Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Axial Diffusivity (AD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD) were measured in the hippocampus (CA), temporal, and frontal lobe white matter (TL, FL), and corpus callosum (CC). Longitudinal analysis was performed using linear mixed models. Analysis of the entire patient collective demonstrated an overall FACC decrease and RDCC increase compared to baseline in all follow-ups; ADCC decreased after 6 months, and MDCC increased after 12 months (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001, 0.001, 0.007, 0.018). ADTL decreased after 24 and 30 months (p &amp;amp;le; 0.004, 0.009). Hippocampal FA increased after 6 and 12 months, driven by a distinct increase in ADCA and MDCA, with RDCA not increasing until 30 months after radiotherapy (p &amp;amp;le; 0.011, 0.039, 0.005, 0.040, 0.019). Mean radiation dose correlated positively with hippocampal FA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These findings may indicate complex pathophysiological changes in cerebral microstructures after radiation, insufficiently explained by conventional DTI models. Hippocampal microstructure differed between patients undergoing HSR and conventional cranial radiotherapy after 6 months with a higher ADCA in the HSR subgroup (p &amp;amp;le; 0.034).</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The comb-shaped pectines in scorpions are intriguing chemo- and mechanosensory organs. By using neuronal tracer and immunohistochemistry, we focused on the projection areas of mechanosensory pecten hair sensillae afferents in two species, <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. We identified an extensive neuronal pathway, which includes distinct ventral neuropils, multisegmental ascending tracts, contralateral branches, and direct innervation of the third and fourth walking leg neuromeres. These results support the hypothesis that pecten hair sensillae function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Scorpions’ sensory abilities are intriguing, especially the rather enigmatic ventral comb-like chemo- and mechanosensory organs, the so-called pectines. Attached ventrally to the second mesosomal segment just posterior to the coxae of the fourth walking leg pair, the pectines consist of the lamellae, the fulcra, and a variable number of pecten teeth. The latter contain the bimodal peg sensillae, used for probing the substrate with regard to chemo- and mechanosensory cues simultaneously. In addition, the lamellae, the fulcra and the pecten teeth are equipped with pecten hair sensillae (PHS) to gather mechanosensory information. Previously, we have analyzed the neuronal pathway associated with the peg sensillae unraveling their somatotopic projection pattern in dedicated pecten neuropils. Little is known, however, regarding the projections of PHS within the scorpion nervous system. Behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed involvement of PHS in reflexive responses but how the information is integrated remains unresolved. Here, we unravel the innervation pattern of the mechanosensory pecten hair afferents in <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. By using immunofluorescent labeling and injection of Neurobiotin tracer, we identify extensive arborizations of afferents, including (i) ventral neuropils, (ii) somatotopically organized multisegmental sensory tracts, (iii) contralateral branches via commissures, and (iv) direct ipsilateral innervation of walking leg neuromeres 3 and 4. Our results suggest that PHS function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance, mediating accurate pecten teeth alignment to guarantee functionality of pectines, which are involved in fundamental capacities like mating or navigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FMRI complexity correlates with tau-PET in Late-Onset and Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibrillary tangle pathology detected with tau-PET correlates closely with neuronal injury and cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Complexity of rs-fMRI time-series, measured by entropy values, have recently been reported to decrease with aging, APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype and cognitive decline in AD. Here we hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index for tau-related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD process. Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative phase 3 (ADNI3) and the Estudio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Jalisciences (EEAJ) study, including cognitively normal elderly controls, persons with late onset AD (LOAD) and early onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) patients and their relatives. Our cohort consisted of a sample of 147 subjects from ADNI3 and 41 subjects from EEAJ with T1 structural, tau-PET (tracer: 18F-AV1451) and fMRI scans. Correlations between SUVR tau-PET and multi-scale entropy (MSE) were calculated voxel-wise as well as for standard automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas regions while accounting for age, gender, and regional gray matter volume. Potential pathways relating MSE to cognitive function mediated through tau-PET were assessed by path analysis. We found significant negative correlations between low frequency MSE and tau-PET measures in medial temporal lobe, in both ADNI3 and EEAJ cohorts. Furthermore, low frequency MSE showed significant associations with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Mini-Mental State Status Exam (MMSE) scores in both ADNI3 and EEAJ cohorts, which were largely mediated through the tau-PET signal. Correlations of MSE with tau-PET in temporal lobes support our hypothesis that the complexity of rs-fMRI is associated with regional tau protein accumulation. Furthermore, the association of MSE with CDR and MMSE, mediated by tau-PET, in disease relevant areas suggests that a reduction in MSE is indicative of decreased information processing capacity and cognitive decline in AD processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">WiChR, a highly potassium selective channelrhodopsin for low-light two-photon neuronal inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The electric excitability of muscle, heart and brain tissue relies on the precise interplay of Na+- and K+-selective ion channels. The involved ion fluxes are controlled in optogenetic studies using light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs). While non-selective cation-conducting ChRs are well-established for excitation, K+-selective ChRs (KCRs) for efficient inhibition have only recently come into reach. Here, we report the molecular analysis of recently discovered KCRs from the stramenopile Hyphochytrium catenoides and identify a novel type of hydrophobic K+-selectivity filter. Next, we demonstrate that the KCR signature motif is conserved in related stramenopile ChRs. Among them, WiChR from Wobblia lunata features an unmatched 80-fold preference for K+ over Na+, stable photocurrents under continuous illumination and a prolonged open state lifetime. Well expressed in neurons, WiChR allows two-photon inhibition at low irradiance and reduced tissue heating, recommending WiChR as the long-awaited efficient and versatile optogenetic inhibitor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Action inhibition revisited: Stopping is not faster than going</a></h4>

              
                We often need to swiftly abort a prepared response at the last moment before it is initiated. Our ability to abort a planned response is thought to be a fundamental facet of action control that is distinguished by its rapid speed, and is enabled by a specialized neural mechanism. This narrative has, however, largely been established based on experiments in which there is much greater urgency to abort an action than there is to generate an action. Here, we demonstrate that, under conditions of matched urgency, the speed at which participants are able to abort an action is comparable to the speed at which they can initiate an action. Our results challenge the prevailing view that stopping behaviors have a privileged status. We suggest, instead, that action initiation may often be systematically delayed to allow time to abort an action if needed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oligodendrocyte-mediated Myelin Plasticity and its role in Neural Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                Temporal synchrony of signals arriving from different neurons or brain regions is essential for proper neural processing. Nevertheless, it is not well understood how such synchrony is achieved and maintained in a complex network of time-delayed neural interactions. Myelin plasticity has been suggested as an efficient mechanism for controlling timing in brain communications through adaptive changes of axonal conduction velocity and consequently conduction time delays, or latencies; however, local rules and feedback mechanisms that oligodendrocytes (OL) use to achieve synchronization are not known. We propose a mathematical model of oligodendrocyte-mediated myelin plasticity (OMP) in which OL play an active role in providing such feedback. This is achieved without using arrival times at the synapse or modulatory signaling from astrocytes; instead, it relies on the presence of global and transient OL responses to local action potentials in the axons they myelinate. While inspired by OL morphology, we provide the theoretical underpinnings that motivated the model and explore its performance for a wide range of its parameters. Our results indicate that when the characteristic time of OL's spike responses is between 10 and 40 ms and the firing rates in individual axons are relatively low (< 10 Hz), the OMP model efficiently synchronizes correlated and time-locked signals while latencies in axons carrying independent signals are unaffected. This suggests a novel form of selective synchronization in the CNS in which oligodendrocytes play an active role by modulating the conduction delays of correlated spike trains as they traverse to their targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter for Neuronal State and Parameter Estimation</a></h4>

              
                Data assimilation techniques for state and parameter estimation are frequently applied in the context of computational neuroscience. In this work, we show how an adaptive variant of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) performs on the tracking of a conductance-based neuron model. Unlike standard recursive filter implementations, the robust adaptive unscented Kalman filter (RAUKF) jointly estimates the states and parameters of the neuronal model while adjusting noise covariance matrices online based on innovation and residual information. We benchmark the adaptive filter's performance against existing nonlinear Kalman filters and explore the sensitivity of the filter parameters to the system being modelled. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution, we simulate practical settings that challenge tracking performance, such as a model mismatch and measurement faults. Compared to standard variants of the Kalman filter the adaptive variant implemented here is more accurate and robust to faults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapses, predictions, and prediction errors: a neocortical computational study of MDD using the temporal memory algorithm of HTM.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synapses and spines are central in major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology, recently highlighted by ketamine's and psilocybin's rapid antidepressant effects. The Bayesian brain and interoception perspectives formalize MDD as being "stuck" in affective states constantly predicting negative energy balance. We examined how synaptic atrophy relates to the predictive function of the neocortex and thus to symptoms, using temporal memory (TM), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. TM represents a single neocortical layer, learns in real-time using local Hebbian-learning rules, and extracts and predicts temporal sequences. Methods: We trained a TM model on random sequences of upper-case alphabetical letters, representing sequences of affective states. To model depression, we progressively destroyed synapses in the TM model and examined how that affected the predictive capacity of the network. Results: Destroying 50% of the synapses slightly reduced the number of predictions, followed by a marked drop with further destruction. However, reducing the synapses by 25% distinctly dropped the confidence in the predictions. So even though the network was making accurate predictions, the network was no longer confident about these predictions. Conclusions: These findings explain how interoceptive cortices could be stuck in limited affective states with high prediction error. Growth of new synapses, e.g., with ketamine and psilocybin, would allow representing more futuristic predictions with higher confidence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the TM model to connect changes happening at synaptic levels to the Bayesian formulation of psychiatric symptomatology, making it possible to understand treatment mechanisms and possibly, develop new treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoupling of interacting neuronal populations by time-shifted stimulation through spike-timing-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The synaptic organization of the brain is constantly modified by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In several neurological disorders, abnormal neuronal activity and pathological synaptic connectivity may significantly impair normal brain function. Reorganization of neuronal circuits by therapeutic stimulation has the potential to restore normal brain dynamics. Increasing evidence suggests that the temporal stimulation pattern crucially determines the long-lasting therapeutic effects of stimulation. Here, we tested whether a specific pattern of brain stimulations can enable the suppression of pathologically strong inter-population synaptic connectivity through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). More specifically, we tested how introducing a time shift between stimuli delivered to two interacting populations of neurons can effectively decouple them. To that end, we first used a tractable model, i.e., two bidirectionally coupled leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, to theoretically analyze the optimal range of stimulation frequency and time shift for decoupling. We then extended our results to two reciprocally connected neuronal populations (modules) where inter-population delayed connections were modified by STDP. As predicted by the theoretical results, appropriately time-shifted stimulation causes a decoupling of the two-module system through STDP, i.e., by unlearning pathologically strong synaptic interactions between the two populations. Based on the overall topology of the connections, the decoupling of the two modules, in turn, causes a desynchronization of the populations that outlasts the cessation of stimulation. Decoupling effects of the time-shifted stimulation can be realized by time-shifted burst stimulation as well as time-shifted continuous simulation. Our results provide insight into the further optimization of a variety of multichannel stimulation protocols aiming at a therapeutic reshaping of diseased brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech-In-Noise Comprehension is Improved When Viewing a Deep-Neural-Network-Generated Talking Face</a></h4>

              
                Listening in a noisy environment is challenging, but many previous studies have demonstrated that comprehension of speech can be substantially improved by looking at the talker's face. We recently developed a deep neural network (DNN) based system that generates movies of a talking face from speech audio and a single face image. In this study, we aimed to quantify the benefits that such a system can bring to speech comprehension, especially in noise. The target speech audio was masked with signal to noise ratios of -9, -6, -3, and 0 dB and was presented to subjects in three audio-visual (AV) stimulus conditions: 1) synthesized AV: audio with the synthesized talking face movie; 2) natural AV: audio with the original movie from the corpus; and 3) audio-only: audio with a static image of the talker. Subjects were asked to type the sentences they heard in each trial and keyword recognition was quantified for each condition. Overall, performance in the synthesized AV condition fell approximately halfway between the other two conditions, showing a marked improvement over the audio-only control but still falling short of the natural AV condition. Every subject showed some benefit from the synthetic AV stimulus. The results of this study support the idea that a DNN-based model that generates a talking face from speech audio can meaningfully enhance comprehension in noisy environments, and has the potential to be used as a "visual hearing aid."

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent decline and recovery of synaptic transmission in central parts of surviving primary afferents after their peripheral cut.</a></h4>

              
                Whereas axons deprived of their nucleus degenerate within a few days in Mammals, they survive for several months in Crustacean. However, it is not known if central synapses from sensory axons may preserve their molecular machinery in the absence of spiking activity, after peripheral axotomy, which suppress their nucleus. Using electrophysiology techniques and electron microscopy imaging we report that 1) Electron microscopy analysis confirms previous observations that glial cell nucleus present in sensory nerve, proliferate an migrate to axon tubes, in which they form close contact with surviving axons; 2) after peripheral axotomy performed in vivo on Coxo-Basipodite chordotonal organ (CBCO) sensory nerve does not convey any sensory message, but antidromic volleys are observed; 3) Central synaptic transmission to motoneurons (MNs) progressively declines over #200 days (90% of monosynaptic excitatory transmission is lost after 3 weeks, whereas 60% of polysynaptic inhibitory transmission persist up to 6 months). After #200 days no transmission is observed anymore; 4) However, this total loss is only apparent, because repetitive electrical stimulation of the sensory nerve in vitro progressively restores first inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) then excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs); 5) The loss of synaptic transmission can be prevented by in vivo chronic sensory nerve stimulation; 6) Using simulations based on the geometric arrangements of synapses of the monosynaptic excitatory transmission and disynaptic inhibitory pathways, we have shown that antidromic activity in CBCO nerve could play a role in maintenance of synaptic function of inhibitory pathways to MNs, but not on monosynaptic excitatory transmission to MNs. Taken together, our study confirms the key role of glial nucleus in axon survival, that machinery for spike conduction and synaptic release even if no activity is present for several months. After long silence periods (>6 months) spike conduction and synaptic function can still be restored by electrical activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Helping can be driven by non-affective cues in rat</a></h4>

              
                Helping another in distress can be motivated by either affective or cognitive empathy, with the latter commonly believed to be restricted to humans and possibly other apes. Here, we found evidence for rodent helping that occurs in the absence of affective cues. We employed a paradigm in which a free rat can open the door to a restrainer containing a trapped rat. When the trapped rat was treated with the anxiolytic midazolam, the helping behavior exhibited by the free rat was diminished but did not extinguish. Correspondingly, midazolam-treated trapped rats still released themselves when given the opportunity, albeit at longer latencies than controls, evidence that midazolam only partially reduced the distress experienced by trapped rats. To test whether helping could occur for a rat who exhibited no affect, trapped rats were immobilized by general anesthesia or heavy sedation. Surprisingly, rats opened the door to restrainers containing these immobilized rats and pulled the incapacitated rats out of the restrainer, pushing them away from the arena center. The same solicitous behavior was observed when an anesthetized rat was simply placed in the center of the arena, without being confined within a restrainer. We speculate that the cognitive dissonance of immobile rats, at odds with predictive expectations of rat behavior built up over a lifetime, motivated solicitous behavior including helping. To block affective behavioral displays without associated dissonant cues of immobility, metyrapone, a drug that selectively blocks corticosterone synthesis, was administered to trapped rats. Under such circumstances, little helping behavior occurred. In sum, rats may be motivated either by affect or by cognitive dissonance, the latter comprising a rudimentary form of cognitive empathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decision-making processes in perceptual learning depend on effectors</a></h4>

              
                Visual perceptual learning is traditionally thought to arise in visual cortex. However, typical perceptual learning tasks also involve systematic mapping of visual information onto motor actions. Because the motor system contains both effector-specific and effector-unspecific representations, the question arises whether visual perceptual learning is effector-specific itself, or not. Here, we study this question in an orientation discrimination task. Subjects learn to indicate their choices either with joystick movements or with manual reaches. After training, we challenge them to perform the same task with eye movements. We dissect the decision-making process using the drift diffusion model. We find that learning effects on the rate of evidence accumulation and the decision criteria depend on effectors, albeit not fully. This suggests that during perceptual learning, visual information is mapped onto effector-specific integrators. Overlap of the populations of neurons encoding motor plans for these effectors may explain partial generalization. Taken together, visual perceptual learning is not limited to visual cortex, but also affects sensorimotor mapping at the interface of visual processing and decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the efficacy of multi-echo ICA denoising on model-based fMRI</a></h4>

              
                fMRI is an indispensable tool for neuroscience investigation, but this technique is limited by multiple sources of physiological and measurement noise. These noise sources are particularly problematic for analysis techniques that require high signal-to-noise ratio for stable model fitting, such as voxel-wise modeling. Multi-echo data acquisition in combination with echo-time dependent ICA denoising (ME-ICA) represents one promising strategy to mitigate physiological and hardware-related noise sources as well as motion-related artifacts. However, most studies employing ME-ICA to date are resting-state fMRI studies, and therefore we have a limited understanding of the impact of ME-ICA on task or model-based fMRI paradigms. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by comparing data quality and model fitting performance on data acquired during a visual population receptive field (pRF) mapping paradigm (N=13 participants) after using one of three preprocessing procedures: ME-ICA, optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising, and typical single echo processing. As expected, multi-echo fMRI improved temporal signal-to-noise compared to single echo fMRI, with ME-ICA amplifying the improvement compared to optimal combination alone. However, unexpectedly, this boost in temporal signal-to-noise did not directly translate to improved model fitting performance: compared to single echo acquisition, model fitting was only improved after ICA-denoising. Specifically, compared to single echo acquisition, ME-ICA resulted in improved variance explained by our pRF model throughout the visual system, including anterior regions of the temporal and parietal lobes where SNR is typically low, while optimal combination without ICA did not. ME-ICA also improved reliability of parameter estimates compared to single echo and optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising. Collectively, these results suggest that ME-ICA is effective for denoising task-based fMRI data for modeling analyses and maintains the integrity of the original data. Therefore, ME-ICA may be beneficial for complex fMRI experiments, including task fMRI studies, voxel-wise modeling, and naturalistic paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mean-field approximations with adaptive coupling for networks with spike-timing-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the effect of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is key to elucidate how neural networks change over long timescales and to design interventions aimed at modulating such networks in neurological disorders. However, progress is restricted by the significant computational cost associated with simulating neural network models with STDP, and by the lack of low-dimensional description that could provide analytical insights. To approximate STDP in phase oscillator networks, simpler phase-difference-dependent plasticity (PDDP) rules have been developed, which prescribe synaptic changes based on phase differences of neuron pairs rather than differences in spike timing. Here we construct mean-field approximations for phase oscillator networks with STDP to describe the dynamics of large networks of adaptive oscillators. We first show that single-harmonic PDDP rules can approximate a simple form of symmetric STDP, while multi-harmonic rules are required to accurately approximate causal STDP. We then derive exact expressions for the evolution of the average PDDP coupling weight in terms of network synchrony. For adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators that form clusters, we formulate a low-dimensional description based on mean field dynamics and average coupling weight. Finally, we show that such a two-cluster mean-field model can be fitted to provide a low-dimensional approximation of a full adaptive network with symmetric STDP. Our framework represents a step towards a low-dimensional description of adaptive networks with STDP, and could for example inform the development of new therapies aimed at maximizing the long-lasting effects of brain stimulation.

                Homeostatic challenges increase the drive for social interaction. The neural activity that prompts this motivation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify direct projections from hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) to the cortico-amygdalar nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT). Dual in situ hybridization (DISH) with probes for PACAP, and VGLUT1, VGLUT2, V1a and V1b revealed a population of vasopressin-receptive PACAPergic neurons in NLOT layer 2 (NLOT2). Water deprivation (48 hours, WD48) increased sociability compared to euhydrated subjects, assessed with the three-chamber social interaction test (3CST). Fos expression immunohistochemistry showed NLOT and its main efferent regions had further increases in rats subjected to WD48+3CST. These regions strongly expressed PAC1 mRNA. Microinjections of AVP into NLOT produced similar changes in sociability to water deprivation, and these were reduced by co-injection of V1a or V1b antagonists along with AVP. We conclude that during challenge to water homeostasis, there is a recruitment of a glutamatergic-multi-peptidergic cooperative circuit that promotes social behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulating hierarchical learning by high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation at theta frequency</a></h4>

              
                Considerable evidence highlights the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a key region for hierarchical learning. In a previous electroencephalography (EEG) study we found that the low level precision weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) were encoded by frontal theta oscillations, centered on F4 corresponding to right DLPFC (rDLPFC). However, the causal relationship between frontal theta oscillations and hierarchical learning remains poorly understood. To investigate this question, in the current study, participants received theta (6Hz) and sham high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation over the rDLPFC, while performing the probabilistic reversal learning task. Behaviorally, theta tACS induced a significant reduction in accuracy for the stable environment, but not for the volatile environment, relative to the sham condition. Computationally, we implemented a combination of a hierarchical Bayesian learning and a decision model. Theta tACS induced a significant increase in low level (i.e., probability) learning rate and uncertainty of low level estimation relative to sham condition. Instead, the temperature parameter of the decision model was not significantly altered due to theta stimulation. These results indicate that theta frequency may modulate the (low level) learning rate. Furthermore, environmental features (e.g., its stability) may determine whether learning is optimized as a result.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural spine plasticity: learning and forgetting of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Learning to discriminate between different sensory stimuli is essential for survival. In rodents, the olfactory bulb, which contributes to odor discrimination via pattern separation, exhibits extensive structural synaptic plasticity involving the formation and removal of synaptic spines, even in adult animals. The network connectivity resulting from this plasticity is still poorly understood. To gain insight into this connectivity we present here a computational model for the structural plasticity of the reciprocal synapses between the dominant population of excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. It incorporates the observed modulation of spine stability by odor exposure. The model captures the striking experimental observation that the exposure to odors does not always enhance their discriminability: while training with similar odors enhanced their discriminability, training with dissimilar odors actually reduced the discriminability of the training stimuli (Chu et al, 2016). Strikingly, this differential learning does not require the activity-dependence of the spine stability and occurs also in a model with purely random spine dynamics in which the spine density is changed homogeneously, e.g., due to a global signal. However, the experimentally observed odor-specific reduction in the response of principal cells as a result of extended odor exposure (Kato et al. 2012) and the concurrent disinhibition of a subset of principal cells arise only in the activity-dependent model. Moreover, this model predicts the experimentally testable recovery of odor response through weak but not through strong odor re-exposure and the forgetting of odors via exposure to interfering odors. Combined with the experimental observations, the computational model provides strong support for the prediction that odor exposure leads to the formation of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb. div.standard { margin-bottom: 2ex; }

                A critical step in neural information processing is the transformation of membrane voltage into calcium signals leading to transmitter release. However, the effect of voltage to calcium transformation on neural responses to different sensory stimuli is not well understood. Here, we use in vivo two-photon imaging of genetically encoded voltage and calcium indicators, Arclight and GCaMP6f respectively, to measure responses in Drosophila direction-selective T4 neurons. Comparison between Arclight and GCaMP6f signals revealed calcium signals to have a significantly higher direction selectivity compared to voltage signals. Using these recordings we build a model which transforms T4 voltage responses to calcium responses. The model reproduces experimentally measured calcium responses across different visual stimuli using different temporal filtering steps and a stationary non-linearity. These findings provide a mechanistic underpinning of the voltage-to-calcium transformation and show how this processing step, in addition to synaptic mechanisms on the dendrites of T4 cells, enhances direction selectivity in the output signal of T4 neurons.

                EEG signals exhibit commonality and variability across subjects, sessions, and tasks. But most existing EEG studies focus on mean group effects (commonality) by averaging signals over trials and subjects. The substantial intra- and inter-subject variability of EEG has often been overlooked. The recently significant technological advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, have brought technological innovations to EEG signal application in many aspects, but there are still great challenges in cross-session, cross-task, and cross-subject EEG decoding. In this work, an EEG-based biometric competition based on a large-scale M3CV (A Multi-subject, Multi-session, and Multi-task Database for investigation of EEG Commonality and Variability) database was launched to better characterize and harness the intra- and inter-subject variability and promote the development of machine learning algorithm in this field. In the M3CV database, EEG signals were recorded from 106 subjects, of which 95 subjects repeated two sessions of the experiments on different days. The whole experiment consisted of 6 paradigms, including resting-state, transient-state sensory, steady-state sensory, cognitive oddball, motor execution, and steady-state sensory with selective attention with 14 types of EEG signals, 120,000 epochs. With the learning tasks of the identification and verification, the performance metrics and baseline methods were introduced in the competition. In general, the proposed M3CV dataset and the EEG-based biometric competition aim to provide the opportunity to develop advanced machine learning algorithms for achieving an in-depth understanding of the commonality and variability of EEG signals across subjects, sessions, and tasks.

                Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main components of cannabis, is generally considered safe, despite the lack of studies on the possible consequences of its consumption during critical periods of neurodevelopment, including prenatal life. Although CBD crosses the placenta and its use during pregnancy is steadily increasing, the impact of gestational CBD exposure on early life is unknown. Here, we combined behavioral exploration and deep learning to assess how in utero exposure to low doses of CBD alters pre-weaning behaviors in mouse pups of both sexes. The data reveal that pups from CBD-treated dams exhibit sex-specific alterations in weight growth, homing behavior, and the syllabic repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations. Thus, prenatal CBD is associated with alterations in innate behavioral responses and communication skills.

                Temporal associations between sensory stimuli separated in time rely on the interaction between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, it is not known how changes in their neural activity support the emergence of temporal association learning. Here, we use simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampal CA1 region and mPFC of mice to elucidate the neural dynamics underlying memory formation in an auditory trace conditioning task. We found that in both areas conditioned (CS+/CS-) and unconditioned stimuli (US) evoked similar temporal sequences of neural responses that progressively diverged during learning. Additionally, persistent CS representations emerged in mPFC after learning, supported by CS+ coding states whose transient reactivation reliably predicted lick onset and behavioral performance on single trials. These results show that coordination of temporal sequences in CA1 and persistent activity in mPFC may underlie temporal association learning, and that transient reactivations of engrams in mPFC predict the animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving Memory via Automated Targeted Memory Reactivation during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                A widely accepted view in memory research is that previously acquired information can be reactivated during sleep, leading to persistent memory storage. Recently, Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) has been developed as a technique whereby specific memories can be reactivated during sleep using a sensory stimulus linked to prior learning. TMR can improve various types of memory, raising the possibility that it may be useful for cognitive enhancement and clinical therapy. A major challenge for the expanded use of TMR is that experimenters must manually control stimulation timing and intensity, which is impractical in most settings. To address this limitation, we developed the SleepStim system for automated TMR in the home environment. SleepStim includes a smartwatch to collect movement and heart-rate data, plus a smartphone to emit auditory cues. A machine-learning model identifies periods of deep non-REM sleep and triggers TMR sounds within these periods. We tested whether this system could replicate the spatial-memory benefit of in-lab TMR. Participants learned the locations of objects on a grid, and then half of the object locations were reactivated during sleep over three nights. In an experiment with 61 participants, the TMR effect was nonsignificant but varied systematically with stimulus intensity; low-intensity but not high-intensity stimuli produced memory benefits. In a second experiment with 24 participants, we limited stimulus intensity and found that TMR reliably improved spatial memory, consistent with effects observed in laboratory studies. We conclude that SleepStim can effectively accomplish automated TMR and that avoiding sleep disruption is critical for TMR benefits.

                The fine control of synaptic function requires robust trans-synaptic molecular interactions. However, it remains poorly understood how the landscape of trans-synaptic bridges dynamically remodels to reflect functional states of the synapse. Here we developed novel optical tools to visualize in firing synapses the molecular behavior of a particular secreted trans-synaptic protein, LGI1, and its presynaptic receptor, ADAM23, and discovered that neuronal activity acutely rearranges the abundance of these proteins at the synaptic cleft. Surprisingly, LGI1 in synapses was not secreted, as described elsewhere, but exo- and endocytosed through its interaction with ADAM23. Activity-driven translocation of LGI1 facilitated the formation of trans-synaptic connections proportionally to the history of activity of the synapse, modulating excitatory transmission correlatively to synaptic firing rates. Thus, our findings reveal that LGI1 abundance at the synaptic cleft can be acutely remodeled and serves as critical point of activity-dependent control of synaptic function.

                The highly conserved GTPase Cdc42 is an essential regulator of cell polarity and promotes exocytosis through the exocyst complex in budding yeast and Drosophila. In mammals, this function is performed by the closely related GTPase TC10 while mammalian Cdc42 does not interact with the exocyst. Axon formation is facilitated by the exocyst complex that tethers vesicles prior to their fusion to expand the plasma membrane. This function depends on the recruitment of the Exo70 subunit to the plasma membrane. Alternative splicing generates two Cdc42 isoforms that differ in their C-terminal 10 amino acids. Our results identify an isoform-specific function of Cdc42 in neurons. We show that the brain-specific Cdc42b isoform, in contrast to the ubiquitous isoform Cdc42u, can interact with Exo70. Cdc42b regulates exocytosis and axon formation downstream of its activator Arhgef7. Thus, the function of Cdc42 in regulating exocytosis is conserved in mammals but specific to one isoform.

                Objective: To test the hypothesis that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 250 and 500Hz occur in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Experiments were conducted in three mouse models of AD: Tg2576 mice (n=9) that overexpress the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 2 knock-out (PS2KO) mice (n=8), and the Ts65Dn model of Down's syndrome (n=9). We recorded HFOs using wideband (0.1-500Hz, 2kHz) intra-hippocampal and cortical surface EEG at 1month until 24months of age during wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG was also recorded using the intra-hippocampal kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epilepsy to compare HFOs in AD and epilepsy models. Interictal spikes (IIS) and seizures in the AD models were also analyzed for the possible presence of HFOs. Results: We describe for the first time hippocampal and cortical HFOs as a new EEG abnormality in AD mouse models. HFOs occurred in all transgenic mice and but no controls (p<0.05). HFOs were most frequent during SWS (vs. REM or wakefulness, p<0.05). HFOs in the AD and epilepsy models were indistinguishable in both spectral frequency and duration (p>0.05). HFOs also occurred during IIS and seizures in the AD models, although with altered spectral properties compared to isolated HFOs (p<0.05). Interpretation: Our data demonstrate a new EEG biomarker in AD mouse models which is detectable from the scalp and thus amenable to non-invasive detection in people at risk for AD.

                The hippocampus is thought to guide navigation and has an essential contribution to learning and memory. Hippocampus is one of the brain regions impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease with progressive memory impairments and cognitive decline. Although successful treatments for AD are still not available, developing new strategies to detect AD at early stages before clinical manifestation is crucial for timely interventions. Here, we investigated in the TgF344-AD rat model the classification of AD-transgenic rats versus Wild-type littermates (WT) from electrophysiological activity recorded in the hippocampus of freely moving subjects at an early, pre-symptomatic stage of the disease (6 months old). To this end, recorded signals were filtered in two separate frequency regimes namely low frequency LFP signals and high frequency spiking activity and passed to machine learning (ML) classifiers to identify the genotype of the rats (TG vs. WT). For the low frequency analysis, we first filtered the signals and extracted the power spectra in different frequency bands known to carry differential information in the hippocampus (delta, theta, slow- and fast-gamma) while for the high frequency analysis, we extracted spike-trains of neurons and calculated different distance metrics between them, including Van Rossum (VR), Inter Spike Interval (ISI), and Event Synchronization (ES). These measures were then used as features for classification with different ML classifiers. We found that both low and high frequency signals were able to classify the rat genotype with a high accuracy with specific signals such as the gamma band power, providing an important fraction of information. In addition, when we combined information from both low and high frequency the classification was boosted indicating that independent information is present across the two bands. The results of this study offer a better insight into how different regions of the hippocampus are affected in earlier stages of AD.

                Purpose: A supervised deep learning (DL) approach for frequency-and-phase Correction (FPC) of MR spectroscopy (MRS) data recently showed encouraging results, but obtaining transients with labels for supervised learning is challenging. This work investigates the feasibility and efficiency of unsupervised DL-based FPC. Method: Two novel DL-based FPC methods (deep learning-based Cr referencing [dCrR] and deep learning-based spectral registration [dSR]) which use a priori physics domain knowledge are presented. The proposed networks were trained, validated, and evaluated using simulated, phantom, and publicly accessible in-vivo MEGA-edited MRS data. The performance of our proposed FPC methods was compared to other generally used FPC methods, in terms of precision and time efficiency. A new measure was proposed in this study to evaluate the FPC method performance. The ability of each of our methods to carry out FPC at varying SNR levels was evaluated. A Monte Carlo (MC) study was carried out to investigate the performance of our proposed methods. Result: The validation using low-SNR manipulated simulated data demonstrated that the proposed methods could perform FPC comparably to other methods. The evaluation showed that the dCrR method achieved the highest performance in phantom data. The applicability of the proposed method for FPC of GABA-edited in-vivo MRS data was demonstrated. Our proposed networks have the potential to reduce computation time significantly. Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed deep neural networks trained in an unsupervised manner with complex data can offer efficient FPC of MRS data in a shorter time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Event-Related Potentials of Single Sided Deaf Cochlear Implant Users - Using a Semantic Oddball Paradigm in Noise</a></h4>

              
                Objective: In individuals with single sided deafness (SSD), which is characterised by a profound hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear, binaural input is no longer present. A cochlear implant (CI) is the only way to restore functional hearing in the profoundly deaf ear, with previous literature demonstrating improvements in speech in noise intelligibility with the provision of a CI. However, we currently have a limited understanding of the neural processes involved (e.g., how the brain integrates the electrical signal produced by the CI with the acoustic signal produced by the normal hearing ear) and how the modulation of these processes with CI contributes to improved speech in noise intelligibility. Using a semantic oddball paradigm presented in the presence of background noise, this study aims to investigate how the provision of CI impacts speech in noise perception of SSD CI users. Method: High density electroencephalography (EEG) from twelve SSD-CI participants was recorded whilst they completed a semantic acoustic oddball task. All participants completed the oddball task in three different free field conditions with the speech and noise coming from different speakers. The three tasks were 1) with the CI-On in background noise, 2) with the CI-Off in background noise and 3) with the CI-On without background noise (Control). We examined task-performance (RT, subjective listening effort, and accuracy) and measured N2N4 and P3b event-related brain potentials (ERPs) linked to the discrimination and evaluation of task relevant stimuli. Speech in noise and sound localisation abilities was also measured. Results: Reaction time was significantly different between all tasks with CI-On (M(SE) = 809(39.9) ms) having faster RTs than CI-Off (M(SE) = 845(39.9) ms) and Control (M(SE) = 785(39.9) ms) being the fastest condition. The Control condition exhibited a significantly shorter N2N4 and P3b area latency when compared to the other two conditions. However, despite these differences noticed in RTs and area latency, we observed similar results between all three conditions for N2N4 and P3b difference area. Conclusion: The inconsistency between the behavioural and neural results suggest that EEG may not be a reliable measure of cognitive effort. This rationale is further supported by the different explanations used in past studies to explain N2N4 and P3b effects. Future studies should look to alternative measures of auditory processing (e.g., pupillometry) to get a deeper understanding of the underlying auditory processes that facilitate speech in noise intelligibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subthalamic stimulation evoked cortical responses relate to motor performance in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Subthalamic deep brain stimulation is effective in alleviating motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Establishing the clinically best stimulation settings often requires time-consuming test sessions and creates a need for biomarkers to optimize this process. While stimulation-evoked cortical responses have been proposed as such a neurophysiological marker, their relationship to motor performance has not yet been studied systematically. For this aim, we recorded finger-tapping movements and cortical responses evoked by different stimulation amplitudes of 22 patients with Parkinson's disease using magnetoencephalography. The motor cortex amplitude was a significant predictor of a higher finger tap frequency and a more regular tapping profile. In addition, subthalamic stimulation evoked responses in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus, and the supplementary motor area. While earlier studies relied on a limited cortical coverage, we reveal a cortical distribution of responses that aligns with the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network. Our study sheds light on the relationship between cortical responses evoked by subthalamic stimulation and motor performance based on objective quantitative parameters. Stimulation-evoked responses could guide clinical programming in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Machine Learning Electroencephalography Biomarkers Predictive of Epworth Sleepiness Scale</a></h4>

              
                Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) causes difficulty in concentrating and continuous fatigue during the day. In a clinical setting, the assessment and diagnosis of EDS relies mostly on subjective questionnaires and verbal reports, which compromises the effectiveness of available therapies. In this study, we used a computational pipeline for the automated, rapid, high-throughput and objective analysis of retrospective encephalography (EEG) data to develop objective, surrogate biomarkers for EDS, thereby defining the quantitative EEG changes in individuals with High Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (n=31), compared to a group of individuals with Low ESS (n=41) at Cleveland Clinic. Signal processing of EEG showed significantly different EEG features in the Low ESS group compared to High ESS, including power enhancement in the alpha and beta bands, and attenuation in the delta and theta bands. Moreover, machine learning algorithms trained on the binary classification of High vs Low ESS reached >80% accuracy. These results demonstrate that EEG data contain information in the form of rhythmic activity that could be leveraged for the quantitative assessment of EDS using machine learning.

     alt="[18F]FDG brain uptake of C57Bl/6 male mice is affected by locomotor activity after cocaine use: A small animal positron emission tomography study"/>
<p>Cocaine effects on brain glucose metabolism were evaluated in three different situations: after maintaining animals in a home cage; exposing them to open field; keeping them under anesthesia. When performing brain PET scanning, locomotor activity induced by cocaine might be a relevant factor, as in animals under anesthesia an acute cocaine injection induced higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake. This is not seen when animals are left awake to experience the locomotor stimulant effect of the drug.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We verified if cocaine-induced peripheral activation might disrupt [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake after a cocaine challenge and suggested an optimal protocol to measure cocaine-induced brain metabolic alterations in mice. C57Bl/6 male mice were injected with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and randomly separated into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were kept conscious after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration and after 5 min received saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg). The animals in group 1 (<i>n</i> = 5) were then evaluated in the open field for 30 min and those from group 2 (<i>n</i> = 6) were kept alone in a home cage for the same period. Forty-five minutes after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration, images were acquired for 30 min. Group 3 (<i>n</i> = 6) was kept anesthetized and image acquisition started immediately after tracer injection, for 75 min. Saline (Day 1) or cocaine (Day 2) was injected 5 min after starting acquisition. Another set of animals (<i>n</i> = 5) were treated with cocaine every other day for 10 days or saline (<i>n</i> = 6) and were scanned with the dynamic protocol to verify its efficacy. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake increased after cocaine administration when compared to baseline only in animals kept under anesthesia. No brain effect of cocaine was observed in animals submitted to the open field or kept in the home cage. The use of anesthesia is essential to visualize cocaine-induced changes in brain metabolism by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, providing an interesting preclinical approach to investigate naïve subjects and enabling a bidirectional translational science approach for better understanding of cocaine use disorder.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 5′-UTR of <i>LRP12</i>, <i>GIPC1</i>, and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> are associated with OPDM. Despite these advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in two unrelated Chinese Han families.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Parametric linkage analysis was performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> was identified in six OPDM patients from two families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the <i>RILPL1</i> locus in unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples showed no significant differences in <i>RILPL1</i> mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated <i>RILPL1</i> transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional transcription from the <i>RILPL1</i> locus. Finally, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> as a novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Fetal-neonatal iron deficiency (ID) causes long-term neurocognitive and affective dysfunctions. Clinical and preclinical studies showed that early-life ID produced sex-specific effects. However, little is known about molecular mechanisms behind the sex-specific effects of early-life ID on neural gene regulation. Objective: To illustrate sex-specific transcriptome alteration in adult rat hippocampus induced by fetal-neonatal ID and prenatal choline treatment. Methods: Pregnant rats were fed iron-deficient (4 mg/kg Fe) or iron-sufficient (200 mg/kg Fe) diet from gestational day (G) 2 to postnatal day (P) 7 with or without choline supplementation (5 g/kg choline) from G11-18. Hippocampi were collected from P65 offspring of both sexes and analyzed for changes in gene expression. Results: Both early-life ID and choline treatment induced more transcriptional changes in female rat hippocampus than males with a less than 10 percent overlap between sexes. While both sexes showed alterations in gene networks related to increased risks of neurocognitive disorders, males also showed enhanced anti-inflammatory activities in response to ID, contrary to activated pro-inflammatory responses in females. Prenatal choline treatment to ID animals partially rescued ID-induced dysregulations in males but showed less effects in females. However, choline treatment to iron-sufficient rats showed more negative effects on the regulation of genes associated with cognition and affective behaviors, especially in females. Conclusions: This study provided unbiased global assessments of gene expression regulated by iron and choline in a sex-specific manner, with greater negative effects in female than male rats. Our new findings highlight potential sex-specific gene networks for further investigation.

                Human brain experiences vibration of certain frequency during various physical activities such as vehicle transportation and machine operation or accidents, which may cause traumatic brain injury or other brain diseases. However, little is known about what happened to brain after vibration stimuli. Here, with a custom-built electromagnetic actuator, vibration was induced in the brain while cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain stiffness were measured at 20, 30, 40 Hz for 52 healthy volunteers. With increasing frequency, multiple regions of the brain showed increasingly reduced CBF, while the size of such regions also expanded. The vibration-induced CBF reduction regions largely fell inside the brain's default mode network (DMN), with about 58 or 46 % overlap at 30 or 40 Hz, respectively. By establishing a biomechanical co-variance network based on tissue stiffness, analysis of small-world properties and modularity showed an increased disruption of the network with increased frequency. These findings demonstrate frequency-dependent features of vibration modulation to brain. Furthermore, the overlap between CBF reduction regions and DMN, and the vibration-induced decrease of biomechanical network connections suggest a interweaved relationship between blood flow, tissue stiffness, and cognitive functions. These may provide critical insights into the mechanical stimulus to brain and vibration-induced brain pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">USP30 inhibition induces mitophagy and reduces oxidative stress in parkin-deficient and CCCP-stressed human iPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins plays an important role in the cellular regulation of mitophagy. The E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin (encoded by PARK2) and the ubiquitin-specific protease 30 (USP30) have both been reported to regulate ubiquitination of outer mitochondrial proteins and thereby mitophagy. Loss of E3 ligase activity is thought to be pathogenic in both sporadic and inherited Parkinson's disease (PD), with loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 being the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive PD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether mitophagy induced by USP30 inhibition provides a functional rescue in isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons with and without PARK2 knockout (KO). Our data show that healthy neurons responded to CCCP-induced mitochondrial damage by clearing the impaired mitochondria and that this process was accelerated by USP30 inhibition. Parkin-deficient neurons showed an impaired mitophagic response to CCCP challenge, although mitochondrial ubiquitination was enhanced. USP30 inhibition promoted mitophagy in PARK2 KO neurons, independently of whether left in basal conditions or treated with CCCP. In PARK2 KO, as in control neurons, USP30 inhibition balanced oxidative stress levels by reducing excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, non-dopaminergic neurons, were the main driver of the beneficial effects of USP30 inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that USP30 inhibition is a promising approach to boost mitophagy and improve cellular health, also in parkin-deficient cells, and support the potential relevance of USP30 inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach in diseases with a need to combat neuronal stress mediated by impaired mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebrospinal fluid and blood profiles of transfer RNA fragments show age, sex and Parkinson's disease-related changes</a></h4>

              
                Transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) have recently been shown to be an important family of small regulatory RNAs with diverse functions. Recent reports have revealed modified tRF blood levels in a number of nervous system conditions including epilepsy, ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about tRF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To address this issue, we studied age, sex and Parkinsons disease (PD) distributions of tRFs in the CSF and blood data of PD patients and healthy controls from the NIH and the PPMI small RNA-seq datasets. The higher levels of long tRFs were found in the CSF than in the blood. Furthermore, the CSF showed pronounced age-associated declines of the level of 3prime-tRFs and i-tRFs and more pronounced differences between the sexes. Blood showed moderate elevation of 3prime-tFs levels with age. In addition, different distinct sets of tRFs segregated PD patients from controls in the CSF and in the blood. Finally, we found enrichment of tRFs predicted to target cholinergic mRNAs (Cholino-tRFs) in the mitochondrial originated tRFs, raising the possibility that the neurodegeneration-related mitochondrial impairment may lead to deregulation of cholinergic tone. Our findings suggest that CSF expressed tRFs are not a mirror of blood tRFs but rather potentially reflect the cerebral changes. Further, both CSF and blood present modified levels of tRFs in a sex-, age-and disease-related manner, calling for including this important subset of small RNA regulators to future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Convergent gene expression highlights shared vocal motor microcircuitry in songbirds and humans</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning is a skilled motor behavior observed in several mammalian and avian species and is critical for human speech. While convergent gene expression patterns have highlighted similar primary motor and striatal pathways for vocal imitation in songbirds and humans, the extent of molecular and circuit convergence remains unresolved. Here we profiled the four principal song nuclei of the zebra finch (HVC, LMAN, RA, Area X) and their surrounding brain regions using RNA-Seq and compared them with specialized markers we identified for human speech brain regions. Expanding previous work, both songbird RA and HVC exhibited convergent specialized gene expression of ~350 genes with human laryngeal sensorimotor cortex. The songbird HVCRA intratelencephalic (IT) neurons were the predominant cell type that was convergent with human, specifically layer 2/3 IT neurons, while the songbird RA extratelencephalic (ET) projection neurons exhibited convergent expression with human layer 5 ET projection neurons. The molecular specializations of both songbird LMAN and human Brocas area were more unique to each species. These findings demonstrate the extent of convergent molecular specializations in distantly related species for vocal imitation and emphasize important evolutionary constraints for this complex trait.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity orchestrates resilience to brain aging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The brain as a central regulator of stress integration determines what is threatening, stores memories and regulates physiological adaptations across the aging trajectory. While sleep homeostasis is linked to brain resilience, how age-associated changes intersect to adapt brain resilience remains enigmatic. We here provide evidence that a brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity ("PreScale") promotes resilience by coupling sleep, longevity and memory during aging. PreScale increased until mid-age and contributed to the age-adaption of sleep patterns, in effect promoting longevity but not memory of aging flies. Mechanistically, imaging and electrophysiology suggest that genetically-encoded PreScale reprograms neuronal activity, membrane firing patterns and excitability of the sleep-promoting dorsal fan-shaped body neurons, qualitatively similar to aging. Flies metabolically reprogrammed by spermidine towards extended longevity and preserved memory skipped PreScale and subsequently age-associated sleep pattern changes. Acute deep sleep induction in mid-age flies reset PreScale back to juvenile levels and restored memory. Taken together, early along aging trajectory, PreScale seems to steer trade-offs between longevity and memory, illustrating how life strategy manifests on circuit and synaptic plasticity levels.

                The use of tonal and speech token auditory oddball tasks has been used abundantly in past literature; however, it has been argued that tasks using non-word sounds fail to capture the higher-level ability to interpret and discriminate stimuli based on meaning which are critical to language comprehension. As such this study aims to examine how neural signals associated with discrimination and evaluation-processes (P3b) from semantic stimuli compare with those elicited by pure tones and speech tokens. This study comprises of two experiments, both containing thirteen adults (Exp 1: (Mean(SD)age = 25.20(3.89) years and Exp 2: Mean(SD)age = 25.3(3.79) years) with normal hearing in both ears (PTA [&le;] 20dB HL). Scalp electroencephalography and auditory event related potentials was recorded in free field whilst they completed three different oddball tasks: 1) Tones, 2) Speech tokens and 3) Odd/Even numbers. In experiment two, the duration of each stimulus was the same. P3b peak latency was significantly different between all three tasks, in both experiments. P3b amplitude was identified to be sensitive to reaction time, with tasks that have a large reaction time variability resulting in the P3b amplitude to be smeared out, thereby reducing the amplitude size. The findings from this study highlight the need to take into consideration all factors of the task before attributing any effects to any additional process such as semantic processing and mental effort. Furthermore, it highlights the need for more cautious interpretation of P3b results in auditory oddball tasks.

                Enteric glial cells (EGC) are a prominent cell type of all layers of the gut wall, virtually controlling all gastrointestinal functions. While the development of transgenic mice has led to major advances in understanding EGC biology, in vitro models are still fairly limited and do not allow for the robust and reproducible establishment of primary cultures discriminating EGC from the inner versus outer layers of the gut wall. Here we report a novel method to separately grow EGC from the inner and outer layers of the intestinal wall from the same mouse with a high degree of purity and cell heterogeneity. Our results indicate that EGC from the inner layers of the gut wall exhibit higher calcium response to ATP when compared to EGC from the outer layers. We also show that inner EGC cultures express lower levels of the transcription factor Sox 10 as compared to outer EGC cultures, which mirrors in situ differential expression of Sox10 in submucosal (inner) versus myenteric (outer) plexus assessed using wholemounts. Confocal microscopy analyses of wholemounts further demonstrate that a majority of calretinin-expressing ganglionic cells of the submucosal plexus express the EGC marker S-100{beta}, while this population is marginally represented in ganglia of the myenteric plexus. Altogether this study describes a novel method of EGC primary cultures permitting for the first time to compare inner versus outer EGC and provides in vitro and ex vivo evidence that inner EGC and outer EGC are phenotypically and functionally distinct.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DNA methylation is a widespread mechanism of light-induced circadian clock period plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is a principal light-responsive circadian clock that adjusts circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior to changes in external light signals. Although mechanisms underlying how light acutely resets the timing of circadian rhythms have been characterized, it remains elusive how light signals induce lasting changes in circadian period, so-called period after-effects. Here we have found that the period after-effects on circadian behavior of changing photoperiods are blocked by application of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors directed to the SCN. At the level of single light pulses that act as clock-resetting stimulations, pharmacologically inhibiting DNA methylation in the SCN significantly attenuates period after-effects following acute phase shifts in behavioral rhythms in vivo, and blocks period after-effects on clock gene rhythms in the isolated ex vivo SCN. Acute clock resetting shifts themselves, however, do not appear to require DNA methylation at the SCN and behavioral levels, in contrast to subsequent period plasticity. Our results indicate that DNA methylation in the SCN mediates light-induced period after-effects in response to photoperiods, and single light pulses, and together with previous studies showing that DNA methylation in the SCN is essential for period after-effects of non-24hr light cycles (T-cycles), suggest that DNA methylation in the SCN is a widespread mechanism of light-induced circadian period plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemical engineering of therapeutic siRNAs for allele-specific gene silencing in vivo in CNS</a></h4>

              
                Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a new class of drugs, exhibiting sequence-driven, potent, and sustained silencing of gene expression in vivo. We recently demonstrated that siRNA chemical architectures can be optimized to provide efficient delivery to the CNS. Many genetically-defined neurodegenerative disorders are autosomal dominant favoring selective silencing of the mutant allele. In some cases, successful targeting of the mutant allele requires targeting of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heterozygosity. Using Huntington's disease as a model, we demonstrate allele-specific RNAi-based silencing of gene expression in vivo and in neurons differentiated from HD patient-derived iPSCs. A series of in vitro screens, with chemical and thermodynamic optimization, identified compounds with >50-fold selectivity for the mutant HD-causing allele, based on a single nucleotide difference. The optimized compound exhibits selective silencing of mutant huntingtin (HTT) protein in patient-derived cells and throughout the HD mouse brain, providing a demonstration of SNP-based allele-specific RNAi silencing of gene expression in vivo in the CNS. The ability to target a disease-causing allele using RNAi-based therapies could be applied to a wide range of dominant CNS disorders, where maintenance of wild-type expression is essential.

                The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are devastating neurological diseases characterized by progressive cerebellar incoordination. While neurons bear the brunt of the pathology, a growing body of evidence suggests that glial cells are also affected. It has, however, been difficult to understand the role of glia, given the diversity of subtypes, each with their individual contributions to neuronal health. Using human SCA autopsy samples we have discovered that Bergmann glia the radial glia of the cerebellum, which form intimate functional connections with cerebellar Purkinje neurons display inflammatory JNK dependent cJun phosphorylation. This phosphorylation defines a signaling pathway not observed in other activated glial populations, providing an opportunity to specifically isolate the role of Bergmann glia in SCA inflammation. Turning to an SCA1 mouse model as a paradigmatic SCA, we demonstrate that inhibiting the JNK pathway reduces Bergmann glia inflammation accompanied by improvements in the SCA1 phenotype both behaviorally and pathologically. These findings demonstrate the causal role for Bergmann glia inflammation in SCA1 and point to a novel therapeutic strategy that could span several ataxic syndromes where Bergmann glia inflammation is a major feature.

                The most common genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the APOE4 allele, with evidence for gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. ApoE knockout in mice abrogates AD phenotypes but causes severe atherosclerosis due to the role of liver ApoE in cholesterol homeostasis. Previous attempts to inhibit brain-specific ApoE with anti-sense oligonucleotides only modestly reduced ApoE expression and had no effect on amyloid burden in adult AD mice. Here, we optimized a divalent small interfering RNA (di-siRNA) to selectively and potently silence ApoE in the brain. Silencing brain ApoE in AD mice significantly reduced amyloid plaque formation without affecting systemic cholesterol levels, confirming that brain and liver APOE pools are spatially and functionally distinct. Mechanistically, APOE appears to be a scaffold for beta-amyloid aggregation that limits clearance by microglia. Di-siRNAs from this study can be taken to pre-clinical and clinical trials to accelerate development of AD-modifying therapies and establish siRNA-based modulation of ApoE as a viable path towards therapeutic development.

                Chemosensation is essential for the survival of insects. Activities like searching for food, mating, and oviposition in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster are to a great extent governed by chemical cues detected via olfaction and gustation. This chemical information is conveyed to higher brain centres via populations of diverse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and gustatory sensory neurons (GSNs) expressing olfactory receptors (ORs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), respectively. ORs are exclusively expressed in the antenna and in the maxillary palps, while GRs are widely expressed in the labellum, tarsi, genitalia etc. Interestingly, 14 GRs were previously reported to be expressed in the antenna of D. melanogaster. However, the spatial expression pattern for all GRs and their functional role are still unclear. Recent data challenge the dogma that single OSNs express a single OR. In the present study, we studied the expression of 12 previously reported GRs among sensory structures on the fly antenna using the Gal4-UAS binary expression system. We observed antennal expression of nine out of the 12 reported. Out of these nine, consistent expression was only apparent for Gr64b, and we reconfirmed its presence in OSNs innervating three glomeruli in the antennal lobe. These glomeruli are known to be innervated by ab5A, ab5B and ab8A OSNs, respectively. Next, we generated double labelling crosses with Gr64b and observed co-expression of Gr64b with Or47a, which is expressed in the ab5B neuron. To elucidate the functional role of Gr64b co-expressed with Or47b, we challenged Or47a-expressing OSNs in wild type and Gr64b-/- mutant flies with odor stimulation using the single sensillum recording technique in two satiation states (fed and starved). Notably, we did not observe any significant odor sensitivity or specificity changes in Gr64b mutants as compared to wild type flies. Taken together, our results reveal co-expression of GRs with ORs in olfactory sensory neurons, while the functional contribution of the GR in this context remains obscure.

                Fibromyalgia is a debilitating widespread chronic pain syndrome that occurs in 2-4% of the population. The prevailing view that fibromyalgia results from central nervous system dysfunction has recently been challenged with data showing changes in peripheral nervous system activity. Using a mouse model of chronic widespread pain through hyperalgesic priming of muscle, we show that neutrophils invade sensory ganglia and confer mechanical hypersensitivity on recipient mice, whilst adoptive transfer of immunoglobulin, serum, lymphocytes or monocytes have no effect on pain behaviour. Neutrophil depletion abolishes the establishment of chronic widespread pain in mice. Neutrophils from patients with fibromyalgia also confer pain on mice. A link between neutrophil released mediators and peripheral nerve sensitisation is already established. These observations suggest new approaches for targeting fibromyalgia pain through an understanding of the mechanisms that cause altered neutrophil activity and interactions with sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ion-channel degeneracy and heterogeneities in the emergence of complex spike bursts in CA3 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Complex spike bursting (CSB) is a characteristic electrophysiological signature exhibited by several neurons and has been implicated in neural plasticity, learning, perception, anesthesia, and active sensing. Here, we address the question of how pronounced intrinsic and synaptic heterogeneities affect CSB, with hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (CA3PN) as a substrate where CSB emergence and heterogeneities are well-characterized. We randomly generated 12,000 unique models and found 236 valid models that satisfied 11 characteristic CA3PN measurements. These morphologically and biophysically realistic valid models accounted for gating kinetics and somato-dendritic expression profiles of 10 active ion channels. This heterogeneous population of valid models was endowed with broad distributions of underlying parameters showing weak pair-wise correlations. We found two functional subclasses of valid models, intrinsically bursting and regular spiking, with significant differences in the expression of calcium and calcium-activated potassium conductances. We triggered CSB in all 236 models through different intrinsic or synaptic protocols and observed considerable heterogeneity in CSB propensity and properties spanning models and protocols. Finally, we employed virtual knockout analyses and showed that synergistic interactions between intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms regulated CSB emergence and dynamics. Specifically, although there was a dominance of calcium and calcium-activated potassium channels in the emergence of CSB, individual deletion of none of the several ion channels or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors resulted in the complete elimination of CSB across all models. Together, our analyses critically implicate ion-channel degeneracy in the robust emergence of CSB and other characteristic signatures of CA3PNs, despite pronounced heterogeneities in underlying intrinsic and synaptic properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presynaptic Rac1 controls synaptic strength through the regulation of synaptic vesicle priming.</a></h4>

              
                Synapses contain a limited number of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that can be released in response to action potentials (APs). Therefore, sustaining synaptic transmission over a wide range of AP firing rates and timescales depends on both SV release and replenishment. Although actin dynamics impact synaptic transmission, how regulators of actin dynamics control SV release and replenishment remain unresolved. Rac1 is a regulator of actin signaling cascades that control synaptogenesis, neuronal development, and postsynaptic function, however, its presynaptic role in regulating synaptic transmission is unclear. To unravel the regulatory roles of presynaptic Rac1 in synaptic transmission, we ablated presynaptic Rac1 at the mature mouse calyx of Held. Presynaptic Rac1 deletion leads to increased synaptic strength due to increased SV release probability which results in faster SV replenishment and increased spontaneous SV release rates. Based on our data, we conclude that presynaptic Rac1 controls synaptic strength by regulating the intrinsic SV release probability through SV priming. Therefore, we propose that presynaptic Rac1 controls actin dynamics and acts as a key regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the contributions to hyperexcitability in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal hyperexcitability is a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three main mechanisms have been proposed to explain it: i), dendritic degeneration leading to increased input resistance, ii), ion channel changes leading to enhanced intrinsic excitability, and iii), synaptic changes leading to excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance. However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms is not fully understood. Therefore, we performed biophysically realistic multi-compartmental modelling of excitability in reconstructed CA1 pyramidal neurons of wild-type and APP/PS1 mice, a well-established animal model of AD. We show that, for synaptic activation, the excitability promoting effects of dendritic degeneration are cancelled out by excitability decreasing effects of synaptic loss. We find an interesting balance of excitability regulation with enhanced degeneration in the basal dendrites of APP/PS1 cells potentially leading to increased excitation by the apical but decreased excitation by the basal Schaffer collateral pathway. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that three additional pathomechanistic scenarios can account for the experimentally observed increase in firing and bursting of CA1 pyramidal neurons in APP/PS1 mice. Scenario 1: increased excitatory burst input; scenario 2: enhanced E/I ratio and scenario 3: alteration of intrinsic ion channels (IAHP down-regulated; INap, INa and ICaT up-regulated) in addition to enhanced E/I ratio. Our work supports the hypothesis that pathological network and ion channel changes are major contributors to neuronal hyperexcitability in AD. Overall, our results are in line with the concept of multi-causality and degeneracy according to which multiple different disruptions are separately sufficient but no single disruption is necessary for neuronal hyperexcitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetically corrected iPSC-derived Neural Stem Cell Grafts deliver NAGLU-IGFII fusion protein to affect CNS disease in Sanfilippo B Mice</a></h4>

              
                Sanfilippo syndrome type B (Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB or MPS IIIB) is a recessive genetic disorder that severely affects the brain due to a deficiency in the enzyme -N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to intralysosomal accumulation of partially degraded heparan sulfate. There are no effective treatments for this disorder. In this project, we carried out an ex vivo lentiviral correction of neural stem cells derived from Naglu-/- mice (iNSCs) using a modified enzyme in which the NAGLU is fused to an Insulin-like Growth Factor II receptor (IGFIIR) binding peptide in order to improve the cross-correction efficiency. After brain transplantation of these corrected iNSCs into Naglu-/- mice and long-term evaluation of the cross-correction, we successfully detected NAGLU-IGFII activity in all transplanted animals, as well as decreased lysosomal accumulation and reduced astrocytic and microglial activation throughout the transplanted brain. In addition, we identified a novel neuropathological phenotype in untreated brains characterized by decreased levels of MAP2 protein and accumulation of synaptophysin-positive aggregates in the brain. Following transplantation, this Naglu-/- -specific phenotype was altered with restored levels of MAP2 expression and significantly reduced formation of synaptophysin-positive aggregates. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and long-term benefit of genetically corrected iNSCs transplantation in the Sanfilippo B brain and effective cross-correction of Sanfilippo-associated pathology in Naglu-/- mice. Our findings suggest that genetically engineered iNSCs can be used to effectively deliver the missing enzyme to the brain and treat Sanfilippo type B-associated neuropathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling Instantaneous Firing Rate of DBS Target Neuronal Ensembles in Basal Ganglia and Thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder symptom, and is closely related to the dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for suppressing PD motor symptoms; however, the underlying mechanisms of DBS remain elusive. A recent study demonstrated that different substructures of the basal ganglia and thalamus respond differently to various frequencies of DBS. Despite the capability of existing models in qualitatively interpreting experimental data, there are very few unified computational models that quantitatively capture the dynamics of the neuronal activity of varying stimulated substructures - including subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNr) and ventralis intermedius (Vim) - across different DBS frequencies. Here, we developed a novel mathematical model to represent the firing rate of nuclei receiving DBS (microstimulation), including STN, SNr and Vim - across different DBS frequencies. In our model, the DBS pulses are filtered through a synapse model and a transfer function to formulate the firing rate variability. To consistently fit the model in varying frequencies of DBS, we developed a novel parameter optimization method based on the concatenated data from all DBS frequencies. Our model accurately reproduces the firing rates observed and calculated from both experimental and synthetic data. The optimal model parameters are consistent across different DBS frequencies, and this consistency conforms to the relatively static synaptic structures in short durations of DBS. Our model can be potentially implemented in navigating the DBS parameter space and improves DBS clinical effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rodent perirhinal cortex, but not ventral hippocampus, inhibition induces approach bias under object-based approach-avoidance conflict</a></h4>

              
                Neural models of approach-avoidance (AA) conflict behavior and its dysfunction have focused traditionally on the hippocampus, with the assumption that this medial temporal lobe (MTL) structure plays a ubiquitous role in arbitrating AA conflict. We challenge this perspective by using three different AA behavioural tasks in conjunction with optogenetics, to demonstrate that a neighbouring region in rats, perirhinal cortex, is also critically involved but only when conflicting motivational values are associated with objects and not contextual information. The ventral hippocampus, in contrast, was found not to be essential for object-associated AA conflict, suggesting its preferential involvement in context-associated conflict. We propose that stimulus type can impact MTL involvement during AA conflict and that a more nuanced understanding of MTL contributions to impaired AA behaviour (e.g., anxiety) is required. These findings serve to expand upon the established functions of the perirhinal cortex while concurrently presenting innovative behavioural paradigms that permit the assessment of different facets of AA conflict behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic information sampling in the brain during visual recognition</a></h4>

              
                Several studies observed behavioral oscillations in perceptual sensitivity across stimulus presentation time, and these fluctuations have been linked to oscillatory processing in the brain. However, whether specific brain areas show oscillations across stimulus time (i.e., oscillatory sampling) has not been investigated. Here, we randomly revealed features of face images across time and recorded participants' brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed two recognition tasks. This allowed us to quantify how each snapshot of visual information coming from the stimulus is processed across time and across the brain. Oscillatory sampling was mostly visible in early visual areas, at theta and low beta frequencies. Furthermore, it explained a larger part of brain activity than oscillatory processing. Other parts of the brain showed distinct sampling patterns. These results advance our understanding of the oscillatory neural dynamics associated with visual processing and show the importance of considering the temporal dimension of stimuli when studying visual recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural activity and theta rhythmicity in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus are involved in regulating social investigation</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are highly complex, involving both approach and avoidance actions towards specific individuals, dependent on the social context. Currently, the brain regions subserving these behaviors are not fully known. The anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is a relatively unstudied and poorly defined brain area, known as part of the medial hypothalamic defensive system. Recent studies that examined the role of the AHN in various contexts have yielded contradicting results regarding its contribution to approach, avoidance, and escape behaviors. Yet, none of these studies has directly examined its role in social interactions. Here we explored the role of AHN neurons in regulating approach and avoidance actions towards distinct stimuli during various types of social interactions, using electrophysiological recording of neural activity in the AHN of behaving mice, c-Fos staining, and direct optogenetic stimulation. We found that theta rhythmicity in the AHN was enhanced during affiliative interactions, but decreased during aversive ones. Moreover, spiking activity of AHN neurons was found to be elevated more persistently during investigation of social stimuli, as compared to objects. Notably, AHN neuronal firing was found to be modulated by theta rhythmicity during social interactions. Finally, we found that during social interaction, direct optogenetic stimulation of AHN neurons augmented approach behavior towards stimuli associated with the optogenetic activation. Overall, our results suggest a context-dependent role for AHN neuronal activity in regulating approach behavior during social interactions, and for theta rhythmicity in mediating the valence of the social context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide connectivity map of mouse thermosensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                In the thermal system, skin cooling is represented in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the posterior insular cortex (pIC). Whether S1 and pIC are nodes in anatomically separated or overlapping thermal sensorimotor pathways is unclear, as the brain-wide connectivity of the thermal system has not been mapped. We address this using functionally targeted, dual injections of anterograde viruses or retrograde tracers into S1 and pIC. Our data show that inputs to S1 and pIC originate from two non-overlapping populations, supporting the existence of parallel input pathways. While outputs from S1 and pIC were more widespread and share a number of cortical and subcortical regions, within target structures axonal projections were often separable. We observed a high degree of reciprocal connectivity with thalamic and cortical regions from both S1 and pIC, but output to the mid- and hind- brain was unidirectional. Notably, pIC showed exclusive connectivity with regions associated with thermal processing. Together, these data indicate that cutaneous thermal information is routed to the cortex via multiple, parallel streams of information which are forwarded to overlapping downstream regions for the binding of complex somatosensory percepts and integration with ongoing behavior.

	<p>Background: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an acute-phase protein that has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetes, and neuroinflammatory diseases. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) has been also implicated in microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, the potential role of LCN2 on TREM2 in diabetic mouse models is not fully understood. Methods: We investigated hepatic and hippocampal TREM2 expressions in high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic LCN2 knockout (KO) mice. Results: In addition to increased serum LCN2 level, diabetic wild-type (WT) mice had insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. However, LCN2 deletion attenuated these metabolic parameters in diabetic mice. We also found that LCN2 deletion reduced hepatic inflammation and microglial activation in diabetic mice. In particular, diabetic LCN2 KO mice had a reduction in hepatic and hippocampal TREM2 expressions compared with diabetic WT mice. Furthermore, we found that many TREM2-positive Kupffer cells and microglia in diabetic WT mice were reduced through LCN2 deletion. Conclusions: These findings indicate that LCN2 may promote hepatic inflammation and microglial activation via upregulation of TREM2 in diabetic mice.</p>

                Aim: To determine the effectiveness of capacity building program on palliative care (PC) in enhancing the capacity of the primary health care workers in need assessment and symptom management of cancer patients.  Background: In India, less than one percent of people living with cancer have access to palliative care since most are from low- and middle-income groups. Accredited social health activist (ASHA) and primary health care workers are grassroots workers who are the first contact with family members and are seldom aware of PC in India. It is essential to train them to give practical and efficient care to needy people. Design: A quasi-experimental design with follow-up will be conducted using an evaluative approach. Methods: The study population consists of 1440 Primary Health Care Workers (staff nurses, ANMs, and ASHA workers) of three taluks of Udupi District, Karnataka State, India. Training on PC will be provided for ASHA workers for one day and ANM/Staff nurses for three days. After their training, they are expected to demonstrate the gain in knowledge & skill in providing PC for cancer patients by identifying and implementing PC services using a mobile app at the primary healthcare level.  Discussion: Palliative home care can give comfort and reduce patients' financial burden, and this training may help to improve the quality of life of needy patients. Impact: If this palliative care training program succeeds, it can be integrated into the healthcare continuum, making it an essential component of primary healthcare delivery to achieve universal health coverage. Moreover, home-based PC supports patients who want to die at home even though it reduces hospital stay costs. Trial registration: CTRI/2020/04/024792.

                Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) releases nucleocapsid proteins (NP) into the blood circulation in infected patients. We investigated whether plasma NP analysis could be used for diagnosing an infection and used for nosocomial screening. Methods: We collected blood samples from patients admitted to the hospital during a period with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based-screening of patients for SARS-CoV-2. Retrospectively the SARS-CoV-2 NP plasma concentrations were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and used for an initial time course study to find the optimal time-point for sampling blood. Next, we estimated the diagnostic accuracy i.e. the clinical sensitivity and specificity at different plasma NP cut-off concentrations. Results: The time course study revealed profiles with rapid or more slow declines in NP titers after the RT-PCR result. Nevertheless, in the time interval 0 – 7 days after the RT-PCR result, the NP concentration was always above the level of detection at 1.66 pg/ml suggesting that the diagnosis could be established in the time interval of 0 - 7 days. The median time gap between the plasma NP and RT-PCR results was 0.0 days (n = 1957, interval: -26 to + 21 days). Reducing the time gap to seven days, the clinical sensitivity was 90.0% (n= 60, 95% CI, 82.4% to 97.6%) at a specificity of 95.9% (n=1876, 95% CI, 95.0% to 96.8%). Curve analysis by receiver operation characteristics identified a cut-off concentration of 1.87 pg/mL NP as optimal resulting in a positive predictive value of 41.2%, a negative predictive value of 99.7% and a prevalence of 3.1%. Conclusions: In conclusion, the NP method is acceptable for making the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, and an intended use of plasma NP as a prospective nosocomial screening method is considered feasible.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Level of development, foreign direct investment and domestic investment in food manufacturing [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whilst the literature on the complementarity and substitutability of foreign direct investment (FDI) on domestic investment (DI) is not uncommon, the facet of food manufacturing is non-existent. This paper fills this void by investigating the effect of FDI on DI in the food manufacturing sector for developing, economies in transition and developed countries. Methods: Using an unbalanced panel data of 49 countries from 1993 to 2016, from FAOSTAT, estimated by the system generalised method of moments (GMM), the Wald statistics for the short and long-run effects of FDI on DI were computed for the development groups. Results: Developed economies experienced a crowd-out effect of FDI on DI in the short run, whilst the others experienced no significant effect. In the case of the long run, the food manufacturing sectors of all three development groups exhibited a crowd-out effect. The effect in the long run for all development groups together is a crowd-in. Analysing all country groups together could mask the results of the various country groups. Conclusions: A review of investment policies to prioritise FDI entry mode that favour domestic investment is needed. Improvement of the investment regulatory and administrative efficiency among others are recommended.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A structured model and likelihood approach to estimate yeast prion propagon replication rates and their asymmetric transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fabian Santiago, Suzanne Sindi</p>

Prion proteins cause a variety of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but are generally harmless to Baker’s yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). This makes yeast an ideal model organism for investigating the protein dynamics associated with these diseases. The rate of disease onset is related to both the replication and transmission kinetics of propagons, the transmissible agents of prion diseases. Determining the kinetic parameters of propagon replication in yeast is complicated because the number of propagons in an individual cell depends on the intracellular replication dynamics and the asymmetric division of yeast cells within a growing yeast cell colony. We present a structured population model describing the distribution and replication of prion propagons in an actively dividing population of yeast cells. We then develop a likelihood approach for estimating the propagon replication rate and their transmission bias during cell division. We first demonstrate our ability to correctly recover known kinetic parameters from simulated data, then we apply our likelihood approach to estimate the kinetic parameters for six yeast prion variants using propagon recovery data. We find that, under our modeling framework, all variants are best described by a model with an asymmetric transmission bias. This demonstrates the strength of our framework over previous formulations assuming equal partitioning of intracellular constituents during cell division.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Histologically resolved multiomics enables precise molecular profiling of human intratumor heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tao Chen, Chen Cao, Jianyun Zhang, Aaron Streets, Tiejun Li, Yanyi Huang</p>

Both the composition of cell types and their spatial distribution in a tissue play a critical role in cellular function, organ development, and disease progression. For example, intratumor heterogeneity and the distribution of transcriptional and genetic events in single cells drive the genesis and development of cancer. However, it can be challenging to fully characterize the molecular profile of cells in a tissue with high spatial resolution because microscopy has limited ability to extract comprehensive genomic information, and the spatial resolution of genomic techniques tends to be limited by dissection. There is a growing need for tools that can be used to explore the relationship between histological features, gene expression patterns, and spatially correlated genomic alterations in healthy and diseased tissue samples. Here, we present a technique that combines label-free histology with spatially resolved multiomics in unfixed and unstained tissue sections. This approach leverages stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to provide chemical contrast that reveals histological tissue architecture, allowing for high-resolution in situ laser microdissection of regions of interests. These microtissue samples are then processed for DNA and RNA sequencing to identify unique genetic profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by mapping gene expression and copy number alterations to histologically defined regions in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our approach provides complementary insights in tumorigenesis and offers an integrative tool for macroscale cancer tissues with spatial multiomics assessments.

                Conventional binary classification performance metrics evaluate either general measures (accuracy, F score) or specific aspects (precision, recall) of a model’s classifying ability. As such, these metrics, derived from the model’s confusion matrix, provide crucial insight regarding classifier-data interactions. However, modern- day computational capabilities have allowed for the creation of increasingly complex models that share nearly identical classification performance. While traditional performance metrics remain as essential indicators of a classifier’s individual capabilities, their ability to differentiate between models is limited. In this paper, we present the methodology for MARS (Method for Assessing Relative Sensitivity/ Specificity) ShineThrough and MARS Occlusion scores, two novel binary classification performance metrics, designed to quantify the distinctiveness of a classifier’s predictive successes and failures, relative to alternative classifiers. Being able to quantitatively express classifier uniqueness adds a novel classifier-classifier layer to the process of model evaluation and could improve ensemble model-selection decision making. By calculating both conventional performance measures, and proposed MARS metrics for a simple classifier prediction dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed metrics’ informational strengths synergize well with those of traditional metrics, delivering insight complementary to that of conventional metrics.

                Background: Earth's temperature has been rising since 1900, and the annual temperature has increased from 20°C to 24°C on the Mediterranean coastline. The external climate directly relates to indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and building performance, particularly in educational buildings. This paper proposes smart adaptive building envelopes (SABEs) as a potential solution for resilient architecture which is prone to unexpected weather patterns posed by climate change. Methods: A multi-dimensional criterion methodology is employed based on Egypt’s local climate, using SABEs to provide thermal comfort and natural daylight using minimum energy. The paper's novelty is in using a comparative methodology that is complemented with a software simulation (OpenStudio 3.0.1) to address the existing educational building design challenges in providing IEQ, and to assess the proposed SABE design’s performance, whilst providing better indoor thermal comfort and daylight. Results: The results show that the application of SABEs has led to significant reduction of the energy consumed, by 7.62% in summer and 5.42% in winter Conclusions: The implications of SABEs on IEQ in terms of thermal comfort and daylight are significant. SABEs also reduce energy consumption.

                Background: The 7+3 regimen is still the main choice of remission induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Successfully achieving complete remission (CR) and the time required to achieve it determine patient’s survival. Hence, bone marrow examination on 14th day of chemotherapy is recommended to predict CR. However, the examination is invasive and still inaccurate. Methods: A prognostic study with retrospective cohort design was conducted at two central hospitals in Indonesia based on medical record data of AML patients who underwent 7+3 induction chemotherapy from January 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2019. The association of nadir leukocyte level and the time required to achieve it with CR occurrence was assessed. Results: One hundred and one subjects were recruited with median age 39 years and 55% men. A total of 55.4% subjects achieved CR. Nadir leukocyte level below 200/mcl was the most optimal cut-off point and independently associated with CR (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.03–5.97) while time required to achieve it was not. Conclusions: The nadir leukocyte level is associated with an increase probability of CR but not for the time required to achieve it in AML patients undergoing 7+3 induction chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance evaluation of the smartphone-based AI cough monitoring app - Hyfe Cough Tracker against solicited respiratory sounds [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging technologies to remotely monitor patients’ cough show promise for various clinical applications. Currently available cough detection systems all represent a trade-off between convenience and performance. The accuracy of such technologies is highly contingent on the clinical settings in which they are intended to be used. Moreover, establishing gold standards to measure this accuracy is challenging. Objectives: We present the first performance evaluation study of the Hyfe Cough Tracker app, a passive cough monitoring smartphone application. We evaluate performance for cough detection using continuous audio recordings and cough counting by trained individuals as the gold standard. We propose standard procedures to use multi-observer cough sound annotation from continuous audio recordings as the gold standard for evaluating automated cough detection devices. Methods: This study was embedded in a larger digital acoustic surveillance study (clinicaltrial.gov NCT04762693). Forty-nine participants were included and instructed to produce a diverse series of solicited sounds in 10-minute sessions. Simultaneously, continuous audio recording was performed using a MP3 recorder and two smartphones running Hyfe Cough Tracker app monitored and identified cough events. All continuous audio recordings were independently labeled by three medically-trained researchers. Results: Hyfe Cough Tracker app showed sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 98% with a very high correlation between the cough rate measured by Hyfe and that of human annotators (Pearson correlation of 0.968). A standardized approach to establish an acoustic gold standard for identifying cough sounds with multiple observers is presented. Conclusion: This is the first performance evaluation of a new smartphone-based cough monitoring system. Hyfe Cough Tracker can detect, record and count coughs from solicited cough-like explosive sounds in controlled acoustic environments with very high accuracy. Additional steps are required to validate the system in clinical and community settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal diagnosis enables detection of any disease or disability of the fetus during the pregnancy of a woman. Parents whose fetus is found to have a serious disorder from antenatal testing may terminate the pregnancy if it is permitted by the law or continue with the pregnancy to term. However, the chance of terminating a pregnancy may be denied if there is prenatal negligence by the medical practitioner in terms of diagnosis or failure to advise on the test results correctly. The purpose of this research is to examine the possible legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Methods: This study adopts doctrinal legal research in which the researcher examines statutes and decided cases in Malaysia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore relating to abortion, wrongful birth and wrongful life claims, in order to determine the legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Results: In Malaysia, abortion following a prenatal diagnosis is only legally possible if the statutory criteria in the Penal Code are met. Abortion is illegal if it is not done for therapeutic purposes. A wrongful birth action brought by a woman who claims to be deprived of the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy may be successful in Malaysia, if it can be proven that a legal abortion could have been performed if not because of the prenatal negligence of the medical practitioner. However, a wrongful life action brought in the child’s name for being allowed to be born with a disability may not be viable since the claim could hardly be established and it is against the public policy. Conclusions: Theoretically, it is possible to bring a wrongful birth action resulted from negligence in prenatal diagnosis successfully in Malaysia, but the chance is relatively slim for wrongful life action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The relationship of age, sex and prothrombin time related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods: This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results: Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion: A person who is infected with COVID-19 and has comorbid diabetes mellitus has a high risk of disease severity and mortality if he is older and male.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A hospital-based prospective cohort study to assess the factors associated with transmission dynamics of SARS CoV-2 among healthcare workers in Delhi [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare personnel providing COVID-19 care are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Understanding the factors associated with the transmission of infection amongst healthcare workers provides input for the development of prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were to study the adherence to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures followed between different categories of healthcare workers, to estimate seroconversion rate based on the type of exposure with COVID-19 patients and to study the association between seroconversion and IPC practices. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021 among the healthcare workers in two tertiary healthcare institutes selected by purposive sampling. All Healthcare workers (HCW) participating in the clinical management or having any exposure to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case were included. A total of 817 subjects were enrolled in the study. At baseline, details on IPC training and adherence along with details of the type of exposure with the COVID-19 patient were collected. The end-line visit was scheduled at 22-31 (preferably 28 days) days from the first visit for the collection of the symptom diary and end-line form.  Results: Hand hygiene practices were found to be best among paramedics (98.0%), followed by doctors (84.5%) and nurses (90.1%). Maximum HCWs (99.5%; 99.8%; 97.1%) reported using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appropriately and regular availability of PPE in the hospital setting. Among the various categories of HCWs, nurses had the highest proportion (28.7%) of untrained personnel. Conclusion: The HCWs who had contact with the surroundings of an infected patient showed higher odds of seroconversion although not statistically significant. Further, analyzing the types of PPE used, we found that the use of masks and gloves were protective in preventing infection. Strengthening IPC training through refresher training and demonstrating the correct use of PPE can enhance adherence to IPC measures.

                Background: Factor puzzles are a salient tool that has been consigned to oblivion. Methods: In this paper, we introduce factor puzzles and study the existence and uniqueness of solutions along with their connections to other areas of mathematics and real-world applications. Results: Using concepts from elementary number theory, we prove several theorems pertinent to the existence and uniqueness of a solvable factor puzzle, and the number of solutions. Furthermore, we established connections between factor puzzles and polynomial as well as matrix factorizations. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of factor puzzles in the real world was evidenced by an application in cryptography. Conclusion: Factor puzzles are a prominent tool with many remarkable connections and real-world applications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Resilience and entrepreneurial intentions of people with disabilities: in search of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is a significant gap in employment between people with and without disabilities, despite the importance of work in achieving their independence, autonomy, and integration into society. There are several reasons that cause this gap to exist, such as: people with disabilities feel less prepared, there is a stigma or discrimination to hire people with disabilities and the incompatibility of schedules due to medical issues, among others. That is why entrepreneurship emerges as a good option for the integration of people with disabilities in our society, improves their confidence and promotes some of the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda. According to existing literature, people with disabilities have certain virtues such as resilience and motivation that favor entrepreneurship. Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide new insights into the variables that determine the entrepreneurial intention of people with disabilities. Methods: In order to respond to this objective, an online questionnaire was given to people with disabilities between the ages of 16 and 65 years, residing in diverse regions of Spain. To analyze the results, this study uses Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in a sample of 235 people with disabilities in Spain using as a framework Krueger´s improved model, adding resilience as a new variable. Results: The results reflect the importance of resilience, the subjective norm, and perceived collective efficacy in the entrepreneurial processes of people with disabilities. Conclusions: This study contributes to the underdeveloped literature on entrepreneurship in people with disabilities; it provides insights that can have a practical effect on the reduction of the inequality gap between people with and without disabilities making recommendations to clinicians, vocational psychologists, and policymakers; also, this study would advance the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 8 and 10.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among patients with celiac disease in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, that occurs in susceptible individuals and is associated with dietary restriction and subsequent nutritional deficiencies. This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children, adolescents and adults with CD who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 ± 15.64 years) with CD was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets (GFD). Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.
