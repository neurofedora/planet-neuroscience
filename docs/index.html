	<p>Background: Although Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent worldwide, treating this condition remains challenging. Further, potential treatments for AUD do not fully address alcohol-induced neuroadaptive changes. Understanding the effects of pharmacotherapies for AUD on the human brain may lead to tailored, more effective treatments, and improved individual clinical outcomes. Objectives: We systematically reviewed the literature for studies investigating pharmacotherapies for AUD that included neuroimaging-based treatment outcomes. We searched the PubMed, Scielo, and PsycINFO databases up to January 2021. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: Eligible studies included those investigating pharmacotherapies for AUD and employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and/or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two independent reviewers screened studies&amp;amp;rsquo; titles and abstracts for inclusion. Data extraction forms were shared among all the authors to standardize data collection. We gathered information on the following variables: sample size; mean age; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics; alcohol use status; study design and methodology; main neuroimaging findings and brain-regions of interest (i.e., brain areas activated by alcohol use and possible pharmacological interactions); and limitations of each study. Results: Out of 177 studies selected, 20 studies provided relevant data for the research topic. Findings indicate that: (1) Acamprosate and gabapentin may selectively modulate limbic regions and the anterior cingulate cortex; (2) Naltrexone and disulfiram effects may involve prefrontal, premotor, and cerebellar regions; (3) Pharmacotherapies acting on glutamate and GABA neurotransmission involve primarily areas underpinning reward and negative affective states, and; (4) Pharmacotherapies acting on opioid and dopamine systems may affect areas responsible for the cognitive and motor factors of AUD. Limitations: Most of the studies were focused on naltrexone. A small number of studies investigated the action of disulfiram and gabapentin, and no neuroimaging studies investigated topiramate. In addition, the time between medication and neuroimaging scans varied widely across studies. Conclusions: We identified key-brain regions modulated by treatments available for AUD. Some of the regions modulated by naltrexone are not specific to the brain reward system, such as the parahippocampal gyrus (temporal lobe), parietal and occipital lobes. Other treatments also modulate not specific regions of the reward system, but play a role in the addictive behaviors, including the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The role of these brain regions in mediating the AUD pharmacotherapy response warrants investigation in future research studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">sDarken: Next generation genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for serotonin</a></h4>

              
                We developed a new family of genetically encoded serotonin (5-HT) sensors (sDarken) on the basis of the native 5-HT1A receptor and circularly permuted GFP. sDarken 5-HT sensors are bright in the unbound state and diminish their fluorescence upon binding of 5-HT. Sensor variants with different affinities for serotonin were engineered to increase the versatility in imaging of serotonin dynamics. Experiments in vitro and in vivo showed the feasibility of imaging serotonin dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution. As demonstrated here, the designed sensors showed excellent membrane expression, have high specificity, a superior signal-to-noise ratio, detect the endogenous release of serotonin and are suitable for two-photon in vivo imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the normative advantages of dopamine and striatal opponency for learning and choice</a></h4>

              
                Much research focuses on how the basal ganglia (BG) and dopamine (DA) contribute to reward-driven behavior. But BG circuitry is notoriously complex, with two opponent pathways interacting via several disinhibitory mechanisms, which are in turn modulated by DA. Building on earlier models, we propose a new model, OpAL*, to assess the normative advantages of such circuitry in cost-benefit decision making. OpAL* dynamically modulates DA as a function of learned reward statistics, differentially amplifying the striatal pathway most specialized for the environment. OpAL* exhibits robust advantages over traditional and alternative BG models across a range of environments, particularly those with sparse reward. These advantages depend on opponent and nonlinear Hebbian plasticity mechanisms previously thought to be pathological. Finally, OpAL* captures patterns of risky choice arising from manipulations of DA and environmental richness across species, suggesting that such choice patterns result from a normative biological mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical interneuron loss and seizure generation as novel clinically relevant disease phenotypes in Cln2R207X mice</a></h4>

              
                Aims: CLN2 disease is a fatal inherited childhood neurodegenerative disorder. Although a disease-modifying therapy now exists, a fundamental lack of understanding of disease pathogenesis has hampered development of more effective therapies. To better understand the cellular pathophysiology of CLN2 disease, we investigated the nature and progression of neuropathological and neurological changes in the recently generated Cln2R207X mouse. Methods: We have detailed microglial activation, astrogliosis, cytokine and chemokine expression, and neuron loss across the forebrain and spinal cords of Cln2R207X mice, along with quantitative gait analysis. We also performed long-term electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to characterize seizure activity, a clinically-relevant phenotype yet to be defined in any CLN2 disease model. Results: Histology revealed early localized microglial activation months before neuron loss in the thalamocortical system and spinal cord, which was accompanied by astrogliosis. These pathological changes were more pronounced and occurred in the cortex before the thalamus or spinal cord. There were early-onset and progressive changes in the expression of specific chemokines and cytokines including IL-33, IP-10, and MIP-1. Gait analysis revealed impaired performance only at disease end stage. EEG recordings revealed robust and progressive epileptiform activity from disease mid-stage including spontaneous seizures, which were accompanied by a profound loss of cortical GABAergic interneurons. Conclusions: Our data reveal novel phenotypes in Cln2R207X mice that differ markedly in their timing and progression through the CNS from other NCL mouse models. Our findings provide new insights on CLN2 disease pathogenesis and clinically-relevant readouts for future therapeutic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of brain-fluid circulation are altered in the mature-onset Tet-off APP mouse model of amyloidosis</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is an incurable brain disorder characterised by the progressive build-up of toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau protein aggregates. AD gradually inflicts cognitive functions of an individual such as memory, thinking, reasoning, and language by degrading synaptic function and the integrity of neuronal networks. It has been recently suggested that the efficacy of different brain-clearance systems like the glymphatic system (GS), involved in the removal of toxic waste and homeostatic balance, plays a key role in the pathology of AD. Moreover, the observed coupling between brain fluid movement and global brain activity implies that an alteration of the neuronal network integrity can impact brain fluid circulation throughout the brain and thereby the efficacy of the GS. Here, we investigated the dynamics of brain fluid circulation in Tet-Off APP (AD) mice, a mature-onset model of amyloidosis in which we have recently shown a deterioration of neuronal network integrity by resting-state fMRI. By utilizing dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI and gadoteric acid (Gd-DOTA) T1 contrast agent injected into the cisterna magna, we demonstrated that brain fluid exchange was significantly altered in 14-month-old AD mice compared to control littermates. More specifically, AD mice showed higher Gd-DOTA accumulation in areas proximal to the injection cite and computational modeling of time courses demonstrated significantly lower inflow time constants relative to the controls. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated abundant amyloid plaque burden in the forebrain of the AD group coinciding with extensive astrogliosis and microgliosis. The neuroinflammatory responses were also found in plaque-devoid regions, potentially impacting brain fluid circulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A distinct subset of oligodendrocyte lineage cells interact with the developing dorsal root entry during its genesis</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cell of the CNS and are critical for the functionality of the nervous system. In the packed CNS, we know distinct profiles of oligodendrocytes are present. Here, we used intravital imaging in zebrafish to identify a distinct oligodendrocyte lineage cell (OLC) that resides on the dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Our profiling of OLC cellular dynamics revealed a distinct cell cluster that interacts with peripheral sensory neurons at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ). With pharmacological, physical and genetic manipulations, we show that the entry of dorsal root ganglia pioneer axons across the DREZ is important to produce sensory located oligodendrocyte lineage cells. These oligodendrocyte lineage cells on peripherally derived sensory neurons display distinct processes that are stable and do not express mbp. Upon their removal, sensory behavior related to the DRG neurons is abolished. Together, these data support the hypothesis that peripheral neurons at the DREZ can also impact oligodendrocyte development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating spatial and network properties of NMDA-dependent neuronal connectivity in mixed cortical cultures</a></h4>

              
                A technique combining fluorescence imaging with Ca2+ indicators and single-cell laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate (LSPS) allows identification of functional connections between individual neurons in mixed cultures of rat neocortical cells as well as observation of synchronous spontaneous activity among neurons. LSPS performed on large numbers of neurons yielded maps of functional connections between neurons and allowed calculation of neuronal network parameters. LSPS also provided an indirect measure of excitability of neurons targeted for photostimulation. By repeating LSPS sessions with the same neurons, stability of connections and change in the number and strength of connections were also determined. Experiments were conducted in the presence of bicuculline to study the properties of excitatory neurotransmission. The AMPA receptor inhibitor, 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), abolished synchronous neuronal activity but had no effect on connections mapped by LSPS. In contrast, the NMDA receptor inhibitor, 2-Amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (APV), dramatically decreased the number of functional connections between neurons while also affecting synchronous spontaneous activity. Functional connections were also decreased by increasing extracellular Mg2+ concentration. These data demonstrated that LSPS mapping interrogates NMDA receptor-dependent connectivity between neurons in the network. A GluN2A-specific inhibitor, NVP-AAM077, decreased the number and strength of connections between neurons as well as neuron excitability. Conversely, the GluN2A-specific positive modulator, GNE-0723, increased these same properties. These data showed that LSPS can be used to directly study perturbations in the properties of NMDA receptor-dependent connectivity in neuronal networks. This approach should be applicable in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo experimental preparations.

                Background: In a recently published study combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we provided first evidence of M1-P15, an early component of TMS-evoked potentials, as a measure of transcallosal inhibition between motor cortices. However, considering the technical challenges of TMS-EEG recordings, further evidence is needed before M1-P15 can be considered a reliable index. Objective: Here, we aimed at validating M1-P15 as a cortical index of transcallosal inhibition, by replicating previous findings on its relationship with the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) and with performance in bimanual coordination. Moreover, we aimed at inducing a task-dependent modulation of transcallosal inhibition. Methods: A new sample of 32 healthy right-handed participants underwent behavioral motor tasks and TMS-EEG recording, in which left and right M1 were stimulated during bimanual tasks and during an iSP paradigm. Hypotheses and methods were preregistered before data collection. Results: We successfully replicated our previous findings on the positive relationship between M1-P15 amplitude and the iSP normalized area. However, we did not confirm the relationship between M1-P15 latency and bimanual coordination. Finally, we show a task-dependent modulation of M1-P15 amplitude, which was affected by the characteristics of the bimanual task the participants were performing, but not by the contralateral hand activity during the iSP paradigm. Conclusions: The present results corroborate our previous findings in validating the M1-P15 as a reliable cortical marker of transcallosal inhibition, and provide novel evidence of its task-dependent modulation. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of a preregistration approach in the TMS-EEG field to increase methodological rigor and transparency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4,6 sulfation regulates sympathetic nerve regeneration after myocardial infarction</a></h4>

              
                Sympathetic denervation of the heart following myocardial infarction (MI) is sustained by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar, and denervation predicts risk of sudden cardiac death. Blocking CSPG signaling restores sympathetic axon outgrowth into the cardiac scar, decreasing arrhythmia susceptibility. Axon growth inhibition by CSPGs is thought to depend on the sulfation status of the glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) attached to the core protein. Tandem sulfation of CS-GAGs at the 4th (4S) and 6th (6S) positions of n-acetyl-galactosamine inhibits outgrowth in several types of neurons within the central nervous system, but it is not known if sulfation is similarly critical during peripheral nerve regeneration. We asked if CSPG sulfation prevented sympathetic axon outgrowth. Sympathetic neurite outgrowth across purified CSPGs is restored in vitro by reducing 4S with the 4- sulfatase enzyme Arylsulfatase-B (ARSB). Additionally, we co-cultured cardiac scar tissue with sympathetic ganglia ex vivo and found that reducing 4S with ARSB restored axon outgrowth to control levels. We examined levels of the enzymes responsible for adding and removing sulfation to CS-GAGs by western blot to determine if they were altered in the left ventricle after MI. We found that CHST15 (4S dependent 6- sulfotransferase) was upregulated, and ARSB was downregulated after MI. Increased CHST15 combined with decreased ARSB suggests a mechanism for production and maintenance of sulfated CSPGs in the cardiac scar. We altered tandem sulfated 4S,6S CS-GAGs in vivo by transient siRNA knockdown of Chst15 and found that reducing 4S,6S restored Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive sympathetic nerve fibers in the cardiac scar after MI and reduced arrhythmias. Overall, our results suggest that modulating CSPG-sulfation after MI may be a therapeutic target to promote sympathetic nerve regeneration in the cardiac scar and reduce post-MI cardiac arrhythmias.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Co-release of histamine and GABA in prefrontal cortex excites fast-spiking interneurons and causes divisive gain change in pyramidal cells; an effect that is enhanced in older mice</a></h4>

              
                We studied how co-release of histamine/GABA from axons originating from the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and projecting to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) influences circuit processing. We opto-stimulated histamine/GABA co-release from genetically defined TMN axons that express the histidine decarboxylase gene (TMNHDC axons). Whole-cell recordings were used to monitor excitability of visually identified PFC neurons in layer 2/3 of prelimbic (PL), anterior cingulate (AC) and infralimbic (IL) regions before and after opto-stimulated histamine/GABA release. We found that histamine-GABA co-release influences the PFC through actions on distinct neuronal types: histamine stimulates fast-spiking interneurons; and co-released GABA enhances tonic (extrasynaptic) inhibition on pyramidal cells (PyrNs). For fast spiking non-accommodating interneurons, opto-stimulation increased excitability, an effect blocked by histamine H1 and H2 receptor antagonists. The excitability of other interneuron types in the PFC was not altered. In contrast, the combined action of histamine and GABA co-release from TMNHDC axons produced predominantly divisive gain changes in PyrNs, increasing their resting input conductance, and decreasing the slope of the input-output relationship. The direct inhibitory effect of TMNHDC axon activation on PyrNs was not blocked by histamine receptor antagonists but was blocked by GABAA receptor antagonists. Across the adult lifespan (from 3 months to over 2 years of age), stimulation of TMNHDCaxons in the PFC inhibited PyrN excitability significantly more in older mice. For individuals that maintain cognitive performance into later life, increases in TMNHDC modulation of PyrNs could enhance information processing and be an adaptive mechanism to buttress cognition.

                Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by an impaired ability to extinguish fear responses to trauma-associated cues. Studies in humans and non-human animals point to differences in the engagement of certain frontal cortical regions as key mediators determining whether or not fear extinction is successful, however the neural circuit interactions that dictate the differential involvement of these regions are not well understood. To better understand how individual differences in extinction recall are reflected in differences in neural circuit activity, we labeled projections to the infralimbic cortex (IL) in rats using a retrograde tracer and compared neural activity within, and outside, of IL-projecting neurons. We analyzed these data in groups separated on the basis of how well rats retained extinction memory. We found that within IL-projecting cells, neurons in the posterior paraventricular thalamus showed heightened activity in rats that showed good extinction recall. Outside of the IL-projecting cells, increased Fos activity was observed in good extinction rats in select regions of the claustrum and ventral hippocampus. Our results indicate that differences in extinction recall are associated with a specific pattern of neural activity both within and outside of projections to the IL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rostral medial frontal cortex is crucial for engagement in consummatory behavior</a></h4>

              
                The medial frontal cortex (MFC) in rodents emits rhythmic activity that is entrained to the animal's licking cycle during consumption and encodes the value of consumed fluids (Horst and Laubach, 2013; Amarante et al., 2017; Amarante and Laubach, 2021). These signals are especially prominent in the rostral half of the MFC. This region is located above an orbitofrontal region where mu opioid receptors regulate intake (Mena et al., 2011; Castro and Berridge, 2017) and reversible inactivation reduces behavioral measures associated with the incentive value and palatability of liquid sucrose (Parent et al., 2015a). Here, we examined the effects of reversible inactivation and stimulation of mu opioid receptors in rostral MFC on behavior in an incentive contrast licking task. Adult male rats licked to receive access to liquid sucrose, which alternated between high (16%) and low (4%) values over 30 sec periods. Bilateral infusion of muscimol reduced the total number of licks emitted over the 30 min test sessions, the time spent actively consuming sucrose, and the ratio of licks for the higher and lower value fluids. Inactivation did not alter licking frequency or variability or microstructural measures such as the duration of licking bouts that are classically associated with the palatability of a liquid reward. Infusions of DAMGO (1ug/uL) at the same sites had inconsistent behavioral effects across different subjects. Our findings suggest that the rostral MFC has a distinct role in the control of consummatory behavior and contributes to peristent consumption and not to the expression of palatability.

	<p>Linguistic phenotypes of individuals with Fragile X (FXS) and Williams (WS) syndromes exhibit various degrees of pragmatic impairment, involving difficulties in social communication and in adapting to conversational principles. The goal of the present study was to explore syndrome-specific pragmatic profiles of adults with FXS and WS based on the assessment of the observance of Gricean maxims of conversation. The participants were 12 Spanish-speaking adults (6 FXS/6 WS), without a diagnosis of ASD, whose extensive naturalistic conversations (71,859 words) were transcribed and coded with the CHILDES/TALKBANK tools and the PREP-CORP pragmatic protocol. Violations of the maxims of conversation were analyzed, and indexes of cooperation and conversational response were obtained. Both groups showed reduced verbal production and repetitive dysfluencies; prominent features in the FXS profile were higher proportion of non-contingent language, perseverations of topic and form, and impulsive conversational responses; in the WS profile, salient characteristics were higher proportion of tangential utterances, reformulations, and conversational responses reflecting overly literal interpretation. Pragmatic profiles of violation of conversational maxims reflect specific communication skills impaired in adults with FXS and WS and raise the need for assessment and intervention methods that specifically address their social communication abilities.</p>

	<p>We present a case of a woman who reported to the emergency unit due to recurrent episodes of severe headache and collapse. MRI examination revealed no relevant findings apart from small meningioma of the right parietal region. The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy and received outpatient treatment, which was changed due to poor toleration. A follow-up MRI was performed which revealed an isolated, focal lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient underwent extensive laboratory testing and antiseizure medications were started again. Another MRI indicated substantial regression of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) lesion. Both the complete clinical image and results of the diagnostic evaluation spoke in favor of cytotoxicity of the corpus callosum associated with anti-epileptic drug treatment. Pathologies involving the corpus callosum include congenital, demyelination, infection, neoplasm, trauma and vascular changes. Isolated, non-specific lesions of the splenium of corpus callosum usually indicate multiple sclerosis; however, other pathologies should be considered. Anti-epileptic drugs may evoke cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs).</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bilateral synchronous cortical activity occurs during sleep, attention, and seizures. Canonical models place the thalamus at the center of bilateral cortical synchronization because it generates bilateral sleep spindle oscillations and primarily generalized absence seizures. However, classical studies suggest that the corpus callosum mediates bilateral cortical synchronization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We mapped the spread of right frontal lobe-onset, focal to bilateral seizures in mice and modified it using chemo and optogenetic suppression of motor thalamic nucleus and corpus callosotomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizures from the right cortex spread faster to the left cortex than to the left thalamus. The 2 thalami have minimal monosynaptic commissural connections compared to the massive commissure corpus callosum. Chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic inhibition of the right ventrolateral thalamic nucleus did not alter inter-hemispheric seizure spread. However, anterior callosotomy delayed bilateral seizure oscillations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical oscillations amplify focal onset motor seizures, and corpus callosum spreads them bilaterally. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adropin is a secreted peptide, which is composed of 43 amino acids and shows an effective role in regulating energy metabolism and insulin resistance. Motor coordination and locomotor activity were improved by adropin in the cerebellum. However, it is not known whether adropin administration has an effect on spatial learning and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of adropin on spatial learning and memory and characterized the biochemical properties of adropin in the hippocampus. Thirty male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups as control and adropin groups. The control group received 0.9% NaCl intracerebroventricular for 6 days, while the adropin groups received 1 nmol of adropin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (for 6 days). The Morris water maze, Y maze, and object location recognition tests were performed to evaluate learning and memory. Also, the locomotor activity tests were measured to assess the motor function. The expression of Akt, phospho-Akt, CREB, phospho-CREB, Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), phospho-GSK3β, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit were determined in the hippocampal tissues by using western blot. Behavior tests showed that adropin significantly increase spatial memory performance. Meanwhile, the western blot analyses revealed that the phosphorylated form of the Akt and CREB were enhanced with adropin administration in the hippocampus. Also, the expression of BDNF showed an enhancement in adropin group in comparison to the control group. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that adropin exerts its enhancing effect on spatial memory capacity through Akt/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Contextual features in the developing hippocampus: A representational similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Functional divisions of labor in support of memory have been reported along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. However, little is known about how the developing hippocampus represents associative memories along this axis. The present research employed representational similarity analysis to ask whether developmental differences exist in the extent to which the anterior versus the posterior hippocampus represent features of the context and associative memories. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during the retrieval phase of an associative recognition task from 8-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and adults (<i>N</i> = 58). Participants were asked to retrieve pairs of items, which were presented either in the same location as during encoding or in a flipped location. In the anterior hippocampus and only for adults, pattern similarity between the two studied pair conditions was greater than pattern similarity between studied pairs presented in the same location and novel pairs. In contrast, this difference was not significant in the posterior hippocampus. Older, but not younger, children showed a similar, albeit attenuated, similarity pattern to that of adults, but measures of patterns similarity predicted associative recognition across ages. In addition, exploratory analyses showed that similarity patterns in the adult posterior, but not anterior, hippocampus tracked the order of the runs. Overall, the results suggest functional and developmental dissociations in processing different contextual features, with the anterior hippocampus responding to salient and rapid-changing features and the posterior hippocampus responding to slower-changing features of the context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Novel measures of Morris water maze performance that use vector field maps to assess accuracy, uncertainty, and intention of navigational searches</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; <i>Ptpn11</i> D61G and <i>Ptpn11</i> N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A growing body of research details spatial representation in bat hippocampus, and experiments have yet to explore hippocampal neuron responses to sonar signals in animals that rely on echolocation for spatial navigation. To bridge this gap, we investigated bat hippocampal responses to natural echolocation sounds in a non-spatial context. In this experiment, we recorded from CA1 of the hippocampus of three awake bats that listened passively to single echolocation calls, call-echo pairs, or natural echolocation sequences. Our data analysis identified a subset of neurons showing response selectivity to the duration of single echolocation calls. However, the sampled population of CA1 neurons did not respond selectively to call-echo delay, a stimulus dimension posited to simulate target distance in recordings from auditory brain regions of bats. A population analysis revealed ensemble coding of call duration and sequence identity. These findings open the door to many new investigations of auditory coding in the mammalian hippocampus.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Information processing in cortical circuits, including the hippocampus, relies on the dynamic control of neuronal activity by GABAergic interneurons (INs). INs form a heterogenous population with defined types displaying distinct morphological, molecular, and physiological characteristics. In the major input region of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG), a number of IN types have been described which provide synaptic inhibition to distinct compartments of excitatory principal cells (PrCs) and other INs. In this study, we perform an unbiased classification of GABAergic INs in the DG by combining in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, intracellular labeling, morphological analysis, and unsupervised cluster analysis to better define IN type diversity in this region. This analysis reveals that DG INs divide into at least 13 distinct morpho-physiological types which reflect the complexity of the local IN network and serve as a basis for further network analyses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive penetrability of scene representations based on horizontal image disparities</a></h4>

              
                The structure of natural scenes is signaled by many visual cues. Principal amongst them are the binocular disparities created by the laterally separated viewpoints of the two eyes. Disparity cues are believed to be processed hierarchically, first in terms of local measurements of absolute disparity and second in terms of more global measurements of relative disparity that allow extraction of the depth structure of a scene. Psychophysical and oculomotor studies have suggested that relative disparities are particularly relevant to perception, whilst absolute disparities are not. Here, we compare neural responses to stimuli that isolate the absolute disparity cue with stimuli that contain additional relative disparity cues, using the high temporal resolution of EEG to determine the temporal order of absolute and relative disparity processing. By varying the observers' task, we assess the extent to which each cue is cognitively penetrable. We find that absolute disparity is extracted before relative disparity, and that task effects arise only at or after the extraction of relative disparity. Our results indicate a hierarchy of disparity processing stages leading to the formation of a proto-object representation upon which higher cognitive processes can act.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative transcriptomics of the Drosophila olfactory subsystems identifies a support cell-expressed Osiris protein required for pheromone sensing</a></h4>

              
                The nose of most animals comprises multiple sensory subsystems, which are defined by the expression of different olfactory receptor families. Drosophila melanogaster antennae comprise two morphologically and functionally distinct subsystems that express Odorant receptors (Ors) or Ionotropic receptors (Irs). Although these receptors have been thoroughly characterized in this species, the subsystem-specific expression and roles of other genes are much less well-understood. Here we generate subsystem-specific transcriptomic datasets to identify hundreds of genes, encoding diverse protein classes, that are selectively enriched in either Or or Ir subsystems. Using single-cell antennal transcriptomic data and RNA in situ hybridization, we find most neuronal genes - other than sensory receptor genes - are broadly expressed within the subsystems. By contrast, we identify many non-neuronal genes that exhibit highly selective cell-type expression, revealing substantial molecular heterogeneity in the non-neuronal cellular components of these olfactory subsystems. We characterize one Or subsystem-specific non-neuronal molecule, Osiris 8 (Osi8), a conserved member of a large family of insect transmembrane proteins. Osi8 is expressed in tormogen support cells that are associated with pheromone sensing neurons. Loss of Osi8 abolishes high sensitivity neuronal responses to pheromone ligands. Together this work identifies a new protein required for insect pheromone detection, emphasizes the importance of support cells in sensory responses, and provides a resource for future characterization of other olfactory subsystem-specific genes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Purinergic P2X7 Receptor-mediated inflammation precedes PTSD-related Behaviors in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Clinical evidence has linked increased peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, whether inflammation contributes to or is a consequence of PTSD is still unclear. Previous research shows that stress can activate P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) on microglia to induce inflammation and behavioral changes. In this investigation, we examined whether P2X7Rs contribute to the development of PTSD-like behaviors induced by single prolonged stress (SPS) exposure in rats. Consistent with the literature, exposing adult male and female rats to SPS produced a PTSD-like phenotype of impaired fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behavior one week after exposure. In addition, SPS-exposed animals had more Iba1-positive microglia expressing the P2X7R in the ventral hippocampus, a structure that regulates fear extinction and anxiety-like behavior. Next, we examined if inflammation precedes the behavioral manifestations. Three days after SPS exposure, increased inflammatory cytokines were found in the blood and hippocampal microglia showed increased expression of the P2X7R, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-, suggesting increased peripheral and central inflammation before behavioral testing. To determine whether P2X7Rs contribute to the PTSD-related behaviors induced by SPS exposure, we gave ICV infusions of the P2X7R antagonist, A-438079, for one week starting the day of SPS exposure. Blocking P2X7Rs prevented the SPS-induced impaired fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats, suggesting that SPS activates P2X7Rs which increase inflammation to produce a PTSD-like phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing the potential of microglia preparations generated using different human iPSC-based differentiation methods to model microglia-mediated mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident immune cells of nervous system. In healthy conditions, microglia actively patrol neural tissues in a homeostatic state, which can rapidly change to an activated state in response to local injury/disease. Dysregulated microglia activation is a hallmark of disorders and diseases of the nervous system, including motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The elucidation of the roles of microglia in human biology and disease has recently benefitted from the development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based approaches to generate microglia-like cells. Microglia represent a heterogenous group of cells with spatial diversity in both health and disease. This situation poses a considerable challenge along the path towards establishing the most pathologically-relevant human iPSC-derived microglia preparations to investigate the complex roles of microglia in ALS and other neurological diseases. The success of these approaches must account for microglia diversity in different regions of the brain and spinal cord. In this study, we compared the transcriptomes of human iPSC-derived microglia generated using different methods to determine whether or not separate strategies can be used to generate microglia with distinct transcriptional signatures in vitro. We show that different derivation methods give rise to preparations comprising human microglia with distinct transcriptomic signatures resembling the gene profiles of specific microglia subpopulations in vivo. These findings suggest that a careful, and coordinated, implementation of multiple microglia differentiation methods from human iPSCs can be an effective approach towards the goal of generating multiple microglia subtypes that will offer enhanced model systems to account for microglia heterogeneity in vivo. Spatially-defined human iPSC-derived microglia would represent an enhanced tool to study the multiple levels of involvement of microglia in mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS, as well as other neurological diseases and disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Familial ALS-associated SFPQ variants promote the formation of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates that reduce surface AMPA receptor expression in primary neurons</a></h4>

              
                SFPQ is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that is involved in a wide range of physiological processes including neuronal development and homeostasis. However, the mislocalization and cytoplasmic aggregation of SFPQ are associated with the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have previously reported that zinc mediates SFPQ polymerization and promotes the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates in neurons. Here we characterize two familial ALS (fALS)-associated SFPQ variants, which cause amino acid substitutions in the proximity of the SFPQ zinc-coordinating center (N533H and L534I). Both mutants display increased zinc-binding affinities, which can be explained by the presence of a secondary zinc-binding site revealed by the 1.83[A] crystal structure of the human SFPQ L534I mutant. Overexpression of these fALS-associated mutants significantly increases the number of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates in primary neurons. Although they do not affect the density of dendritic spines, the presence of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates causes a marked reduction in the levels of the GluA1, but not the GluA2 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors on the neuronal surface. Taken together, our data demonstrate that fALS-associated mutations enhance the propensity of SFPQ to bind zinc and form aggregates, leading to the dysregulation of AMPA receptor subunit composition, which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in ALS.

                Oxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in AlzheimerOxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in AlzheimerOxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how it affects the pathogenesis of AD is not yet fully understood. Neil3 is a DNA glycosylase initiating repair of oxidative DNA base lesions and with a distinct expression pattern in proliferating cells. In brain, its function has been linked to hippocampal-dependent memory and to induction of neurogenesis after stroke and in prion disease. Here, we generated a novel AD mouse model deficient for Neil3 to study the impact of impaired oxidative base lesion repair on the pathogenesis of AD. Our results demonstrate an age-dependent decrease in amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaque deposition in female Neil3-deficient AD mice, whereas no significant difference was observed in male mice. Furthermore, male but not female Neil3-deficient AD mice show reduced neural stem cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus and impaired working memory compared to controls. These effects seem to be independent of DNA repair as both sexes show increased level of oxidative base lesions in the hippocampus upon loss of Neil3. Thus, our findings suggest an age- and sex-dependent role of Neil3 in the progression of AD by altering cerebral A{beta} accumulation and promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis to maintain cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the modulation of cortical Up-Down state switching by astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Converging experimental reports have shown that the firing dynamics of neural networks in several cortical brain areas can exhibit Up-Down synchronization regimes, spontaneously alternating between long periods of high collective firing activity (Up state) and long periods of relative silence (Down state). The molecular or cellular mechanisms that support the emergence of these reversible transitions are still uncertain. In addition to intrinsic mechanisms supported by the local neurons of the network, recent experimental studies have suggested that the astrocytes of the local network can actually control the emergence of Up-Down regimes. Here we propose and study a neural network model to explore the implication of astrocytes in this dynamical phenomenon. We consider three populations of cells: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes, interconnected by gliotransmission events, from neurons to astrocytes and back. We derive two models for this three-population system: a rate model and a stochastic spiking neural network with thousands of neurons and astrocytes. In numerical simulations of these three-population models, the presence of astrocytes is indeed observed to promote the emergence of Up-Down regimes with realistic characteristics. Linear stability analysis reveals that astrocytes in these models do not change the bifurcation structure of these systems, but change the localization of the bifurcations in the parameter space. Accordingly, with the addition of astrocytes, the network can enter a bistability region of the dynamics, where the Up-Down dynamical regime emerges. Simulations of the stochastic network model further evidence that astrocytes provide a stationary and stable background of gliotransmission events to the neurons, that triggers spontaneous transitions between synchronized Up and Down phases of neuronal firing. Taken together, our work provides a theoretical framework to test scenarios and hypotheses on the modulation of Up-Down dynamics by gliotransmission from astrocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Syntaxin-1A modulates vesicle fusion in mammalian neurons via juxtamembrane domain dependent palmitoylation of its transmembrane domain</a></h4>

              
                SNAREs are undoubtedly one of the core elements of synaptic transmission. On the contrary to the well characterized function of their SNARE domains bringing the plasma and vesicular membranes together, the level of contribution of their juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the vesicle fusion is still under debate. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed three groups of STX1A mutations: 1) elongation of STX1As JMD by three amino acid insertions in the junction of SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD; 2) charge reversal mutations in STX1As JMD; and 3) palmitoylation deficiency mutations in STX1As TMD. We found that both JMD elongations and charge reversal mutations have position dependent differential effects on Ca2+-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release in cultured murine hippocampal neurons. Importantly, we show that STX1As JMD regulates the palmitoylation of STX1As TMD and loss of STX1A palmitoylation either through charge reversal mutation K260E or by loss of TMD cysteines particularly inhibits spontaneous vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the retinal ribbon specific STX3B has a glutamate in the position corresponding to the K260E mutation in STX1A and mutating it with E259K acts as a molecular on-switch. Furthermore, palmitoylation of post-synaptic STX3A can be induced by the exchange of its JMD with STX1As JMD together with the incorporation of two cysteines into its TMD. Forced palmitoylation of STX3A dramatically enhances spontaneous vesicle fusion suggesting that STX1A regulates spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one through the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain and the other through the palmitoylation of its TMD.

                People who have Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 and thus also an additional copy of APP; this genetic change drives the early development of Alzheimers disease in these individuals. Here we use a combination of next-generation mouse models of Down syndrome (Tc1, Dp3Tyb, Dp(10)2Yey and Dp(17)3Yey) and a knockin mouse model of amyloid-beta accumulation (AppNLF) to determine how chromosome 21 genes other than APP modulate APP/amyloid-beta in the brain when in three copies. We demonstrate that three copies of other chromosome 21 genes are sufficient to partially ameliorate amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain. We go on to identify a subregion of chromosome 21 that contains the gene/genes causing this decrease in amyloid-beta accumulation and investigate the role of two lead candidate genes Dyrk1a and Bace2. Thus an additional copy of chromosome 21 genes, other than APP, can modulate APP/amyloid-beta in the brain under physiological conditions. This work provides critical mechanistic insight into the development of disease and an explanation for the typically later age of onset of dementia in people who have AD-DS compared to those who have familial AD caused by triplication of APP.

                Mammalian taxonomies are conventionally defined by morphological traits and genetics. How species differ in terms of neural circuits and whether inter-species differences in neural circuit organization conform to these taxonomies is unknown. The main obstacle for the comparison of neural architectures have been differences in network reconstruction techniques, yielding species-specific connectomes that are not directly comparable to one another. Here we comprehensively chart connectome organization across the mammalian phylogenetic spectrum using a common reconstruction protocol. We analyze the mammalian MRI (MaMI) data set, a database that encompasses high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 124 species across 12 taxonomic orders and 5 superorders, collected using a single protocol on a single scanner. We assess similarity between species connectomes using two methods: similarity of Laplacian eigenspectra and similarity of multiscale topological features. We find greater inter-species similarities among species within the same taxonomic order, suggesting the connectome organization recapitulates traditional taxonomies defined by morphology and genetics. While all connectomes retain hallmark global features and relative proportions of connection classes, inter-species variation is driven by local regional connectivity profiles. By encoding connectomes into a common frame of reference, these findings establish a foundation for investigating how neural circuits change over phylogeny, forging a link from genes to circuits to behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The maternal X chromosome impairs cognition and accelerates brain aging through epigenetic modulation in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Female mammalian cells harbor two X chromosomes, one of maternal and one of paternal origin. During development, one X randomly inactivates. This renders either the maternal or paternal X active, causing X mosaicism that varies among individual females, with some showing considerable or complete skew in the general female population. Parent-of-X-origin can modify epigenetics via DNA methylation and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in aging and disease. However, whether X skewing - or its mosaicism - alters functions in females is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew toward the maternal X (Xm) influences key functions of the body. Among cardiac, bone, metabolic, and brain functions, Xm selectively impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biologic or epigenetic aging of the female hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory. Xm showed epigenetic imprinting of several genes within hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. Thus, the maternal X chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain aging, and silenced genes. Understanding how the maternal X impairs brain function could lead to new understanding of female heterogeneity in cognitive heath and to X chromosome-derived pathways against cognitive deficits and brain aging.

                Despite abundant research on the role of Broca's area in language processing, there is still no consensus on language specificity of this region and its connectivity network. The present study employed the meta-analytic connectivity modeling procedure to identify and compare domain-specific (language-related) and domain-general (non-language) functional connectivity patterns of three subdivisions within the broadly defined Broca's area: pars opercularis (IFGop), pars triangularis (IFGtri) and pars orbitalis (IFGorb) of the left inferior frontal gyrus. The findings revealed a left-lateralized frontotemporal network for all regions of interest underlying domain-specific linguistic functions. The domain-general network and its conjunction with the domain- specific network, however, spanned frontoparietal regions that overlap with the multiple-demand network. The findings suggest that language-specificity of Broca's area emerges within a left-lateralized frontotemporal network, and that domain-general resources are garnered from the frontoparietal network when required by task demands.

                The endocannabinoid signalling (ECS) system is a complex lipid signalling pathway that modulates diverse physiological processes in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems. In nematodes, knowledge of endocannabinoid (EC) biology is derived primarily from the free-living model species Caenorhabditis elegans, where ECS has been linked to key aspects of nematode biology. The conservation and complexity of nematode ECS beyond C. elegans is largely uncharacterised, undermining the understanding of ECS biology in nematodes including species with key importance to human, veterinary and plant health. In this study we exploited publicly available omics datasets, in silico bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses to examine the presence, conservation and life-stage expression profiles of EC-effectors across phylum Nematoda. Our data demonstrate that: (i) ECS is broadly conserved across phylum Nematoda, including in therapeutically and agriculturally relevant species; (ii) EC-effectors appear to display clade and lifestyle-specific conservation patterns; (iii) filarial species possess a reduced EC-effector complement; (iv) there are key differences between nematode and vertebrate EC-effectors; (v) life stage-, tissue- and sex-specific EC-effector expression profiles suggest a role for ECS in therapeutically relevant parasitic nematodes. These data also highlight putative novel targets for anthelmintic therapies. To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive characterisation of ECS pathways in phylum Nematoda and inform our understanding of nematode ECS complexity. Fundamental knowledge of nematode ECS systems will seed follow-on functional studies in key nematode parasites to underpin novel drug target discovery efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of UBE3A in the autism and epilepsy-related Dup15q syndrome using patient-derived, CRISPR-corrected neurons</a></h4>

              
                Chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (Dup15q) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by maternal duplications of this region. Autism and epilepsy are key features of Dup15q, but affected individuals also exhibit intellectual disability and developmental delay. UBE3A, the gene encoding the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, is likely a major driver of Dup15q because individuals with maternal, but not paternal 15q duplications have the disorder, and UBE3A is the only imprinted gene expressed solely from the maternal allele in mature neurons. Nevertheless, the exact role of UBE3A is yet to be determined. To establish whether UBE3A overexpression is required for Dup15q neuronal deficits, UBE3A expression was manipulated in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines using antisense oligonucleotides. Dup15q neurons exhibited hyperexcitability features compared to genome-edited isogenic control neurons, and this phenotype was generally prevented by normalizing UBE3A levels throughout in vitro development. Overexpression of UBE3A in an iPSC line with a paternal duplication resulted in a profile similar to that of Dup15q neurons except for synaptic phenotypes. These results indicate that UBE3A overexpression is necessary for most Dup15q cellular phenotypes. However, the inability of UBE3A overexpression to recapitulate synaptic phenotypes suggests an important role for non-imprinted genes in the disorder.

                Meditation has been practised for millennia but the neuroscientific understanding of the dynamics is still lacking. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is an evidence based breathing based meditation technique that utilizes rhythmic breathing to induce a deep state of relaxation and calm. Multiple studies have found benefits of the SKY technique from genetic, physiological, psychological to behaviour levels. We collected Electroencephalographic (EEG) data in 43 subjects who underwent the SKY technique and analysed the brain rhythms at different stages of the technique namely preparatory breathing (Pranayama), rhythmic breathing (Kriya) and meditation (Yoga Nidra) using newly developed methods to analyse periodic and aperiodic components. Alpha waves amplitude in the parieto-occipital region decreased as the rhythmic breathing progressed and dropped sharply during the meditation period. Theta amplitudes and peak frequency increased in the centro-frontal region during the rhythmic breathing period but were marked by sustained low theta waves during the meditation period. The delta wave amplitude was not affected by breathing but both delta band power and peak frequency increased during the meditation period in the centro-frontal region. We also saw a decrease in the 1/f aperiodic signal across the brain during the meditation period suggesting a modification of excitation-inhibition balance. We see an overall slowing down of brain oscillations from alpha to theta to delta as the meditation progressed. The paper studies in depth the transitional dynamics of the SKY technique analysing the alpha, theta, delta waves and aperiodic signals and demonstrates that each phase in a breathing based meditation has a unique electrophysiological signature.

Being able to accurately monitor biological changes underlying neuropathic pain will improve our understanding of neuropathic pain mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive molecular imaging technique that can provide quantitative information of biochemical changes at the whole-body level by using radiolabeled ligands. One important biological change underlying the development of neuropathic pain is the overexpression of 2{delta}-1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels (the target of gabapentin). Thus, we hypothesized that a radiolabeled form of gabapentin may allow imaging changes in 2{delta}-1 for monitoring the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Here, we report the development of two 18F-labeled derivatives of gabapentin (trans-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin and cis-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin) and their evaluation in healthy rats and a rat model of neuropathic pain (spinal nerve ligation model). Both isomers were found to selectively bind to the 2{delta}-1 receptor with trans-4-[18F]fluorogabapentin having a higher affinity. Both tracers displayed around 1.5- to 2-fold increased uptake in injured nerves over the contralateral uninjured nerves when measured by gamma counting ex vivo. Although the small size of the nerves and the signal from surrounding muscle prevented visualizing these changes using PET, this work demonstrates that fluorinated derivatives of gabapentin retain binding to 2{delta}-1 and that their radiolabeled forms can be used to detect pathological changes in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, this work confirms that 2{delta}-1 is a promising target for imaging specific features of neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromodulation of striatal D1 cells shapes BOLD fluctuations in anatomically connected thalamic and cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain's macroscale dynamics are shaped by underlying microscale mechanisms is a key problem in neuroscience. In animal models, we can now investigate this relationship in unprecedented detail by directly manipulating cellular-level properties while measuring the whole-brain response using resting-state fMRI. Here we focused on understanding how blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) dynamics, measured within a structurally well-defined striato-thalamo-cortical circuit, are shaped by chemogenetically exciting or inhibiting D1 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the right dorsomedial striatum (CPdm). We characterize changes in both the BOLD dynamics of individual cortical and subcortical brain areas, and patterns of inter-regional coupling (functional connectivity) between pairs of areas. Using a classification approach based on a large and diverse set of time-series properties, we found that CPdm neuromodulation alters BOLD dynamics within thalamic subregions that project back to dorsomedial striatum. In the cortex, the strongest changes in local dynamics were observed in unimodal regions, i.e., regions that process information from a single sensory modality, while changes in the local dynamics weakened along a putative cortical hierarchical gradient towards transmodal regions. In contrast, a decrease in functional connectivity was observed only for cortico-striatal connections after D1 excitation. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of how targeted cellular-level manipulations affect local BOLD dynamics at the macroscale, including the role of a circuit's structural characteristics and hierarchical cortical level in shaping those dynamics. These findings contribute to ongoing attempts to understand the influence of structure-function relationships in shaping inter regional communication at subcortical and cortical levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Organization of thalamocortical structural covariance and a corresponding 3D atlas of the mouse thalamus</a></h4>

              
                For information from sensory organs to be processed by the brain, it is usually passed to appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex. Almost all of this information passes through the thalamus, a relay structure that reciprocally connects to the vast majority of the cortex. The thalamus facilitates this information transfer through a set of thalamocortical connections that vary in cellular structure, molecular profiles, innervation patterns, and firing rates. Additionally, corticothalamic connections allow for intracortical information transfer through the thalamus. These efferent and afferent connections between the thalamus and cortex have been the focus of many studies, and the importance of cortical connectivity in defining thalamus anatomy is demonstrated by multiple studies that parcellate the thalamus based on cortical connectivity profiles. Here, we examine correlated morphological variation between the thalamus and cortex, or thalamocortical structural covariance. For each voxel in the thalamus as a seed, we construct a cortical structural covariance map that represents correlated cortical volume variation, and examine whether high structural covariance is observed in cortical areas that are functionally relevant to the seed. Then, using these cortical structural covariance maps as features, we subdivide the thalamus into six non-overlapping regions (clusters of voxels), and assess whether cortical structural covariance is associated with cortical connectivity that specifically originates from these regions. We show that cortical structural covariance is high in areas of the cortex that are functionally related to the seed voxel, cortical structural covariance varies along cortical depth, and sharp transitions in cortical structural covariance profiles are observed when varying seed locations in the thalamus. Subdividing the thalamus based on structural covariance, we additionally demonstrate that the six thalamic clusters of voxels stratify cortical structural covariance along the dorsal-ventral, medial-lateral, and anterior-posterior axes. These cluster-associated structural covariance patterns are prominently detected in cortical regions innervated by fibers projecting out of their related thalamic subdivisions. Together, these results advance our understanding of how the thalamus and the cortex couple in their volumes. Our results indicate that these volume correlations reflect functional organization and structural connectivity, and further provides a novel segmentation of the mouse thalamus that can be used to examine thalamic structural variation and thalamocortical structural covariation in disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Trem2*R47H mouse model without cryptic splicing drives age- and disease-dependent tissue damage and synaptic loss in response to plaques</a></h4>

              
                Genome-Wide Association Studies revealed the TREM2 R47H variant as one of the strongest genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Unfortunately, many current TREM2*R47H mouse models are associated with cryptic mRNA splicing of the mutant allele that produces a confounding reduction in protein product. We have developed the Trem2R47H NSS (Normal Splice Site) mouse model where the Trem2 allele is expressed at a similar level to the wild-type Trem2 allele, without evidence of cryptic splicing products, and appropriate inflammatory responses to cuprizone challenge. Utilizing the 5xFAD mouse model, we report age- and disease-dependent changes in response to pathology. At an early disease stage (4 mo), homozygous Trem2R47H NSS; hemizygous 5xFAD (Trem2R47H NSS ; 5xFAD) mice have reduced size and number of microglia plus impaired interaction with plaques, that is associated with increased dystrophic neurites and axonal damage detected through plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) level and suppressed inflammation. However, homozygosity for Trem2R47H NSS suppressed LTP deficits and presynaptic puncta loss caused by the 5xFAD transgene array. At a more advanced disease stage (12 mo,) Trem2R47H NSS ; 5xFAD mice no longer display impaired plaque-microglia interaction or suppressed inflammatory gene expression, although NfL levels remain elevated, and a unique interferon-related gene expression signature is seen. Furthermore, (age) Trem2R47H NSS ; 5xFAD mice also display robust LTP deficits and exacerbated presynaptic loss. Collectively, we provide a Trem2R47H variant mouse without cryptic splicing, and demonstrate it has disease stage dependent effects when combined with a plaque bearing model, with an initial loss of function that ultimately resolves, giving rise to a unique interferon signature and associated tissue damage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular stress in brain organoids is limited to a distinct and bioinformatically removable subpopulation.</a></h4>

              
                Organoids enable disease modeling in complex and structured human tissue, in vitro. Like most 3D models, they lack sufficient oxygen supply, leading to cellular stress. These negative effects are particularly prominent in complex models, like brain organoids, where they can prevent proper lineage commitment. Here, we analyze brain organoid and fetal single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from published and new datasets totaling over 190,000 cells. We describe a unique stress signature found in all organoid samples, but not in fetal samples. We demonstrate that cell stress is limited to a defined organoid cell population, and present Gruffi, an algorithm that uses granular functional filtering to identify and remove stressed cells from any organoid scRNAseq dataset in an unbiased manner. Our data show that adverse effects of cell stress can be corrected by bioinformatic analysis, improving developmental trajectories and resemblance to fetal data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BLMM: Parallelised Computing for Big Linear Mixed Models</a></h4>

              
                Within neuroimaging large-scale, shared datasets are becoming increasingly commonplace, challenging existing tools both in terms of overall scale and complexity of the study designs. As sample sizes grow, researchers are presented with new opportunities to detect and account for grouping factors and covariance structure present in large experimental designs. In particular, standard linear model methods cannot account for the covariance and grouping structures present in large datasets, and the existing linear mixed models (LMM) tools are neither scalable nor exploit the computational speed-ups afforded by vectorisation of computations over voxels. Further, nearly all existing tools for imaging (fixed or mixed effect) do not account for variability in the patterns of missing data near cortical boundaries and the edge of the brain, and instead omit any voxels with any missing data. Yet in the large-n setting, such a voxel-wise deletion missing data strategy leads to severe shrinkage of the final analysis mask. To counter these issues, we describe the "Big" Linear Mixed Models (BLMM) toolbox, an efficient Python package for large-scale fMRI LMM analyses. BLMM is designed for use on high performance computing clusters and utilizes a Fisher Scoring procedure made possible by derivations for the LMM Fisher information matrix and score vectors derived in our previous work, Maullin-Sapey and Nichols (2021).

                Odors are intimately tied to the taste system to aid food selection and determine the sensory experience of food. However, how smell and taste are integrated in the nervous system to drive feeding behavior remains largely unknown. We show in Drosophila that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not the olfactory organs. Calcium imaging shows that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by specific olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.

	<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is highly prevalent in the post-stroke population, and has been shown to affect cognitive, neurological, and functional status. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is one of the most effective interventions for obstructive sleep apnea, but compliance is often low due to confounding effects of co-occurring conditions, side effects of treatment titration procedures, and individual patient personality characteristics, perceptions, and social factors. Current research suggests that CPAP treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is not associated with significant risk and can subsequently improve post-stroke motor and neurocognitive function. However, effects of CPAP treatment on post-stroke speech and language recovery remain unclear. Post-stroke communication disorders (e.g., aphasia, dysarthria, and apraxia) are also highly prevalent in this population. Knowledge of the potential positive impact of CPAP on language recovery could contribute to patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motivation to comply with CPAP treatment and provide incentive for speech-language pathologists to refer patients to sleep medicine specialists. In this review of the literature, we examine the question of what effect CPAP treatment may have on post-stroke speech and language function and recovery, as well as summarize the current knowledge on cognitive, neurological, and functional effects. While this review of the literature found CPAP to have varying effects on different cognitive domains, there was not sufficient evidence to determine effects on language recovery. Further research is necessary to determine the potential effects of CPAP treatment on speech and language recovery among stroke patients.</p>

	<p>The objective of this study was to characterize network-level changes in nonfluent/agrammatic Primary Progressive Aphasia (agPPA) and Primary Progressive Apraxia of Speech (PPAOS) with graph theory (GT) measures derived from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. EEGs of 15 agPPA and 7 PPAOS patients were collected during relaxed wakefulness with eyes closed (21 electrodes, 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 positions, 256 Hz sampling rate, 1&amp;amp;ndash;200 Hz bandpass filter). Eight artifact-free, non-overlapping 1024-point epochs were selected. Via Brainwave software, GT weighted connectivity and minimum spanning tree (MST) measures were calculated for theta and upper and lower alpha frequency bands. Differences in GT and MST measures between agPPA and PPAOS were assessed with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Of greatest interest, Spearman correlations were computed between behavioral and network measures in all frequency bands across all patients. There were no statistically significant differences in GT or MST measures between agPPA and PPAOS. There were significant correlations between several network and behavioral variables. The correlations demonstrate a relationship between reduced global efficiency and clinical symptom severity (e.g., parkinsonism, AOS). This preliminary, exploratory study demonstrates potential for EEG GT measures to quantify network changes associated with degenerative speech&amp;amp;ndash;language disorders.</p>

	<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric illness that disproportionately affects military personnel, veterans, and public safety personnel (PSP). Evidence demonstrates that PTSD is significantly associated with difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) and difficulties with cognitive functioning, including difficulties with attention, working memory, and executive functioning. A wide body of evidence suggests a dynamic interplay among cognitive dysfunction, difficulties with ER, and symptoms of PTSD, where numerous studies have identified overlapping patterns of alterations in activation among neuroanatomical regions and neural circuitry. Little work has examined interventions that may target these symptoms collectively. The primary objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel experimental design was to assess the effectiveness of goal management training (GMT), a cognitive remediation intervention, in reducing difficulties with cognitive functioning, and to determine its effects on PTSD symptoms and symptoms associated with PTSD, including difficulties with ER, dissociation, and functioning among military personnel, veterans, and PSP. Forty-two military personnel, veterans, and PSP between the ages of 18 and 70 with symptoms of PTSD were recruited across Ontario, Canada between October 2017 and August 2019. Participants were randomized to either the waitlist (WL) (n = 18) or the GMT (n = 22) condition. Participants in both conditions received self-report measures and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Following their completion of the 3-month follow-up, participants in the WL condition were given the opportunity to participate in GMT. Assessors and participants were blind to intervention allocation during the initial assessment. A series of 2 (time) &amp;amp;times; 2 (group) ANOVAs were conducted to assess the differences between the WL and GMT conditions from pre- to post-intervention for the self-report and neuropsychological measures. The results demonstrated significant improvements in measures of executive functioning (e.g., verbal fluency, planning, impulsivity, cognitive shifting, and discrimination of targets) and trending improvements in short-term declarative memory for participants in the GMT condition. Participants in the GMT condition also demonstrated significant improvements from pre- to post-testing in measures of subjective cognition, functioning, PTSD symptom severity, difficulties with ER, dissociative symptom severity, and depression and anxiety symptoms. No adverse effects were reported as a result of participating in GMT. The results of this pilot RCT show promise that GMT may be a useful intervention to improve symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, symptoms of PTSD, and symptoms associated with PTSD within military personnel, veterans, and PSP. Future work is needed to address the small sample size and the durability of these findings.</p>

	<p>Patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) can improve some non-motor symptoms (NMS) after starting treatment with opicapone. The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of opicapone on global NMS burden in PD. OPEN-PD (Opicapone Effectiveness on Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease) is a prospective open-label single-arm study conducted in 5 centers from Spain. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (V0) to the end of the observational period (6 months &amp;amp;plusmn; 30 days) (V2) in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) total score. Different scales were used for analyzing the change in motor, NMS, quality of life (QoL), and disability. Thirty-three patients were included between JUL/2019 and JUN/2021 (age 63.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.91; 60.6% males; 7.48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.22 years from symptoms onset). At 6 months, 30 patients completed the follow-up (90.9%). The NMSS total score was reduced by 27.3% (from 71.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 37.12 at V0 to 52.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 34.76 at V2; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size = &amp;amp;minus;0.97; p = 0.002). By domains, improvement was observed in sleep/fatigue (&amp;amp;minus;40.1%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), mood/apathy (&amp;amp;minus;46.6%; p = 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (&amp;amp;minus;20.7%; p = 0.029), and miscellaneous (&amp;amp;minus;44.94%; p = 0.021). QoL also improved with a 18.4% reduction in the 39-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire Summary Index (from 26.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.61 at V0 to 21.75 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.9 at V2; p = 0.001). A total of 13 adverse events in 11 patients (33.3%) were reported, 1 of which was severe (not related to opicapone). Dyskinesias and nausea were the most frequent (6.1%). Opicapone is well tolerated and improves global NMS burden and QoL in PD patients at 6 months.</p>

	<p>Eating disorders (EDs) are serious, life-threatening psychiatric conditions associated with physical and psychosocial impairment, as well as high morbidity and mortality. Given the chronic refractory nature of EDs and the paucity of evidence-based treatments, there is a pressing need to identify novel approaches for this population. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist, ketamine, has recently been approved for treatment-resistant depression, exerting rapid and robust antidepressant effects. It is now being investigated for several new indications, including obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive, post-traumatic, and substance use disorder, and shows transdiagnostic potential for EDs, particularly among clinical nonresponders. Hence, the aim of this review is to examine contemporary findings on the treatment of EDs with ketamine, whether used as a primary, adjunctive, or combination psychopharmacotherapy. Avenues for future research are also discussed. Overall, results are encouraging and point to therapeutic value; however, are limited to case series and reports on anorexia nervosa. Further empirical research is thus needed to explore ketamine efficacy across ED subgroups, establish safety profiles and optimize dosing, and develop theory-driven, targeted treatment strategies at the individual patient level.</p>

	<p>Background: The locus coeruleus (LC) plays a critical role in modulating emotional memory performance via widespread connections to the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Interestingly, both the LC and MTL are affected during aging. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether worry during cognitive aging changes the relationship between memory performance and the neural activity patterns during an emotional memory task. Methods: Twenty-eight participants aged 60&amp;amp;ndash;83 years from the Maastricht Aging study conducted an emotional mnemonic discrimination task during a 7T fMRI-scan. We performed a robust multiple linear regression to examine the association between worry and mnemonic memory performance under different levels of arousal. Subsequently, we examined if worry modifies the relationship between neuronal activity and mnemonic memory performance. Results: We observed that under low arousal, only participants with low compared to high levels of worry benefitted from additional LC activity. Under high arousal, additional LC activity was associated with lower mnemonic memory performance. Conclusion: Our results suggest there might be an optimal involvement of the NA-system for optimal memory discrimination performance, as we observed that under low levels of worry and with lower levels of arousal, higher LC activity might be needed to achieve similar levels of optimal memory performance as achieved under higher arousal when LC activity remained lower.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a common brain disorder characterized by a heterogenous etiology. Its main features are recurrent seizures. Despite many clinical studies, about 30% of cases are refractory to treatment. Recent studies suggested the important role of immune-system elements in its pathogenesis. It was suggested that a deregulated inflammatory process may lead to aberrant neural connectivity and the hyperexcitability of the neuronal network. The aim of our study was the analysis of the expression of inflammatory mediators in a mouse model of epilepsy and their impact on the neurodegeneration process located in the brain. We used the KA-induced model of epilepsy in SJL/J mice and performed the analysis of gene expression and protein levels. We observed the upregulation of IL1&amp;amp;beta; and CXCL12 in the early phase of KA-induced epilepsy and elevated levels of CCL5 at a later time point, compared with control animals. The most important result obtained in our study is the elevation of CXCL2 expression at both studied time points and its correlation with the neurodegeneration observed in mouse brain. Increasing experimental and clinical data suggest the influence of peripheral inflammation on epileptogenesis. Thus, studies focused on the molecular markers of neuroinflammation are of great value and may help deepen our knowledge about epilepsy, leading to the discovery of new drugs.</p>

                <p>Understanding the human brain is a "Grand Challenge" for 21st century research. Computational approaches enable large and complex datasets to be addressed efficiently, supported by artificial neural networks, modeling and simulation. Dynamic generative multiscale models, which enable the investigation of causation across scales and are guided by principles and theories of brain function, are instrumental for linking brain structure and function. An example of a resource enabling such an integrated approach to neuroscientific discovery is the BigBrain, which spatially anchors tissue models and data across different scales and ensures that multiscale models are supported by the data, making the bridge to both basic neuroscience and medicine. Research at the intersection of neuroscience, computing and robotics has the potential to advance neuro-inspired technologies by taking advantage of a growing body of insights into perception, plasticity and learning. To render data, tools and methods, theories, basic principles and concepts interoperable, the Human Brain Project (HBP) has launched EBRAINS, a digital neuroscience research infrastructure, which brings together a transdisciplinary community of researchers united by the quest to understand the brain, with fascinating insights and perspectives for societal benefits.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Here, we reveal an unbiased view of the brain regions that provide specific inputs to aromatase-expressing cells in the medial amygdala, neurons that play an outsized role in the production of sex-specific social behaviors, using rabies tracing and light sheet microscopy. While the downstream projections from these cells are known, the specific inputs to the aromatase-expressing cells in the medial amygdala remained unknown. We observed established connections to the medial amygdala (e.g., bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and accessory olfactory bulb) indicating that aromatase neurons are a major target cell type for efferent input including from regions associated with parenting and aggression. We also identified novel and unexpected inputs from areas involved in metabolism, fear and anxiety, and memory and cognition. These results confirm the central role of the medial amygdala in sex-specific social recognition and social behavior, and point to an expanded role for its aromatase-expressing neurons in the integration of multiple sensory and homeostatic factors, which are likely used to modulate many other social behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Individualized Assays of Temporal Coding in the Ascending Human Auditory System</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural phase-locking to temporal fluctuations is a fundamental and unique mechanism by which acoustic information is encoded by the auditory system. The perceptual role of this metabolically expensive mechanism, the neural phase-locking to temporal fine structure (TFS) in particular, is debated. Although hypothesized, it is unclear whether auditory perceptual deficits in certain clinical populations are attributable to deficits in TFS coding. Efforts to uncover the role of TFS have been impeded by the fact that there are no established assays for quantifying the fidelity of TFS coding at the individual level. While many candidates have been proposed, for an assay to be useful, it should not only intrinsically depend on TFS coding, but should also have the property that individual differences in the assay reflect TFS coding per se over and beyond other sources of variance. Here, we evaluate a range of behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures as candidate individualized measures of TFS sensitivity. Our comparisons of behavioral and EEG-based metrics suggest that extraneous variables dominate both behavioral scores and EEG amplitude metrics, rendering them ineffective. After adjusting behavioral scores using lapse rates, and extracting latency or percent-growth metrics from EEG, interaural timing sensitivity measures exhibit robust behavior-EEG correlations. Together with the fact that unambiguous theoretical links can be made relating binaural measures and phase-locking to TFS, our results suggest that these "adjusted" binaural assays may be well suited for quantifying individual TFS processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Pupil Correlates of Decision Variables in Mice Playing a Competitive Mixed-Strategy Game</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a competitive game involving an animal and an opponent, the outcome is contingent on the choices of both players. To succeed, the animal must continually adapt to competitive pressure, or else risk being exploited and lose out on rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed male mice can be trained to play the iterative competitive game "matching pennies" against a virtual computer opponent. We find that the animals&rsquo; performance is well described by a hybrid computational model that includes Q-learning and choice kernels. Comparing between matching pennies and a non-competitive two-armed bandit task, we show that the tasks encourage animals to operate at different regimes of reinforcement learning. To understand the involvement of neuromodulatory mechanisms, we measure fluctuations in pupil size and use multiple linear regression to relate the trial-by-trial transient pupil responses to decision-related variables. The analysis reveals that pupil responses are modulated by observable variables, including choice and outcome, as well as latent variables for value updating, but not action selection. Collectively, these results establish a paradigm for studying competitive decision-making in head-fixed mice and provide insights into the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation in the decision process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Intrinsic Sources and Functional Impacts of Asymmetry at Electrical Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Electrical synapses couple inhibitory neurons across the brain, underlying a variety of functions that are modifiable by activity. Despite recent advances, many functions and contributions of electrical synapses within neural circuitry remain underappreciated. Among these are the sources and impacts of electrical synapse asymmetry. Using multi-compartmental models of neurons coupled through dendritic electrical synapses, we investigated intrinsic factors that contribute to effective synaptic asymmetry and that result in modulation of spike timing and synchrony between coupled cells. We show that electrical synapse location along a dendrite, input resistance, internal dendritic resistance, or directional conduction of the electrical synapse itself each alter asymmetry as measured by coupling between cell somas. Conversely, we note that asymmetrical gap junction (GJ) conductance can be masked by each of these properties. Furthermore, we show that asymmetry modulates spike timing and latency of coupled cells by up to tens of milliseconds, depending on direction of conduction or dendritic location of the electrical synapse. Coordination of rhythmic activity between two cells also depends on asymmetry. These simulations illustrate that causes of asymmetry are diverse, may not be apparent in somatic measurements of electrical coupling, influence dendritic processing, and produce a variety of outcomes on spiking and synchrony of coupled cells. Our findings highlight aspects of electrical synapses that should always be included in experimental demonstrations of coupling, and when assembling simulated networks containing electrical synapses.</p>

                Background: High corn production and consumption in Indonesia have led to massive corn husk waste. To increase the economic value of corn husk waste, innovations have utilized its silica content as an alternative source for the synthesis of multifunctional silica compounds. Methods: In this research, silica xerogel was successfully synthesized from corn husk via the sol-gel method. Its physical properties and capabilities as an adsorbent to remove cationic dyes such as crystal violet and methylene blue in wastewater were investigated for the first time. Results: The as-synthesized silica xerogel possesses an amorphous crystal structure with an average pore diameter of 6.35 nm, a Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area of 363.72 m2/g, and particle size ranging from 80 to 250 μm. The optimum contact times of silica xerogel are 90 minutes for crystal violet and 120 minutes for methylene blue adsorptions. While at the same time, the dye removal efficiencies are as high as 98.539% and 96.184%, respectively. The adsorption of both crystal violet and methylene blue on silica xerogel follows the Langmuir isotherm model and exhibits a high monolayer capacity of 69.44 mg/g and 59.17 mg/g, respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest the great potential of silica xerogel synthesized from corn husk as a low-cost and effective cationic dye adsorbent.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay among positive and negative symptoms, neurocognition, social cognition, and functioning in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia: a network analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizophrenia has a broad range of interrelated symptoms and impairment in functioning. The objective of the study was to explore the interplay between positive symptoms, negative symptoms, neurocognition, social cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia using network analysis. Methods: Participants were 64 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. Psychopathologic, neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome were measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III, Faces test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, and Personal Social Performance scale. Results: The network analysis suggested that functional outcome was the most central in the network followed by avolition and asociality. Functioning was directly connected to avolition, asociality, blunted affect, neurocognition and emotion recognition. The positive symptoms were the most remote and therefore the least important node. Conclusion: The high centrality of functioning suggests the need for improving of everyday life skills for patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, treatment of specific negative symptoms, neurocognition and emotion recognition could also enhance functional outcome.

                Background: The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in the Elderly defined sarcopenia as a geriatric syndrome with a diagnostic criteria of low skeletal muscle mass (LMM). Various sarcopenia consensuses recommend as cut-offs for LMM, the use of below 2 SDs from the mean skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) of a young reference group. Given the contrast between reported cut-offs, the objective of this study was to establish cut-offs for LMM from older adults in Manizales and compare them with those published in the literature. Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional analytical study in 237 healthy elderly patients from the city of Manizales, Colombia. Anthropometric measurements of weight, height and body mass index were estimated. The SMI was estimated with the Xitron Technologies bioimpedance meter using the Janssen formula. For the comparison of SMI cut-offs, studies that evaluated this parameter with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were taken into account, in addition to being obtained from the −2 SD from the sex-specific mean of a young reference group. Results: The cut-off points for SMI were 8.0 kg/m2 for men and 6.1 kg/m2 for women. There was a statistically significant difference when evaluating LMM from the cut-offs of the present study and those reported in Spain, Turkey, and Finland. The cut-off points of SMI derived from this sample of Colombian men and women may be adequate for the diagnosis in the Colombian geriatric population. However, we did not find significant differences when comparing the cut-offs for SMI from a population of older adults and young adults from the same city. Conclusions: The cut-off points of SMI by BIA derived from a sample of Colombian men and women may be adequate for the diagnosis of LMM in the Colombian geriatric population or populations with similar characteristics to those of the sample evaluated here.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of acute L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The oral administration of L-arginine has been related to improved physical performance due to a likely reduction in muscle fatigue, resulting from the vasodilator effect of nitric oxide on skeletal muscle. However, there is no precise and quantitative analysis of the information in the literature. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training with a systematic review and meta-analysis. We hypothesized that L-arginine supplementation would improve performance capacity and the effects involved in strength training. Methods: The study period was from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion process established articles with well-designed human experiments that included only L-arginine supplementation (without any additional compounds) testing the effects of L-arginine supplementation on sports performance related to strength training; identical experimental conditions in placebo or control group; and publications in the last ten years (until December 31, 2020). Three studies were included that compared L-arginine supplementation with placebo in anaerobic performance tests. Test analysis supplementation with other supplements was removed and there was no gender, age, and ethnicity level. Results: There was no significant heterogeneity (p>0.05) in the analysis of the three selected articles and the effects of L-arginine supplementation in muscular endurance; performance had a mean of 0.26 (95% CI = -0.129; 0.649; p = 0.190), peak torque with a mean of -0.002 (95% CI = -0.531; 0.527; p = 0. 99) of the third series of exercises and, furthermore, when comparing the integrated effect (resistance rate with the peak torque) there was no difference with a mean of 0.168 (95% CI = -0.145; 0.481; p = 0.292). Conclusions: Acute L-arginine supplementation provides no ergogenic effect on strength training performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health consequences of COVID-19 in house staff physicians [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was associated with a newly identified respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across the globe, imposing increased working hours and workloads for healthcare workers. We have evaluated the prevalence of mental health outcomes and associated factors in house staff physicians in Panama. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken from July 23, 2020, to August 13, 2020. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. Then, an electronic questionnaire with scales to evaluate anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R) was administered. In addition, socio-demographic variables, clinical history of mental disorders and COVID-19 exposure were evaluated. Independent analyses for each mental health outcome were undertaken using a logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 517/1,205 (42.9%) interns and residents were recruited nationwide. The overall prevalence of depression symptoms was 25.3%, 13.7% for anxiety and 12.2% for post-traumatic stress. At least 9.3% participants reported having suicidal ideation. The most parsimonious model showed females had a higher prevalence of mental health disorders across results, and married participants were more likely to present depression (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03-2.91; P = 0.039) or at least one mental health disorder (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.68; P = 0.039). Conclusions: A high prevalence of mental health disorders was found, showing the need to mitigate this emotional burden among healthcare workers in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic physical illness: A single institutional cross-sectional study from Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Depression is a global public health problem. Studies show comorbid depression increases morbidity, mortality, and associated risk of poor adherence compared to those without depression. Materials and Method An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 326 patients who met the inclusion criteria. They were selected following simple random sampling from medical OPD and ward of Shree Birendra Hospital Kathmandu, Nepal.  Semi-structured interview schedule (SSIS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Kuppuswamy’s Scale (KS) were used for data collection. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 26 and STATA version 15. Simple frequency distribution of attributes presented in tables and association assessed using Chi-square/ Fisher’s exact test. Further, the relation between depression and other independent factors is quantified using multivariate/ multivariable logistics regression analyses. Result Using Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) as a tool to determine depression 52.1% (n=170) had minimal or no depression, 16.9% (n=55) had mild depression, 18.7 %( n=61) had moderate depression and 12.3% (n=40) had severe depression i.e. 47.9% of population had some form of depression. Prevalence of depression among patient with single comorbidity found to be 30.9% (n=25, N=81) for hypertension, 43.3% (n=13, N=30) for diabetes mellitus, 45.6% (n=31, N=68) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 77.5% (n=31, N=40) for chronic kidney disease, and 60 %( n=9, N=15) for chronic heart disease. Depression among patient with multiple comorbidities (more than one disease above mention) was found to be 51.1% (n=47, N=92). Prevalence of depression was more among patients with history of longer duration of illness; 11 years and above 52.9 % (n=36, N=68); 6-10 years 48.3 % (n=43, N=89); 1-5 years 45.6 %( n=77, N=169). Conclusion This study showed that the prevalence of depression has a significant relationship with the duration of illness. Therefore, early recognition and treatment play a crucial role in reducing the effects of depression.

                The term “noetic” comes from the Greek word noēsis/noētikos that means inner wisdom, direct knowing, intuition, or implicit understanding. Strong cultural taboos exist about sharing these experiences. Thus, many may not feel comfortable transparently discussing or researching these topics, despite growing evidence that these experiences may be real. The study’s objective was to qualitatively evaluate first-hand accounts of noetic experiences. 521 English-speaking adults from around the world completed an online survey that collected demographic data and four open-ended questions about noetic experiences. Thematic analysis was used to characterize the data. The ten most used codes were expressing to or sharing with others, impacting decision-making, intuition/”just knowing,” meditation/hypnosis, inner visions, setting intentions/getting into the “state,” healing others, writing for self, and inner voice. There were five main themes identified: 1. Ways of Engagement; 2. Ways of Knowing; 3. Types of Information; 4. Ways of Affecting; and 5. Ways of Expressing. Subthemes. Future research will include investigating the nuances of these themes and also establishing standardized methods for evaluating them. This would also then inform curricula and therapies to support people in these experiences.

                Background: Protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency (VAD) are the most important public health issues, and a food-based strategy is crucial to combat those health problems among the vulnerable group of people. Methods: Composite biscuits were made with 100:0:0, 90:5:5, 80:10:10, 70:15:15, 60:20:20, and 50:25:25 percent wheat, haricot bean, and orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) flours.Standard methods were used to evaluate the proximate compositions, β-carotene, physical properties, functional properties, and sensory acceptability. A one-way analysis of variance model was used to statistically evaluate the data using the statistical analysis system software package, version 9.0 standard methods. Results: The results showed that partially replacing wheat with haricot beans and OFSP increased the β-carotene and proximate compositions significantly. When wheat was replaced with haricot beans and OFSP, the physical characteristics of the biscuits did not vary significantly from those of biscuits made entirely of wheat flour. Sensory acceptability (appearance, color, flavor, taste and overall acceptability) was higher in the composite biscuits with up to 40% wheat substitution than in the 100% wheat flour biscuits. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this report, replacing wheat with OFSP and haricot beans in biscuit formulation appears to be promising in improving nutritional quality, sensory acceptability, and beta carotene. It is proposed that these products can mitigate food insecurity and deficiency of vitamin A.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The ability to classify patients based on gene-expression data varies by algorithm and performance metric</a></h4>

By classifying patients into subgroups, clinicians can provide more effective care than using a uniform approach for all patients. Such subgroups might include patients with a particular disease subtype, patients with a good (or poor) prognosis, or patients most (or least) likely to respond to a particular therapy. Transcriptomic measurements reflect the downstream effects of genomic and epigenomic variations. However, high-throughput technologies generate thousands of measurements per patient, and complex dependencies exist among genes, so it may be infeasible to classify patients using traditional statistical models. Machine-learning classification algorithms can help with this problem. However, hundreds of classification algorithms exist—and most support diverse hyperparameters—so it is difficult for researchers to know which are optimal for gene-expression biomarkers. We performed a benchmark comparison, applying 52 classification algorithms to 50 gene-expression datasets (143 class variables). We evaluated algorithms that represent diverse machine-learning methodologies and have been implemented in general-purpose, open-source, machine-learning libraries. When available, we combined clinical predictors with gene-expression data. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of performing hyperparameter optimization and feature selection using nested cross validation. Kernel- and ensemble-based algorithms consistently outperformed other types of classification algorithms; however, even the top-performing algorithms performed poorly in some cases. Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection typically improved predictive performance, and univariate feature-selection algorithms typically outperformed more sophisticated methods. Together, our findings illustrate that algorithm performance varies considerably when other factors are held constant and thus that algorithm selection is a critical step in biomarker studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating genetic variance contributed by a quantitative trait locus: A random model approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shibo Wang, Fangjie Xie, Shizhong Xu</p>

Detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) and estimating QTL variances (represented by the squared QTL effects) are two main goals of QTL mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, there are issues associated with estimated QTL variances and such issues have not attracted much attention from the QTL mapping community. Estimated QTL variances are usually biased upwards due to estimation being associated with significance tests. The phenomenon is called the Beavis effect. However, estimated variances of QTL without significance tests can also be biased upwards, which cannot be explained by the Beavis effect; rather, this bias is due to the fact that QTL variances are often estimated as the squares of the estimated QTL effects. The parameters are the QTL effects and the estimated QTL variances are obtained by squaring the estimated QTL effects. This square transformation failed to incorporate the errors of estimated QTL effects into the transformation. The consequence is biases in estimated QTL variances. To correct the biases, we can either reformulate the QTL model by treating the QTL effect as random and directly estimate the QTL variance (as a variance component) or adjust the bias by taking into account the error of the estimated QTL effect. A moment method of estimation has been proposed to correct the bias. The method has been validated via Monte Carlo simulation studies. The method has been applied to QTL mapping for the 10-week-body-weight trait from an F<sub>2</sub> mouse population.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterization of intrinsically disordered regions in proteins informed by human genetic diversity</a></h4>

All proteomes contain both proteins and polypeptide segments that don’t form a defined three-dimensional structure yet are biologically active—called intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs and IDRs). Most of these IDPs/IDRs lack useful functional annotation limiting our understanding of their importance for organism fitness. Here we characterized IDRs using protein sequence annotations of functional sites and regions available in the UniProt knowledgebase (“UniProt features”: active site, ligand-binding pocket, regions mediating protein-protein interactions, etc.). By measuring the statistical enrichment of twenty-five UniProt features in 981 IDRs of 561 human proteins, we identified eight features that are commonly located in IDRs. We then collected the genetic variant data from the general population and patient-based databases and evaluated the prevalence of population and pathogenic variations in IDPs/IDRs. We observed that some IDRs tolerate 2 to 12-times more single amino acid-substituting missense mutations than synonymous changes in the general population. However, we also found that 37% of all germline pathogenic mutations are located in disordered regions of 96 proteins. Based on the observed-to-expected frequency of mutations, we categorized 34 IDRs in 20 proteins (DDX3X, KIT, RB1, etc.) as intolerant to mutation. Finally, using statistical analysis and a machine learning approach, we demonstrate that mutation-intolerant IDRs carry a distinct signature of functional features. Our study presents a novel approach to assign functional importance to IDRs by leveraging the wealth of available genetic data, which will aid in a deeper understating of the role of IDRs in biological processes and disease mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep inference of seabird dives from GPS-only records: Performance and generalization properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amédée Roy, Sophie Lanco Bertrand, Ronan Fablet</p>

At-sea behaviour of seabirds have received significant attention in ecology over the last decades as it is a key process in the ecology and fate of these populations. It is also, through the position of top predator that these species often occupy, a relevant and integrative indicator of the dynamics of the marine ecosystems they rely on. Seabird trajectories are recorded through the deployment of GPS, and a variety of statistical approaches have been tested to infer probable behaviours from these location data. Recently, deep learning tools have shown promising results for the segmentation and classification of animal behaviour from trajectory data. Yet, these approaches have not been widely used and investigation is still needed to identify optimal network architecture and to demonstrate their generalization properties. From a database of about 300 foraging trajectories derived from GPS data deployed simultaneously with pressure sensors for the identification of dives, this work has benchmarked deep neural network architectures trained in a supervised manner for the prediction of dives from trajectory data. It first confirms that deep learning allows better dive prediction than usual methods such as Hidden Markov Models. It also demonstrates the generalization properties of the trained networks for inferring dives distribution for seabirds from other colonies and ecosystems. In particular, convolutional networks trained on Peruvian boobies from a specific colony show great ability to predict dives of boobies from other colonies and from distinct ecosystems. We further investigate accross-species generalization using a transfer learning strategy known as ‘fine-tuning’. Starting from a convolutional network pre-trained on Guanay cormorant data reduced by two the size of the dataset needed to accurately predict dives in a tropical booby from Brazil. We believe that the networks trained in this study will provide relevant starting point for future fine-tuning works for seabird trajectory segmentation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Automatic wound detection and size estimation using deep learning algorithms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Héctor Carrión, Mohammad Jafari, Michelle Dawn Bagood, Hsin-ya Yang, Roslyn Rivkah Isseroff, Marcella Gomez</p>

Evaluating and tracking wound size is a fundamental metric for the wound assessment process. Good location and size estimates can enable proper diagnosis and effective treatment. Traditionally, laboratory wound healing studies include a collection of images at uniform time intervals exhibiting the wounded area and the healing process in the test animal, often a mouse. These images are then manually observed to determine key metrics —such as wound size progress— relevant to the study. However, this task is a time-consuming and laborious process. In addition, defining the wound edge could be subjective and can vary from one individual to another even among experts. Furthermore, as our understanding of the healing process grows, so does our need to efficiently and accurately track these key factors for high throughput (e.g., over large-scale and long-term experiments). Thus, in this study, we develop a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that aims to intake non-uniform wound images and extract relevant information such as the location of interest, wound only image crops, and wound periphery size over-time metrics. In particular, our work focuses on images of wounded laboratory mice that are used widely for translationally relevant wound studies and leverages a commonly used ring-shaped splint present in most images to predict wound size. We apply the method to a dataset that was never meant to be quantified and, thus, presents many visual challenges. Additionally, the data set was not meant for training deep learning models and so is relatively small in size with only 256 images. We compare results to that of expert measurements and demonstrate preservation of information relevant to predicting wound closure despite variability from machine-to-expert and even expert-to-expert. The proposed system resulted in high fidelity results on unseen data with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, the pipeline estimates acceptable wound sizes when less than 50% of the images are missing reference objects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated human chromosome segmentation and feature extraction: Current trends and prospects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Automated human chromosome segmentation and feature extraction aim to improve the overall quality of genetic disorder diagnosis by addressing the limitations of tedious manual processes such as expertise dependence, time-inefficiency, observer variability and fatigue errors. Nevertheless, significant differences caused by staining methods, chromosome damage which may occur during imaging, cell and staining debris, inhomogeneity, weak boundaries, morphological variations, premature sister chromatid separation, as well as the presence of overlapping, touching, di-centric and bent chromosomes pose challenges in automated human chromosome segmentation and feature extraction. This review paper extensively discusses how the approaches presented in literature have addressed these challenges, and their strengths and limitations. Human chromosome segmentation algorithms are presented under four broad categories; thresholding, clustering, active contours and convex-concave points-based methods. Chromosome feature extraction methods are discussed under two main categories based on banding-pattern and geometry. In addition, new insights for the improvement of fully automated karyotyping are provided.

                Perception and cognition require the integration of feedforward sensory information with feedback signals. Using different sized stimuli, we isolate spectral signatures of feedforward and feedback signals, and their effect on communication between layers in primary visual cortex of male macaque monkeys. Small stimuli elicited gamma frequency oscillations predominantly in the superficial layers. These Granger-causally originated in upper layer 4 and lower supragranular layers. Unexpectedly, large stimuli generated strong narrow band gamma oscillatory activity across cortical layers. They Granger-causally arose in layer 5, were conveyed through layer six to superficial layers, and violated existing models of feedback spectral signatures. Equally surprising, with large stimuli, alpha band oscillatory activity arose predominantly in granular and supragranular layers and communicated in a feedforward direction. Thus, oscillations in specific frequency bands are dynamically modulated to serve feedback and feedforward communication and are not restricted to specific cortical layers in V1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A saturation-mutagenesis analysis of the interplay between stability and activation in Ras</a></h4>

              
                Cancer mutations in Ras occur predominantly at three hotspots: Gly 12, Gly 13, and Gln 61. Previously, we reported that deep mutagenesis of H-Ras using a bacterial assay identified many other activating mutations (Bandaru et al., 2017). We now show that the results of saturation mutagenesis of H-Ras in mammalian Ba/F3 cells correlate well with the results of bacterial experiments in which H-Ras or K-Ras are co-expressed with a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The prominent cancer hotspots are not dominant in the Ba/F3 data. We used the bacterial system to mutagenize Ras constructs of different stabilities and discovered a feature that distinguishes the cancer hotspots. While mutations at the cancer hotspots activate Ras regardless of construct stability, mutations at lower-frequency sites (e.g. at Val 14 or Asp 119) can be activating or deleterious, depending on the stability of the Ras construct. We characterized the dynamics of three non-hotspot activating Ras mutants by using NMR to monitor hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). These mutations result in global increases in HDX rates, consistent with destabilization of Ras. An explanation for these observations is that mutations that destabilize Ras increase nucleotide dissociation rates, enabling activation by spontaneous nucleotide exchange. A further stability decrease can lead to insufficient levels of folded Ras – and subsequent loss of function. In contrast, the cancer hotspot mutations are mechanism-based activators of Ras that interfere directly with the action of GAPs. Our results demonstrate the importance of GAP surveillance and protein stability in determining the sensitivity of Ras to mutational activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Progressive axonopathy when oligodendrocytes lack the myelin protein CMTM5</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes facilitate rapid impulse propagation along the axons they myelinate and support their long-term integrity. However, the functional relevance of many myelin proteins has remained unknown. Here, we find that expression of the tetraspan-transmembrane protein CMTM5 (chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL-transmembrane domain containing protein 5) is highly enriched in oligodendrocytes and central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Genetic disruption of the <i>Cmtm5</i> gene in oligodendrocytes of mice does not impair the development or ultrastructure of CNS myelin. However, oligodendroglial <i>Cmtm5</i> deficiency causes an early-onset progressive axonopathy, which we also observe in global and tamoxifen-induced oligodendroglial <i>Cmtm5</i> mutants. Presence of the <i>Wld<sup>S</sup></i> mutation ameliorates the axonopathy, implying a Wallerian degeneration-like pathomechanism. These results indicate that CMTM5 is involved in the function of oligodendrocytes to maintain axonal integrity rather than myelin biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Leading edge maintenance in migrating cells is an emergent property of branched actin network growth</a></h4>

              
                Animal cell migration is predominantly driven by the coordinated, yet stochastic, polymerization of thousands of nanometer-scale actin filaments across micron-scale cell leading edges. It remains unclear how such inherently noisy processes generate robust cellular behavior. We employed high-speed imaging of migrating neutrophil-like HL-60 cells to explore the fine-scale shape fluctuations that emerge and relax throughout the process of leading edge maintenance. We then developed a minimal stochastic model of the leading edge that reproduces this stable relaxation behavior. Remarkably, we find lamellipodial stability <i>naturally</i> <i>emerges</i> from the interplay between branched actin network growth and leading edge shape - with no additional feedback required - based on a synergy between membrane-proximal branching and lateral spreading of filaments. These results thus demonstrate a novel biological noise-suppression mechanism based entirely on system geometry. Furthermore, our model suggests that the Arp2/3-mediated ~70‑80º branching angle optimally smooths lamellipodial shape, addressing its long-mysterious conservation from protists to mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contextual control of conditioned pain tolerance and endogenous analgesic systems</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are unclear but may involve the persistence or strengthening of pain memories acquired in part through associative learning. Contextual cues, which comprise the environment in which events occur, were recently described as a critical regulator of pain memory; both male rodents and humans exhibit increased pain sensitivity in environments recently associated with a single painful experience. It is unknown, however, how repeated exposure to an acute painful unconditioned stimulus in a distinct context modifies pain sensitivity or the expectation of pain in that environment. To answer this question, we conditioned mice to associate distinct contexts with either repeated administration of a mild visceral pain stimulus (intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid) or vehicle injection over the course of three days. On the final day of experiments animals received either an acid injection or vehicle injection prior to being placed into both contexts. In this way, contextual control of pain sensitivity and pain expectation could be tested respectively. When re-exposed to the noxious stimulus in a familiar environment, both male and female mice exhibited context-dependent conditioned analgesia, a phenomenon mediated by endogenous opioid signaling. However, when expecting the presentation of a painful stimulus in a given context, males exhibited conditioned hypersensitivity whereas females exhibited endogenous opioid-mediated conditioned analgesia. These results are evidence that pain perception and engagement of endogenous opioid systems can be modified through their psychological association with environmental cues. Successful determination of the brain circuits involved in this sexually dimorphic anticipatory response may allow for the manipulation of pain memories, which may contribute to the development of chronic pain states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NLGC: Network Localized Granger Causality with Application to MEG Directional Functional Connectivity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the causal relationships that underlie networked activity between different cortical areas is critical for understanding the neural mechanisms behind sensory processing. Granger causality (GC) is widely used for this purpose in functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis, but there the temporal resolution is low, making it difficult to capture the millisecond-scale interactions underlying sensory processing. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has millisecond resolution, but only provides low-dimensional sensor-level linear mixtures of neural sources, which makes GC inference challenging. Conventional methods proceed in two stages: First, cortical sources are estimated from MEG using a source localization technique, followed by GC inference among the estimated sources. However, the spatiotemporal biases in estimating sources propagate into the subsequent GC analysis stage, resulting in both false alarms and missing true GC links. Here, we introduce the Network Localized Granger Causality (NLGC) inference paradigm, which models the source dynamics as latent sparse multivariate autoregressive processes and estimates their parameters directly from the MEG measurements, without intermediate source localization, and employs the resulting parameter estimates to produce a precise statistical characterization of the detected GC links. We offer several theoretical and algorithmic innovations within NLGC and further examine its utility via comprehensive simulations and application to MEG data from an auditory task involving tone processing from both younger and older participants. Our simulation studies reveal that NLGC is markedly robust with respect to model mismatch, network size, and low signal-to-noise ratio, whereas the conventional two-stage methods result in high false alarms and mis-detections. We also demonstrate the advantages of NLGC in revealing the cortical network-level characterization of neural activity during tone processing and resting state by delineating task- and age-related connectivity changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The vigor paradox: saccade velocity during deliberation encodes utility of effortful actions</a></h4>

              
                During deliberation, as the brain considers its options, the neural activity representing the goodness of each option rises toward a threshold, and the choice is often dictated by the option for which the rise is fastest. Here we report a surprising correlate of these activities: saccade vigor. We engaged human subjects in a decision-making task in which they considered effortful options, each requiring walking various durations and inclines. As they deliberated, they made saccades between the symbolic representations of those options. These saccades had no bearing on the effort that they would later expend, yet as they deliberated, saccade velocities increased. The rate of rise in vigor was faster for saccades toward the option that they later indicated as their choice, and encoded the difference in the subjective value of the two effortful options. Once deliberation ended, following a brief delay the subjects indicated their choice by making another saccade. Remarkably, vigor for this saccade dropped to baseline and no longer encoded subjective value. These results are consistent with an urgency model of decision-making in which a global signal in the brain drives both the neural circuits that make decisions, and the neural circuits that make movements. Paradoxically, this common drive is shared between the oculomotor circuits and the decision-making circuits, even when the decision involves effortful expenditure during a future event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Musashi proteins are post-transcriptional activators of protein expression and alternative exon splicing in vertebrate photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                The Musashi proteins, MSI1 and MSI2, are conserved RNA binding proteins with a role in the maintenance and renewal of stem cells. Contrasting with this role, retina and terminally differentiated photoreceptor cells express high levels of MSI1 and MSI2, indicating that the two proteins have a role unrelated to maintaining undifferentiated cell state. Here we show that the Musashi proteins are essential in mature photoreceptors. Combined knockout of Msi1 and Msi2 lead to loss of the retina response to light and progressive photoreceptor cell death. The two proteins are fully redundant as individual deletion of Msi1 or Msi2 did not produce a phenotype. To define the molecular functions underlying the requirement for Musashi in photoreceptors, we delineated their RNA targets and analyzed the effect of the combined Msi1/Msi2 knockout on transcript levels, pre-mRNA splicing, and protein expressions. We show distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic functions for the Musashi proteins in photoreceptor cells. In the nucleus, Musashi binding to the downstream proximal intron promotes splicing of alternative exons. Surprisingly, four conserved photoreceptor-specific alternative exons in genes critical for vision proved to be dispensable, leaving open questions about the selective pressures that lead to the conservation of these exons and the contribution of alternative splicing to the phenotype of the Musashi knockout. In the photoreceptor cell cytoplasm MSI1 and MSI2 act as activators of protein expression. The combined knockout of Msi1 and Msi2 reduced the levels of multiple proteins including proteins required for vision and photoreceptor survival.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ambient RNA analysis reveals misinterpreted and masked cell types in brain single-nuclei datasets</a></h4>

              
                Ambient RNA contamination in single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a significant problem, but its consequences are poorly understood. Here, we show that ambient RNAs in brain single-nuclei RNA-seq can have a nuclear or extra-nuclear origin with distinct gene set signatures. Both ambient RNA signatures are predominantly neuronal and we find that some previously annotated neuronal cell types are distinguished by ambient RNA. Strikingly, we also detect pervasive neuronal ambient RNA contamination in all glial cell types unless glia and neurons are physically separated prior to sequencing. We demonstrate that this contamination can be removed in silico. We also show that previous annotations of immature oligodendrocytes are likely glial cells contaminated with ambient RNAs. After ambient RNA removal, we detect extremely rare, committed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which were infrequently annotated in previous adult human brain datasets. Together, these results provide an in-depth analysis of ambient RNA contamination in brain single-cell datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The lateral intraparietal area preferentially supports stimulus selection in directed tasks compared to undirected free behavior</a></h4>

              
                Our reactions to the sensory world depend on context. For instance, explicit directions to search for a particular object or feature will induce a different treatment of the sensory world than exploration without a fixed goal. To understand how we navigate the sensory world, it is necessary to understand how both directed search and undirected exploration are produced by the brain. The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) in the posterior parietal cortex has an established role in visual stimulus selection. However, most studies of LIP's role in stimulus selection focus primarily on highly trained, directed tasks, in which animals are given explicit cues as to which stimulus they should select. Here, we compare neural activity in LIP across two tasks. In one task, the animal is given an explicit direction to select one of two natural images from an array; in the other, the animal is allowed to choose an image freely based on their innate preferences. We find that LIP reliably encodes the eye movement prior to its execution only in the directed task, while the eye movement encoding in the undirected task emerges significantly later. Further, LIP's encoding of the image's behavioral relevance emerges after the decision in both tasks. These results indicate that LIP preferentially supports stimulus selection in highly trained and directed behaviors, as opposed to free behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell transcriptome profiles of Drosophila fruitless-expressing neurons from both sexes</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila melanogaster reproductive behaviors are orchestrated by fruitless neurons. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on fru P1 pupal neurons. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering generates an atlas containing 113 clusters. While the male and female neurons overlap in UMAP space, more than half the UMAP clusters have sex-differences in neuron number, and nearly all clusters display sex-differential expression. Based on an examination of enriched marker genes, we annotate clusters as circadian clock neurons, mushroom body Kenyon cell neurons, neurotransmitter- and/or neuropeptide-producing, and those that express doublesex. Enriched marker gene analyses also shows that genes that encode members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, transcription factors, neuropeptides, neuropeptide receptors, and Wnts have unique patterns of enriched expression across the clusters. In vivo spatial gene-expression links to the UMAP clusters are provided. A functional analysis of fru P1 circadian neurons shows they have dimorphic roles in sleep/activity and period length. Given that most clusters are comprised of male and female neurons indicates that the sexes have fru P1 neurons with common gene expression programs. Sex-specific expression is overlaid on this program, to build the potential for vastly different sex-specific behaviors.

                The choroid plexus (ChP) of the cerebral ventricles is a source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and also plays a key role in immune surveillance at the level of blood-to-CSF-barrier (BCSFB). In this study, we quantify ChP blood perfusion and BCSFB mediated water exchange from arterial blood into ventricular CSF using non-invasive continuous arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging (CASL-MRI). Systemic administration of anti-diuretic hormone (vasopressin) was used to validate BCSFB mediated water exchange as a metric of choroidal CSF secretory function. To further investigate the coupling between ChP perfusion and CSF secretory function, we characterized the effects of two anesthetic regimens known to have large-scale differential effects on cerebral blood flow. For quantification of ChP blood perfusion a multi-compartment perfusion model was employed, and we discovered that partial volume correction improved measurement accuracy. Vasopressin significantly reduced both ChP blood perfusion and CSF secretory function. ChP perfusion was significantly higher with pure isoflurane anesthesia (2-2.5%) when compared to a balanced anesthesia with dexmedetomidine and low-dose isoflurane (1.0 %), however there was no significant difference in BCSFB water secretory function. In summary, here we introduce a non-invasive, robust, and spatially resolved in vivo imaging platform to quantify ChP perfusion as well as BCSFB water secretory function which can be applied to study coupling of these two key parameters in future clinical translational studies.

                Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play a central role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which these processes lead to neurodegeneration is still not fully understood. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is an antioxidant protein that can be cleaved into a peptide known as Thioredoxin-80 (Trx80), which modulates monocyte function in the periphery and shows anti-amyloidogenic properties in the brain. In this study we aimed to further clarify the biological function of this peptide and its regulation in the brain. We show that neurons are the main producers of Trx80 in the brain. Trx80 levels increase in vivo both in normal aging and in young APPNL-G-F mouse model of amyloid pathology. Trx80 levels were increased in neurons in primary culture treated with either rotenone or 27-hydroxycholesterol, what suggests that Trx80 production is stimulated upon oxidative stress. RNA-sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis revealed that Trx80 induces microglia activation into a phenotype compatible with interferon response microglia. Finally, we determine that the induction of this microglia phenotype by Trx80 is Trem2-dependent. This study identifies Trx80 as a novel neuron-derived signaling mechanism that modulates microglia function under stress conditions. Strategies to regulate Trx80 levels could be beneficial against AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal dynamics of microvascular recovery after acquired cortical injury</a></h4>

              
                Acquired brain injuries due to trauma damage cortical vasculature, which in turn impairs blood flow to injured tissues. There are reports of vascular morphological recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the remodeling process has not been examined longitudinally in detail after injury in vivo. Understanding the dynamic processes that influence recovery is thus critically important. We evaluated the longitudinal and dynamic microvascular recovery and remodeling up to 2 months post injury using live brain miniscope and 2-photon microscopic imaging. The new imaging approaches captured dynamic morphological and functional recovery processes at high spatial and temporal resolution in vivo. Vessel painting documented the initial loss and subsequent temporal morphological vascular recovery at the injury site. Miniscopes were used to longitudinally image the temporal dynamics of vascular repair in vivo after brain injury in individual mice across each cohort. We observe near-immediate nascent growth of new vessels in and adjacent to the injury site that peaks between 14-21 days post injury. 2-photon microscopy confirms new vascular growth and further demonstrates differences between cortical layers after cortical injury: large vessels persist in deeper cortical layers (>200 m), while superficial layers exhibit a dense plexus of fine (and often non-perfused) vessels displaying regrowth. Functionally, blood flow increases mirror increasing vascular density. Filopodia development and endothelial sprouting is measurable within 3 days post injury that rapidly transforms regions devoid of vessels to dense vascular plexus in which new vessels become increasingly perfused. Within 7 days post injury, blood flow is observed in these nascent vessels. Behavioral analysis reveals improved vascular modulation after 9 days post injury, consistent with vascular regrowth. We conclude that morphological recovery events are closely linked to functional recovery of blood flow to the compromised tissues, which subsequently leads to improved behavioral outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-Scale Circuit Configuration for Flexible Sensory-Motor Decisions</a></h4>

              
                Humans and non-human primates can acquire, and rapidly switch between, arbitrary rules that govern the mapping from sensation to action. It has remained unknown if and how the brain configures large-scale sensory-motor circuits to establish such flexible information flow. Here, we developed an approach that elucidates the dynamic configuration of task-specific sensory-motor circuits in humans. Participants switched between arbitrary mapping rules for reporting visual orientation judgments during fMRI. Rule switches were either signaled explicitly or inferred by the participants from ambiguous cues, and we used behavioral modeling to reconstruct the time course of their belief about the active rule. In both contexts, patterns of correlations between ongoing fluctuations in feature-specific activity across visual and action-related brain regions tracked participants' belief about the active rule. These rule-specific, intrinsic correlation patterns broke down on error trials and predicted individuals' model-inferred internal noise. Our findings indicate that internal beliefs about task state are instantiated in specific large-scale patterns of selective, correlated neural variability.

                Serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) are widely distributed throughout the brain and are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although in recent years, a considerable amount of evidence supports 5-HT2CRs facilitating effect on anxiety behavior, the involvement in learned fear responses and fear extinction is rather unexplored. Here we used a 5-HT2CR knock-out mouse line (2CKO) to gain new insights into the involvement of 5-HT2CRs in the neuronal fear circuitry. Using a cued fear conditioning paradigm, our results revealed that global loss of 5-HT2CRs exclusively accelerates fear extinction, without affecting fear acquisition and fear expression. To investigate the neuronal substrates underlying the extinction enhancing effect, we mapped the immediate-early gene product cFos, a marker for neuronal activity, in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Surprisingly, besides extinction-associated changes, our results revealed alterations in neuronal activity even under basal home cage conditions in specific subregions of the DRN and the BNST in 2CKO mice. Neuronal activity in the dorsal BNST was shifted in an extinction-supporting direction due to 5-HT2CR knock-out. Finally, the assessment of DRN-BNST connectivity using antero- and retrograde tracing techniques uncovered a discrete serotonergic DRC-BNSTad pathway showing increased activity in 2CKO mice. Thus, our results provide new insights for the fear extinction network by revealing a specific serotonergic DRC-BNSTad pathway underlying a 5-HT2CR-sensitive mechanism with high significance in the treatment of PTSD.

	<p>Pronoun resolution plays an important role in language comprehension. However, little is known about its recruited cognitive mechanisms. Our investigation aims to explore the cognitive mechanisms underlying various types of pronoun resolution in Chinese using an electroencephalograph (EEG). We used three convolutional neural networks (CNNs)&amp;amp;mdash;LeNeT-5, GoogleNet, and EffifcientNet&amp;amp;mdash;to discover high-level feature abstractions of the EEG spatial topologies. The output of the three models was then fused using different scales by principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve cognitive workload classification. Overall, the workload classification rate by fusing three deep networks can be achieved at 55&amp;amp;ndash;63% in a participant-specific manner. We provide evidence that both the behavioral indicator of reaction time and the neural indicator of cognitive workload collected during pronoun resolution vary depending on the type of the pronoun. We observed an increase in reaction time accompanied by a decrease of the theta power while participants were processing ambiguous pronoun resolution compared to unambiguous controls. We propose that ambiguous pronoun resolution involves a more time-consuming yet more flexible cognitive mechanism, consistent with the predictions of the decision-making framework from an influential pragmatic tradition. Our results extend previous research that the cognitive states of resolving ambiguous and unambiguous pronouns are differentiated, indicating that cognitive workload evaluated using the method of machine learning for analysis of EEG signals acts as a complementary indicator for studying pronoun resolution and serves as an important inspiration for human&amp;amp;ndash;machine interaction.</p>

	<p>Although the interaction between anxiety and attention is considered crucial for learning and performance in mathematics, few studies have examined these cognitive and affective predictors in a single framework or explored the role of sustained attention in promoting children&amp;amp;rsquo;s arithmetic performance, using traditional linear analyses and latent profile analysis (LPA). In this paper, state anxieties (in a math test and in an attention test situation), general anxiety traits, sustained attention (performance-based test and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) self-ratings) and math achievement of 403 fourth and fifth graders (55.8% girls) were assessed. A negative correlation between state anxiety prior to the math test and arithmetic achievements was identified, even when controlling for other non-math related state anxieties and general anxiety. Sustained attention was a strong predictor of arithmetic achievement and functioned as a moderator in the anxiety-performance link. LPA identified six distinct profiles that revealed a complex relationship with arithmetic fluency. The weakest achievement was found for a specific math anxiety subgroup. The findings highlight the important role of the interaction of anxiety and sustained attention in children&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to perform math and enable new conclusions about the specific nature of math anxiety. Implications for future research are discussed.</p>

	<p>The current study investigated heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) across day and night in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). We recorded 24-h electrocardiography in 26 patients with DOC (i.e., unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; n = 16) and (exit) minimally conscious state ((E)MCS; n = 10)). To examine diurnal variations, HR and HRV indices in the time, frequency, and entropy domains were computed for periods of clear day- (forenoon: 8 a.m.&amp;amp;ndash;2 p.m.; afternoon: 2 p.m.&amp;amp;ndash;8 p.m.) and nighttime (11 p.m.&amp;amp;ndash;5 a.m.). The results indicate that patients&amp;amp;rsquo; interbeat intervals (IBIs) were larger during the night than during the day, indicating HR slowing. The patients in UWS showed larger IBIs compared to the patients in (E)MCS, and the patients with non-traumatic brain injury showed lower HRV entropy than the patients with traumatic brain injury. Additionally, higher HRV entropy was associated with higher EEG entropy during the night. Thus, cardiac activity varies with a diurnal pattern in patients with DOC and can differentiate between patients&amp;amp;rsquo; diagnoses and etiologies. Moreover, the interaction of heart and brain appears to follow a diurnal rhythm. Thus, HR and HRV seem to mirror the integrity of brain functioning and, consequently, might serve as supplementary measures for improving the validity of assessments in patients with DOC.</p>

	<p>Memories of the past are critically important as we age. For older adults receiving formal care in a range of settings, reminiscing with care staff may provide frequent opportunities for recalling autobiographical memories with a supportive conversational partner. Importantly, prior research suggests that some reminiscing conversations are more supportive than others. In the developmental literature, a long tradition of sociocultural memory research` has shown how children&amp;amp;rsquo;s autobiographical memory is scaffolded and supported by parents during reminiscing, when parents use a particular kind of conversational technique, known as &amp;amp;ldquo;elaborative reminiscing&amp;amp;rdquo;. In the current project, we aimed to examine whether we could enhance conversations between staff and older people receiving aged care by teaching care staff about these beneficial conversational techniques and supporting them to reminisce more often with residents/clients. We also aimed to determine whether staff members&amp;amp;rsquo; use of elaborative reminiscing techniques was associated with autobiographical memory details recalled by residents/clients during routine conversations. We conducted a workshop with 16 staff within a residential aged care and community care setting. We followed this with a 4-week training-and-feedback period during which staff recorded their conversations with residents and clients. Staff feedback indicated successful use of the scaffolding techniques overall, and benefits as well as barriers to their use in day-to-day practice. Analysis of the conversations demonstrated that the use of particular elaborative reminiscing techniques by staff was associated with increased recall of episodic and semantic autobiographical memory details by residents/clients. Overall, findings suggest that the principles of elaborative reminiscing may apply across the lifespan, and that the benefits of elaborative reminiscing for autobiographical memory may be particularly important in times of cognitive need. Practically, training aged care staff in specific and practical conversational tools can facilitate reminiscing for people receiving aged care.</p>

	<p>Numerical abilities are fundamental in our society. As a consequence, poor numerical skills might have a great impact on daily living. This study analyzes the extent to which the numerical deficit observed in young adults with Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) impacts their activities of everyday life. For this purpose, 26 adults with DD and 26 healthy controls completed the NADL, a standardized battery that assesses numerical skills in both formal and informal contexts. The results showed that adults with DD had poorer arithmetical skills in both formal and informal settings. In particular, adults with DD presented difficulties in time and measure estimation as well as money usage in real-world numerical tasks. In contrast, everyday tasks regarding distance estimation were preserved. In addition, the assessment revealed that adults with DD were aware of their numerical difficulties, which were often related to emotional problems and negatively impacted their academic and occupational decisions. Our study highlights the need to design innovative interventions and age-appropriate training for adults with DD to support their numerical skills as well as their social and emotional well-being.</p>

	<p>Objective: T lymphocytes, complement, and immunoglobulin play an important role in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). As common clinical examination indicators, they have been used as routine indicators in many hospitals, which is convenient for being carried out in clinical work, but there are few articles of guiding significance for clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to study the relationship between commonly used immune indicators and clinical characteristics in patients with NMOSD. Methods: We compared clinical characteristics and clinical immune indicators in 258 patients with NMOSD and 200 healthy controls (HCs). We used multiple linear regression to study the relationship between immunotherapy, disease phase, sex, age, AQP4-IgG, and immune indicators. In addition, lymphocyte subsets were compared before and after immunotherapy in 24 of the 258 patients. We explored the influencing factors and predictors of severe motor disability. Results: The percentages of CD3 ratio (71.4% vs. 73.8%, p = 0.013), CD4 ratio (38.8% vs. 42.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and CD4/CD8 ratio (1.43 vs. 1.66, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in NMOSD patients were significantly lower than those in the HC group. In addition, complement C4 (0.177 g/L vs. 0.221 g/L, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and peripheral blood IgG (10.95 g/L vs. 11.80 g/L, p = 0.026) in NMOSD patients were significantly lower than those in the HC group. CD3 percentage was correlated with blood collection age and disease stage; CD8 percentage was correlated with blood collection age, disease stage, and treatment; CD4/CD8 percentage was correlated with blood collection age and treatment; complement C4 was correlated with blood collection age and sex; and IgG was correlated with disease stage and treatment. Twenty-four patients before and after treatment showed that the percentages of CD3 ratio (74.8% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.001) and CD8 ratio (32.4% vs. 26.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) after treatment in NMOSD patients were significantly increased, and the percentage of CD3 before treatment was moderately negatively correlated with ARR (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.507, p = 0.011). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that peripheral blood complement C3 is a serious influencing factor for severe motor disability (EDSS score &amp;amp;ge; 6 points). Peripheral blood complement C3 and C4 are predictors of severe motor disability (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that peripheral blood T lymphocytes, C3, C4 and immunoglobulin are convenient and routine clinical indicators that are convenient for implementation in clinical work. They have certain reference values for disease staging, recurrence, drug efficacy, and motor disability. They have improved our understanding of clinical immune indicators for NMOSD patients, but whether they can be used as biomarkers for clinical prognosis remains to be further studied.</p>

	<p>Math fluency is the ability to solve arithmetic facts quickly and accurately (i.e., addition and subtraction problems up to 20, and multiplication and division problems from the multiplication table). Curricula in primary school devote a significant period of time for learning and retrieval of arithmetic facts. Recently, a new computerized tool to assess math fluency&amp;amp;mdash;the BGU-MF (Ben-Gurion University Math Fluency) test&amp;amp;mdash;was developed and found to be a reliable and valid tool for adults. In the current study, we examine the performance of first to sixth-grade children in math fluency using the BGU-MF. The results present the performance of MF during childhood and emphasize that it continues to develop during primary school. Importantly, proficiency of MF differed by operations, and the automaticity of math facts was acquired in different grades. Moreover, we found that the BGU-MF is a reliable and valid tool not only for adults but also for children during primary school. Our study has educational implications for the teaching, practice, and retrieval of arithmetic facts.</p>

	<p>Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenolic compound found in various plants, has been reported to improve cognitive function. However, it remains unclear how long it takes for CGAs to exert their effects. Here, we evaluated the short-term effects of CGAs on cognitive function. We assessed the effects of 2-week CGA intake on cognitive function. The study was carried out as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Twenty-six healthy Japanese participants (50&amp;amp;ndash;65 years of age) were randomly assigned to either the active beverage (CGAs: 270 mg) or the placebo beverage group daily for 2 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, the participants consumed the other beverages. We assessed cognitive function at baseline and following the first treatment period using the Japanese version of CNS Vital Signs. CGAs significantly improved the scores for psychomotor speed, motor speed, and right and left finger tapping compared to placebo. In addition, processing speed scores improved significantly from baseline only after CGA intake. In conclusion, CGAs were confirmed to improve cognitive function over a short period of two weeks.</p>

                Background: The decrease of immunity acquired from COVID-19 vaccines is a potential cause of breakthrough infection. Understanding the dynamics of immune responses of vaccine-induced antibodies post-vaccination is important. This study aimed to measure the level of neutralizing antibody (NAb) anti-SRBD in individuals at different time points upon the receipt of the second dose of CoronaVac vaccine, as well as evaluate the plausible associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among CoronaVac-vaccinated residents in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. The level of NAb titre was measured using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay. A set of standardized and validated questionnaires were used to assess the demographics and other plausible associated factors. Results: Our results showed waning SARS-Cov-2 NAb titres over time post-vaccination. Compared to samples of the first month post-vaccination, the levels of NAb titres were significantly lower than those of five-months (mean 184.6 vs. 101.8 IU/mL, p = 0.009) and six-months post-vaccination (mean 184.6 vs. 95.59 IU/mL, p = 0.001). This suggests that the length of time post-vaccination was negatively correlated with antibody anti-SRBD titre. A protective level of NAbs titres (threshold of 15 IU/mL) was observed from all the samples vaccinated within one to three months; however, only 73.7% and 78.9% of the sera from five- and six-months possessed the protective titres against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The titre of NAb anti-SRBD was found significantly higher in sera of individuals having a regular healthy meal intake compared to those who did not (mean 136.7 vs. 110.4 IU/mL, p = 0.044), including in subgroup analysis that included those five to six months post-vaccination only (mean 79.0 vs. 134.5 IU/mL, p = 0.009). Conclusions: This study provides insights on the efficacy of CoronaVac vaccine in protecting individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, which may contribute to future vaccination policy management to improve and prolong protective strategy.

                BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 vaccination program, which uses various types of vaccines, has been applied since the beginning of 2021. However, the efficacy in the context of seroconversion rate remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the seroconversion rates among different COVID-19 vaccines using a network meta-analysis approach. METHODS: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted during the study period. Data of interest, such as seroconversion rate and the type of COVID-19 vaccine, were extracted from each study. The analysis was performed using single-arm analysis by calculating the cumulative seroconversion rate. A network meta-analysis was conducted using the Bayesian method. RESULTS: A total of 31 RCTs were included in our analysis. Our pooled calculation revealed that the seroconversion rates of inactivated messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), protein subunit, and vector COVID-19 vaccines during the follow-up periods were 93.2%, 93.9%, 65.3%, and 54.7%, respectively, at ≤ 15 days; 96.0%, 94.8%, 91.2%, and 89.7%, respectively, between days 16–30; and 98.5%, 98.6%, 98.5%, and 96.2%, respectively, between days 31–60.The indirect comparison revealed that in the follow-up periods of ≤ 15 and 16–30 days, the inactivated and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines had superior seroconversion rates compared with those of the protein subunit and vector vaccines. In the follow-up period of 31–60 days, the highest seroconversion rates were found in the inactivated, mRNA, and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable information regarding the comparison of seroconversion rates of COVID-19 vaccines.

The RS waterlogging approach on the soil surface possibly reduces CH4 emission due to not being buried into the soil. However, evaluation of CH4 emission by this approach has not been determined. The objective of this study was to examine CH4 emission under RS waterlogging on surface water compared with RS incorporation into the soil. Methods: We carried out a microcosm experiment in a screen-house with two treatments, including (i) RS incorporation into the soil and (ii) RS waterlogging on the soil surface in triplicates. We compared the CH4 emissions and CH4 accumulation for the rice-growing and off-sowing periods. Yield-scaled CH4 emission was assessed based on total methane emission and rice yield. Results: The results demonstrated that RS waterlogging reduced CH4 emission by 16.9% compared to RS incorporation into the soil. During the rice-growing period, total CH4 emission from RS waterlogging accounted for 36% of the incorporation treatment. However, RS waterlogging is caused by high emissions during the off-sowing stage. The difference between yield-scaled CH4 emissions was insignificant. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the treatment of RS by waterlogging is an appropriate alternative to conventional RS practices known as incorporation, which increases greenhouse CH4 emission. However, high CH4 emission during the off-sowing period, and RS accumulation in the field are key drivers that possibly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, further evaluation is needed to determine the long-term effects of this approach.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors related to depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in two coastal regions of Peru: An analytical cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and their aggravation have been studied extensively in the general population. However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29]. Conclusion: There are few studies exploring depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic; this research shows the importance of mental health care in this population and, particularly, of those who are 76 or older because they suffer from comorbid conditions and have interrupted recreational activities.

                Background: The confidence of Bottom 40 (B40) shareholders is crucial for cooperative’s sustenance within wider corporate governance. An in-depth study on cooperatives is needed, as they play a crucial role in the Malaysian economic system and contribute greatly to the country’s social development. However, in the current landscape, confidence among shareholders is at stake. This study aims to identify the research gap into corporate governance for cooperatives in relation to B40 shareholder confidence, as well as identify current study challenges and develop a conceptual framework for future research. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review, with the use of agency theory to assess shareholders’ confidence. Emerald, ProQuest, InderScience, Scopus and Science Direct were the online databases used in this study to search five keyword phrases: corporate governance, confidence, cooperative, agency theory and Bottom 40% (B40) household. Tranfield’s five stages were used to conduct the systematic review. Results: Only 5 of the 324 studies assess shareholders’ confidence in cooperatives, as well as one paper on B40 and two papers on agency theory. Our review presents three major findings. First, research in the context of B40 shareholder’s confidence in cooperatives  is  scarce. Second, the challenges related to shareholders’ confidence in B40 are major issues in the context. Third, research on agency theory in the context of shareholders’ confidence within cooperatives and corporate governance is still scant. Conclusions: This review urges the research community to conduct more studies based on the highlighted research gaps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Personalized pathology test for Cardio-vascular disease: Approximate Bayesian computation with discriminative summary statistics learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ritabrata Dutta, Karim Zouaoui Boudjeltia, Christos Kotsalos, Alexandre Rousseau, Daniel Ribeiro de Sousa, Jean-Marc Desmet, Alain Van Meerhaeghe, Antonietta Mira, Bastien Chopard</p>

Cardio/cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) have become one of the major health issue in our societies. But recent studies show that the present pathology tests to detect CVD are ineffectual as they do not consider different stages of platelet activation or the molecular dynamics involved in platelet interactions and are incapable to consider inter-individual variability. Here we propose a stochastic platelet deposition model and an inferential scheme to estimate the biologically meaningful model parameters using approximate Bayesian computation with a summary statistic that maximally discriminates between different types of patients. Inferred parameters from data collected on healthy volunteers and different patient types help us to identify specific biological parameters and hence biological reasoning behind the dysfunction for each type of patients. This work opens up an unprecedented opportunity of personalized pathology test for CVD detection and medical treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A copula based topology preserving graph convolution network for clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Snehalika Lall, Sumanta Ray, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay</p>

Annotation of cells in single-cell clustering requires a homogeneous grouping of cell populations. There are various issues in single cell sequencing that effect homogeneous grouping (clustering) of cells, such as small amount of starting RNA, limited per-cell sequenced reads, cell-to-cell variability due to cell-cycle, cellular morphology, and variable reagent concentrations. Moreover, single cell data is susceptible to technical noise, which affects the quality of genes (or features) selected/extracted prior to clustering.
Here we introduce sc-CGconv (copula based graph convolution network for single clustering), a stepwise robust unsupervised feature extraction and clustering approach that formulates and aggregates cell–cell relationships using copula correlation (Ccor), followed by a graph convolution network based clustering approach. sc-CGconv formulates a cell-cell graph using <i>Ccor</i> that is learned by a graph-based artificial intelligence model, graph convolution network. The learned representation (low dimensional embedding) is utilized for cell clustering. sc-CGconv features the following advantages. a. sc-CGconv works with substantially smaller sample sizes to identify homogeneous clusters. b. sc-CGconv can model the expression co-variability of a large number of genes, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art gene selection/extraction methods for clustering. c. sc-CGconv preserves the cell-to-cell variability within the selected gene set by constructing a cell-cell graph through copula correlation measure. d. sc-CGconv provides a topology-preserving embedding of cells in low dimensional space.

                Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected people’s mental health owing to different factors. The primary objective of this review was to systematically summarize available literature on the range of interventions for common mental health disorders during an infectious disease outbreak, specifically focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, EPPI mapper and Google Scholar to identify English literature published since January 2010. We included scientific research studies and grey literature, extracted the information and summarized results thematically. Results: A range of common mental health disorders that affected populations from most parts of the world and associated factors were identified. We thematically classified intervention into the following: providing accurate and timely information and ensuring adequate supplies of daily need essentials; developing mindfulness and resilience that can revive self-sufficiency and self-awareness in stress management; early identification; providing necessary mental health care through professionals; and health system strengthening and capacity building interventions. Conclusion: There is an immediate need for a collective action through inter-sectoral coordination at community, national and international levels. Policymakers and program implementers should be prepared to tackle common mental health disorders amidst the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic and in future emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks.

                Background: Both genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to joint health and disease. For example, pathological levels of biomechanical stress on joints play a notable role in initiation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA), a common chronic degenerative joint disease affecting articular cartilage and underlying bone. Population-level gene expression studies of cartilage cells experiencing biomechanical stress may uncover gene-by-environment interactions relevant to human joint health. Methods: To build a foundation for population-level gene expression studies in cartilage, we applied differentiation protocols to develop an in vitro system of chondrogenic cell lines (iPSC-chondrocytes). We characterized gene regulatory responses of three human iPSC-chondrocyte lines to cyclic tensile strain treatment. We measured the contribution of biological and technical factors to gene expression variation in this system. Results: We identified patterns of gene regulation that differ between strain-treated and control iPSC-chondrocytes. Differentially expressed genes between strain and control conditions are enriched for gene sets relevant to joint health and OA. Furthermore, even in this small sample, we found several genes that exhibit inter-individual expression differences in response to mechanical strain, including genes previously implicated in OA. Conclusions: Expanding this system to include iPSC-chondrocytes from a larger number of individuals will allow us to characterize and better understand gene-by-environment interactions related to joint health.

                Background: The freshwater ichthyofauna of Wallacea is diverse and understudied. A baseline survey of Bolano Sau Lake in Parigi Moutong District, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia in 2019 found an eleotrid goby (local name payangka) with characters conforming to the genus Giuris, long considered monophyletic as G. margaritacea/G. margaritaceus but recently found to comprise at least eight species. This study focused on the molecular (DNA barcoding) identification and phenotypic characters of the payangka. Methods: Payangka samples were collected from August to December 2019 in collaboration with local fishermen, weighed and measured, and preserved in 75% ethanol. Length, weight, sex (n=111) and seventeen morphometric characters/six meristic counts (n=42) were recorded. DNA barcoding was performed on a fin clipping preserved in 96% ethanol. Homologous nucleotide sequences were obtained from public (GenBank and BOLD) databases, analysis conducted in MEGA X, and phylogenetic trees edited in the Interactive Tree of Life (iToL). Results: Within the polyphyletic Giuris clade, the payangka sequence resolved into a sub-clade identified as Giuris laglaizei (Sauvage 1880), a recently resurrected taxon, based on a sequence provided by Philippe Keith. The length-weight relationship (L = 0.0087∙W3.162) indicated mildly allometric positive growth. Size distribution differed significantly between male and female fish with significantly larger mean size of males (13.56 cm) than females (11.62 cm). The meristic formula was: D VI-I,8 A I,8 P 13 V I,5 C15. Phylogenic analysis indicated four Giuris species in wetlands around Tomini Bay and five in Sulawesi. Conclusions: This first record of G. laglaizei in Indonesia advances knowledge of Wallacean and Indo-Pacific gobioid biogeography and highlights the need for a revision of the conservation status of the taxa currently grouped under Giuris margaritacea/G. margaritaceus in the IUCN Red List and FishBase databases. The data will inform biodiversity and fisheries management at local and regional levels.

                Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting populations worldwide. Remdesivir is an anti-retroviral agent, with a broad spectrum of usage. Remdesivir usage against COVID-19 had been studied both in vitro and in vivo but is still considered a new treatment for COVID-19 and is not available in all countries. The aim of our study was to report several cases of the use of Remdesivir in Sudanese patients and report the adverse events related to the course of treatment. Methods: A case series study was conducted in Imperial Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan reporting two cases who received Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 besides other treatments such as steroids and supportive therapy in December 2020. Cases were males aged over 65 years. Cases presentation: Both patients were severe cases of COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who received Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 infection. Several side effects were reported: the first case had increased liver enzymes and then unexpectedly died from severe resistant hypotension; and hypoalbuminemia was noticed in the second case. Conclusions: Remdesivir use among patients in Sudan must be studied extensively in order to determine the unexpected fatal event and assess the association of this event to Remdesivir use, as well as to report the frequency of the side effects.

                Background: Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and is also associated with many pulmonary complications. Decreased cardiopulmonary function and functional capacity is one of the major treatment related side effects of chemoradiation therapy. In this study we aimed to assess and quantify the impact of treatment related side effects on the respiratory function and functional capacity of head and neck cancer patients during chemoradiation therapy.   Methods: This was a pilot longitudinal study conducted amongst 12 newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (stage III, IV, IVa, IVb) who were admitted to hospital care and were receiving chemoradiation therapy for seven weeks. Outcome variables assessed were diaphragmatic thickness and mobility, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and functional capacity using six-minute walk test at baseline, three weeks and seven weeks of chemo radiation. Repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used to identify significant differences at the three time points with a p < 0.05.  Results: Our data reported a decrease in all the variables and a significant decrease in diaphragm function during deep inspiration, respiratory pressures which indicate respiratory muscle strength and functional capacity by the end of the seventh week of chemo-radiation therapy (p <0.05).  Conclusion: We conclude that seven weeks of chemo-radiation therapy reduces the diaphragmatic thickness, mobility, respiratory muscle strength and functional capacity in head and neck cancer patients.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Maternal Epilepsy and Long‐term Offspring Mortality: A Nationwide Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined how maternal epilepsy and use of antiseizure medications in pregnancy was associated with offspring mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This population-based cohort study included all live- and stillborn singletons in Denmark between 1981 and 2016. We used nation-wide registers to retrieve information on pregnancy characteristics, epilepsy diagnoses, use of antiseizure medications, and mortality. Adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 1,862,474 children. In total, 12,026 live-born children died during follow-up, of whom 170 (1.4%) were offspring of mothers with epilepsy. Overall mortality was increased in offspring of mothers with epilepsy compared to offspring of mothers without epilepsy (MRR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23–1.71), driven by an excess mortality only in the first year of life. Mortality was increased for natural deaths (MRR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25–1.78) but not from unnatural deaths (MRR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.84–2.14), and only in offspring of women with epilepsy who used antiseizure medications during pregnancy (MRR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.00–2.17), but not in offspring of women with epilepsy who did not use antiseizure medications while pregnant (MRR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69–1.31). When analyses were restricted to children born from 2000 and onwards, the excess mortality that was observed in the first year of life among children of mothers with epilepsy, was no longer evident.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>During the 1981 to 1999 epoch, offspring of women with epilepsy were at increased risk of dying in the first year of life. However, this risk did not extend to children born after 2000. Future retrospective studies of the effects of maternal epilepsy on the health of the offspring should take this difference into account. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Inhibitory abilities in girls and boys: More similarities or differences?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This brief review examined the literature from 1990 to June 2020 on sex differences in inhibitory abilities from early childhood to adolescence, primarily in individuals with typical development (TD) and individuals with atypical development. The 38 articles included (28 on individuals with TD, eight on the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] population, and two on individuals with autism spectrum disorder [ASD]) suggest that the cognitive demand of the task is important, together with contextual factors that may interact with the development of inhibitory ability, for revealing differences between the sexes. The literature has neglected the multicomponential nature of inhibitory abilities, and the emphasis has consequently been placed on response inhibition (vs. other components). The implication of the impurity problem has also been considered. The findings on children and adolescents with ADHD or ASD—even for outcomes that are not conclusive—imply that there is no evidence for a difference in inhibitory abilities between males and females. The literature proposes an asynchrony in the development of inhibitory abilities that may explain what is found in typically developing girls who perform more highly than boys on more demanding tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Excessive release of inorganic phosphate by ALS/FTD astrocytes causes non-cell-autonomous toxicity to motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                Arredondo et al. demonstrate that inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) levels are increased in human and mouse ALS/FTD astrocytes in culture and in tissue as well as in astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) and cerebrospinal fluid. Targeting polyP in ALS/FTD astrocytes or in derived ACM prevents motoneuron (MN) death. These findings reveal that polyP released by ALS/FTD astrocytes is a critical factor in non-cell-autonomous MN degeneration and a potential therapeutic target for ALS/FTD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Shank promotes action potential repolarization by recruiting BK channels to calcium microdomains</a></h4>

              
                Mutations altering the scaffolding protein Shank are linked to several psychiatric disorders, and to synaptic and behavioral defects in mice. Among its many binding partners, Shank directly binds CaV1 voltage activated calcium channels. Here we show that the <i>C. elegans</i> SHN-1/Shank promotes CaV1 coupling to calcium activated potassium channels. Mutations inactivating SHN-1, and those preventing SHN-1 binding to EGL-19/CaV1 all increase action potential durations in body muscles. Action potential repolarization is mediated by two classes of potassium channels: SHK-1/KCNA and SLO-1 and SLO-2 BK channels. BK channels are calcium-dependent, and their activation requires tight coupling to EGL-19/CaV1 channels. SHN-1's effects on AP duration are mediated by changes in BK channels. In <i>shn-1 </i>mutants, SLO-2 currents and channel clustering are significantly decreased in both body muscles and neurons. Finally, increased and decreased <i>shn-1 </i>gene copy number produce similar changes in AP width and SLO-2 current. Collectively, these results suggest that an important function of Shank is to promote microdomain coupling of BK with CaV1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intrinsic mechanical sensitivity of mammalian auditory neurons as a contributor to sound-driven neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensation - by which mechanical stimuli are converted into a neuronal signal - is the basis for the sensory systems of hearing, balance, and touch. Mechanosensation is unmatched in speed and its diverse range of sensitivities, reaching its highest temporal limits with the sense of hearing; however, hair cells (HCs) and the auditory nerve (AN) serve as obligatory bottlenecks for sounds to engage the brain. Like other sensory neurons, auditory neurons use the canonical pathway for neurotransmission and millisecond-duration action potentials (APs). How the auditory system utilizes the relatively slow transmission mechanisms to achieve ultrafast speed, and high audio-frequency hearing remains an enigma. Here, we address this paradox and report that the mouse, and chinchilla, AN are mechanically sensitive, and minute mechanical displacement profoundly affects its response properties. Sound-mimicking sinusoidal mechanical and electrical current stimuli affect phase-locked responses. In a phase-dependent manner, the two stimuli can also evoke suppressive responses. We propose that mechanical sensitivity interacts with synaptic responses to shape responses in the AN, including frequency tuning and temporal phase-locking. Combining neurotransmission and mechanical sensation to control spike patterns gives the mammalian AN a secondary receptor role, an emerging theme in primary neuronal functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulation parameters are distinctly associated with tau and amyloid in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuronal and circuit level abnormalities of excitation and inhibition are shown to be associated with tau and amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in preclinical models of Alzheimers disease (AD). These relationships remain poorly understood in patients with AD. Methods: Using empirical spectra from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and computational modeling (neural mass model; NMM) we examined excitatory and inhibitory parameters of neuronal subpopulations and investigated their specific associations to regional tau and A{beta}, measured by positron emission tomography (PET), in patients with AD. Results: Patients with AD showed abnormal excitatory and inhibitory time-constants and neural gains compared to age-matched controls. Increased excitatory time-constants distinctly correlated with higher tau depositions while increased inhibitory time-constants distinctly correlated with higher A{beta} depositions. Conclusions: Our results provide critical insights about potential mechanistic links between abnormal neural oscillations and cellular correlates of impaired excitatory and inhibitory synaptic functions associated with tau and A{beta} in patients with AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">URB597 induces aggression in adult Lister Hooded rats</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in both social and cognitive processing. The endocannabinoid metabolism inhibitor, URB597, dose-dependently improves non-social memory in adult Wistar and Sprague Dawley rats, whereas its effect on social interaction (SI) is affected by both rat strain and drug dose. Lister Hooded rats consistently respond differently to drug treatment in general compared with albino strains. This study sought to investigate the effects of different doses of URB597 on social and non-social memory in Lister Hooded rats, as well as analysing the behavioural composition of the SI. Males were tested for novel object recognition (NOR), social preference (between an object and an unfamiliar rat), social novelty recognition (for a familiar vs unfamiliar rat) and SI with an unfamiliar rat. URB597 (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) or vehicle was given 30 minutes before testing. During SI testing, total interaction time was assessed along with time spent on aggressive and explorative behaviours. Lister Hooded rats displayed expected non-social and social memory and social preference, which was not affected by URB597. During SI, URB597 did not affect total interaction time. However, the high dose increased aggression, compared to vehicle, and decreased anogenital sniffing, compared to the low dose of URB597. In summary, URB597 did not affect NOR, social preference or social recognition memory but did have subtle behavioural effects during SI in Lister hooded rats. These findings highlight the importance of considering strain as well as the composition of behaviour when investigating drug effects on social behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Introducing RELAX (the Reduction of Electroencephalographic Artifacts): A fully automated pre-processing pipeline for cleaning EEG data - Part 1: Algorithm and Application to Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalographic (EEG) data is typically contaminated with non-neural artifacts which can confound the results of experiments. Artifact cleaning approaches are available, but often require time-consuming manual input and significant expertise. Advancements in artifact cleaning often only address a single artifact, are only compared against a small selection of pre-existing methods, and seldom assess whether a proposed advancement improves experimental outcomes. To address these issues, we developed RELAX (the Reduction of Electroencephalographic Artifacts), an automated EEG cleaning pipeline implemented within EEGLAB that reduces all artifact types. RELAX cleans continuous data using Multiple Wiener filtering [MWF] and/or wavelet enhanced independent component analysis [wICA] applied to artifacts identified by ICLabel [wICA_ICLabel]). Several versions of RELAX were tested using three datasets containing a mix of cognitive and resting recordings (N = 213, 60 and 23 respectively). RELAX was compared against six commonly used EEG cleaning approaches across a wide range of artifact cleaning quality metrics, including signal-to-error and artifact-to-residue ratios, measures of remaining blink and muscle activity, and the amount of variance explained by experimental manipulations after cleaning. RELAX with MWF and wICA_ICLabel showed amongst the best performance for cleaning blink and muscle artifacts while still preserving neural signal. RELAX with wICA_ICLabel (and no MWF) may perform better at detecting the effect of experimental manipulations on alpha oscillations in working memory tasks. The pipeline is easy to implement in MATLAB and freely available on GitHub. Given its high cleaning performance, objectivity, and ease of use, we recommend RELAX for data cleaning across EEG studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vocalization categorization behavior explained by a feature-based auditory categorization model</a></h4>

              
                Vocal animals produce multiple categories of calls with high between- and within-subject variability, over which listeners must generalize to accomplish call categorization. The behavioral strategies and neural mechanisms that support this ability to generalize are largely unexplored. We previously proposed a theoretical model that accomplished call categorization by detecting features of intermediate complexity that best contrasted each call category from all other categories. We further demonstrated that some neural responses in the primary auditory cortex were consistent with such a model. Here, we asked whether a feature-based model could predict call categorization behavior. We trained both the model and guinea pigs on call categorization tasks using natural calls. We then tested categorization by the model and guinea pigs using temporally and spectrally altered calls. Both the model and guinea pigs were surprisingly resilient to temporal manipulations, but sensitive to moderate frequency shifts. Critically, model performance quantitatively matched guinea pig behavior to a remarkable degree. By adopting different model training strategies and examining features that contributed to solving specific tasks, we could gain insight into possible strategies used by animals to categorize calls. Our results validate a model that uses the detection of intermediate-complexity contrastive features to accomplish call categorization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Homophilic wiring principles underpin neuronal network topology in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Economical efficiency has been a popular explanation for how networks organize themselves within the developing nervous system. However, the precise nature of the economic negotiations governing this self- organization remain unclear. We approach this problem by combining high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings, which allow for detailed characterization of the ongoing extracellular electrical activity of individual neurons in vitro, with a generative modeling approach capable of simulating network formation. The best fitting model uses a homophilic generative wiring principle in which neurons form connections to other neurons with similar connectivity patterns to themselves. This homophily-based mechanism for neuronal network emergence accounts for a wide range of observations that are described, but not sufficiently explained, by traditional analyses of network topology. Using rodent and human monolayer and organoid cultures, we show that homophilic generative mechanisms account for the topology of emerging cellular functional connectivity, representing an important wiring principle and determining factor of neuronal network formation in vitro.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-literal language processing is jointly supported by the language and Theory of Mind networks: Evidence from a novel meta-analytic fMRI approach</a></h4>

              
                Going beyond the literal meaning of utterances is key to communicative success. However, the mechanisms that support non-literal inferences remain debated. We use a novel meta-analytic approach to evaluate the contribution of linguistic, social-cognitive, and executive mechanisms to non-literal interpretation. We identified 74 fMRI experiments (n=1,430 participants) from 2001-2021 that contrasted non-literal language comprehension with a literal control condition, spanning ten phenomena (e.g., metaphor, irony, indirect speech). Applying the activation likelihood estimation approach to the 825 activation peaks yielded six left-lateralized clusters. We then evaluated the locations of both the individual-study peaks and the clusters against probabilistic functional atlases (cf. macroanatomy, as is typically done) for three candidate brain networks -- the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2011), which supports language processing, the Theory of Mind (ToM) network (Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003), which supports social inferences, and the domain-general Multiple-Demand (MD) network (Duncan, 2010), which supports executive control. These atlases were created by overlaying individual activation maps of participants who performed robust and extensively validated "localizer" tasks (n=806 for language; n=198 for ToM; n=691 for MD). The analysis revealed that both the individual-study peaks and the ALE clusters fell primarily within the language network and the ToM network. These results suggest that non-literal processing is supported by both i) mechanisms that process literal linguistic meaning, and ii) mechanisms that support general social inference. They thus undermine a strong divide between literal and non-literal aspects of language and challenge the claim that non-literal processing requires additional executive resources.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal Interneuronal Dysfunction and Hyperexcitability in Porcine Model of Concussion</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment is a common symptom following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI or concussion) and can persist for years in some individuals. While the underlying mechanisms driving these impairments remain unknown, structural changes in the hippocampus post-mTBI have been reported in human patients, as well as electrophysiological changes in rodents following impact models of TBI. In addition, slice preparations from a closed-head, rotational acceleration injury (RAI) in swine showed reduced axonal function and hippocampal circuitry disruption. However, electrophysiological changes in neurons and their subtypes have not been examined. Using in vivo electrophysiology techniques, we examined the laminar oscillatory field potentials and single unit activity in the intact hippocampal network at 7 days post-RAI in anesthetized minipigs. Concussion altered the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal cells and interneurons differently in area CA1. Specifically, while firing rate and burst occurrence of CA1 interneurons were significantly decreased post-mTBI, these parameters were unchanged in putative CA1 pyramidal cells. However, pyramidal CA1 cells in TBI animals were significantly less entrained to hippocampal gamma (40 - 80 Hz) oscillations. In addition, stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals revealed hyperexcitability in the laminar CA1 response post-mTBI. Finally, computational simulations suggest that the reported changes in interneuronal firing rate and action potentials may be due to alterations in voltage-gated sodium channels. These data demonstrate that a single concussion can lead to significant neuronal and circuit level changes in the hippocampus, and that the loss of pyramidal gamma entrainment and changes in interneuronal firing may be important contributors to cognitive dysfunction following mTBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lingering neural representations of past task features adversely affect future behavior</a></h4>

              
                During goal-directed behavior, humans purportedly form and retrieve so called 'event files' - conjunctive representations that link context-specific information about stimuli, their associated actions, and the expected action-outcomes. The automatic formation - and later retrieval - of such conjunctive 'event file' representations can substantially facilitate efficient action selection. However, recent behavioral work suggests that these event-files may also adversely affect future behavior, especially when action requirements have changed between successive instances of the same task context (e.g., during task-switching). Here, we directly tested this hypothesis through a recently developed method that allows measuring the strength of the neural representations of context-specific stimulus-action conjunctions (i.e., event files). Thirty-five male and female adult humans performed a task-switching paradigm while undergoing EEG recordings. Replicating previous behavioral work, we found that changes in action requirements between two spaced repetitions of the same task incurred a significant reaction time cost. By combining multi-variate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis of the EEG recordings with linear mixed-effects modeling of trial-to-trial behavior, we then found that the magnitude of this behavioral cost was directly proportional to the strength of the conjunctive representation formed during the most recent previous exposure to the same task - i.e., the most recent 'event file'. This confirms that the formation of conjunctive representations of specific task contexts, stimuli, and actions in the brain can indeed adversely affect future behavior. Moreover, these findings demonstrate the potential of neural decoding of complex task set representations towards the prediction of behavior beyond the current trial.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sepsis-induced brain state instability</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis-associated brain dysfunction (SABD) is a frequent severe complication of sepsis and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. It is associated with high mortality and a majority of survivors suffer long-term neurological consequences. Here, we studied the effects of SABD on oscillatory brain states in an acute rat model of sepsis induced by high dose LPS (10 mg/kg). To focus on intrinsically generated brain state dynamics, we used a urethane model that spares oscillatory activity in REM- and NREM-like sleep states. Soon after the intraperitoneal LPS injection we observed a robust fragmentation of both oscillatory states resulting in a three-fold increase in the number of state transitions that lasted for several hours, although the overall time spent in either state did not change. Analysis of power spectra showed opposing shifts in low frequency oscillations (1-9 Hz) that resulted in increased similarity between both states in 2-D state space. The described spectral characteristics of sepsis-induced EEG state instability might point to a mechanism underlying severe sleep fragmentation as described both in sepsis patients and in SABD animal models.

                Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to examine neural activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus, referred to as an Event-Related Potential (ERP). However, EEG is also influenced by non-neural artifacts, which can confound ERP comparisons. Artifact cleaning can reduce artifacts, but often requires time-consuming manual decisions. Most automated cleaning methods require frequencies <1Hz to be filtered out of the data, so are not recommended for ERPs (which often contain <1Hz frequencies). In our companion article, we introduced RELAX (the Reduction of Electroencephalographic Artifacts), an automated and modular cleaning pipeline that reduces artifacts with Multiple Wiener Filtering (MWF) and/or wavelet enhanced independent component analysis (wICA) applied to artifact components detected with ICLabel (wICA_ICLabel) (Bailey et al., 2022). To evaluate the suitability of RELAX for data cleaning prior to ERP analysis, multiple versions of RELAX were compared to four commonly used EEG cleaning pipelines. Cleaning performance was compared across a range of artifact cleaning metrics and in the amount of variance in ERPs explained by different conditions in a Go-Nogo task. RELAX with MWF and wICA_ICLabel cleaned the data the most effectively and produced amongst the most dependable ERP estimates. RELAX with wICA_ICLabel only or MWF_only may detect experimental effects better for some ERP measures. Importantly, RELAX can high-pass filter data at 0.25Hz, so is applicable to analyses involving ERPs. The pipeline is easy to implement via EEGLAB in MATLAB and is freely available on GitHub. Given its performance, objectivity, and ease of use, we recommend RELAX for EEG data cleaning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of individualized behavioral predictions across anatomical, diffusion and functional connectivity MRI</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental goal across the neurosciences is the characterization of relationships linking brain anatomy, functioning, and behavior. Although various MRI modalities have been developed to probe these relationships, direct comparisons of their ability to predict behavior have been lacking. Here, we compared the ability of anatomical T1, diffusion and functional MRI (fMRI) to predict behavior at an individual level. Cortical thickness, area and volume were extracted from anatomical T1 images. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and approximate Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) models were fitted to the diffusion images. The resulting metrics were projected to the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) skeleton. We also ran probabilistic tractography for the diffusion images, from which we extracted the stream count, average stream length, and the average of each DTI and NODDI metric across tracts connecting each pair of brain regions. Functional connectivity (FC) was extracted from both task and resting-state fMRI. Individualized prediction of a wide range of behavioral measures were performed using kernel ridge regression, linear ridge regression and elastic net regression. Consistency of the results were investigated with the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) datasets. In both datasets, FC-based models gave the best prediction performance, regardless of regression model or behavioral measure. This was especially true for the cognitive domain. Furthermore, all modalities were able to predict cognition better than other behavioral domains. Combining all modalities improved prediction of cognition, but not other behavioral domains. Finally, across all behaviors, combining resting and task FC yielded prediction performance similar to combining all modalities. Overall, our study suggests that in the case of healthy children and young adults, behaviorally-relevant information in T1 and diffusion features might reflect a subset of the variance captured by FC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serotonin sensing by microglia conditions the proper development of neuronal circuits and of social and adaptive skills</a></h4>

              
                The proper maturation of emotional and sensory circuits requires a fine tuning of serotonin (5-HT) level during early postnatal development. Consistently, dysfunctions of the serotonergic system have been associated with neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental effects of 5-HT remain partially unknown, one obstacle being the action of 5-HT on different cell types.

Here, we focused on microglia, which play a role in brain wiring refinement, and we investigated whether the control of these cells by 5-HT is relevant for neurodevelopment and spontaneous behaviors. Since the main 5-HT sensor in microglia is the 5-HT2B receptor subtype, we prevented 5-HT signaling specifically in microglia by conditionally invalidating Htr2b gene in these cells. We observed that abrogating the serotonergic control of microglia neonatally impacts the phagolysosomal compartment of these cells and their proximity to synapses, and perturbs neuronal circuits maturation. Furthermore, this early ablation of microglial 5-HT2B receptors leads to adult hyperactivity in a novel environment and behavioral defects in sociability and flexibility. Importantly, we show that these behavioral alterations result from a developmental effect, since they are not observed when microglial Htr2b invalidation is induced later, at P30 onward.

Thus, a primary alteration of 5-HT sensing in microglia, during a critical time window between birth and P30, is sufficient to impair social and flexibility skills. This link between 5-HT and microglia may explain the association between serotonergic dysfunctions and behavioral traits, like impaired sociability and inadaptability to novelty, which are prominent in several psychiatric disorders such as ASD.

	<p>Research has shown that abnormal brain networks in patients with schizophrenia appear at different frequencies, but the relationship between these different frequencies is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to use a multilayer network model to evaluate the integration of information from different frequency bands. To explore the mechanism of integration and separation in the multilayer network of schizophrenia, we constructed multilayer frequency brain network models in 50 patients with schizophrenia and 69 healthy subjects, and the entropy of the multiplex degree (EMD) and multilayer clustering coefficient (MCC) were calculated. The results showed that the ability to integrate and separate information in the multilayer network of patients was significantly higher than that of normal people. This difference was mainly reflected in the default mode network, sensorimotor network, subcortical network, and visual network. Among them, the subcortical network was different in both MCC and EMD outcomes. Furthermore, differences were found in the posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, pallidum, and thalamus. The thalamus and posterior cingulate gyrus were associated with the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s symptom scores. Our results showed that the cross-frequency interaction ability of patients with schizophrenia was significantly enhanced, among which the subcortical network was the most active. This interaction may serve as a compensation mechanism for intralayer dysfunction.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum governs motor coordination and motor learning. Infection with external microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, induces the release and production of inflammatory mediators, which drive acute cerebellar inflammation. The clinical observation of acute cerebellitis is associated with the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. In our animal model of the acute inflammation of the cerebellar cortex, animals did not show any ataxia but hyperexcitability in the cerebellar cortex and depression-like behaviors. In contrast, animal models with neurodegeneration of the cerebellar Purkinje cells and hypoexcitability of the neurons show cerebellar ataxia. The suppression of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels in vivo is associated with a type of ataxia. Therefore, there is a gap in our interpretation between the very early phase of cerebellar inflammation and the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. In this review, we discuss the hypothesized scenario concerning the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. First, compared with genetically induced cerebellar ataxias, we introduce infection and inflammation in the cerebellum via aberrant immunity and glial responses. Especially, we focus on infections with cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV-2, potential relevance to mitochondrial DNA, and autoimmunity in infection. Second, we review neurophysiological modulation (intrinsic excitability, excitatory, and inhibitory synaptic transmission) by inflammatory mediators and aberrant immunity. Next, we discuss the cerebellar circuit dysfunction (presumably, via maintaining the homeostatic property). Lastly, we propose the mechanism of the cerebellar ataxia and possible treatments for the ataxia in the cerebellar inflammation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relationship between identifying as transgender and substance use. (2) Methods: We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Scopus, the Web of Science, and PsycINFO on 21 July 2021. (3) Results: Twenty studies comparing transgender and cisgender people were included in this work, accounting for a total of 2,376,951 participants (18,329 of whom were transgender). These articles included data on current tobacco use, current tobacco use disorder, current alcohol use, current alcohol use disorder, lifetime substance (all) use, current substance use (excluding tobacco and alcohol), current use of specific substances (excluding tobacco and alcohol and including cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, ecstasy, stimulants, heroin, opiates, cannabis, marijuana, LSD, hallucinogens, steroids, inhalants, sedatives, Ritalin or Adderall, diet pills, cold medicine, prescription medications, polysubstance, other club drugs, and other illegal drugs), and current substance use disorder (excluding tobacco and alcohol). We used the ORs and their 95% CIs to state the association between identifying as transgender and those variables. The control reference category used in all cases was cisgender. We employed a random-effects model. Transgender people were more likely to use tobacco (odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% CI [1.37, 1.98]), have used substances throughout their lives (OR = 1.48; 95% CI [1.30, 1.68]), and present current use of specific substances (OR = 1.79; 95% CI [1.54, 2.07]). When current alcohol and substance use in general and tobacco, alcohol, and substance use disorders specifically were considered, the likelihood did not differ from that of cisgender people. (4) Conclusions: The presence of substance use disorders did not differ between transgender and cisgender people. Considering this population as consumers or as addicted may be a prejudice that perpetuates stigma. Nonetheless, transgender people were more likely to use tobacco and other substances, but not alcohol. Hypothetically, this might be an emotional regulation strategy, a maladaptive mechanism for coping with traumatic experiences, or could respond to minority stress, produced by stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and harassment. It is of particular importance to implement policies against discrimination and stigmatisation and to adapt prevention and treatment services so that they are inclusive of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.</p>

	<p>This study compared orofacial muscle strength between normal and dysarthric speakers and across types of dysarthria, and examined correlations between strength and dysarthria severity. Participants included 79 speakers with flaccid, spastic, mixed spastic&amp;amp;ndash;flaccid, ataxic, or hypokinetic dysarthria and 33 healthy controls. Maximum pressure generation (Pmax) by the tongue, lips, and cheeks represented strength. Pmax was lower for speakers with mixed spastic&amp;amp;ndash;flaccid dysarthria for all tongue and lip measures, as well as for speakers with flaccid or spastic dysarthria for anterior tongue elevation and lip compression. Anterior tongue elevation and cheek compression tended to be lower than normal for the hypokinetic group. Pmax did not differ significantly between controls and speakers with ataxic dysarthria on any measure. Correlations were generally weak between dysarthria severity and orofacial weakness but were stronger in the dysarthria groups with more prominent orofacial weakness. The results generally support predictions that orofacial weakness accompanies flaccid and/or spastic dysarthria but not ataxic dysarthria. The findings support including type of dysarthria as a variable of interest when examining orofacial weakness in motor speech disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Median Raphe Nonserotonergic Neurons Modulate Hippocampal Theta Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal theta oscillations (HTOs) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep play an important role in mnemonic processes by coordinating hippocampal and cortical activities. However, it is not fully understood how HTOs are modulated by subcortical regions, including the median raphe nucleus (MnR). The MnR is thought to suppress HTO through its serotonergic outputs. Here, our study on male mice revealed a more complex framework indicating roles of nonserotonergic MnR outputs in regulating HTO. We found that nonselective optogenetic activation of MnR neurons at theta frequency increased HTO amplitude. Granger causality analysis indicated that MnR theta oscillations during REM sleep influence HTO. By using three transgenic mouse lines, we found that MnR serotonergic neurons exhibited little or no theta-correlated activity during HTO. Instead, most MnR GABAergic neurons and Vglut3 neurons respectively increased and decreased activities during HTO and exhibited hippocampal theta phase-locked activities. Although MnR GABAergic neurons do not directly project to the hippocampus, they could modulate HTO through local Vglut3 and serotonergic neurons as we found that MnR GABAergic neurons monosynaptically targeted Vglut3 and serotonergic neurons. Additionally, pontine wave recorded from the MnR during REM sleep accompanied nonserotonergic activity increase and HTO acceleration. These results suggest that MnR nonserotonergic neurons modulate hippocampal theta activity during REM sleep, which regulates memory processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The MnR is the major source of serotonergic inputs to multiple brain regions including the hippocampus and medial septal area. It has long been thought that those serotonergic outputs suppress HTOs. However, our results revealed that MnR serotoninergic neurons displayed little firing changes during HTO. Instead, MnR Vglut3 neurons were largely silent during HTO associated with REM sleep. Additionally, many MnR GABAergic neurons fired rhythmically phase-locked to HTO. These results indicate an important role of MnR nonserotonergic neurons in modulating HTO.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brief Stimuli Cast a Persistent Long-Term Trace in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual processing is strongly influenced by recent stimulus history, a phenomenon termed adaptation. Prominent theories cast adaptation as a consequence of optimized encoding of visual information by exploiting the temporal statistics of the world. However, this would require the visual system to track the history of individual briefly experienced events, within a stream of visual input, to build up statistical representations over longer timescales. Here, using an openly available dataset from the Allen Brain Observatory, we show that neurons in the early visual cortex of the mouse indeed maintain long-term traces of individual past stimuli that persist despite the presentation of several intervening stimuli, leading to long-term and stimulus-specific adaptation over dozens of seconds. Long-term adaptation was selectively expressed in cortical, but not in thalamic, neurons, which only showed short-term adaptation. Early visual cortex thus maintains concurrent stimulus-specific memory traces of past input, enabling the visual system to build up a statistical representation of the world to optimize the encoding of new information in a changing environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the natural world, previous sensory input is predictive of current input over multisecond timescales. The visual system could exploit these predictabilities by adapting current visual processing to the long-term history of visual input. However, it is unclear whether the visual system can track the history of individual briefly experienced images, within a stream of input, to build up statistical representations over such long timescales. Here, we show that neurons in early visual cortex of the mouse brain exhibit remarkably long-term adaptation to brief stimuli, persisting over dozens of seconds, and despite the presentation of several intervening stimuli. The visual cortex thus maintains long-term traces of individual briefly experienced past images, enabling the formation of statistical representations over extended timescales.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Conditioned Place Preference for Heroin Is Signaled by Increased Dopamine and Direct Pathway Activity and Decreased Indirect Pathway Activity in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repeated pairing of a drug with a neutral stimulus, such as a cue or context, leads to the attribution of the drug's reinforcing properties to that stimulus, and exposure to that stimulus in the absence of the drug can elicit drug-seeking. A principal role for the NAc in the response to drug-associated stimuli has been well documented. Direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs) have been shown to bidirectionally regulate cue-induced heroin-seeking in rats expressing addiction-like phenotypes, and a shift in NAc activity toward the direct pathway has been shown in mice following cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). However, how NAc signaling guides heroin CPP, and whether heroin alters the balance of signaling between dMSNs and iMSNs, remains unknown. Moreover, the role of NAc dopamine signaling in heroin reinforcement is unclear. Here, we integrate fiber photometry for <I>in vivo</I> monitoring of dopamine and dMSN/iMSN calcium activity with a heroin CPP procedure in rats to begin to address these questions. We identify a sensitization-like response to heroin in the NAc, with prominent iMSN activity during initial heroin exposure and prominent dMSN activity following repeated heroin exposure. We demonstrate a ramp in dopamine activity, dMSN activation, and iMSN inactivation preceding entry into a heroin-paired context, and a decrease in dopamine activity, dMSN inactivation, and iMSN activation preceding exit from a heroin-paired context. Finally, we show that buprenorphine is sufficient to prevent the development of heroin CPP and reduce Fos activation in the NAc after conditioning. Together, these data support the hypothesis that an imbalance in NAc activity contributes to the development of drug-cue associations that can drive addiction processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The attribution of the reinforcing effects of drugs to neutral stimuli (e.g., cues and contexts) contributes to the long-standing nature of addiction, as re-exposure to drug-associated stimuli can reinstate drug-seeking and -taking even after long periods of abstinence. The NAc has an established role in encoding the value of drug-associated stimuli, and dopamine release into the NAc is known to modulate the reinforcing effects of drugs, including heroin. Using fiber photometry, we show that entering a heroin-paired context is driven by dopamine signaling and NAc direct pathway activation, whereas exiting a heroin-paired context is driven by NAc indirect pathway activation. This study provides further insight into the role of NAc microcircuitry in encoding the reinforcing properties of heroin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Interruption of Auditory Interhemispheric Cross Talk Impairs Discrimination Learning of Frequency-Modulated Tone Direction But Not Gap Detection and Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Functional hemispheric lateralization is a basic principle of brain organization. In the auditory domain, the right auditory cortex (AC) determines the pitch direction of continuous auditory stimuli whereas the left AC discriminates gaps in these stimuli. The involved functional interactions between the two sides, mediated by commissural connections, are poorly understood. Here, we selectively disrupted the interhemispheric cross talk from the left to the right primary AC and vice versa using chromophore-targeted laser-induced apoptosis of the respective projection neurons, which make up 6&ndash;17% of all AC neurons in Layers III, V, and VI. Following photolysis, male gerbils were trained in a first experimental set to discriminate between rising and falling frequency-modulated (FM) tone sweeps. The acquisition of the task was significantly delayed in lesioned animals of either lesion direction. However, the final discrimination performance and hit rate was lowest for animals with left-side lesioned commissural neurons, demonstrating that also information from the left AC is relevant for FM direction learning. Photolysis after successful learning did not affect the retrieval of the learned task, indicating that the disruption during learning was not because of a general functional impairment. In a second experimental set, the gerbil's ability to detect and discriminate small silent gaps of varying length within FM sweeps was tested. This ability was also preserved after interhemispheric disruption. Taken together, interhemispheric communication between the left and right AC is important for the acquisition of FM tone direction learning but not for its retrieval and for gap detection and gap duration discrimination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hemispheric lateralization of neuronal functions such as speech and music processing in humans are common throughout the brain; however, the involved interhemispheric interactions are ill-defined. Here, we show that the selective photolytic disruption of auditory cortical commissural connections in rodents impairs the acquisition but not retrieval of a frequency-modulated tone direction discrimination task. The final discrimination performance and hit rate was lowest for animals with lesioned left-to-right-side projections; thus, although right auditory cortex is dominant, left auditory cortex is also relevant for learning this task. The detection and discrimination of small gaps within the tone sweeps remain intact, suggesting a pathway for the processing of these temporal structures, which could be independent from the lesioned interhemispheric cross talk.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Opposing Roles of the Dorsolateral and Dorsomedial Striatum in the Acquisition of Skilled Action Sequencing in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The shift in control from dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum during skill and habit formation has been well established, but whether striatal subregions orchestrate this shift cooperatively or competitively remains unclear. Cortical inputs have also been implicated in the shift toward automaticity, but it is unknown whether they mirror their downstream striatal targets across this transition. We addressed these questions using a five step heterogeneous action sequencing task in male rats that is optimally performed by automated chains of actions. By optimizing automatic habitual responding, we discovered that loss of function in the dorsomedial striatum accelerated sequence acquisition. In contrast, loss of function in the dorsolateral striatum impeded acquisition of sequencing, demonstrating functional opposition within the striatum. Unexpectedly, the mPFC was not involved; however, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was critical. These results shift current theories about striatal control of behavior to a model of competitive opposition, where the dorsomedial striatum interferes with the development of dorsolateral-striatum dependent behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide the most direct evidence to date that the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum compete for control in the acquisition of habitual action sequences. The dorsolateral striatum was critical for sequencing behavior, but loss of dorsomedial striatum function enhanced acquisition. In addition, we found that the mPFC was not required for the formation of automated actions. Using a task that optimizes habitual responding, we demonstrate that the arbitration of dorsomedial and dorsolateral control is not modulated by medial prefrontal cortical activity. However, we find evidence for the role of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex in action sequencing. These results have implications for our understanding of how habits and skills form.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency Shapes the Quality of Tactile Percepts Evoked through Electrical Stimulation of the Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves of human participants provides a unique opportunity to study the neural determinants of perceptual quality using a causal manipulation. A major challenge in the study of neural coding of touch has been to isolate the role of spike timing&mdash;at the scale of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds&mdash;in shaping the sensory experience. In the present study, we address this question by systematically varying the pulse frequency (PF) of electrical stimulation pulse trains delivered to the peripheral nerves of seven participants with upper and lower extremity limb loss via chronically implanted neural interfaces. We find that increases in PF lead to systematic increases in perceived frequency, up to ~50 Hz, at which point further changes in PF have little to no impact on sensory quality. Above this transition frequency, ratings of perceived frequency level off, the ability to discriminate changes in PF is abolished, and verbal descriptors selected to characterize the sensation change abruptly. We conclude that sensation quality is shaped by temporal patterns of neural activation, even if these patterns are imposed on a fixed neural population, but this temporal patterning can only be resolved up to ~50 Hz. These findings highlight the importance of spike timing in shaping the quality of a sensation and will contribute to the development of encoding strategies for conveying touch feedback through bionic hands and feet.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A major challenge in the study of neural coding of touch has been to understand how temporal patterns in neuronal responses shape the sensory experience. We address this question by varying the pulse frequency (PF) of electrical pulse trains delivered through implanted nerve interfaces in seven amputees. We concomitantly vary pulse width to separate the effect of changing PF on sensory quality from its effect on perceived magnitude. We find that increases in PF lead to increases in perceived frequency, a qualitative dimension, up to ~50 Hz, beyond which changes in PF have little impact on quality. We conclude that temporal patterning in the neuronal response can shape quality and discuss the implications for restoring touch via neural interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hemin-Induced Death Models Hemorrhagic Stroke and Is a Variant of Classical Neuronal Ferroptosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ferroptosis is a caspase-independent, iron-dependent form of regulated necrosis extant in traumatic brain injury, Huntington disease, and hemorrhagic stroke. It can be activated by cystine deprivation leading to glutathione depletion, the insufficiency of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase-4, and the hemolysis products hemoglobin and hemin. A cardinal feature of ferroptosis is extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activation culminating in its translocation to the nucleus. We have previously confirmed that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 inhibits persistent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and ferroptosis. Here, we show that hemin exposure, a model of secondary injury in brain hemorrhage and ferroptosis, activated ERK1/2 in mouse neurons. Accordingly, MEK inhibitor U0126 protected against hemin-induced ferroptosis. Unexpectedly, U0126 prevented hemin-induced ferroptosis independent of its ability to inhibit ERK1/2 signaling. In contrast to classical ferroptosis in neurons or cancer cells, chemically diverse inhibitors of MEK did not block hemin-induced ferroptosis, nor did the forced expression of the ERK-selective MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP)3. We conclude that hemin or hemoglobin-induced ferroptosis, unlike glutathione depletion, is ERK1/2-independent. Together with recent studies, our findings suggest the existence of a novel subtype of neuronal ferroptosis relevant to bleeding in the brain that is 5-lipoxygenase-dependent, ERK-independent, and transcription-independent. Remarkably, our unbiased phosphoproteome analysis revealed dramatic differences in phosphorylation induced by two ferroptosis subtypes. As U0126 also reduced cell death and improved functional recovery after hemorrhagic stroke in male mice, our analysis also provides a template on which to build a search for U0126's effects in a variant of neuronal ferroptosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent mechanism of regulated necrosis that has been linked to hemorrhagic stroke. Common features of ferroptotic death induced by diverse stimuli are the depletion of the antioxidant glutathione, production of lipoxygenase-dependent reactive lipids, sensitivity to iron chelation, and persistent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Unlike classical ferroptosis induced in neurons or cancer cells, here we show that ferroptosis induced by hemin is ERK-independent. Paradoxically, the canonical MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 blocks brain hemorrhage-induced death. Altogether, these data suggest that a variant of ferroptosis is unleashed in hemorrhagic stroke. We present the first, unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis of ferroptosis as a template on which to understand distinct paths to cell death that meet the definition of ferroptosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dysregulation of the Basal Ganglia Indirect Pathway in Early Symptomatic Q175 Huntington's Disease Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The debilitating psychomotor symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) are linked partly to degeneration of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. At early symptomatic stages, before major cell loss, indirect pathway neurons exhibit numerous cellular and synaptic changes in HD and its models. However, the impact of these alterations on circuit activity remains poorly understood. To address this gap, optogenetic- and reporter-guided electrophysiological interrogation was used in early symptomatic male and female <I>Q175</I> HD mice. D2 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons (D2-SPNs) were hypoactive during synchronous cortical slow-wave activity, consistent with known reductions in dendritic excitability and cortical input strength. Downstream prototypic parvalbumin-expressing external globus pallidus (PV<sup>+</sup> GPe) neurons discharged at 2-3 times their normal rate, even during periods of D2-SPN inactivity, arguing that defective striatopallidal inhibition was not the only cause of their hyperactivity. Indeed, PV<sup>+</sup> GPe neurons also exhibited abnormally elevated autonomous firing <I>ex vivo</I>. Optogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> GPe neurons <I>in vivo</I> partially and fully ameliorated the abnormal hypoactivity of postsynaptic subthalamic nucleus (STN) and putative PV<sup>&ndash;</sup> GPe neurons, respectively. In contrast to STN neurons whose autonomous firing is impaired in HD mice, putative PV<sup>&ndash;</sup> GPe neuron activity was unaffected <I>ex vivo</I>, implying that excessive inhibition was responsible for their hypoactivity <I>in vivo</I>. Together with previous studies, these data demonstrate that (1) indirect pathway nuclei are dysregulated in <I>Q175</I> mice through changes in presynaptic activity and/or intrinsic cellular and synaptic properties; and (2) prototypic PV<sup>+</sup> GPe neuron hyperactivity and excessive target inhibition are prominent features of early HD pathophysiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The early symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) are linked to degenerative changes in the action-suppressing indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. Consistent with this linkage, the intrinsic properties of cells in this pathway exhibit complex alterations in HD and its models. However, the impact of these changes on activity is poorly understood. Using electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that the indirect pathway is highly dysregulated in early symptomatic HD mice through changes in upstream activity and/or intrinsic properties. Furthermore, we reveal that hyperactivity of external globus pallidus neurons and excessive inhibition of their targets are key features of early HD pathophysiology. Together, these findings could help to inform the development and targeting of viral-based, gene therapeutic approaches for HD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms and Consequences of Cerebellar Purkinje Cell Disinhibition in a Mouse Model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of childhood muscular dystrophy, is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In addition to debilitating muscle degeneration, patients display a range of cognitive deficits thought to result from the loss of dystrophin normally expressed in the brain. While the function of dystrophin in muscle tissue is well characterized, its role in the brain is still poorly understood. The highest expression of dystrophin in the mouse brain is in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), where it colocalizes with GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor clusters. Using <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiological recordings from connected molecular layer interneuron (MLI)&ndash;PC pairs, we investigated changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission caused by dystrophin deficiency. In male <I>mdx</I> mice (which lack long-form dystrophin), we found that responses at MLI&ndash;PC pairs were reduced by ~60% because of both decreased quantal response amplitude and a reduced number of functional vesicle release sites. Using electron microscopy, we found significantly fewer and smaller anatomically defined inhibitory synapses contacting the soma of PCs in <I>mdx</I> mice, suggesting that dystrophin may play a critical role in synapse formation and/or maintenance. Functionally, we found reduced MLI-evoked pauses in PC firing in acute slices. <I>In vivo</I> recordings from awake <I>mdx</I> mice showed increased sensory-evoked simple spike firing in positively modulating PCs, consistent with reduced feedforward inhibition, but no change in negatively modulating PCs. These data suggest that dystrophin deficiency in PCs disrupts inhibitory signaling in the cerebellar circuit and PC firing patterns, potentially contributing to cognitive and motor deficits observed in <I>mdx</I> mice and DMD patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is primarily characterized by progressive muscle weakening caused by genetic mutations in the gene for dystrophin. Dystrophin is also normally expressed in the CNS, and DMD patients experience a range of nonprogressive cognitive deficits. The pathophysiology of CNS neurons resulting from loss of dystrophin and the function of dystrophin in neurons are still poorly understood. Using cerebellar PCs as a model, we found that the loss of dystrophin specifically disrupts the number and strength of inhibitory synaptic connections, suggesting that dystrophin participates in formation and/or maintenance of these synapses. This work provides insight into the function of dystrophin in the CNS and establishes neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, which may underlie cognitive deficits in DMD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathogenic Mechanisms of Cytosolic and Membrane-Enriched {alpha}-Synuclein Converge on Fatty Acid Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;-Synuclein (&alpha;S) plays a key role in Parkinson's disease. Although Parkinson's disease is typically "sporadic," inherited &alpha;S missense mutations provide crucial insights into molecular mechanisms. Here, we examine two clinical mutants, E46K and G51D, which are both in the conserved N-terminus that mediates transient &alpha;S-membrane interactions. However, E46K increases and G51D decreases &alpha;S-membrane interactions. Previously, we amplified E46K via the 11-residue repeat motifs, creating "3K" (E35K+E46K+E61K). Here, we engineered these motifs to amplify G51D (V40D+G51D+V66D = "3D") and systematically compared E46K/3K versus G51D/3D. We found that G51D increased cytosolic &alpha;S in neural cells and 3D aggravates this. G51D, and 3D even more, reduced &alpha;S multimer-to-monomer (&alpha;S60:&alpha;S14) ratio. Both amplified variants caused cellular stress in rat primary neurons and reduced growth in human neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, both 3K- and 3D-induced stress was ameliorated by pharmacologically inhibiting stearoyl-CoA desaturase or by conditioning the cells in palmitic (16:0) or myristic (14:0) acid. SCD inhibition lowered lipid-droplet accumulation in both 3D- and 3K-expressing cells and benefitted G51D by normalizing multimer:monomer ratio, as reported previously for E46K. Our findings suggest that, despite divergent cytosol/membrane partitioning, both G51D and E46K neurotoxicity can be prevented by decreasing fatty-acid unsaturation as a common therapeutic approach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> &alpha;-Synuclein (&alpha;S) dyshomeostasis is linked to Parkinson's disease. Here we focus on two contrasting familial-Parkinson's disease &alpha;S mutants, E46K and G51D, that alter &alpha;S membrane association in opposite directions (E46K increases, G51D decreases it). Taking advantage of &alpha;S repeat structure, here we designed &alpha;S "3D," an amplified G51D variant (V40D+G51D+V66D). &alpha;S 3D further enhanced G51D's cytosolic enrichment. Systematic comparison of G51D/3D with membrane-enriched E46K/its amplified variant 3K revealed that both can elicit stress in human neural cells and primary rodent neurons. This toxicity can be ameliorated by inhibiting stearoyl-CoA desaturase or by saturated fatty acid conditioning. Thus, despite divergent membrane binding, both G51D and E46K &alpha;S dyshomeostasis are mitigated by altering fatty acid saturation as a shared target.</p>

                <p>The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is connected to the rest of the brain through two main networks: the anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM) systems. Given the crucial role of the MTL and networks in the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present study aimed at (1) investigating whether MTL atrophy propagates specifically within the AT and PM networks, and (2) evaluating the vulnerability of these networks to AD proteinopathies. To do that, we used neuroimaging data acquired in human male and female in three distinct cohorts: (1) resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the aging brain cohort (ABC) to define the AT and PM networks (<I>n</I> = 68); (2) longitudinal structural MRI from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI)GO/2 to highlight structural covariance patterns (<I>n</I> = 349); and (3) positron emission tomography (PET) data from ADNI3 to evaluate the networks' vulnerability to amyloid and tau (<I>n</I> = 186). Our results suggest that the atrophy of distinct MTL subregions propagates within the AT and PM networks in a dissociable manner. Brodmann area (BA)35 structurally covaried within the AT network while the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) covaried within the PM network. In addition, these networks are differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, with higher tau levels in AT than in PM and higher amyloid levels in PM than in AT. Our results also suggest differences in the relative burden of tau species. The current results provide further support for the notion that two distinct MTL networks display differential alterations in the context of AD. These findings have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study provides further support for the notion that two distinct medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks, i.e., anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM), display differential alterations in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, neurodegeneration appears to occur within these networks in a dissociable manner marked by their covariance patterns. In addition, the AT and PM networks are also differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, and perhaps differences in the relative burden of tau species [e.g., neurofibriliary tangles (NFTs) vs tau in neuritic plaques]. These findings, in the context of a growing literature consistent with the present results, have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD in light of the differential cognitive processes ascribed to them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroimmunometabolism: A New Pathological Nexus Underlying Neurodegenerative Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroimmunometabolism is an emerging field that examines the intersection of immunologic and metabolic cascades in the brain. Neuroinflammatory conditions often involve differential metabolic reprogramming in neuronal and glial cells through their immunometabolic sensors. The impact of such bioenergetic adaptation on general brain function is poorly understood, but this cross-talk becomes increasingly important in neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit reshaping of neuroimmunometabolic pathways. Here we summarize the intrinsic balance of neuroimmunometabolic substrates and sensors in the healthy brain and how their dysregulation can contribute to the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative disorders. This review also proposes possible avenues for disease management through neuroimmunometabolic profiling and therapeutics to bridge translational gaps and guide future treatment strategies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuroimmunometabolism intersects with neuroinflammation and immunometabolic regulation of neurons and glial cells in the CNS. There is emerging evidence that neuroimmunometabolism plays an essential role in the manifestation of CNS degeneration. This review highlights how neuroimmunometabolic homeostasis is disrupted in various neurodegenerative conditions and could be a target for new therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Endothelial Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 4 Regulates Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability and Promotes a Homeostatic Endothelial Phenotype</a></h4>

              
                <p>The precise regulation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability for immune cells and blood-borne substances is essential to maintain brain homeostasis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule enriched in plasma, is known to affect BBB permeability. Previous studies focused on endothelial S1P receptors 1 and 2, reporting a barrier-protective effect of S1P1 and a barrier-disruptive effect of S1P2. Here, we present novel data characterizing the expression, localization, and function of the S1P receptor 4 (S1P4) on primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Hitherto, the receptor was deemed to be exclusively immune cell associated. We detected a robust expression of S1P4 in homeostatic murine BMECs (MBMECs), bovine BMECs (BBMECs), and porcine BMECs (PBMECs) and pinpointed its localization to abluminal endothelial membranes via immunoblotting of fractionated brain endothelial membrane fragments. Apical S1P treatment of BMECs tightened the endothelial barrier <I>in vitro</I>, whereas basolateral S1P treatment led to an increased permeability that correlated with S1P4 downregulation. Likewise, downregulation of S1P4 was observed in mouse brain microvessels (MBMVs) after stroke, a neurologic disease associated with BBB impairment. RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis of BMECs suggested the involvement of S1P4 in endothelial homeostasis and barrier function. Using S1P4 knock-out (KO) mice and S1P4 siRNA as well as pharmacological agonists and antagonists of S1P4 both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>, we demonstrate an overall barrier-protective function of S1P4. We therefore suggest S1P4 as a novel target regulating BBB permeability and propose its therapeutic potential in CNS diseases associated with BBB dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many neurologic diseases including multiple sclerosis and stroke are associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and disturbed brain homeostasis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) are potent regulators of endothelial permeability and pharmacological S1PR modulators are already in clinical use. However, the precise role of S1P for BBB permeability regulation and the function of receptors other than S1P1 and S1P2 therein are still unclear. Our study shows both barrier-disruptive and barrier-protective effects of S1P at the BBB that depend on receptor polarization. We demonstrate the expression and novel barrier-protective function of S1P4 in brain endothelial cells and pinpoint its localization to abluminal membranes. Our work may contribute to the development of novel specific S1PR modulators for the treatment of neurologic diseases associated with BBB impairment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Female-Specific Role for Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in Rodent Pain Models</a></h4>

              
                <p>We aimed to investigate a sexually dimorphic role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rodent models of pain. Based on findings in migraine where CGRP has a preferential pain-promoting effect in female rodents, we hypothesized that CGRP antagonists and antibodies would attenuate pain sensitization more efficaciously in female than male mice and rats. In hyperalgesic priming induced by activation of interleukin 6 signaling, CGRP receptor antagonists olcegepant and CGRP<SUB>8-37</SUB> both given intrathecally, blocked, and reversed hyperalgesic priming only in females. A monoclonal antibody against CGRP, given systemically, blocked priming specifically in female rodents but failed to reverse it. In the spared nerve injury model, there was a transient effect of both CGRP antagonists, given intrathecally, on mechanical hypersensitivity in female mice only. Consistent with these findings, intrathecally applied CGRP caused a long-lasting, dose-dependent mechanical hypersensitivity in female mice but more transient effects in males. This CGRP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was reversed by olcegepant and the KCC2 enhancer CLP257, suggesting a role for anionic plasticity in the dorsal horn in the pain-promoting effects of CGRP in females. In spinal dorsal horn slices, CGRP shifted GABA<SUB>A</SUB> reversal potentials to significantly more positive values, but, again, only in female mice. Therefore, CGRP may regulate KCC2 expression and/or activity downstream of CGRP receptors specifically in females. However, KCC2 hypofunction promotes mechanical pain hypersensitivity in both sexes because CLP257 alleviated hyperalgesic priming in male and female mice. We conclude that CGRP promotes pain plasticity in female rodents but has a limited impact in males.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The majority of patients impacted by chronic pain are women. Mechanistic studies in rodents are creating a clear picture that molecular events promoting chronic pain are different in male and female animals. We sought to build on evidence showing that CGRP is a more potent and efficacious promoter of headache in female than in male rodents. To test this, we used hyperalgesic priming and the spared nerve injury neuropathic pain models in mice. Our findings show a clear sex dimorphism wherein CGRP promotes pain in female but not male mice, likely via a centrally mediated mechanism of action. Our work suggests that CGRP receptor antagonists could be tested for efficacy in women for a broader variety of pain conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PTEN Regulates Dendritic Arborization by Decreasing Microtubule Polymerization Rate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a major negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in <I>PTEN</I> have been found in a subset of patients with macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). PTEN loss in neurons leads to somal hypertrophy, aberrant migration, dendritic overgrowth, increased spine density, and hyperactivity of neuronal circuits. These neuronal overgrowth phenotypes are present on <I>Pten</I> knock-out (KO) and reconstitution with autism-associated point mutations. The mechanism underlying dendritic overgrowth in <I>Pten</I> deficient neurons is unclear. In this study, we examined how <I>Pten</I> loss impacts microtubule (MT) dynamics in both sexes using retroviral infection and transfection strategies to manipulate PTEN expression and tag the plus-end MT binding protein, end-binding protein 3 (EB3). We found <I>Pten</I> KO neurons sprout more new processes over time compared with wild-type (WT) neurons. We also found an increase in MT polymerization rate in <I>Pten</I> KO dendritic growth cones. Reducing MT polymerization rate to the WT level was sufficient to reduce dendritic overgrowth in <I>Pten</I> KO neurons <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Finally, we found that rescue of dendritic overgrowth via inhibition of MT polymerization was sufficient to improve the performance of <I>Pten</I> KO mice in a spatial memory task. Taken together, our data suggests that one factor underlying PTEN loss dependent dendritic overgrowth is increased MT polymerization. This opens the possibility for an intersectional approach targeting MT polymerization and mTOR with low doses of inhibitors to achieve therapeutic gains with minimal side effects in pathologies associated with loss of neuronal PTEN function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of <I>Pten</I> function because of genetic deletion or expression of mutations associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), results in overgrowth of neurons including increased total dendritic length and branching. We have discovered that this overgrowth is accompanied by increased rate of microtubule (MT) polymerization. The increased polymerization rate is insensitive to acute inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 or protein synthesis. Direct pharmacological inhibition of MT polymerization can slow the polymerization rate in <I>Pten</I> knock-out (KO) neurons to rates seen in wild-type (WT) neurons. Correction of the MT polymerization rate rescues increased total dendritic arborization and spatial memory. Our studies suggest that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inhibits dendritic growth through parallel regulation of protein synthesis and cytoskeletal polymerization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons of the Spinal Cord Superficial Dorsal Horn Diverge in Their Somatosensory Responses and Plasticity in Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>The superficial dorsal horn (SDH) of the spinal cord represents the first site of integration between innocuous and noxious somatosensory stimuli. According to gate control theory, diverse populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the SDH are activated by distinct sensory afferents, and their interplay determines the net nociceptive output projecting to higher pain centers. Although specific SDH cell types are ill defined, numerous classifications schemes find that excitatory and inhibitory neurons fundamentally differ in their morphology, electrophysiology, neuropeptides, and pain-associated plasticity; yet little is known about how these neurons respond over a range of natural innocuous and noxious stimuli. To address this question, we applied an <I>in vivo</I> imaging approach in male mice where the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s was expressed either in vGluT2-positive excitatory or vIAAT-positive inhibitory neurons. We found that inhibitory neurons were markedly more sensitive to innocuous touch than excitatory neurons but still responded dynamically over a wide range of noxious mechanical stimuli. Inhibitory neurons were also less sensitive to thermal stimuli than their excitatory counterparts. In a capsaicin model of acute pain sensitization, the responses of excitatory neurons were significantly potentiated to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli, whereas inhibitory neural responses were only depressed to noxious stimuli. These <I>in vivo</I> findings show that excitatory and inhibitory SDH neurons diverge considerably in their somatosensory responses and plasticity, as postulated by gate control theory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Gate control theory posits that opposing spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons, differently tuned across somatosensory modalities, determine the net nociceptive output to higher pain centers. Little is known about how natural stimuli activate these two neural populations. This study applied an <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging approach to genetically target these neurons and contrast their responses over a range of innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli. Compared with excitatory neurons, we found that inhibitory neurons are more sensitive to innocuous touch and far less sensitive to thermal stimuli. An acute model of pain also revealed that these subtypes undergo divergent mechanosensory plasticity. Our data provide important and novel insights for gate-control inspired models of pain processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Performance-Dependent Consolidation of Learned Vocal Changes in Adult Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor skills learned through practice are consolidated at later time, which can include nighttime, but the time course of motor memory consolidation and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated neural substrates underlying motor memory consolidation of learned changes in birdsong, a tractable model system for studying neural basis of motor skill learning. Previous studies in male zebra finches and Bengalese finches have demonstrated that adaptive changes in adult song structure learned through a reinforcement paradigm are initially driven by a cortical-basal ganglia circuit, and subsequently consolidated into downstream cortical motor circuitry. However, the time course of the consolidation process, including whether it occurs offline during nighttime or online during daytime, remains unclear and even controversial. Here, we provide in both species experimental evidence of virtually no consolidation of learned vocal changes during nighttime. We demonstrate instead that the consolidation occurs during daytime and the amount of consolidation is strongly correlated with the amount of learning, suggesting online, performance-dependent mechanisms of consolidation of learned vocal changes. Moreover, by using computer simulations based on our experimental results, we demonstrate that such online, performance-dependent consolidation can account for the contradicting conclusions concerning the time course of consolidation process reached by previous studies. These results thus reconcile a controversy in the study of vocal motor consolidation in songbirds, and illustrate the neural substrates through which newly learned motor skills initially implemented by cortical-basal ganglia circuits become encoded in the cortical motor circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor skills learned through repetitive practice become stable and are consolidated into cortical motor circuits. We investigate neural substrates of this "motor memory consolidation" in adult songbirds, which produce songs that are complex motor skills learned and maintained through repetitive vocal practice. We demonstrate that learned changes in song acoustic structure are consolidated into the cortical motor circuits predominantly during daytime, but not during nighttime, depending on ongoing song performance. These consolidation mechanisms reconcile seemingly contradicting results of previous studies regarding the time course of vocal learning consolidation, and provide fundamental insights into the process through which learned performance of complex motor skills is consolidated and encoded in in motor circuits.</p>
