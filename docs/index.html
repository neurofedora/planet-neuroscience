                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

">FOXP2-immunoreactive, corticothalamic pyramidal cells in neocortical layers 6a and 6b are tightly regulated by neuromodulatory systems</a></h4>

              
                The FOXP2/Foxp2 gene is involved in fine motor control in many vertebrate species; in humans, it is one of the candidate genes thought to play a prominent role in language production. Several studies suggest that in the neocortex, Foxp2 is exclusively expressed in a subset of corticothalamic (CT) pyramidal cells (PCs) in layer 6 (L6). However, the morphological and intrinsic electrophysiological, synaptic and neuromodulatory properties of Foxp2-expressing L6 PCs remain largely unknown. Here we systematically characterise these properties for FOXP2-positive (FOXP2+) PCs across L6 in the rat somatosensory cortex. We find that L6 FOXP2+ PCs are distinct in all of these properties from those of L6 FOXP2-negative (FOXP2-) neuronal cell types. We show that L6 FOXP2+ PCs project exclusively to thalamus. In upper L6 (L6a), FOXP2+ PCs innervate either the first-order thalamus or both first and higher-order thalamic nuclei. FOXP2+ PCs in deep L6 (L6b) project almost exclusively to higher-order thalamus. Synaptic connections established by L6a and L6b FOXP2+ PCs exhibit low synaptic release probability, whereas L6 corticocortical PCs have a high release probability. Both L6a and L6b FOXP2+ PCs respond strongly to acetylcholine (ACh), which in the absence of TTX results in firing of action potential (AP) trains. Notably, L6b but not L6a FOXP2- PCs are highly sensitive to ACh. In addition, L6b FOXP2+ PCs close to the white matter border show strong responses to dopamine that develop into prolonged AP firing. Our data suggest that FOXP2 is a marker for CT PCs in L6 that are strongly controlled by neurotransmitters such as ACh and dopamine. These findings are in line with a pivotal role for both L6a and L6b CT PCs as modulators of thalamic activity.

">Beyond brain size: disentangling the effect of sex and brain size on brain morphometry and cognitive functioning</a></h4>

              
                It is imperative to study sex differences in brain morphology and function. However, there are major observable and unobservable confounding factors that can contribute to the estimated differences. Males have larger head sizes than females. Head size differences not only act as a confounding factor in studying sex differences in the brain, but also impact its anatomy and functioning. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effect of head size from sex in studying sex differentiated aging trajectories, its relation to canonical functional networks and cytoarchitectural classes, brain allometry, cognition. Using the UK Biobank (UKBB) neuroimaging data (N = 35,732 participants, 19,281 females, 44-82 years of age), we created a subsample (N = 11,294) where females (N = 5,657) and males were matched by their total intracranial volume (TIV) and age, a subsample that maintains the UKBB sample distribution, one matched only by age, and one that exaggerated the TIV difference between sexes. We then modeled the aging trajectories at both regional and vertex-wise levels in the four subsamples, and compared the estimations of the models. Our results show that when females and males have the same head size, the overall sex estimations tend towards zero, suggesting that most of the variability results from head size differences. Our approach also revealed bidirectional sex differences in brain neuroanatomy previously masked by the effect of head size. Further, the scaling relationship between regional and total brain volume remains fairly consistent across the lifespan and is not sex differentiated overall. We evaluated how the results of cognitive tests with perceived sex differences are influenced and explained by head size and found that although the correlation between TIV and cognitive scores is low, the matching process changes the direction of the effect sizes of differences between sexes in "verbal and numerical reasoning" and "working memory" cognitive domains. Taken together, employing a matching approach that is widely used in causal modeling studies, we provide new evidence for disentanglement of sex differences in the brain from head size as a biological confound.

	<p>Imbalance and falls in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) do not only reduce their quality of life but also their life expectancy. Aging-related symptoms as well as disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms contribute to these conditions and should be treated when appropriate. In addition to an active lifestyle, advanced exercise training is useful and effective, especially for less medically responsive symptoms such as freezing of gait and postural instability at advanced stages. As treadmill training in non-immersive virtual reality, including dual tasks, significantly reduced the number of falls in PD patients, the mechanism(s) explaining this effect should be further investigated. Such research could help to select the most suitable patients and develop the most effective training protocols based on this novel technology. Real-life digital surrogate markers of mobility, such as those describing aspects of endurance, performance, and the complexity of specific movements, can further improve the quality of mobility assessment using wearables.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0108-24.2024?rss=1">Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Affects Fast But Not Slow Adaptive Processes in Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an initial decline in declarative memory, while nondeclarative memory processing remains relatively intact. Error-based motor adaptation is traditionally seen as a form of nondeclarative memory, but recent findings suggest that it involves both fast, declarative, and slow, nondeclarative adaptive processes. If the declarative memory system shares resources with the fast process in motor adaptation, it can be hypothesized that the fast, but not the slow, process is disturbed in AD patients. To test this, we studied 20 early-stage AD patients and 21 age-matched controls of both sexes using a reach adaptation paradigm that relies on spontaneous recovery after sequential exposure to opposing force fields. Adaptation was measured using error clamps and expressed as an adaptation index (AI). Although patients with AD showed slightly lower adaptation to the force field than the controls, both groups demonstrated effects of spontaneous recovery. The time course of the AI was fitted by a hierarchical Bayesian two-state model in which each dynamic state is characterized by a retention and learning rate. Compared to controls, the retention rate of the fast process was the only parameter that was significantly different (lower) in the AD patients, confirming that the memory of the declarative, fast process is disturbed by AD. The slow adaptive process was virtually unaffected. Since the slow process learns only weakly from an error, our results provide neurocomputational evidence for the clinical practice of errorless learning of everyday tasks in people with dementia.</p>

                <p>In the rodent whisker system, active sensing and sensorimotor integration are mediated in part by the dynamic interactions between the motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1). However, understanding these dynamic interactions requires knowledge about the synapses and how specific neurons respond to their input. Here, we combined optogenetics, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology to characterize the synaptic connections between M1 and layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in S1 of mice (both sexes). We found that M1 synapses onto IT cells displayed modest short-term depression, whereas synapses onto PT neurons showed robust short-term facilitation. Despite M1 inputs to IT cells depressing, their slower kinetics resulted in summation and a response that increased during short trains. In contrast, summation was minimal in PT neurons due to the fast time course of their M1 responses. The functional consequences of this reduced summation, however, were outweighed by the strong facilitation at these M1 synapses, resulting in larger response amplitudes in PT neurons than IT cells during repetitive stimulation. To understand the impact of facilitating M1 inputs on PT output, we paired trains of inputs with single backpropagating action potentials, finding that repetitive M1 activation increased the probability of bursts in PT cells without impacting the time dependence of this coupling. Thus, there are two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of M1 synaptic excitation in L5 of S1, each defined by the short-term dynamics of its synapses, the class of postsynaptic neurons, and how the neurons respond to those inputs.</p>

                Near-death experience (NDE) is a transcendent mental event of uncertain etiology that arises on the cusp of biological death. Since the discovery of NDE in the mid-1970s, multiple neuroscientific theories have been developed in an attempt to account for it in strictly materialistic or reductionistic terms. Therefore, in this conception, NDE is at most an extraordinary hallucination without any otherworldly, spiritual, or supernatural denotations. During the last decade or so, a number of animal and clinical studies have emerged which reported that about the time of death, there may be a surge of high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) at a time when cortical electrical activity is otherwise at a very low ebb. This oscillatory rhythm falls within the range of the enigmatic brain wave-labelled gamma-band activity (GBA). Therefore, it has been proposed that this brief, paradoxical, and perimortem burst of the GBA may represent the neural foundation of the NDE. This study examines three separate but related questions concerning this phenomenon. The first problem pertains to the electrogenesis of standard GBA and the extent to which authentic cerebral activity has been contaminated by myogenic artifacts. The second problem involves the question of whether agents that can mimic NDE are also underlain by GBA. The third question concerns the electrogenesis of the surge in GBA itself. It has been contended that this is neither cortical nor myogenic in origin. Rather, it arises in a subcortical (amygdaloid) location but is recorded at the cortex via volume conduction, thereby mimicking standard GBA. Although this surge of GBA contains genuine electrophysiological activity and is an intriguing and provocative finding, there is little evidence to suggest that it could act as a kind of neurobiological skeleton for a phenomenon such as NDE.

                Background Hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord are a complex and diagnostically challenging entity that can present with diverse clinical features. This study protocol outlines a comprehensive investigation to understand the causes, clinical and imaging characteristics, and correlation with pathological findings of hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord. By establishing a systematic assessment approach, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into these abnormalities’ diagnostic and prognostic implications. Methods The study will be conducted as a prospective observational design. Patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected spinal cord lesion presenting with intramedullary T2-weighted hyperintensity and referred for MRI evaluation will be included. Data collection will encompass patient demographics, clinical features, and extensive imaging parameters. Pathological data, when available, will be correlated with imaging findings. Various statistical methods will be employed to analyse the data, including frequency analysis, comparative tests, logistic regression, and survival analysis. Expected Results The study anticipates elucidating the spectrum of etiologies underlying hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord and their clinical and imaging profiles. The systematic approach will offer a structured diagnostic method, while correlations with pathological data will provide an enhanced understanding of these conditions. The results are expected to provide clinicians with valuable insights into diagnosing, treating, and prognosticating patients with spinal cord hyperintensities on T2-weighted images.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. Methods We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. Results Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). Conclusions This study’s findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background The 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths officially reported to the World Health Organization. Previous studies investigating factors associated with death had conflicting findings, interventions showing promising outcomes had small sample sizes, studies were often single- or dual-country based and most focused on laboratory-confirmed EVD and not on clinically-suspected EVD. We used the Ebola data platform of the Infectious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO) to review individual patient records to assess factors associated with death, and particularly whether there were differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-suspected cases. Methods This was a cohort study involving analysis of secondary data in the IDDO database. The study population included all patients classified as having either clinically-suspected or laboratory-confirmed EVD, admitted to 22 Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between December 2013 and March 2016. Baseline characteristics and treatments were documented along with ETU exit outcomes. Factors associated with death were investigated by multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results There were 14,163 patients, of whom 6,208 (43.8%) were laboratory-confirmed and 7,955 (56.2%) were clinically-suspected. Outcomes were not recorded in 2,889 (20.4%) patients. Of the 11,274 patients with known outcomes, 4,090 (36.3%) died: 2,956 (43.6%) with laboratory-confirmed EVD and 1,134 (18.8%) with clinically-suspected EVD. The strongest risk factor for death was confirmed disease status. Patients with laboratory-confirmed disease had 2.9 times higher risk of death compared to clinically-suspected patients, after adjusting for other co-variables. Other factors significantly associated with death included a higher risk for patients aged ≥60 years and a lower risk for patients in Sierra Leone. Conclusions Although laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to ETUs fared worse than clinically-suspected patients, the latter still had a substantial risk of death and more attention needs to be paid to this group in future EVD outbreaks.

                Background Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of the penis characterized by ventral opening of urethra. This abnormality is often accompanied by scrotal abnormalities, where both penile and scrotal development occur at the same time during the fetal period. This study aims to analyze associated scrotal anomalies in children with hypospadias. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of boys diagnosed with hypospadias during a 6 years period. The age of patients, severity of hypospadias, and associated scrotal anomalies such as penoscrotal transposition (PST), bifid scrotum (BS), and scrotal hypoplasia were assessed. Scrotoplasty procedure was also recorded. The association between the severity of hypospadias, incidence of scrotal anomalies, severity of both PST and BF were analyzed using Chi-square test and alternatively Fisher exact test, p<0,05 considered significant. Results During the study period, there were 240 hypospadias patients, with a median age of 5,6 years. Most patients had severe hypospadias. Associated scrotal anomalies were found in 63,3% of patients. Incidence of scrotal anomaly was higher in patients with severe hypospadias (75%) compared to mild cases (75% vs 36.1%; p<0.001; PR= 2.08 (95% CI: 1.51 – 2.86)). Patients with severe hypospadias had a more severe PST, especially in bilateral minor and major forms compared to patients with mild cases (p<0.001); and was significantly associated with severe and partial type of SB (p<0.001). Patients with a more severe PST tend to have a more severe SB, on contrary, patients with minor PST tend to have a milder or even no BS (p<0.001). Scrotoplasty was performed in 35,4% of cases. Conclusion Most hypospadias patients had associated scrotal anomaly, in which severe hypospadias was associated with the more severe type of PST and BS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-670/v1?src=rss">Recent advances in the design of SERS substrates and sensing systems for (bio)sensing applications: Systems from single cell to single molecule detection [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Raman effect originates from spontaneous inelastic scattering of photons by matter. These photons provide a characteristic fingerprint of this matter, and are extensively utilized for chemical and biological sensing. The probability of generation, and hence the detection of these Raman scattered photons, is very low; hence, it is difficult to use this directly for sensing in complex matrices. To amplify this signal, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been extensively investigated and has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for sensing diverse analytes, including ions, small molecules, inorganics, organics, radionucleotides, and cells. Plasmonic nanoparticles, called hotspots, exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). This amplifies the Raman signal and may offer up to a 1010-fold SERS signal enhancement. The development of SERS active substrates requires further consideration and optimization of several critical features such as surface periodicity, hotspot density, mitigation of sample or surface autofluorescence, tuning of surface hydrophilicities, use of specific (bio) recognition elements with suitable linkers and bioconjugation chemistries, and use of appropriate optics to obtain relevant sensing outcomes in terms of sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, limit of detection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stability, shelf-life, and disposability. This article details the optimization of the aforementioned considerations in the use of disposable materials such as commercial grades of paper, textiles, glasses, polymers, and some specific substrates such as blue-ray digital versatile discs (DVDs) for use as SERS-active substrates for point-of-use (POU) sensing applications. The advancements in these technologies have been reviewed and critiqued for analyte detection in resource-limited settings, highlighting the prospects of applications ranging from single-molecule to single-cell detection.

                Background Tuberculosis is one of the diseases that requires comprehensive treatment. This disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air. Climate factors play a role in the increasing cases of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the correlation between climatic variables and TB in Kolaka District, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, Methods This research was modeled using an autoregressive (AR) Bayesian model with three possible likelihoods; Gaussian, Poisson and Negative Binomial responses. Results Minimum temperature and average temperature, a coefficient of 4.234 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in minimum temperature, there is an estimated increase of approximately four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Maximum temperature, a coefficient of 17.851 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in maximum temperature, there is an estimated increase of around 17-18 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Humidity, a coefficient of -13.413 suggests that for every 1% increase in humidity, there is an estimated decrease of around 13 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Rainfall, a coefficient of -0.327 suggests that for every 1 mm increase in rainfall, there is an estimated decrease of around 0.327 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Light, a coefficient of -4.322 suggests that for every 1-hour increase in light duration, there is an estimated decrease of around four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Conclusions Climate change has a significant impact on tuberculosis through temperature-related factors. These factors influence the prevalence, spread, and vulnerability to TB. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach involving adaptation planning. Strong public health systems and healthcare infrastructure can help mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change-related tuberculosis.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                Introduction Actinomycosis is an uncommon inflammatory bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species, especially Actinomyces Israeli. Abdominopelvic forms are relatively rare and may involve the colon as a solid mass, mimicking a malignant tumor. Case presentation A 68-year-old Tunisian man, with a history of diabetes, hypertension, penicillin allergy, and renal failure, presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. CT scan showed an acute intestinal obstruction upstream with obstructive tissular mass at the sigmoid colon. Emergency surgery revealed a sigmoid mass and a pre-perforative cecum. Subtotal colectomy was performed, with ileostomy and distal end closure. Histological examination confirmed Actinomyces infection. The patient was then placed on long-term doxycycline and Bactrim, with no recurrence over a 9-month follow-up period. Conclusion Abdominal actinomycosis, though rare, presents diagnostic challenges. It can be mistaken for malignancy, leading to unnecessary surgery in non-complicated cases, since it is effectively treated by antibiotics. In complicated cases, a combined approach involving both surgery and antibiotic therapy is necessary until the infection is completely eradicated.

<i>Candida albicans</i> is a commensal of the human microbiota that can form biofilms on implanted medical devices. These biofilms are tolerant to antifungals and to the host immune system. To identify novel genes modulating <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> biofilm formation, we performed a large-scale screen with 2,454 <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> doxycycline-dependent overexpression strains and identified 16 genes whose overexpression significantly hampered biofilm formation. Among those, overexpression of the <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> paralogs that encode transcription factors and have orthologs only in biofilm-forming species of the <i>Candida</i> clade, caused impaired biofilm formation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> impeded biofilm formation without any defect in hyphal growth. Transcript profiling, transcription factor binding, and phenotypic microarray analyses conducted upon overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> demonstrated their role in reprogramming cellular metabolism by regulating central metabolism including glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes. Taken together, this study has identified a new set of biofilm regulators, including <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i>, that appear to control biofilm development through their specific role in metabolic remodeling.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy and the most significant contributor to mortality in female oncology patients. Potassium Two Pore Domain Channel Subfamily K Member 1 (KCNK1) is differentially expressed in a variety of tumors, but the mechanism of its function in breast cancer is unknown. In this study, we found for the first time that KCNK1 was significantly up-regulated in human breast cancer and was correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. KCNK1 promoted breast cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and vivo. Further studies unexpectedly revealed that KCNK1 increased the glycolysis and lactate production in breast cancer cells by binding to and activating lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which promoted histones lysine lactylation to induce the expression of a series of downstream genes and LDHA itself. Notably, increased expression of LDHA served as a vicious positive feedback to reduce tumor cell stiffness and adhesion, which eventually resulted in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that KCNK1 may serve as a potential breast cancer biomarker, and deeper insight into the cancer-promoting mechanism of KCNK1 may uncover a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23620?af=R">Temporal organization of narrative recall is present but attenuated in adults with hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies of the impact of brain injury on memory processes often focus on the quantity and episodic richness of those recollections. Here, we argue that the organization of one's recollections offers critical insights into the impact of brain injury on functional memory. It is well-established in studies of word list memory that free recall of unrelated words exhibits a clear temporal organization. This <i>temporal contiguity effect</i> refers to the fact that the order in which word lists are recalled reflects the original presentation order. Little is known, however, about the organization of recall for semantically rich materials, nor how recall organization is impacted by hippocampal damage and memory impairment. The present research is the first study, to our knowledge, of temporal organization in semantically rich narratives in three groups: (1) Adults with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, (2) adults with bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage and no memory impairment, and (3) demographically matched non-brain-injured comparison participants. We find that although the narrative recall of adults with bilateral hippocampal damage reflected the temporal order in which those narratives were experienced above chance levels, their temporal contiguity effect was significantly attenuated relative to comparison groups. In contrast, individuals with vmPFC damage did not differ from non-brain-injured comparison participants in temporal contiguity. This pattern of group differences yields insights into the cognitive and neural systems that support the use of temporal organization in recall. These data provide evidence that the retrieval of temporal context in narrative recall is hippocampal-dependent, whereas damage to the vmPFC does not impair the temporal organization of narrative recall. This evidence of limited but demonstrable organization of memory in participants with hippocampal damage and amnesia speaks to the power of narrative structures in supporting meaningfully organized recall despite memory impairment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-200/v4?src=rss">Spatio-temporal characteristics of Tuberculosis in Ghana [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a key contributor to global mortality; ranks second as the most fatal infectious disease and seventh among the top ten causes of death in Ghana. There is insufficient literature regarding the utilization of Bayesian hierarchical models for examining the spatial and spatio-temporal dynamics of tuberculosis risk in Ghana. Aim This study addresses this gap by determining TB hotspots regions in Ghana using the Bayesian modeling framework. Methods TB data were obtained from the Ghana Health Service and National Tuberculosis Programme for the 10 administrative regions of Ghana, from 2008 to 2017. Spatial and spatio-temporal TB relative risk for each region were estimated under the Bayesian modeling frameworks. Maps for TB risks were created to visualized regions with TB hotspots. Model fitting and parameter estimation were conducted using integrated nested Laplace approximation via R version 4.3.2. Results Among the baseline predictors, TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income were found to be most significant predictors of TB risk in Ghana. We noted an increased risk of TB infection in the Northern zone and the Eastern and Greater Accra regions in the Southern zone. Spatio-temporal distribution of TB infection risk was predominantly concentrated in the Southern zone. Clustering of TB risk was observed among neighboring regions. Conclusion Factors influencing tuberculosis (TB) risk in Ghana are TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, HIV prevalence, literacy rate, and income level. The risk distribution was mainly concentrated in the Southern zone, with clusters of TB risk observed among neighboring regions. To achieve a significant reduction in TB cases, it is essential to allocate resources to TB hotspots regions and also implement measures to control significant predictors of TB infection risk.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1369/v4?src=rss">Micronutrients in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR); 60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE. The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or “adverse pregnancy” associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance, structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1226/v2?src=rss">Post-pubertal management of undescended testes from the malignancy risk point of view: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Undescended testes (UDT) is a condition where one or both testes is absent in the scrotum. The general age recommendation in which the treatment should be performed is before 18 months old due to the infertility risk and malignancy in later life. On the other hand, in post-pubertal UDT, the current guideline recommends orchiectomy; however, this recommendation is weak. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of post-pubertal UDT treatment, focusing on the malignancy risk point of view. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Wiley Online Library and the Cochrane Library up to 5 March 2023. Any study with either post-pubertal orchiectomy or orchidopexy in patients with UDT and reporting the testicular malignancy was included. The exclusion criteria were studies with lack of information of UDT correction time, no history of correction and the full text wasn’t available. The data collected were the occurrence of testicular malignancy in post-pubertal UDT patients corrected with any method. Quality and bias assessment was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results Seven articles (three case reports and four observational studies) were reviewed with a total of 42 patients who underwent post-pubertal correction of either unilateral or bilateral UDT. The correction age ranged from 13 to 34 years old, with follow-up of 48.7–252 months. Among those who developed malignancies, the most common were seminoma, teratoma and carcinoma in situ of the testes. In addition, this study was able to propose an algorithm for post-pubertal UDT treatment strategy. Conclusions The scarce resource was the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this review showed that post-pubertal UDT management should be tailored individually. Several factors that should be considered include the condition of the contralateral descended testis, UDT location, serum testosterone level, patient’s age, comorbidities, and interest in fertility.

                Sudden deafness is a common cause of emergency consultation in otology. Usually, despite investigations, no etiology is known. Intracochlear hemorrhage is a rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and may be associated with various labyrinthine disorders. In such cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clef of the diagnosis. We report the case of a 70-year-old patient who was referred to our department for sudden hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Otoscopic and neurological examinations were normal, and pure-tone audiometry revealed left profound sensorineural hearing loss. Videonystagmography (VNG) revealed left vestibular deficit. MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity inside the cochlea on unenhanced T1-weighted images, and no other abnormalities were found; in particular, no enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. No etiology was identified. Vertigo disappeared rapidly with corticosteroid treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but hearing did not improve. Intra-labyrinthine hemorrhage causing SSNHL is rare, and the hearing prognosis is poor.

                Background The Cipto Triage Method (CTM) is a method developed in Indonesia for assessing the clinical acuity of emergency department patients. To evaluate the accuracy of the CTM, this study compared triage decisions using the CTM performed by nurses to the triage decisions performed by emergency medical officers (EMO). Methods This cross-sectional diagnostic study was performed in a single-centre referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Adult patients who attended the emergency department (ED) met the inclusion criteria. Trauma cases, pregnancy, and psychiatric disorders were excluded. All eligible patients underwent triage assessment based on CTM by a triage nurse and were then referred to the ED treatment zone for triage assessment performed by an EMO. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio were calculated. Results Between April and July 2022, 902 participants were randomly selected. The overall accuracy of the triage assessment of the index test was 84.7%, and the PPV of resuscitation and urgent triage was very good (90.5% and 84.5%, respectively). In the non-urgent category, the PPV was acceptable (72%), but the NPV was very good (92.2%). Conclusions Nurse-based triage assessment using CTM in the ED had very good accuracy in determining clinical acuity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94748">Coordinated molecular and ecological adaptations underlie a highly successful parasitoid</a></h4>

              
                The success of an organism depends on the molecular and ecological adaptations that promote its beneficial fitness. Parasitoids are valuable biocontrol agents for successfully managing agricultural pests, and they have evolved diversified strategies to adapt to both the physiological condition of hosts and the competition of other parasitoids. Here, we deconstructed the parasitic strategies in a highly successful parasitoid, <i>Trichopria drosophilae</i>, which parasitizes a broad range of <i>Drosophila</i> hosts, including the globally invasive species <i>D. suzukii</i>. We found that <i>T. drosophilae</i> had developed specialized venom proteins that arrest host development to obtain more nutrients via secreting tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), as well as a unique type of cell—teratocytes—that digest host tissues for feeding by releasing trypsin proteins. In addition to the molecular adaptations that optimize nutritional uptake, this pupal parasitoid has evolved ecologically adaptive strategies including the conditional tolerance of intraspecific competition to enhance parasitic success in older hosts and the obligate avoidance of interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. Our study not only demystifies how parasitoids weaponize themselves to colonize formidable hosts but also provided empirical evidence of the intricate coordination between the molecular and ecological adaptations that drive evolutionary success.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90606">Automated multiconformer model building for X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM</a></h4>

              
                In their folded state, biomolecules exchange between multiple conformational states that are crucial for their function. Traditional structural biology methods, such as X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), produce density maps that are ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in various conformations. Yet, most models derived from these maps explicitly represent only a single conformation, overlooking the complexity of biomolecular structures. To accurately reflect the diversity of biomolecular forms, there is a pressing need to shift toward modeling structural ensembles that mirror the experimental data. However, the challenge of distinguishing signal from noise complicates manual efforts to create these models. In response, we introduce the latest enhancements to qFit, an automated computational strategy designed to incorporate protein conformational heterogeneity into models built into density maps. These algorithmic improvements in qFit are substantiated by superior R<sub>free</sub> and geometry metrics across a wide range of proteins. Importantly, unlike more complex multicopy ensemble models, the multiconformer models produced by qFit can be manually modified in most major model building software (e.g., Coot) and fit can be further improved by refinement using standard pipelines (e.g., Phenix, Refmac, Buster). By reducing the barrier of creating multiconformer models, qFit can foster the development of new hypotheses about the relationship between macromolecular conformational dynamics and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81698">Discovery of runs-of-homozygosity diplotype clusters and their associations with diseases in UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments, contiguous homozygous regions in a genome were traditionally linked to families and inbred populations. However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for the efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and are shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and hemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped or imputed. Using a genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase in mortality among COVID-19 patients (P-value=1.82×10<sup>-11</sup>). In summary, our ROH-DICE method, by calling out large ROH diplotypes in a large outbred population, enables further population genetics into the demographic history of large populations. More importantly, our method enables a new genome-wide mapping approach for finding disease-causing loci with multi-marker recessive effects at a population scale.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84747">Arabidopsis transcriptome responses to low water potential using high-throughput plate assays</a></h4>

              
                Soil-free assays that induce water stress are routinely used to investigate drought responses in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Due to their ease of use, the research community often relies on polyethylene glycol (PEG), mannitol, and salt (NaCl) treatments to reduce the water potential of agar media, and thus induce drought conditions in the laboratory. However, while these types of stress can create phenotypes that resemble those of water deficit experienced by soil-grown plants, it remains unclear how these treatments compare at the transcriptional level. Here, we demonstrate that these different methods of lowering water potential elicit both shared and distinct transcriptional responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoot and root tissue. When we compared these transcriptional responses to those found in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots subject to vermiculite drying, we discovered many genes induced by vermiculite drying were repressed by low water potential treatments on agar plates (and vice versa). Additionally, we also tested another method for lowering water potential of agar media. By increasing the nutrient content and tensile strength of agar, we show the ‘hard agar’ (HA) treatment can be leveraged as a high-throughput assay to investigate natural variation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> growth responses to low water potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88985">The Alk receptor tyrosine kinase regulates Sparkly, a novel activity regulating neuropeptide precursor in the Drosophila central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Numerous roles for the Alk receptor tyrosine kinase have been described in <i>Drosophila</i>, including functions in the central nervous system (CNS), however the molecular details are poorly understood. To gain mechanistic insight, we employed Targeted DamID (TaDa) transcriptional profiling to identify targets of Alk signaling in the larval CNS. TaDa was employed in larval CNS tissues, while genetically manipulating Alk signaling output. The resulting TaDa data were analyzed together with larval CNS scRNA-seq datasets performed under similar conditions, identifying a role for Alk in the transcriptional regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. Further integration with bulk and scRNA-seq datasets from larval brains in which Alk signaling was manipulated identified a previously uncharacterized <i>Drosophila</i> neuropeptide precursor encoded by <i>CG4577</i> as an Alk signaling transcriptional target. <i>CG4577</i>, which we named <i>Sparkly (Spar)</i>, is expressed in a subset of Alk-positive neuroendocrine cells in the developing larval CNS, including circadian clock neurons. In agreement with our TaDa analysis, overexpression of the <i>Drosophila</i> Alk ligand Jeb resulted in increased levels of Spar protein in the larval CNS. We show that Spar protein is expressed in circadian (clock) neurons, and flies lacking Spar exhibit defects in sleep and circadian activity control. In summary, we report a novel activity regulating neuropeptide precursor gene that is regulated by Alk signaling in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94547">The non-mitotic role of HMMR in regulating the localization of TPX2 and the dynamics of microtubules in neurons</a></h4>

              
                A functional nervous system is built upon the proper morphogenesis of neurons to establish the intricate connection between them. The microtubule cytoskeleton is known to play various essential roles in this morphogenetic process. While many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuronal morphogenesis, the function of many more remains to be determined. This study focuses on a MAP called HMMR in mice, which was originally identified as a hyaluronan binding protein and later found to possess microtubule and centrosome binding capacity. HMMR exhibits high abundance on neuronal microtubules and altering the level of HMMR significantly affects the morphology of neurons. Instead of confining to the centrosome(s) like cells in mitosis, HMMR localizes to microtubules along axons and dendrites. Furthermore, transiently expressing HMMR enhances the stability of neuronal microtubules and increases the formation frequency of growing microtubules along the neurites. HMMR regulates the microtubule localization of a non-centrosomal microtubule nucleator TPX2 along the neurite, offering an explanation for how HMMR contributes to the promotion of growing microtubules. This study sheds light on how cells utilize proteins involved in mitosis for non-mitotic functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96876">Drosophila medulla neuroblast termination via apoptosis, differentiation and gliogenic switch is scheduled by the depletion of the neuroepithelial stem cell pool</a></h4>

              
                The brain is consisted of diverse neurons arising from a limited number of neural stem cells. <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NBs) produces specific neural lineages of various lineage sizes depending on their location in the brain. In the <i>Drosophila</i> visual processing centre - the optic lobes (OLs), medulla NBs derived from the neuroepithelium (NE) give rise to neurons and glia cells of the medulla cortex. The timing and the mechanisms responsible for the cessation of medulla NBs are so far not known. In this study, we show that the termination of medulla NBs during early pupal development is determined by the exhaustion of the NE stem cell pool. Hence, altering NE-NB transition during larval neurogenesis disrupts the timely termination of medulla NBs. Medulla NBs terminate neurogenesis via a combination of apoptosis, terminal symmetric division via Prospero, and a switch to gliogenesis via Glial Cell Missing (Gcm), however, these processes occur independently of each other. We also show that temporal progression of the medulla NBs is mostly not required for their termination. As the <i>Drosophila</i> OL shares a similar mode of division with mammalian neurogenesis, understanding when and how these progenitors cease proliferation during development can have important implications for mammalian brain size determination and regulation of its overall function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90735">A novel method for estimating properties of attentional oscillators reveals an age-related decline in flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic attending theory proposes that the ability to track temporal cues in the auditory environment is governed by entrainment, the synchronization between internal oscillations and regularities in external auditory signals. Here, we focused on two key properties of internal oscillators: their preferred rate, the default rate in the absence of any input; and their flexibility, how they adapt to changes in rhythmic context. We developed methods to estimate oscillator properties (Experiment 1) and compared the estimates across tasks and individuals (Experiment 2). Preferred rates, estimated as the stimulus rates with peak performance, showed a harmonic relationship across measurements and were correlated with individuals’ <i>spontaneous motor tempo</i>. Estimates from motor tasks were slower than those from the perceptual task, and the degree of slowing was consistent for each individual. Task performance decreased with trial-to-trial changes in stimulus rate, and responses on individual trials were biased toward the preceding trial’s stimulus properties. Flexibility, quantified as an individual’s ability to adapt to faster-than-previous rates, decreased with age. These findings show domain-specific rate preferences for the assumed oscillatory system underlying rhythm perception and production, and that this system loses its ability to flexibly adapt to changes in the external rhythmic context during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89889">Choline supplementation in early life improves and low levels of choline can impair outcomes in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves cognition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models. However, the effects of MCS on neuronal hyperexcitability in AD are unknown. We investigated the effects of MCS in a well-established mouse model of AD with hyperexcitability, the Tg2576 mouse. The most common type of hyperexcitability in Tg2576 mice are generalized EEG spikes (interictal spikes [IIS]). IIS also are common in other mouse models and occur in AD patients. In mouse models, hyperexcitability is also reflected by elevated expression of the transcription factor ∆FosB in the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), which are the principal cell type. Therefore, we studied ΔFosB expression in GCs. We also studied the neuronal marker NeuN within hilar neurons of the DG because reduced NeuN protein expression is a sign of oxidative stress or other pathology. This is potentially important because hilar neurons regulate GC excitability. Tg2576 breeding pairs received a diet with a relatively low, intermediate, or high concentration of choline. After weaning, all mice received the intermediate diet. In offspring of mice fed the high choline diet, IIS frequency declined, GC ∆FosB expression was reduced, and hilar NeuN expression was restored. Using the novel object location task, spatial memory improved. In contrast, offspring exposed to the relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, such as increased mortality. They had the weakest hilar NeuN immunoreactivity and greatest GC ΔFosB protein expression. However, their IIS frequency was low, which was surprising. The results provide new evidence that a diet high in choline in early life can improve outcomes in a mouse model of AD, and relatively low choline can have mixed effects. This is the first study showing that dietary choline can regulate hyperexcitability, hilar neurons, ΔFosB, and spatial memory in an animal model of AD.

">Bidirectional valence coding in amygdala intercalated clusters:A neural substrate for the opponent-process theory of motivation</a></h4>

              
                Processing emotionally meaningful stimuli and eliciting appropriate valence-specific behavior in response is a critical brain function for survival. Thus, how positive and negative valence are represented in neural circuits and how corresponding neural substrates interact to cooperatively select appropriate behavioral output are fundamental questions. In previous work, we identified that two amygdala intercalated clusters show opposite response selectivity to fear- and anxiety-inducing stimuli - negative valence (Hagihara et al. 2021). Here, we further show that the two clusters also exhibit distinctly different representations of stimuli with positive valence, demonstrating a broader role of the amygdala intercalated system beyond fear and anxiety. Together with the mutually inhibitory connectivity between the two clusters, our findings suggest that they serve as an ideal neural substrate for the integrated processing of valence for the selection of behavioral output.

">Gut-immune reactivity underlies sex differences in the maternal immune activation preclinical model of autism</a></h4>

              
                The gut microbiome plays a vital role in health and disease, including neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD affects 4:1 males-to-females, and sex differences are apparent in gut microbiota composition among ASD individuals and in animal models of this condition, such as the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model. However, few studies have included sex as a biological variable when assessing the role of gut microbiota in mediating ASD symptoms. Using the MIA model of ASD, we assessed whether gut microbiota contributes to the sex differences in the presentation of ASD-like behaviors. Gut microbiota transplantation from MIA or vehicle/control male and female mice into healthy, otherwise unmanipulated, 4-week-old C57Bl/6 mice was performed for 6 treatments over 12 days. Colonization with male, but not female, MIA microbiota was sufficient to reduce sociability, increase repetitive burying behavior, decrease microbiota diversity and increase neuroinflammation with more pronounced deficits in male recipients. Colonization with both male and female donor microbiota altered juvenile ultrasonic vocalizations and anxiety-like behavior in recipients of both sexes, and there was an accompanied change in the gut microbiota and serum cytokine IL-4 and IL-7 levels of all recipients of MIA gut microbiota. In addition to the increases in gut microbes associated with pathological states, the female donor microbiota profile also had increases in gut microbes with known neural protective effects (e.g., Lactobacillus and Rikenella). These results suggest that gut reactivity to environmental insults, such as in the MIA model, plays a pivotal role in shaping the sex disparity observed in ASD development.

">Covert actions of epidural stimulation on spinal locomotor circuits</a></h4>

              
                Spinal circuitry produces the rhythm and patterning of locomotion. However, both descending and sensory inputs are required to initiate and adapt locomotion to the environment. Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts descending controls of the spinal cord, producing paralysis. Epidural stimulation (ES) is a promising clinical therapy for motor control recovery and is capable of reactivating the lumbar spinal locomotor networks, yet little is known about the effects of ES on locomotor neurons. Previously, we found that both sensory afferent pathways and serotonin exert mixed excitatory and inhibitory actions on lumbar interneurons involved in the generation of the locomotor rhythm, identified by the transcription factor Shox2. However, after chronic complete SCI, sensory afferent inputs to Shox2 interneurons become almost exclusively excitatory and Shox2 interneurons are supersensitive to serotonin. Here, we investigated the effects of ES on these SCI-induced changes. Inhibitory input from sensory pathways to Shox2 interneurons was maintained and serotonin supersensitivity was not observed in SCI mice that received daily sub-motor threshold ES. Interestingly, the effects of ES were maintained for at least three weeks after the ES was discontinued. In contrast, the effects of ES were not observed in Shox2 interneurons from mice that received ES after the establishment of the SCI-induced changes. Our results demonstrate mechanistic actions of ES at the level of identified spinal locomotor circuit neurons and the effectiveness of early treatment with ES on preservation of spinal locomotor circuitry after SCI, suggesting possible therapeutic benefits prior to the onset of motor rehabilitation.

                Early diagnosis and biomarker discovery to bolster the therapeutic pipeline for Parkinson's disease (PD) are urgently needed. In this study, we leverage the large-scale whole-blood total RNA-seq dataset from the Accelerating Medicine Partnership in Parkinson's Disease (AMP PD) program to identify PD-associated RNAs, including both known genes and novel circular RNAs (circRNA) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). There were 1,111 significant marker RNAs, including 491 genes, 599 eRNAs, and 21 circRNAs, that were first discovered in the PPMI cohort (FDR < 0.05) and confirmed in the PDBP/BioFIND cohorts (nominal p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis showed that the PD-associated genes are involved in neutrophil activation and degranulation, as well as the TNF-alpha signaling pathway. We further compare the PD-associated genes in blood with those in post-mortem brain dopamine neurons in our BRAINcode cohort. 44 genes show significant changes with the same direction in both PD brain neurons and PD blood, including neuroinflammation-associated genes IKBIP, CXCR2, and NFKBIB. Finally, we built a novel multi-omics machine learning model to predict PD diagnosis with high performance (AUC = 0.89), which was superior to previous studies and might aid the decision-making for PD diagnosis in clinical practice. In summary, this study delineates a wide spectrum of the known and novel RNAs linked to PD and are detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale dataset. It provides a generally useful computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction.

">Childhood brain morphometry in children with persistent stunting and catch-up growth</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early childhood stunting affects around 150 million young children worldwide and leads to suboptimal human potential in later life. However, there is limited data on the effects of early childhood stunting and catch-up growth on brain morphometry. Methods: We evaluated childhood brain volumes at nine years of age in a community-based birth-cohort follow-up study in Vellore, south India among four groups based on anthropometric assessments at two, five, and nine years namely 'Never Stunted' (NS), 'Stunted at two years and caught up by five years' (S2N5), 'Stunted at two and five years and caught up by nine years' (S2N9), and 'Always Stunted' (AS). T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were acquired using a 3T MRI scanner, and brain volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer software. Findings: Amongst 251 children from the overall cohort, 178 children with a mean age of 9.54 were considered for further analysis. The total brain volume, subcortical volume, bilateral cerebellar white matter, and posterior corpus callosum showed a declining trend from NS to AS. Regional cortical brain analysis showed significant lower bilateral lateral occipital volumes, right pallidum, bilateral caudate, and right thalamus volumes between NS and AS. Interpretation: To the best of our knowledge, this first neuroimaging analysis to investigate the effects of persistent childhood stunting and catch-up growth on brain volumetry indicates impairment at different brain levels involving total brain and subcortical volumes, networking/connecting centres (thalamus, basal ganglia, callosum, cerebellum) and visual processing area of lateral occipital cortex.

                The ability to reconstruct imagery represented by the brain has the potential to give us an intuitive understanding of what the brain sees. Reconstruction of visual input from human fMRI data has garnered significant attention in recent years. Comparatively less focus has been directed towards vision reconstruction from single-cell recordings, despite its potential to provide a more direct measure of the information represented by the brain. Here, we achieve high-quality reconstructions of videos presented to mice, from the activity of neurons in their visual cortex. Using our method of video optimization via gradient descent through a state-of-the-art dynamic neural encoding model we reliably reconstruct 10-second movies at 30 Hz from two-photon calcium imaging data. We achieve a {approx} 2-fold increase in pixel-by-pixel correlation compared to previous reconstructions of static images from mouse V1, while also capturing temporal dynamics. We find that critical for high-quality reconstructions are the number of neurons in the dataset and the use of model ensembling.

">Cortical synaptic vulnerabilities revealed in a α-synuclein aggregation model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment is a frequent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease, and cortical Lewy pathology is strongly associated with cognitive decline. Synaptic pathology has been observed in the PD cortex, but the extent of synaptic vulnerabilities and their temporal and spatial relationship to pathology remains unclear. We employed high-resolution imaging to analyze synaptic abnormalities in layer 5 of the secondary motor cortex. We used striatal injections of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils as a model to cause the progressive pathological aggregation of endogenous -synuclein. We find that cortical -synuclein pathology results in the progressive loss of excitatory synapses, followed by a reduction in inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Synapse loss is most pronounced in areas with high pathology. Additionally, we observed ultrastructural changes in the remaining excitatory synaptic loci, including smaller synaptic vesicles. Consistent with these results, gene ontology analysis of synaptic genes exhibiting altered expression in pathological neurons supported pre- and post-synaptic changes, including in synapse organizing pathways. Our results demonstrate that -synuclein aggregation in the cortex is linked to molecular and structural alterations that disrupt synaptic connectivity and provide insights into the progressive PD-relevant vulnerability of cortical synapses.

">Neurotransmitter release is triggered by a calcium-induced rearrangement in the Synaptotagmin-1/SNARE complex primary interface</a></h4>

              
                The Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 triggers neurotransmitter release together with the neuronal SNARE complex formed by syntaxin-1, SNAP25 and synaptobrevin. Moreover, synaptotagmin-1 increases synaptic vesicle priming and impairs spontaneous vesicle release. The synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain binds to the SNARE complex through a primary interface via two regions (I and II), but how exactly this interface mediates distinct functions of synaptotagmin-1, and the mechanism underlying Ca2+-triggering of release is unknown. Using mutagenesis and electrophysiological experiments, we show that region II is functionally and spatially subdivided: binding of C2B domain arginines to SNAP-25 acidic residues at one face of region II is crucial for Ca2+-evoked release but not for vesicle priming or clamping of spontaneous release, whereas other SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 acidic residues at the other face mediate priming and clamping of spontaneous release but not evoked release. Mutations that disrupt region I impair the priming and clamping functions of synaptotagmin-1 while, strikingly, mutations that enhance binding through this region increase vesicle priming and clamping of spontaneous release, but strongly inhibit evoked release and vesicle fusogenicity. These results support previous findings that the primary interface mediates the functions of synaptotagmin-1 in vesicle priming and clamping of spontaneous release, and, importantly, show that Ca2+-triggering of release requires a rearrangement of the primary interface involving dissociation of region I, while region II remains bound. Together with modeling and biophysical studies presented in the accompanying paper, our data suggest a model whereby this rearrangement pulls the SNARE complex to facilitate fast synaptic vesicle fusion.

	<p>Aim: Remethylation disorders such as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency reduce the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The resulting hyperhomocysteinemia can lead to serious neurological consequences and multisystem toxicity. The role of MTHFR genotypes has not been investigated in patients with Rett Syndrome (RTT). In this study, we sought to assess the impact of co-occurring MTHFR genotypes on symptom profiles in RTT. Method: Using pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, the MTHFR genetic polymorphisms rs1801133 (c.665C&amp;amp;gt;T mutation) and rs1801131 (c.1286A&amp;amp;gt;C mutation) were determined in 65 patients (18.7 years &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.1 [mean &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation]) with RTT as part of routine clinical care within the Centre for Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology (CIPP) Rett Centre, a National and Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the UK. The clinical severity of patients was assessed using the RTT-anchored Clinical Global Impression Scale (RTT-CGI). Results: The clinical severity symptom distribution varied between the homozygous and heterozygous MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes. Those with the homozygous genotype had a narrower spread of severity scores across several domains (language and communication, ambulation, hand-use and eye contact clinical domains). Patients with the homozygous genotype had statistically significantly greater CGI-Severity scores than individuals with a non-homozygous MTHFR genotype (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.44, p = 0.015). When comparing the ratings of moderately impaired (4), markedly impaired (5), severely impaired (6) and extremely impaired (7), individuals with the homozygous MTHFR genotype were more impaired than those with the non-homozygous MTHFR genotype (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.06, p = 0.039). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of prescribed anti-epileptic drugs between the genotypes. Conclusions: Our findings show that in those with a pathogenic RTT genetic variant, co-occurring homozygotic MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms may act as associative genetic modifiers of clinical severity in a subset of patients. Profiling of rs1801133 and rs1801131 in RTT may therefore be useful, especially for high-risk patients who may be at the most risk from symptom deterioration.</p>

	<p>Attention is an essential psychological component in sports games, which conditions sports success. The purpose of this study was to identify the attention style (internal or external) and the weight of attention qualities depending on the practiced team sport (basketball, volleyball, or handball) and gender (female or male), in athletes aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;18. A total of 177 active athletes (87 female (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation: 16.07 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.94 years) and 90 male (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation: 15.96 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.82 years)) were involved in the study, including 62 handball players (28 female and 34 male), 58 volleyball players (30 female and 28 male) and 57 basketball players (29 female and 28 male). In the study, two questionnaires were applied: one implemented to identify the attentive style with the two dimensions internal and external (standardized), called questionnaire for the assessment of attentional style in athletes (QASA), and one designed by us, called questionnaire to identify the weights of attention qualities according to the characteristics of the practiced sport (QAQCS), aiming to identify the most relevant quality of attention, depending on the practiced sport. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha for both questionnaires was between 0.701 and 0.855. The results recorded in the present study reveal a variation in the attentional style between the groups of athletes and between genders. The results of the study highlight that in handball, girls have a predominantly external style with a total of 10.213 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; handball, the predominant focus of attention is internal with a total score of 9.087 points. Girls&amp;amp;rsquo; volleyball focus of attention is predominantly external, with 8.999 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; volleyball, the attention style is internal, registering a score of 9.713 points. In girls&amp;amp;rsquo; basketball, the predominant focus of attention is internal, with a total score of 8.516 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; basketball, the external attention style is predominant, with 9.213 points. Looking at the weight of attention qualities, it was found that the most relevant for girls is concentration and mobility for handball players, stability was identified in volleyball, and distributiveness in basketball. In boys&amp;amp;rsquo; handball teams, mobility is the most essential, just like in basketball, and in volleyball it was found that stability has the biggest impact. ANOVA analysis highlighted statistically significant differences between groups of sports games by gender category, at both subscales of (QASA), as well as QAQCS, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. The results of our study highlight differences between the attentional styles and their qualities in relation to the gender and the specific sport played, which determines differentiated approaches to these psychological components</p>

	<p>The original conceptualization of REM sleep as paradoxical sleep was based on its EEG resembling wakefulness and its association with dreaming. Over time, the concept of paradox was expanded to include various associations with REM sleep, such as dream exclusivity, high recall, and pathophysiology. However, none of these associations are unique to REM sleep; they can also occur in other sleep states. Today, after more than fifty years of focused research, two aspects of REMS clearly retain paradoxical exclusivity. Despite the persistent contention that the EEG of human REMS consists of wake-like, low-voltage, non-synchronous electrical discharges, REMS is based on and defined by the intracranial electrical presence of 5&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz. theta, which has always been the marker of REMS in other animals. The wake-like EEG used to define REMS on human polysomnography is secondary to a generalized absence of electrophysiological waveforms because the strong waves of intracranial theta do not propagate to scalp electrodes placed outside the skull. It is a persistent paradox that the theta frequency is restricted to a cyclical intracranial dynamic that does not extend beyond the lining of the brain. REMS has a persistent association with narratively long and salient dream reports. However, the extension of this finding to equate REMS with dreaming led to a foundational error in neuroscientific logic. Major theories and clinical approaches were built upon this belief despite clear evidence that dreaming is reported throughout sleep in definingly different physiologic and phenomenological forms. Few studies have addressed the differences between the dreams reported from the different stages of sleep so that today, the most paradoxical aspect of REMS dreaming may be how little the state has actually been studied. An assessment of the differences in dreaming between sleep stages could provide valuable insights into how dreaming relates to the underlying brain activity and physiological processes occurring during each stage. The brain waves and dreams of REMS persist as being paradoxically unique and different from waking and the other states of sleep consciousness.</p>

                <p>Formation and retrieval of remote contextual memory depends on cortical engram neurons that are defined during learning. Manipulation of astrocytic G<SUB>q</SUB> and G<SUB>i</SUB> associated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling has been shown to affect memory processing, but little is known about the role of cortical astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in remote memory acquisition and the functioning of cortical engram neurons. We assessed this by chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male mice, during either encoding or consolidation of a contextual fear memory, while simultaneously labeling cortical engram neurons. We found that stimulation of astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB> signaling during memory encoding and consolidation did not alter remote memory expression. In line with this, the size of the mPFC engram population and the recall-induced reactivation of these neurons was unaffected. Hence, our data indicate that activation of G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in cortical astrocytes is not sufficient to alter memory performance and functioning of cortical engram neurons.</p>

                <p>How features of complex visual patterns are combined to drive perception and eye movements is not well understood. Here we simultaneously assessed human observers&rsquo; perceptual direction estimates and ocular following responses (OFR) evoked by moving plaids made from two summed gratings with varying contrast ratios. When the gratings were of equal contrast, observers&rsquo; eye movements and perceptual reports followed the motion of the plaid pattern. However, when the contrasts were unequal, eye movements and reports during early phases of the OFR were biased toward the direction of the high-contrast grating component; during later phases, both responses followed the plaid pattern direction. The shift from component- to pattern-driven behavior resembles the shift in tuning seen under similar conditions in neuronal responses recorded from monkey MT. Moreover, for some conditions, pattern tracking and perceptual reports were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. The OFR may therefore provide a precise behavioral readout of the dynamics of neural motion integration for complex visual patterns.</p>

                <p>by Soraya Mirzaei, Mojtaba Tefagh</p>

Microbial communities play fundamental roles in every complex ecosystem, such as soil, sea and the human body. The stability and diversity of the microbial community depend precisely on the composition of the microbiota. Any change in the composition of these communities affects microbial functions. An important goal of studying the interactions between species is to understand the behavior of microbes and their responses to perturbations. These interactions among species are mediated by the exchange of metabolites within microbial communities. We developed a computational model for the microbial community that has a separate compartment for exchanging metabolites. This model can predict possible metabolites that cause competition, commensalism, and mutual interactions between species within a microbial community. Our constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach provides insights to elucidate the pattern of metabolic interactions for each common metabolite between two microbes. To validate our approach, we used a toy model and a syntrophic co-culture of <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</i> and <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, as well as another in co-culture between <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> and <i>Rhodoferax ferrireducens</i>. For a more general evaluation, we applied our algorithm to the honeybee gut microbiome, composed of seven species, and the epiphyte strain <i>Pantoea eucalypti 299R</i>. The epiphyte strain Pe299R has been previously studied and cultured with six different phyllosphere bacteria. Our algorithm successfully predicts metabolites, which imply mutualistic, competitive, or commensal interactions. In contrast to OptCom, MRO, and MICOM algorithms, our COMMA algorithm shows that the potential for competitive interactions between an epiphytic species and Pe299R is not significant. These results are consistent with the experimental measurements of population density and reproductive success of the Pe299R strain.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used for non-invasive evaluation of hemodynamics. However, its routine use is limited by labor-intensive manual segmentation, CFD mesh creation, and time-consuming simulation. This study aims to train a deep learning model to both generate patient-specific volume-meshes of the pulmonary artery from 3D cardiac MRI data and directly estimate CFD flow fields. This proof-of-concept study used 135 3D cardiac MRIs from both a public and private dataset. The pulmonary arteries in the MRIs were manually segmented and converted into volume-meshes. CFD simulations were performed on ground truth meshes and interpolated onto point-point correspondent meshes to create the ground truth dataset. The dataset was split 110/10/15 for training, validation, and testing. Image2Flow, a hybrid image and graph convolutional neural network, was trained to transform a pulmonary artery template to patient-specific anatomy and CFD values, taking a specific inlet velocity as an additional input. Image2Flow was evaluated in terms of segmentation, and the accuracy of predicted CFD was assessed using node-wise comparisons. In addition, the ability of Image2Flow to respond to increasing inlet velocities was also evaluated. Image2Flow achieved excellent segmentation accuracy with a median Dice score of 0.91 (IQR: 0.86–0.92). The median node-wise normalized absolute error for pressure and velocity magnitude was 11.75% (IQR: 9.60–15.30%) and 9.90% (IQR: 8.47–11.90), respectively. Image2Flow also showed an expected response to increased inlet velocities with increasing pressure and velocity values. This proof-of-concept study has shown that it is possible to simultaneously perform patient-specific volume-mesh based segmentation and pressure and flow field estimation using Image2Flow. Image2Flow completes segmentation and CFD in ~330ms, which is ~5000 times faster than manual methods, making it more feasible in a clinical environment.

The unique structure of the human foot is seen as a crucial adaptation for bipedalism. The foot’s arched shape enables stiffening the foot to withstand high loads when pushing off, without compromising foot flexibility. Experimental studies demonstrated that manipulating foot stiffness has considerable effects on gait. In clinical practice, altered foot structure is associated with pathological gait. Yet, experimentally manipulating individual foot properties (e.g. arch height or tendon and ligament stiffness) is hard and therefore our understanding of how foot structure influences gait mechanics is still limited. Predictive simulations are a powerful tool to explore causal relationships between musculoskeletal properties and whole-body gait. However, musculoskeletal models used in three-dimensional predictive simulations assume a rigid foot arch, limiting their use for studying how foot structure influences three-dimensional gait mechanics. Here, we developed a four-segment foot model with a longitudinal arch for use in predictive simulations. We identified three properties of the ankle-foot complex that are important to capture ankle and knee kinematics, soleus activation, and ankle power of healthy adults: (1) compliant Achilles tendon, (2) stiff heel pad, (3) the ability to stiffen the foot. The latter requires sufficient arch height and contributions of plantar fascia, and intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles. A reduced ability to stiffen the foot results in walking patterns with reduced push-off power. Simulations based on our model also captured the effects of walking with anaesthetised intrinsic foot muscles or an insole limiting arch compression. The ability to reproduce these different experiments indicates that our foot model captures the main mechanical properties of the foot. The presented four-segment foot model is a potentially powerful tool to study the relationship between foot properties and gait mechanics and energetics in health and disease.

The apicomplexan intracellular parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a major food borne pathogen that is highly prevalent in the global population. The majority of the <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i> proteome remains uncharacterized and the organization of proteins into complexes is unclear. To overcome this knowledge gap, we used a biochemical fractionation strategy to predict interactions by correlation profiling. To overcome the deficit of high-quality training data in non-model organisms, we complemented a supervised machine learning strategy, with an unsupervised approach, based on similarity network fusion. The resulting combined high confidence network, ToxoNet, comprises 2,063 interactions connecting 652 proteins. Clustering identifies 93 protein complexes. We identified clusters enriched in mitochondrial machinery that include previously uncharacterized proteins that likely represent novel adaptations to oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, complexes enriched in proteins localized to secretory organelles and the inner membrane complex, predict additional novel components representing novel targets for detailed functional characterization. We present ToxoNet as a publicly available resource with the expectation that it will help drive future hypotheses within the research community.

OCD has been conceptualized as a disorder arising from dysfunctional beliefs, such as overestimating threats or pathological doubts. Yet, how these beliefs lead to compulsions and obsessions remains unclear. Here, we develop a computational model to examine the specific beliefs that trigger and sustain compulsive behavior in a simple symptom-provoking scenario. Our results demonstrate that a single belief disturbance–a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of one’s preventive (harm-avoiding) actions–can trigger and maintain compulsions and is directly linked to compulsion severity. This distrust can further explain a number of seemingly unrelated phenomena in OCD, including the role of not-just-right feelings, the link to intolerance to uncertainty, perfectionism, and overestimation of threat, and deficits in reversal and state learning. Our simulations shed new light on which underlying beliefs drive compulsive behavior and highlight the important role of perceived ability to exert control for OCD.

Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) is: “the result of an analytic and/or deliberative process about human health, or affecting human health, that is explicit, and therefore can be represented and reasned upon using logic, formal standards, and mathematical approaches.” Representing biomedical knowledge in a machine-interpretable, computable form increases its ability to be discovered, accessed, understood, and deployed. Computable knowledge artifacts can greatly advance the potential for implementation, reproducibility, or extension of the knowledge by users, who may include practitioners, researchers, and learners. Enriching computable knowledge artifacts may help facilitate reuse and translation into practice. Following the examples of 10 Simple Rules papers for scientific code, software, and applications, we present 10 Simple Rules intended to make shared computable knowledge artifacts more useful and reusable. These rules are mainly for researchers and their teams who have decided that sharing their computable knowledge is important, who wish to go beyond simply describing results, algorithms, or models via traditional publication pathways, and who want to both make their research findings more accessible, and to help others use their computable knowledge. These rules are roughly organized into 3 categories: planning, engineering, and documentation. Finally, while many of the following examples are of computable knowledge in biomedical domains, these rules are generalizable to computable knowledge in any research domain.

Computational biologists are frequently engaged in collaborative data analysis with wet lab researchers. These interdisciplinary projects, as necessary as they are to the scientific endeavor, can be surprisingly challenging due to cultural differences in operations and values. In this Ten Simple Rules guide, we aim to help dry lab researchers identify sources of friction and provide actionable tools to facilitate respectful, open, transparent, and rewarding collaborations.

                <p>by Genís Bayarri, Pau Andrio, Josep Lluís Gelpí, Adam Hospital, Modesto Orozco</p>

Interactive Jupyter Notebooks in combination with Conda environments can be used to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable/Reproducible) biomolecular simulation workflows. The interactive programming code accompanied by documentation and the possibility to inspect intermediate results with versatile graphical charts and data visualization is very helpful, especially in iterative processes, where parameters might be adjusted to a particular system of interest. This work presents a collection of FAIR notebooks covering various areas of the biomolecular simulation field, such as molecular dynamics (MD), protein–ligand docking, molecular checking/modeling, molecular interactions, and free energy perturbations. Workflows can be launched with myBinder or easily installed in a local system. The collection of notebooks aims to provide a compilation of demonstration workflows, and it is continuously updated and expanded with examples using new methodologies and tools.

                <p>by Bartosz A. Gren, Maciej Antczak, Tomasz Zok, Joanna I. Sulkowska, Marta Szachniuk</p>

Unlike proteins, RNAs deposited in the Protein Data Bank do not contain topological knots. Recently, admittedly, the first trefoil knot and some lasso-type conformations have been found in experimental RNA structures, but these are still exceptional cases. Meanwhile, algorithms predicting 3D RNA models have happened to form knotted structures not so rarely. Interestingly, machine learning-based predictors seem to be more prone to generate knotted RNA folds than traditional methods. A similar situation is observed for the entanglements of structural elements. In this paper, we analyze all models submitted to the CASP15 competition in the 3D RNA structure prediction category. We show what types of topological knots and structure element entanglements appear in the submitted models and highlight what methods are behind the generation of such conformations. We also study the structural aspect of susceptibility to entanglement. We suggest that predictors take care of an evaluation of RNA models to avoid publishing structures with artifacts, such as unusual entanglements, that result from hallucinations of predictive algorithms.

                <p>by Yu-Ying Phoebe Hsieh, Wanting Sun, Janet M. Young, Robin Cheung, Deborah A. Hogan, Ajai A. Dandekar, Harmit S. Malik</p>

Fungi and bacteria coexist in many polymicrobial communities, yet the molecular basis of their interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the fungus <i>Candida albicans</i> sequesters essential magnesium ions from the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. To counteract fungal Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> expresses the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA when Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are low. Thus, loss of MgtA specifically impairs <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> in co-culture with <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, but fitness can be restored by supplementing Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a panel of fungi and bacteria, we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration is a general mechanism of fungal antagonism against gram-negative bacteria. Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation enhances bacterial resistance to polymyxin antibiotics like colistin, which target gram-negative bacterial membranes. Indeed, experimental evolution reveals that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> evolves <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>-dependent colistin resistance via non-canonical means; antifungal treatment renders resistant bacteria colistin-sensitive. Our work suggests that fungal–bacterial competition could profoundly impact polymicrobial infection treatment with antibiotics of last resort.

                <p>by Sophie Bavard, Erik Stuchlý, Arkady Konovalov, Sebastian Gluth</p>

Humans are known to be capable of inferring hidden preferences and beliefs of their conspecifics when observing their decisions. While observational learning based on choices has been explored extensively, the question of how response times (RT) impact our learning of others’ social preferences has received little attention. Yet, while observing choices alone can inform us about the direction of preference, they reveal little about the strength of this preference. In contrast, RT provides a continuous measure of strength of preference with faster responses indicating stronger preferences and slower responses signaling hesitation or uncertainty. Here, we outline a preregistered orthogonal design to investigate the involvement of both choices and RT in learning and inferring other’s social preferences. Participants observed other people’s behavior in a social preferences task (Dictator Game), seeing either their choices, RT, both, or no information. By coupling behavioral analyses with computational modeling, we show that RT is predictive of social preferences and that observers were able to infer those preferences even when receiving only RT information. Based on these findings, we propose a novel observational reinforcement learning model that closely matches participants’ inferences in all relevant conditions. In contrast to previous literature suggesting that, from a Bayesian perspective, people should be able to learn equally well from choices and RT, we show that observers’ behavior substantially deviates from this prediction. Our study elucidates a hitherto unknown sophistication in human observational learning but also identifies important limitations to this ability.

                <p>by Jiao Li, Chao Zhang, Yao Meng, Siqi Yang, Jie Xia, Huafu Chen, Wei Liao</p>

The human brain is organized as segregation and integration units and follows complex developmental trajectories throughout life. The cortical manifold provides a new means of studying the brain’s organization in a multidimensional connectivity gradient space. However, how the brain’s morphometric organization changes across the human lifespan remains unclear. Here, leveraging structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,790 healthy individuals aged 8 to 89 years, we investigated age-related global, within- and between-network dispersions to reveal the segregation and integration of brain networks from 3D manifolds based on morphometric similarity network (MSN), combining multiple features conceptualized as a “fingerprint” of an individual’s brain. Developmental trajectories of global dispersion unfolded along patterns of molecular brain organization, such as acetylcholine receptor. Communities were increasingly dispersed with age, reflecting more disassortative morphometric similarity profiles within a community. Increasing within-network dispersion of primary motor and association cortices mediated the influence of age on the cognitive flexibility of executive functions. We also found that the secondary sensory cortices were decreasingly dispersed with the rest of the cortices during aging, possibly indicating a shift of secondary sensory cortices across the human lifespan from an extreme to a more central position in 3D manifolds. Together, our results reveal the age-related segregation and integration of MSN from the perspective of a multidimensional gradient space, providing new insights into lifespan changes in multiple morphometric features of the brain, as well as the influence of such changes on cognitive performance.

                Background Salmonella enterica are bacteria that include more than 2,500 serovars. Most of these serovars have been linked to human foodborne illnesses, mainly related to poultry and pigs. Thus, these animals are considered the reservoirs of many Salmonella serovars and strains related to antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, serovars, β-lactam resistance genes, and the risk factors associated with Salmonella enterica in pork commercialized in open markets of Quito city. Methods For this, 165 pork meat samples were taken from municipal markets in three areas in the city. These samples were microbiologically processed following the ISO 6579-2014 standardized method. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was used to identify Salmonella serotyping and resistance genes. Strains not identified by PCR were typed by the Kauffman White Le Minor scheme. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with the presence of the microorganism. Results Salmonella prevalence in pork was 9.1%. Identified serovars were 4, [5], 12: i:- (53.3%), Infantis (33.3%), and Derby (13.4%). Furthermore, the β-lactam resistance genes bla CTX-M-65 could be identified in three S. infantis isolates. Multivariate analysis showed that temperature (above 8°C) and cutting surfaces (wood) presented significant association values. Conclusions In conclusion, pork in traditional markets of Quito is contaminated with Salmonella enterica, whose main serovars pose a public health concern, and shows beta-lactam resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-665/v1?src=rss">Comparative Long-Term Effectiveness Of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) And Anti CGRP In Migraine Prevention: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Every year, 15% of the global population suffers from migraines, making it a substantial social burden with a significant negative impact on quality of life. This systematic review aims to evaluate the comparative efficacy, safety profiles, cost-effectiveness, and additional dimensions of two prominent chronic migraine (CM) prophylactics: OnabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Methods Using specific keywords related to onabotulinumtoxinA and anti-CGRP treatments for migraines, we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed and the Cochrane Library, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Our analysis included 13 publications that revealed notable decreases in migraine frequency and severity with both treatment modalities. While CGRP mAbs demonstrated significant reductions in migraine days with minimal adverse effects, BoNT-A emerged as a superior option due to its cost-efficiency and higher patient satisfaction. Both treatments exhibited mild short-term side effects; however, CGRP mAbs were occasionally associated with extended periods of constipation. The simplicity of adherence, with either monthly self-administered injections of CGRP mAbs or quarterly physician-administered BoNT-A injections, further distinguished these treatments. BoNT-A, in particular, was recognized for enhancing overall quality of life and performance metrics. Conclusions BoNT-A stands out as a low-cost intervention effective across various migraine categories, including chronic, episodic, unilateral, and vestibular types, significantly alleviating pain severity and reducing migraine episode frequency. The findings underscore that both CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A are comparably effective for CM prophylaxis. However, BoNT-A is especially beneficial for patients ineligible for CGRP mAb therapy or those requiring localized treatment with minimal systemic exposure risk. For patients resistant or refractory to BoNT-A, combining it with CGRP mAbs may maximize therapeutic benefits due to their distinct modes of action. The efficacy, safety, and cost-benefit analyses of these medications may help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions based on the study's findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-664/v1?src=rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23608?af=R">In vivo structural connectivity of the reward system along the hippocampal long axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23607?af=R">The well‐worn route revisited: Striatal and hippocampal system contributions to familiar route navigation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23610?af=R">A comparison of hippocampal and retrosplenial cortical spatial and contextual firing patterns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are key components of the brain's memory and navigation systems. Lesions of either region produce profound deficits in spatial cognition and HPC neurons exhibit well-known spatial firing patterns (place fields). Recent studies have also identified an array of navigation-related firing patterns in the RSC. However, there has been little work comparing the response properties and information coding mechanisms of these two brain regions. In the present study, we examined the firing patterns of HPC and RSC neurons in two tasks which are commonly used to study spatial cognition in rodents, open field foraging with an environmental context manipulation and continuous T-maze alternation. We found striking similarities in the kinds of spatial and contextual information encoded by these two brain regions. Neurons in both regions carried information about the rat's current spatial location, trajectories and goal locations, and both regions reliably differentiated the contexts. However, we also found several key differences. For example, information about head direction was a prominent component of RSC representations but was only weakly encoded in the HPC. The two regions also used different coding schemes, even when they encoded the same kind of information. As expected, the HPC employed a sparse coding scheme characterized by compact, high contrast place fields, and information about spatial location was the dominant component of HPC representations. RSC firing patterns were more consistent with a distributed coding scheme. Instead of compact place fields, RSC neurons exhibited broad, but reliable, spatial and directional tuning, and they typically carried information about multiple navigational variables. The observed similarities highlight the closely related functions of the HPC and RSC, whereas the differences in information types and coding schemes suggest that these two regions likely make somewhat different contributions to spatial cognition.</p>

                Functional network (FN) analyses play a pivotal role in uncovering insights into brain function and understanding the pathophysiology of various brain disorders. This paper focuses on classical and advanced methods for deriving brain FNs from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We systematically review their foundational principles, advantages, shortcomings, and interrelations, encompassing both static and dynamic FN extraction approaches. In the context of static FN extraction, we present hypothesis-driven methods such as region of interest (ROI)-based approaches as well as data-driven methods including matrix decomposition, clustering, and deep learning. For dynamic FN extraction, both window-based and windowless methods are surveyed with respect to the estimation of time-varying FN and the subsequent computation of FN states. We also discuss the scope of application of the various methods and avenues for future improvements.

                Sakuma et al. describe that fibrinopeptide A (FPA), produced during the coagulation of host blood, inhibits blood feeding of Aedes aegypti. The amount of FPA in the mosquito’s body increases as feeding proceeds. These findings indicate that a negative regulator for mosquito blood feeding is present in the host blood.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88648">Stochastic characterization of navigation strategies in an automated variant of the Barnes maze</a></h4>

              
                Animals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate towards a goal vestibule from a random start vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial, and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions. They closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences, revealing a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every six vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90908">The trunk replaces the longer mandible as the main feeding organ in elephant evolution</a></h4>

              
                The long-trunked elephantids underwent a significant evolutionary stage characterized by an exceptionally elongated mandible. The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the <i>Platybelodon</i> clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93325">Spatial and temporal pattern of structure–function coupling of human brain connectome with development</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural circuitry shapes a richly patterned functional synchronization, supporting for complex cognitive and behavioural abilities. However, how coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) develops and its relationships with cognitive functions and transcriptomic architecture remain unclear. We used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data from 439 participants aged 5.7–21.9 years to predict functional connectivity by incorporating intracortical and extracortical structural connectivity, characterizing SC–FC coupling. Our findings revealed that SC–FC coupling was strongest in the visual and somatomotor networks, consistent with evolutionary expansion, myelin content, and functional principal gradient. As development progressed, SC–FC coupling exhibited heterogeneous alterations dominated by an increase in cortical regions, broadly distributed across the somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. Moreover, we discovered that SC–FC coupling significantly predicted individual variability in general intelligence, mainly influencing frontoparietal and default mode networks. Finally, our results demonstrated that the heterogeneous development of SC–FC coupling is positively associated with genes in oligodendrocyte-related pathways and negatively associated with astrocyte-related genes. This study offers insight into the maturational principles of SC–FC coupling in typical development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88466">E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex facilitates the expansion of Wingless gradient and antagonizes Wingless signaling through a conserved mechanism of transcriptional effector Armadillo/β-catenin degradation</a></h4>

              
                The Wnt/Wg pathway controls myriads of biological phenomena throughout the development and adult life of all organisms across the phyla. Thus, an aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with a wide range of pathologies in humans. Tight regulation of Wnt/Wg signaling is required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis. Here, we report a novel role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex in Wg signaling regulation. <i>Drosophila dx</i> genetically interacts with <i>wg a</i>nd its pathway components. Furthermore, Dx LOF results in a reduced spreading of Wg while its over-expression expands the diffusion gradient of the morphogen. We attribute this change in Wg gradient to the endocytosis of Wg through Dx which directly affects the short- and long-range Wg targets. We also demonstrate the role of Dx in regulating Wg effector Armadillo where Dx down-regulates Arm through proteasomal degradation. We also showed the conservation of Dx function in the mammalian system where DTX1 is shown to bind with β-catenin and facilitates its proteolytic degradation, spotlighting a novel step that potentially modulates Wnt/Wg signaling cascade.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90505">Cyclic muscle contractions reinforce the actomyosin motors and mediate the full elongation of C. elegans embryo</a></h4>

              
                The paramount importance of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and embryogenesis is widely recognized, but understanding the mechanism at the cellular and molecular level remains challenging. Because of its simple internal organization, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a rewarding system of study. As demonstrated experimentally, after an initial period of steady elongation driven by the actomyosin network, muscle contractions operate a quasi-periodic sequence of bending, rotation, and torsion, that leads to the final fourfold size of the embryos before hatching. How actomyosin and muscles contribute to embryonic elongation is investigated here theoretically. A filamentary elastic model that converts stimuli generated by biochemical signals in the tissue into driving forces, explains embryonic deformation under actin bundles and muscle activity, and dictates mechanisms of late elongation based on the effects of energy conversion and dissipation. We quantify this dynamic transformation by stretches applied to a cylindrical structure that mimics the body shape in finite elasticity, obtaining good agreement and understanding of both wild-type and mutant embryos at all stages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93694">Boosting biodiversity monitoring using smartphone-driven, rapidly accumulating community-sourced data</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The <i>Biome</i> mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed &gt;6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of <i>Biome</i> data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating <i>Biome</i> data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required &gt;2000 records for accurate models (Boyce index ≥ 0.9), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by <i>Biome</i> data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87518">Metabolic regulation of misfolded protein import into mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are the cellular energy hub and central target of metabolic regulation. Mitochondria also facilitate proteostasis through pathways such as the ‘mitochondria as guardian in cytosol’ (MAGIC) whereby cytosolic misfolded proteins (MPs) are imported into and degraded inside mitochondria. In this study, a genome-wide screen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> uncovered that Snf1, the yeast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibits the import of MPs into mitochondria while promoting mitochondrial biogenesis under glucose starvation. We show that this inhibition requires a downstream transcription factor regulating mitochondrial gene expression and is likely to be conferred through substrate competition and mitochondrial import channel selectivity. We further show that Snf1/AMPK activation protects mitochondrial fitness in yeast and human cells under stress induced by MPs such as those associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85560">Multimodal HLA-I genotype regulation by human cytomegalovirus US10 and resulting surface patterning</a></h4>

              
                Human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules play a central role for both NK and T-cell responses that prevent serious human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) disease. To create opportunities for viral spread, several HCMV-encoded immunoevasins employ diverse strategies to target HLA-I. Among these, the glycoprotein US10 is so far insufficiently studied. While it was reported that US10 interferes with HLA-G expression, its ability to manipulate classical HLA-I antigen presentation remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that US10 recognizes and binds to all HLA-I (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -G) heavy chains. Additionally, impaired recruitment of HLA-I to the peptide loading complex was observed. Notably, the associated effects varied significantly dependending on HLA-I genotype and allotype: (i) HLA-A molecules evaded downregulation by US10, (ii) tapasin-dependent HLA-B molecules showed impaired maturation and cell surface expression, and (iii) β<sub>2</sub>m-assembled HLA-C, in particular HLA-C*05:01 and -C*12:03, and HLA-G were strongly retained in complex with US10 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These genotype-specific effects on HLA-I were confirmed through unbiased HLA-I ligandome analyses. Furthermore, in HCMV-infected fibroblasts inhibition of overlapping US10 and US11 transcription had little effect on HLA-A, but induced HLA-B antigen presentation. Thus, the US10-mediated impact on HLA-I results in multiple geno- and allotypic effects in a so far unparalleled and multimodal manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93662">Identification of a third myosin-5a-melanophilin interaction that mediates the association of myosin-5a with melanosomes</a></h4>

              
                Transport and localization of melanosome at the periphery region of melanocyte are depended on myosin-5a (Myo5a), which associates with melanosome by interacting with its adaptor protein melanophilin (Mlph). Mlph contains four functional regions, including Rab27a-binding domain, Myo5a GTD-binding motif (GTBM), Myo5a exon F-binding domain (EFBD), and actin-binding domain (ABD). The association of Myo5a with Mlph is known to be mediated by two specific interactions: the interaction between the exon-F-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-EFBD and that between Myo5a-GTD and Mlph-GTBM. Here, we identify a third interaction between Myo5a and Mlph, that is, the interaction between the exon-G-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-ABD. The exon-G/ABD interaction is independent from the exon-F/EFBD interaction and is required for the association of Myo5a with melanosome. Moreover, we demonstrate that Mlph-ABD interacts with either the exon-G or actin filament, but cannot interact with both of them simultaneously. Based on above findings, we propose a new model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosomes.

                Autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are only partially represented in current experimental models and the development of humanized immune mice is crucial for better understanding of immunopathogenesis and testing of therapeutics. We describe a humanized mouse model with several key features of MS. Severely immunodeficient B2m-NOG mice were transplanted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-DRB1-typed MS and healthy (HI) donors and showed rapid engraftment by human T and B lymphocytes. Mice receiving cells from MS patients with recent/ongoing Epstein–Barr virus reactivation showed high B cell engraftment capacity. Both HLA-DRB1*15 (DR15) MS and DR15 HI mice, not HLA-DRB1*13 MS mice, developed human T cell infiltration of CNS borders and parenchyma. DR15 MS mice uniquely developed inflammatory lesions in brain and spinal cord gray matter, with spontaneous, hCD8 T cell lesions, and mixed hCD8/hCD4 T cell lesions in EAE immunized mice, with variation in localization and severity between different patient donors. Main limitations of this model for further development are poor monocyte engraftment and lack of demyelination, lymph node organization, and IgG responses. These results show that PBMC humanized mice represent promising research tools for investigating MS immunopathology in a patient-specific approach.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98649">Novel autophagy inducers by accelerating lysosomal clustering against Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The autophagy-lysosome pathway plays an indispensable role in the protein quality control by degrading abnormal organelles and proteins including a-synuclein (aSyn) associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the activation of this pathway is mainly by targeting lysosomal enzymic activity. Here, we focused on the autophagosome-lysosome fusion process around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) regulated by lysosomal positioning. Through high-throughput chemical screening, we identified 6 out of 1,200 clinically approved drugs enabling the lysosomes to accumulate around the MTOC with autophagy flux enhancement. We further demonstrated that these compounds induce the lysosomal clustering through a JIP4-TRPML1-dependent mechanism. Among them, the lysosomal-clustering compound albendazole promoted the autophagy-dependent degradation of Triton-X-insoluble, proteasome inhibitor-induced aggregates. In a cellular PD model, albendazole boosted insoluble aSyn degradation. Our results revealed that lysosomal clustering can facilitate the breakdown of protein aggregates, suggesting that lysosome-clustering compounds may offer a promising therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregate-prone proteins.

">Theta-phase locking of single neurons during human spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                The precise timing of single-neuron activity in relation to local field potentials may support various cognitive functions. Extensive research in rodents, along with some evidence in humans, suggests that single-neuron activity at specific phases of theta oscillations plays a crucial role in memory processes. Our fundamental understanding of such theta-phase locking in humans and its dependency on basic electrophysiological properties of the local field potential is still limited, however. Here, using single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients performing a spatial memory task, we thus aimed at improving our understanding of factors modulating theta-phase locking in the human brain. Combining a generalized-phase approach for frequency-adaptive theta-phase estimation with time-resolved spectral parameterization, our results show that theta-phase locking is a strong and prevalent phenomenon across human medial temporal lobe regions, both during spatial memory encoding and retrieval. Neuronal theta-phase locking increased during periods of elevated theta power, when clear theta oscillations were present, and when aperiodic activity exhibited steeper slopes. Theta-phase locking was similarly strong during successful and unsuccessful memory, and most neurons activated at similar theta phases between encoding and retrieval. Some neurons changed their preferred theta phases between encoding and retrieval, in line with the idea that different memory processes are separated within the theta cycle. Together, these results help disentangle how different properties of local field potentials and memory states influence theta-phase locking of human single neurons. This contributes to a better understanding of how interactions between single neurons and local field potentials may support human spatial memory.

">A low-activity cortical network selectively encodes syntax</a></h4>

              
                Syntax, the abstract structure of language, is a hallmark of human cognition. Despite its importance, its neural underpinnings remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover three syntactic networks that are broadly distributed across traditional language regions, but with focal concentrations in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks process syntax mostly to the exclusion of words and meaning, supporting a cognitive architecture with a distinct syntactic system. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of syntax: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "low-activity coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

">Privileged representational axes in biological and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                How do neurons code information? Recent work emphasizes properties of population codes, such as their geometry and decodable information, using measures that are blind to the native tunings (or 'axes') of neural responses. But might these representational axes matter, with some privileged systematically over others? To find out, we developed methods to test for alignment of neural tuning across brains and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Across both vision and audition, both brains and DCNNs consistently favored certain axes for representing the natural world. Moreover, the representational axes of DCNNs trained on nat- ural inputs were aligned to those in perceptual cortices, such that axis-sensitive model-brain similarity metrics better differentiated competing models of biological sensory systems. We further show that coding schemes that privilege certain axes can reduce downstream wiring costs and improve generalization. These results motivate a new framework for understanding neural tuning in biological and artificial networks and its computational benefits.

                For over a century, scientists have been attempting to map the human cerebral cortex, however, they have not taken into account the complex molecular structure of the cortex, which is only beginning to be understood. Here, we parcellate the human cerebral cortex using a machine learning (ML) approach to define its transcriptomic architecture, revealing a multi-resolution organization across individuals. The transcriptomically-derived spatial patterns of gene expression separate the cortex into three major regions, frontal, temporal and parietooccipital, with smaller subregions appearing at lower levels of the transcriptomic hierarchy. The core regions, which remain stable across different hierarchical levels, are physiologically associated with language, emotion regulation, social cognition, motor and visuospatial processing and planning. Importantly, some core regions cross structural and anatomical boundaries identified in previous parcellations of the cortex, revealing that the transcriptomic architecture of the cortex is closely linked to human-specific higher cognitive function.

">Sex Differences in Human Brain Structure at Birth</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in human brain anatomy have been well-documented; however, their underlying causes remain controversial. Neonatal research offers a pivotal opportunity to address this long-standing debate. Given that postnatal environmental influences (e.g., gender socialisation) are minimal at birth, any sex differences observed at this stage can be more readily attributed to prenatal influences. Here, we assessed on-average sex differences in global and regional brain volumes in 514 newborns (236 birth-assigned females and 278 birth-assigned males) using data from the developing Human Connectome Project. On average, males had significantly larger intracranial and total brain volumes, even after controlling for birth weight. After controlling for total brain volume, females showed higher total cortical gray matter volumes, whilst males showed higher total white matter volumes. After controlling for total brain volume in regional comparisons, females had increased white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and increased gray matter volumes in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri (posterior parts), left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobes, and right caudate nucleus. Males had increased gray matter volumes in the right medial and inferior temporal gyrus (posterior part) and right subthalamic nucleus. Effect sizes ranged from small for regional comparisons to large for global comparisons. While postnatal experiences likely amplify sex differences in the brain, our findings demonstrate that several global and regional on-average sex differences are already present at birth.

                In this paper, we introduce a new, open-source software developed in Python for analyzing Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) waveforms. ABRs are a far-field recording of synchronous neural activity generated by the auditory fibers in the ear in response to sound, and used to study acoustic neural information traveling along the ascending auditory pathway. Common ABR data analysis practices are subject to human interpretation and are labor-intensive, requiring manual annotations and visual estimation of hearing thresholds. The proposed new Auditory Brainstem Response Analyzer (ABRA) software is designed to facilitate the analysis of ABRs by supporting batch data import/export, waveform visualization, and statistical analysis. Techniques implemented in this software include algorithmic peak finding, threshold estimation, latency estimation, time warping for curve alignment, and 3D plotting of ABR waveforms over stimulus frequencies and decibels. The excellent performance on a large dataset of ABR collected from three labs in the field of hearing research that use different experimental recording settings illustrates the efficacy, flexibility, and wide utility of ABRA.

">Feedback Control of Neuronal Excitability and Epileptiform Bursting using a Photocaged Adenosine A1 Agonist</a></h4>

              
                Adenosine is a potent regulator of neurotransmission and neuronal excitability through activation of Gi protein-coupled adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs). It has gained interest as a potential anticonvulsant due to its endogenous involvement in ending ongoing seizure activity. A recently developed coumarin-caged derivative of the A1R agonist N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CPA), cCPA, was used for photo-uncaging of CPA with millisecond flashes of 405 nm light. At population level, CPA reduces Schaffer Collateral stimulated extracellular dendritic field potentials (FPs) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus with an ED50 of 44.1{+/-}2.8 nM and a Hill coefficient of 3. Response onset is CPA dependent and takes less than seconds, while recovery is CPA independent with a time constant of around 20 minutes. A closed-loop feedback system used the amplitude of evoked dendritic FPs to photorelease CPA and was able to control FP amplitude to user defined levels between 10% and 90% of baseline level. In the acute elevated potassium model of epilepsy raising extracellular K+ to 8.5 mM enhances neuronal excitability and induces regularly occurring epileptiform bursts, but FPs evoked with low intensity could still continuously monitor excitability without interfering with bursting. In this model the closed-loop system that controlled CPA release, was able to suppress epileptiform bursting, while maintaining an acceptable level of functional neurotransmission. Including in the control algorithm a second parameter that combined population spike amplitude and number of population spikes, enabled the system to automatically find a level of functional neurotransmission that was just below the threshold for multiple spiking and epileptiform bursting. The combination of photopharmacological adenosinergic modulation with real-time FP monitoring provides a first step towards closed-loop precision treatment for diseases related to neuronal hyperexcitability such as epilepsy.

	<p>Recent evidence shows that it is possible to identify the elements responsible for sensorineural hearing loss, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages, by performing perilymph sampling. However, current studies have only focused on the diagnosis of such as otologic conditions. Hearing loss is a feature of certain neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is widely detected in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Although the environment of the inner ear is highly regulated, there are several communication pathways between the perilymph of the inner ear and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, examination of the perilymph may help understand the mechanism behind the hearing loss observed in certain neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we review the constituents of CSF and perilymph, the anatomy of the inner ear and its connection with the brain. Then, we discuss the relevance of perilymph sampling in neurology. Currently, perilymph sampling is only performed during surgical procedures, but we hypothesize a simplified and low-invasive technique that could allow sampling in a clinical setting with the same ease as performing an intratympanic injection under direct visual check. The use of this modified technique could allow for perilymph sampling in people with hearing loss and neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative disorders and clarify the relationship between these conditions; in fact, by measuring the concentration of neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative biomarkers and those typically expressed in the inner ear in aging SNHL, it could be possible to understand if SNHL is caused by aging or neuroinflammation.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is typically characterized by a range of motor dysfunctions, and its impact extends beyond physical abnormalities into emotional well-being and cognitive symptoms. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) leads to an array of dysfunctions in the functioning of the basal ganglia (BG) circuitry that manifests into PD. While active research is being carried out to find the root cause of SNc cell death, various therapeutic techniques are used to manage the symptoms of PD. The most common approach in managing the symptoms is replenishing the lost dopamine in the form of taking dopaminergic medications such as levodopa, despite its long-term complications. Another commonly used intervention for PD is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is most commonly used when levodopa medication efficacy is reduced, and, in combination with levodopa medication, it helps reduce the required dosage of medication, prolonging the therapeutic effect. DBS is also a first choice option when motor complications such as dyskinesia emerge as a side effect of medication. Several studies have also reported that though DBS is found to be effective in suppressing severe motor symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, it has an adverse effect on cognitive capabilities. Henceforth, it is important to understand the exact mechanism of DBS in alleviating motor symptoms. A computational model of DBS stimulation for motor symptoms will offer great insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying DBS, and, along this line, in our current study, we modeled a cortico-basal ganglia circuitry of arm reaching, where we simulated healthy control (HC) and PD symptoms as well as the DBS effect on PD tremor and bradykinesia. Our modeling results reveal that PD tremors are more correlated with the theta band, while bradykinesia is more correlated with the beta band of the frequency spectrum of the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. With a DBS current of 220 pA, 130 Hz, and a 100 microsecond pulse-width, we could found the maximum therapeutic effect for the pathological dynamics simulated using our model using a set of parameter values. However, the exact DBS characteristics vary from patient to patient, and this can be further studied by exploring the model parameter space. This model can be extended to study different DBS targets and accommodate cognitive dynamics in the future to study the impact of DBS on cognitive symptoms and thereby optimize the parameters to produce optimal performance effects across modalities. Combining DBS with rehabilitation is another frontier where DBS can reduce symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, enabling patients to participate in their therapy. With DBS providing instant relief to patients, a combination of DBS and rehabilitation can enhance neural plasticity. One of the key motivations behind combining DBS with rehabilitation is to expect comparable results in motor performance even with milder DBS currents.</p>

	<p>Both chronic and recurrent spinal pain alter sensorimotor integration (SMI), which is demonstrated using complex neurophysiological techniques. Currently, there is no patient-reported outcome measure that documents and/or assesses SMI in populations with spinal problems. The purpose of this study was to develop the Sensory&amp;amp;ndash;Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q) and assess its test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability and internal consistency in individuals with recurrent spinal pain. The SMD-Q was developed based on the existing literature on motor control disturbances associated with disordered SMI. The initial SMD-Q drafts underwent review by two separate panels of subject matter experts and a focus group with subclinical spine pain. Their suggestions were incorporated into the questionnaire prior to reliability testing. The questionnaire was administered twice at a seven-day interval using QualtricsTM. A total of 20 participants (14 females and 6 males; 20.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.46 years of age) completed the study. Quadratic weighted kappa (Kw) was used to assess test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha (&amp;amp;alpha;) was used to assess internal consistency. Four items had a Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.40, seven had a 0.40 &amp;amp;lt; Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.75, and one had a Kw &amp;amp;gt; 0.75 (excellent agreement), with excellent internal consistency (&amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;gt; 0.90). The pilot SMD-Q appears to reliably measure altered SMI, suggesting that revisions and testing with a larger sample are worth pursuing.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical condition characterized by a high prevalence, substantial mortality rates, and unpredictable clinical outcomes, which results in a serious threat to human health. Improving the timeliness and accuracy of prognosis assessment is crucial to minimizing mortality and long-term disability associated with ICH. Due to the complexity of ICH, the diagnosis of ICH in clinical practice heavily relies on the professional expertise and clinical experience of physicians. Traditional prognostic methods largely depend on the specialized knowledge and subjective judgment of healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, existing artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, which predominantly utilize features derived from computed tomography (CT) scans, fall short of capturing the multifaceted nature of ICH. Although existing methods are capable of integrating clinical information and CT images for prognosis, the effectiveness of this fusion process still requires improvement. To surmount these limitations, the present study introduces a novel AI framework, termed the ICH Network (ICH-Net), which employs a joint-attention cross-modal network to synergize clinical textual data with CT imaging features. The architecture of ICH-Net consists of three integral components: the Feature Extraction Module, which processes and abstracts salient characteristics from the clinical and imaging data, the Feature Fusion Module, which amalgamates the diverse data streams, and the Classification Module, which interprets the fused features to deliver prognostic predictions. Our evaluation, conducted through a rigorous five-fold cross-validation process, demonstrates that ICH-Net achieves a commendable accuracy of up to 87.77%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods detailed within our research. This evidence underscores the potential of ICH-Net as a formidable tool in prognosticating ICH, promising a significant advancement in clinical decision-making and patient care.</p>

	<p>Background: Automated pupillometry (AP) is a handheld, non-invasive tool that is able to assess pupillary light reflex dynamics and is useful for the detection of intracranial hypertension. Limited evidence is available on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the ability of AP to discriminate AIS patients from healthy subjects (HS). Secondly, we aimed to compute a predictive score for AIS diagnosis based on clinical, demographic, and AP variables. Methods: We included 200 consecutive patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center who underwent AP assessment through NPi-200 (NeurOptics&amp;amp;reg;) within 72 h of stroke onset and 200 HS. The mean values of AP parameters and the absolute differences between the AP parameters of the two eyes were considered in the analyses. Predictors of stroke diagnosis were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regressions; we then computed a nomogram based on each variable&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;beta; coefficient. Finally, we developed a web app capable of displaying the probability of stroke diagnosis based on the predictive algorithm. Results: A high percentage of pupil constriction (CH, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), a low constriction velocity (CV, p = 0.002), and high differences between these two parameters (p = 0.036 and p = 0.004, respectively) were independent predictors of AIS. The highest contribution in the predictive score was provided by CH, the Neurological Pupil Index, CV, and CV absolute difference, disclosing the important role of AP in the discrimination of stroke patients. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that AP parameters, and in particular, those concerning pupillary constriction, may be useful for the early diagnosis of AIS.</p>

	<p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is involved in a range of central and peripheral pathways related to appetitive behavior. Hence, this study explored the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on substance and behavioral addictions, including alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, psychostimulants, compulsive shopping, and sex drive/libido. Data were collected from various social platforms. Keywords related to GLP-1 RAs and substance/behavioral addiction were used to extract relevant comments. The study employed a mixed-methods approach to analyze online discussions posted from December 2019 to June 2023 and collected using a specialized web application. Reddit entries were the focus here due to limited data from other platforms, such as TikTok and YouTube. A total of 5859 threads and related comments were extracted from six subreddits, which included threads about GLP-1 RAs drugs and associated brand names. To obtain relevant posts, keywords related to potential substance use and compulsive behavior were selected. Further analysis involved two main steps: (1) manually coding posts based on users&amp;amp;rsquo; references to the potential impact of GLP-1 RAs on substance use and non-substance habits, excluding irrelevant or unclear comments; (2) performing a thematic analysis on the dataset of keywords, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. Second, a thematic analysis was performed on the keyword-related dataset, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. In total, 29.75% of alcohol-related; 22.22% of caffeine-related; and 23.08% of nicotine-related comments clearly stated a cessation of the intake of these substances following the start of GLP-1 RAs prescription. Conversely, mixed results were found for cannabis intake, and only limited, anecdotal data were made available for cocaine, entactogens, and dissociative drugs&amp;amp;rsquo; misuse. Regarding behavioral addictions, 21.35% of comments reported a compulsive shopping interruption, whilst the sexual drive/libido elements reportedly increased in several users. The current mixed-methods approach appeared to be a useful tool in gaining insight into complex topics such as the effects of GLP-1 RAs on substance and non-substance addiction-related disorders; some GLP-1 RA-related mental health benefits could also be inferred from here. Overall, it appeared that GLP-1 RAs may show the potential to target both substance craving and maladaptive/addictive behaviors, although further empirical research is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0244-23.2024?rss=1">Experiencing an Elongated Limb in Virtual Reality Modifies the Tactile Distance Perception of the Corresponding Real Limb</a></h4>

              
                <p>In measurement, a reference frame is needed to compare the measured object to something already known. This raises the neuroscientific question of which reference frame is used by humans when exploring the environment. Previous studies suggested that, in touch, the body employed as measuring tool also serves as reference frame. Indeed, an artificial modification of the perceived dimensions of the body changes the tactile perception of external object dimensions. However, it is unknown if such a change in tactile perception would occur when the body schema is modified through the illusion of owning a limb altered in size. Therefore, employing a virtual hand illusion paradigm with an elongated forearm of different lengths, we systematically tested the subjective perception of distance between two points [tactile distance perception (TDP) task] on the corresponding real forearm following the illusion. Thus, the TDP task is used as a proxy to gauge changes in the body schema. Embodiment of the virtual arm was found significantly greater after the synchronous visuotactile stimulation condition compared with the asynchronous one, and the forearm elongation significantly increased the TDP. However, we did not find any link between the visuotactile-induced ownership over the elongated arm and TDP variation, suggesting that vision plays the main role in the modification of the body schema. Additionally, significant effect of elongation found on TDP but not on proprioception suggests that these are affected differently by body schema modifications. These findings confirm the body schema malleability and its role as a reference frame in touch.</p>

                <p>Essential tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterized by involuntary oscillations of the limbs during movement, remains to date not well understood. It has been recently suggested that the tremor originates from impaired delay compensation, affecting movement representation and online control. Here we tested this hypothesis directly with 24 ET patients (14 female; 10 male) and 28 neurologically intact (NI) human volunteers (17 female; 11 male) in an upper limb postural perturbation task. After maintaining their hand in a visual target, participants experienced perturbations of unpredictable direction and magnitude and were instructed to counter the perturbation and steer their hand back to the starting position. In comparison with NI volunteers, ET patients&rsquo; early muscular responses (short and long-latency responses, 20&ndash;50 and 50&ndash;100&nbsp;ms, respectively) were preserved or even slightly increased. However, they exhibited perturbation-dependent deficits when stopping and stabilizing their hand in the final target supporting the hypothesis that the tremor was generated by the feedback controller. We show in a computational model that errors in delay compensation accumulating over time produced the same small increase in initial feedback response followed by oscillations that scaled with the perturbation magnitude as observed in ET population. Our experimental results therefore validate the computational hypothesis that inaccurate delay compensation in long-latency pathways could be the origin of the tremor.</p>

                <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, also referred to as paradoxical sleep for the striking resemblance of its electroencephalogram (EEG) to the one observed in wakefulness, is characterized by the occurrence of transient events such as limb twitches or facial and rapid eye movements. Here, we investigated the local activity of the primary somatosensory or barrel cortex (S1) in naturally sleeping head-fixed male mice during REM. Through local field potential recordings, we uncovered local appearances of spindle waves in the barrel cortex during REM concomitant with strong delta power, challenging the view of a wakefulness-like activity in REM. We further performed extra- and intracellular recordings of thalamic cells in head-fixed mice. Our data show high-frequency thalamic bursts of spikes and subthreshold spindle oscillations in approximately half of the neurons of the ventral posterior medial nucleus which further confirmed the thalamic origin of local cortical spindles in S1 in REM. Cortical spindle oscillations were suppressed, while thalamus spike firing increased, associated with rapid mouse whisker movements and S1 cortical activity transitioned to an activated state. During REM, the sensory thalamus and barrel cortex therefore alternate between high (wake-like) and low (non-REM sleep-like) activation states, potentially providing a neuronal substrate for mnemonic processes occurring during this paradoxical sleep stage.</p>

                <p>Even in the absence of specific sensory input or a behavioral task, the brain produces structured patterns of activity. This organized activity is modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish how arousal relates to cortical network voltage and hemodynamic activity in spontaneously behaving head-fixed male and female mice expressing the voltage-sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. We find that global voltage and hemodynamic signals are both positively correlated with changes in arousal with a maximum correlation of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, at a time lag of 0&nbsp;s. We next show that arousal influences distinct cortical regions for both voltage and hemodynamic signals. These include a broad positive correlation across most sensory-motor cortices extending posteriorly to the primary visual cortex observed in both signals. In contrast, activity in the prefrontal cortex is positively correlated to changes in arousal for the voltage signal while it is a slight net negative correlation observed in the hemodynamic signal. Additionally, we show that coherence between voltage and hemodynamic signals relative to arousal is strongest for slow frequencies below 0.15&nbsp;Hz and is near zero for frequencies &gt;1&nbsp;Hz. We finally show that coupling patterns are dependent on the behavioral state of the animal with correlations being driven by periods of increased orofacial movement. Our results indicate that while hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those observed by voltage activity.</p>

                <p>Vertebrate vision begins with light absorption by rod and cone photoreceptors, which transmit signals from their synaptic terminals to second-order neurons: bipolar and horizontal cells. In mouse rods, there is a single presynaptic ribbon-type active zone at which the release of glutamate occurs tonically in the dark. This tonic glutamatergic signaling requires continuous exo- and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. At conventional synapses, endocytosis commonly requires dynamins: GTPases encoded by three genes (<I>Dnm1&ndash;3</I>), which perform membrane scission. Disrupting endocytosis by dynamin deletions impairs transmission at conventional synapses, but the impact of disrupting endocytosis and the role(s) of specific dynamin isoforms at rod ribbon synapses are understood incompletely. Here, we used cell-specific knock-outs (KOs) of the neuron-specific <I>Dnm1</I> and <I>Dnm3</I> to investigate the functional roles of dynamin isoforms in rod photoreceptors in mice of either sex. Analysis of synaptic protein expression, synapse ultrastructure, and retinal function via electroretinograms (ERGs) showed that dynamins 1 and 3 act redundantly and are essential for supporting the structural and functional integrity of rod ribbon synapses. Single <I>Dnm3</I> KO showed no phenotype, and single <I>Dnm1</I> KO only modestly reduced synaptic vesicle density without affecting vesicle size and overall synapse integrity, whereas double <I>Dnm1/Dnm3</I> KO impaired vesicle endocytosis profoundly, causing enlarged vesicles, reduced vesicle density, reduced ERG responses, synaptic terminal degeneration, and disassembly and degeneration of postsynaptic processes. Concurrently, cone function remained intact. These results show the fundamental redundancy of dynamins 1 and 3 in regulating the structure and function of rod ribbon synapses.</p>

                <p>Research on selective attention has largely focused on the enhancement of behaviorally important information, with less focus on the suppression of distracting information. Enhancement and suppression can operate through a push&ndash;pull relationship attributable to competitive interactions among neural populations. There has been considerable debate, however, regarding (1) whether suppression can be voluntarily deployed, independent of enhancement, and (2) whether voluntary deployment of suppression is associated with neural processes occurring prior to the distractor onset. Here, we investigated the interplay between pre- and post-distractor neural processes, while male and female human subjects performed a visual search task with a cue that indicated the location of an upcoming distractor. We utilized two established EEG markers of suppression: the distractor positivity (P<SUB>D</SUB>) and alpha power (~8&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz). The P<SUB>D</SUB>&mdash;a component of event-related potentials&mdash;has been linked with successful distractor suppression, and increased alpha power has been linked with attenuated sensory processing. Cueing the location of an upcoming distractor speeded responses and led to an earlier P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with earlier suppression due to strategic use of a spatial cue. In comparison, higher predistractor alpha power contralateral to distractors led to a later P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with later suppression. Lower alpha power contralateral to distractors instead led to distractor-related attentional capture. Lateralization of alpha power was not linked to the spatial cue. This observation, combined with differences in the timing of suppression&mdash;as indexed by earlier and later P<SUB>D</SUB> components&mdash;demonstrates that cue-related, voluntary suppression can occur separate from alpha-related gating of sensory processing.</p>

                <p>Attentional control over sensory processing has been linked to neural alpha oscillations and related inhibition of cerebral cortex. Despite the wide consensus on the functional relevance of alpha oscillations for attention, precise neural mechanisms of how alpha oscillations shape perception and how this top-down modulation is implemented in cortical networks remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that alpha oscillations in frontal eye fields (FEFs) are causally involved in the top-down regulation of visual processing in humans (male and female). We applied sham-controlled, intermittent transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over bilateral FEF at either 10&nbsp;Hz (alpha) or 40&nbsp;Hz (gamma) to manipulate attentional preparation in a visual discrimination task. Under each stimulation condition, we measured psychometric functions for contrast perception and introduced a novel linear mixed modeling approach for statistical control of neurosensory side effects of the electric stimulation. tACS at alpha frequency reduced the slope of the psychometric function, resulting in improved subthreshold and impaired superthreshold contrast perception. Side effects on the psychometric functions were complex and showed large interindividual variability. Controlling for the impact of side effects on the psychometric parameters by using covariates in the linear mixed model analysis reduced this variability and strengthened the perceptual effect. We propose that alpha tACS over FEF mimicked a state of endogenous attention by strengthening a fronto-occipitoparietal network in the alpha band. We speculate that this network modulation enhanced phasic gating in occipitoparietal cortex leading to increased variability of single-trial psychometric thresholds, measurable as a reduction of psychometric slope.</p>

                <p>Decreased neuronal specificity of the brain in response to cognitive demands (i.e., neural dedifferentiation) has been implicated in age-related cognitive decline. Investigations into functional connectivity analogs of these processes have focused primarily on measuring segregation of nonoverlapping networks at rest. Here, we used an edge-centric network approach to derive entropy, a measure of specialization, from spatially overlapping communities during cognitive task fMRI. Using Human Connectome Project Lifespan data (713 participants, 36&ndash;100&nbsp;years old, 55.7% female), we characterized a pattern of nodal despecialization differentially affecting the medial temporal lobe and limbic, visual, and subcortical systems. At the whole-brain level, global entropy moderated declines in fluid cognition across the lifespan and uniquely covaried with age when controlling for the network segregation metric modularity. Importantly, relationships between both metrics (entropy and modularity) and fluid cognition were age dependent, although entropy's relationship with cognition was specific to older adults. These results suggest entropy is a potentially important metric for examining how neurological processes in aging affect functional specialization at the nodal, network, and whole-brain level.</p>

                <p>Inhibitory neurons embedded within mammalian neural circuits shape breathing, walking, and other rhythmic motor behaviors. At the core of the neural circuit controlling breathing is the preBo&#x0308;tzinger Complex (preBo&#x0308;tC), where GABAergic (GAD1/2<sup>+</sup>) and glycinergic (GlyT2<sup>+</sup>) neurons are functionally and anatomically intercalated among glutamatergic Dbx1-derived (Dbx1<sup>+</sup>) neurons that generate rhythmic inspiratory drive. The roles of these preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory neurons in breathing remain unclear. We first characterized the spatial distribution of molecularly defined preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory subpopulations in male and female neonatal double reporter mice expressing either tdTomato or EGFP in GlyT2<sup>+</sup>, GAD1<sup>+</sup>, or GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons. We found that the majority of preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory neurons expressed both GlyT2 and GAD2 while a much smaller subpopulation also expressed GAD1. To determine the functional role of these subpopulations, we used holographic photostimulation, a patterned illumination technique, in rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal Dbx1<sup>tdTomato</sup>;GlyT2<sup>EGFP</sup> and Dbx1<sup>tdTomato</sup>;GAD1<sup>EGFP</sup> double reporter mice of either sex. Stimulation of 4 or 8 preBo&#x0308;tC GlyT2<sup>+</sup> neurons during endogenous rhythm prolonged the interburst interval in a phase-dependent manner and increased the latency to burst initiation when bursts were evoked by stimulation of Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons. In contrast, stimulation of 4 or 8 preBo&#x0308;tC GAD1<sup>+</sup> neurons did not affect interburst interval or latency to burst initiation. Instead, photoactivation of GAD1<sup>+</sup> neurons during the inspiratory burst prolonged endogenous and evoked burst duration and decreased evoked burst amplitude. We conclude that GlyT2<sup>+</sup>/GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons modulate breathing rhythm by delaying burst initiation while a smaller GAD1<sup>+</sup> subpopulation shapes inspiratory patterning by altering burst duration and amplitude.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of seniors in the United States. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study neurophysiology in AD and its prodromal condition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which can be estimated through the magnitude of the autocorrelation of neural signals from rs-fMRI, is thought to quantify the duration that neural information is stored in a local circuit. Such heterogeneity of the timescales forms a basis of the brain functional hierarchy and captures an aspect of circuit dynamics relevant to excitation/inhibition balance, which is broadly relevant for cognitive functions. Given that, we applied rs-fMRI to test whether distinct changes of INT at different hierarchies are present in people with MCI, those progressing to AD (called Converter), and AD patients of both sexes. Linear mixed-effect model was implemented to detect altered hierarchical gradients across populations followed by pairwise comparisons to identify regional differences. High similarities between AD and Converter were observed. Specifically, the inferior temporal, caudate, and pallidum areas exhibit significant alterations in both AD and Converter. Distinct INT-related pathological changes in MCI and AD were found. For AD/Converter, neural information is stored for a longer time in lower hierarchical areas, while higher levels of hierarchy seem to be preferentially impaired in MCI leading to a less pronounced hierarchical gradient. These results inform that the INT holds great potential as an additional measure for AD prediction, even a stable biomarker for clinical diagnosis.</p>

In a sample of 64 superagers (mean age, 81.9; 59% women) and 55 typical older adults (mean age, 82.4; 64% women) from the Vallecas Project, we studied, cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 5&nbsp;years with yearly follow-ups, the global cerebral white matter status as well as region-specific white matter microstructure assessment derived from diffusivity measures. Superagers and typical older adults showed no difference in global white matter health (total white matter volume, Fazekas score, and lesions volume) cross-sectionally or longitudinally. However, analyses of diffusion parameters revealed the better white matter microstructure in superagers than in typical older adults. Cross-sectional differences showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in superagers mostly in frontal fibers and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in most white matter tracts, expressed as an anteroposterior gradient with greater group differences in anterior tracts. FA decrease over time is slower in superagers than in typical older adults in all white matter tracts assessed, which is mirrored by MD increases over time being slower in superagers than in typical older adults in all white matter tracts except for the corticospinal tract, the uncinate fasciculus, and the forceps minor. The better preservation of white matter microstructure in superagers relative to typical older adults supports resistance to age-related brain structural changes as a mechanism underpinning the remarkable memory capacity of superagers, while their regional aging pattern is in line with the last-in-first-out hypothesis.</p>

                <p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions within the gene <I>C9ORF72</I> are the most common cause of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This disease-causing expansion leads to a reduction in C9ORF72 expression levels in patients, suggesting loss of C9ORF72 function could contribute to disease. To further understand the consequences of C9ORF72 deficiency in vivo, we generated a <I>c9orf72</I> mutant zebrafish line. Analysis of the adult female spinal cords revealed no appreciable neurodegenerative pathology such as loss of motor neurons or increased levels of neuroinflammation. However, detailed examination of adult female <I>c9orf72<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retinas showed prominent neurodegenerative features, including a decrease in retinal thickness, gliosis, and an overall reduction in neurons of all subtypes. Analysis of rod and cone cells within the photoreceptor layer showed a disturbance in their outer segment structure and rhodopsin mislocalization from rod outer segments to their cell bodies and synaptic terminals. Thus, C9ORF72 may play a previously unappreciated role in retinal homeostasis and suggests C9ORF72 deficiency can induce tissue specific neuronal loss.</p>

                <p>The olfactory tubercle (TUB), also called the tubular striatum, receives direct input from the olfactory bulb and, along with the nucleus accumbens, is one of the two principal components of the ventral striatum. As a key component of the reward system, the ventral striatum is involved in feeding behavior, but the vast majority of research on this structure has focused on the nucleus accumbens, leaving the TUB's role in feeding behavior understudied. Given the importance of olfaction in food seeking and consumption, olfactory input to the striatum should be an important contributor to motivated feeding behavior. Yet the TUB is vastly understudied in humans, with very little understanding of its structural organization and connectivity. In this study, we analyzed macrostructural variations between the TUB and the whole brain and explored the relationship between TUB structural pathways and feeding behavior, using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy in females and males. We identified a unique structural covariance between the TUB and the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which has recently been implicated in the suppression of feeding. We further show that the integrity of the white matter tract between the two regions is negatively correlated with BMI. Our findings highlight a potential role for the TUB&ndash;PAG pathway in the regulation of feeding behavior in humans.</p>

                Background The significance of innovative work behavior is growing as organizations strive to maintain their competitiveness by hiring freelancer employees. This study aimed to examine how absorptive capability mediates the connections between job motivation, transformational leadership, and innovation work behavior in freelancers working in the oil and gas industry. Methods A quantitative methodology was employed through an online questionnaire, using a random sampling strategy involving 250 respondents. Furthermore, data analysis was performed using structural equation modelling. Results The findings indicate that job motivation and transformational leadership did not have a direct impact on innovation work behavior. However, they did have an indirect beneficial influence mediated by absorptive capability. This study revealed that absorptive skills play a vital role in facilitating the translation of job drive and transformational leadership into innovative work behaviors. Conclusions The practical consequences involve firms embracing transformational leadership and establishing training programs to enhance employees' absorptive potential, thereby promoting innovation. Ultimately, cultivating absorptive skills is crucial for leadership styles and motivational elements to be evident in innovative work behaviors.

                Background Patients treated in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) departments benefit from global and multidisciplinary long-term care. The study of satisfaction represents an important element in the evaluation of the quality of the healthcare provided. The aim of this study is to assess the level of satisfaction of patients treated in the PM&R department of Sahloul university hospital of Sousse Tunisia as well as the associated factors during the year 2020. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study, including patients treated in the hospitalization and the outpatient units of the PM&R department. Monnin and Perneger scale validated in Arabic was used to measure satisfaction in its different dimensions. Medical data were completed from patients’ records. Results A total of 240 patients were included in our study. The level of satisfaction was significantly higher with the admission procedures for inpatients compared to outpatients (87.9% vs. 60.0%, p<0.001). Regarding the global assessment, 82.1% of patients were satisfied. Multivariate analysis showed that for administrative procedures, consultation for outpatients was a factor of dissatisfaction (aOR=0.18, p<0.001). Patients’ physiotherapy treatment during the Covid-19 period was negatively associated with satisfaction for logistics (aOR= 0.44, p=0.011) and for the global assessment of health care provided in our department (aOR= 0.46, p=0.04). Conclusion Our study showed overall good levels of satisfaction in the department of PM&R of Sahloul. However, more studies should follow to determine other factors that can influence satisfaction.

                Background Lassa fever is an endemic and immediately notifiable disease in Liberia, and one laboratory confirmed case constitutes an outbreak. We described the epidemiological characteristics and hospital outcome of Lassa fever cases hospitalized during the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Methods A cohort study was conducted using routine Lassa fever surveillance data from the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and log binomial regression to assess the association between epidemiological characteristics and mortality. Results A total of 439 suspected Lassa fever cases were reported. The median age was 22 (interquartile range: 10-33) years and 233 (53%) were women. The median number of days between symptom onset and admission was 4 (IQR 2-7). Of the 439 cases, 416 (95%) were tested for Lassa fever and 138 were confirmed with 33% positivity rate. The majority, 290 (69%), of confirmed cases were <30 years, 78 (57%) were females, and 81 (59%) were reported during the dry season (October – March). Contact with rodents, 94 (68%), was the commonest mode of exposure. Fever, 128 (93%), malaise, 121 (88%), headache, 114 (83%) and myalgia, 114 (83%) were the most common clinical characteristics. There were 83 (19%) deaths among hospitalized suspected Lassa fever cases - 42 deaths (15%) among 278 individuals who tested negative and 41 among confirmed cases with 30% case fatality rate (CFR). The highest CFR was recorded among those aged 40-49 years, 8 (67%) and those aged≥50, 5 (63%). There was no significant association between epidemiological characteristics and Lassa fever mortality. Conclusions The outbreak highlighted a high disease burden of Lassa fever with young adults disproportionately infected, and substantial mortality, even among those who tested negative for the virus. This underscores the urgent need for preventive measures like vaccines and health education campaigns.

                Introduction Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe condition that causes severe pain and emotional distress in the brain. It can significantly impact the quality of a person's life and lead to daily withdrawal and emotional instability. Despite extensive research, there is still a need for comprehensive bibliometric studies to understand the literature on TN. This study is particularly important as there are no existing bibliometric studies on TN on Scopus, providing new opportunities for research and innovation in TN treatment. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords “trigeminal neuralgia”, current and therapy. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, factorial map of the documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by affiliation, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, and qualitative analysis. Conclusions The study focuses on trigeminal neuralgia, a topic of research and a recent topic involving periferal nerve stimulation and the use of karbamazepin, a new topic in the field of therapy.

                Background Despite the relaxation of fertility restrictions, China’s birth rate continues to decline. The Universal Two-Child Policy encourages couples to consider having a second child, often leading to a bargaining process between spouses with differing preferences. Additionally, the skewed sex ratio has increased Chinese women’s bargaining power, highlighting the importance of analyzing fertility decisions through marital bargaining. Methods This paper investigates second-child fertility decisions using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and employs Ordinary Least Squares regression. The study examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences and uses the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The study shows that achieving consensus on having a second child requires cooperation between spouses, particularly when their fertility preferences differ. The study also reveals that marriage matching is not random; individuals are more likely to partner with those who share the same second-child preference. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power positively influence their husbands’ desired family size, a correlation not observed in males. Conclusion The study concludes that second-child fertility decisions in China are significantly influenced by marital bargaining and the increased bargaining power of women due to the skewed sex ratio. Cooperation between spouses with differing fertility preferences is crucial for reaching a consensus on having a second child.

     alt="Extensive soma-soma plate-like contact sites (ephapses) connect suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons"/><p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus comprises cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent intrinsic circadian periods that maintain coordinated oscillations even when chemical synapses or gap junctions are blocked. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, a three-dimensional reconstruction of SCN core neurons was performed from 805 ultrathin sections imaged with electron microscopy. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. As such, this ensemble of cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent periods must maintain coordinated oscillations. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, 805 coronal ultrathin sections of mouse SCN tissue were imaged with electron microscopy and aligned into a volumetric stack, from which selected neurons within the SCN core were reconstructed <i>in silico</i>. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected to each other via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts. In some cases, a sliver of a glial process was interleaved. These contacts were large, covering on average ∼21% of apposing neuronal somata. It is possible that contacts may be the electrophysiological substrate for synchronization between SCN neurons. Such plate-like contacts may explain why the synchronization of SCN neurons is maintained even when chemical synaptic transmission or electrical synaptic transmission via gap junctions is blocked. Such ephaptic contact-mediated synchronization among nearby neurons may therefore contribute to the wave-like oscillations of circadian core clock genes and calcium signals observed in the SCN.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>Three-dimensional reconstruction of SCN tissue via serial electron microscopy revealed a novel structural feature of SCN neurons that may account for interneuronal synchronization that persists even when the predominant mechanisms of neuronal communication are blocked. We found that SCN core neurons are connected by multiple soma–soma contact specializations, ultrastructural elements that could enable synchronization of tightly packed neurons organized in clustered networks. This extensive network of plate-like soma–soma contacts among clustered SCN neurons may provide insight into how ∼20,000 autonomous neuronal oscillators with a broad range of intrinsic periods remain synchronized in the absence of ordinary communication modalities, thereby conferring the resilience required for the SCN to function as the mammalian circadian pacemaker.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This work attempted to clarify the interaction of cognition and pain sensitization during a paradigm of Temporal Summation of Second Pain (TSSP). We analyzed pain ratings and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity obtained from 21 healthy participants during the presentation of four experimental conditions that differed in the manipulation of attention to painful stimuli or working memory load (Attention to hand &amp; TSSP; 0-back &amp; TSSP (low cognitive load); 2-back &amp; TSSP (high cognitive load); 2-back (without pain)). We found that the TSSP was reduced when the attention was diverted and the cognitive load increased, and this reduction was accompanied by higher midfrontal theta activity and lower posterior alpha and central beta activity. Although it is well established that TSSP is a phenomenon that occurs at the spinal level, here we show that it is also affected by supraspinal attentional mechanisms. Delivery of painful repeated stimuli did not affect the performance of the 2-back task but was associated with smaller amplitudes of attentional event-related potentials (ERPs) after standard stimuli (not the target). The study of brain activity during TSSP allowed to clarify the role of top-down attentional modulation in pain sensitization processes. Results contribute to a better understanding of cognitive dysfunction in pain conditions and reinforce the use of therapeutic strategies based on distracting attention away from pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25362?af=R">Newborn auditory brainstem response and sudden infant death syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)—the sudden and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant, &lt;1 year old—may be associated with abnormalities in the brain regions that underlie breathing and arousal during sleep. While post-mortem studies suggest abnormalities in SIDS infants' brainstems, there are no studies of these infants' brainstem function before death. One way to assess the function of the brainstem is with auditory brainstem response (ABR), a routine hearing-screening method that noninvasively measures the brainstem's response to sound. We hypothesize that anomalies in newborns' ABR measures may predict SIDS. Indeed, previous studies identified abnormalities in ABR characteristics in small samples of near-miss SIDS infants hospitalized for infant apnea syndrome. However, there is a need to examine the ABRs of infants who died of SIDS. Therefore, in the current study, we propose integrating two secondary datasets to examine newborns' ABRs (<i>N</i> = 156,972), including those who later died of SIDS (<i>n</i> = ~42; .27 out of every 1000 infants), using existing archived records of neonatal ABR results from a sample of newborns born in Florida. We hypothesize that infants who die from SIDS are more likely than non-SIDS infants to have abnormal ABRs as newborns. Understanding the association between SIDS and ABR may facilitate more accurate identification of an infant's risk for SIDS at birth, enabling increased monitoring, which may facilitate interventions and improve survivorship.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26913?af=R">Determinants and Biomarkers of Progression Independent of Relapses in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that a smoldering inflammatory activity is present from the earliest stages of the disease and underlies the progression of disability, which proceeds relentlessly and independently of clinical and radiological relapses (PIRA). The complex system of pathological events driving “chronic” worsening is likely linked with the early accumulation of compartmentalized inflammation within the central nervous system as well as insufficient repair phenomena and mitochondrial failure. These mechanisms are partially lesion-independent and differ from those causing clinical relapses and the formation of new focal demyelinating lesions; they lead to neuroaxonal dysfunction and death, myelin loss, glia alterations, and finally, a neuronal network dysfunction outweighing central nervous system (CNS) compensatory mechanisms. This review aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of neuropathological, immunological, and imaging knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the smoldering disease activity, focusing on possible early biomarkers and their translation into clinical practice.
