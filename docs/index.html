              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of VGLUT1 in Cholinergic Medial Habenula Projections Increases Nicotine Self-Administration</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cholinergic projections from the medial habenula (MHb) to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) have been studied for their complex contributions to nicotine addiction and have been implicated in nicotine reinforcement, aversion, and withdrawal. While it has been established that MHb cholinergic projections corelease glutamate, no direct evidence has demonstrated a role for this glutamate projection in nicotine consumption. In the present study, a novel floxed <I>Slc17a7</I> [vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1)] mouse was generated and used to create conditional knock-out (cKO) mice that lack VGLUT1 in MHb cholinergic neurons. Loss of <I>Slc17a7</I> expression in ventral MHb cholinergic neurons was validated using fluorescent <I>in situ</I> hybridization, and immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate a corresponding reduction of VGLUT1 protein in cholinergic terminals in the IPN. We also used optogenetics-assisted electrophysiology to evoke EPSCs in IPN and observed a reduction of glutamatergic currents in the cKO, supporting the functional disruption of VGLUT1 in MHb to IPN synapses. cKO mice exhibited no gross phenotypic abnormalities and displayed normal thigmotaxis and locomotor behavior in the open-field assay. When trained to lever press for food, there was no difference between control and cKO. However, when tested in a nicotine self-administration procedure, we found that the loss of VGLUT1-mediated glutamate corelease led to increased responding for nicotine. These findings indicate that glutamate corelease from ventral MHb cholinergic neurons opposes nicotine self-administration, and provide additional support for targeting this synapse to develop potential treatments for nicotine addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phase-Synchronized Stimulus Presentation Augments Contingency Knowledge and Affective Evaluation in a Fear-Conditioning Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Memory often combines information from different sensory modalities. Animal studies show that synchronized neuronal activity in the theta band (4&ndash;8 Hz) binds multimodal associations. Studies with human participants have likewise established that theta-phase synchronization augments the formation of declarative video&ndash;tone pair memories. Another form of associative learning, classical fear conditioning, models nondeclarative, emotional memory with distinct neuronal mechanisms. Typical fear-conditioning tasks pair a conditioned stimulus (CS) in one modality with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) in another. The present study examines the effects of CS&ndash;US synchronization in the theta band on fear memory formation in humans. In a fear generalization procedure, we paired one of five visual gratings of varying orientation (CS) with an aversive auditory US. We modulated the luminance of the CS and the volume of the US at a rate of 4 Hz. To manipulate the synchrony between visual and auditory input during fear acquisition, one group (<I>N</I> = 20) received synchronous CS&ndash;US pairing, whereas the control group (<I>N</I> = 20) received the CS&ndash;US pairs out of phase. Phase synchronization improved CS&ndash;US contingency knowledge and facilitated CS discrimination in terms of rated valence and arousal, resulting in narrower generalization across the CS gratings compared with the out-of-phase group. In contrast, synchronization did not amplify conditioned responding in physiological arousal (skin conductance) and visuocortical engagement (steady-state visually evoked potentials) during acquisition, although both measures demonstrated tuning toward the CS<sup>+</sup>. Together, these data support a causal role of theta-phase synchronization in affective evaluation and contingency report during fear acquisition.</p>

                A 57-year-old male who had been working in masonry for 33 years was hospitalized for renal function decline associated with exertional dyspnea. He presented with hypertension and limb edema. Urinalysis revealed an active urine sediment with glomerular proteinuria at 1.5 g/24h and the renal biopsy identified mesangial IgA Nephropathy. Chest tomography scans showed signs of silicosis. The patient received Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors with stable renal function. To our knowledge, the association of silicosis-IgA nephropathy has rarely been reported in the literature. This case highlights the effect of chronic exposure to silica dust and its association with both silica and renal disease.

                The pandemic has created challenges in all sectors of the economy and education. Traditional teaching approaches seem futile in the new context, thus the need to constantly reinvent the delivery to meet the fast-paced changes in the education domain. Hence, Design Thinking (DT) is an alternative approach that might be useful in the given context. DT is known to be a human-centric approach to innovative problem-solving processes. DT could be employed in the delivery process to develop twenty-first-century skills and enhance creativity and innovation, in an attempt to identify alternative solutions. The study explores the role of design thinking (DT) in the form of empathy, thinking process, gamified lessons and curriculum enhancement, which leads to innovative delivery among teachers. It enhances and facilitates innovative content delivery by leveraging creativity. The study targeted 131 teachers, whereby 61 are primary school teachers and 70 are secondary school teachers. A questionnaire constituting of 23 close-ended questions using the 5-point Likert scale was used to collect data. Data was analyzed using SmartPLS to establish relationships between DT and Innovative Delivery in schools. The data was further analyzed to seek co-relations between the DT steps and the successful transformation of content delivery by teachers. The study established a framework for the application of design thinking for teachers as the primary support in developing activities for their students. It shows that thinking process, gamifying lessons and curriculum enhancement have positive significance in innovative delivery, whereas empathy did not show a significant positive relationship. The outcome of this study will help fill the gap towards creating an interesting method of delivery in schools and constantly innovating the method to suit the evolving generation. This insight is crucial for the Ministry of Education and policymakers to enhance teachers’ ability to innovatively deliver content to students.

                Background: The study sought to explore the lived experiences of individuals having served in the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia, as they made the transition to civilian life and sought new employment opportunities.     Methods: Researchers carried out qualitative research in the form of narrative inquiry. Narratives were collected from eleven in-depth interviews conducted in Saudi Arabia in 2021, allowed for insight into participant experiences. Existing literature on military retirement was also investigated. Results: Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed concurrently using thematic analysis to identify patterns or themes. The researchers adopted thematic synthesis as an analytical framework though which descriptive themes from the literature on military retirement were generated. Overall, this approach allowed for the comparison of themes in literature with those of narrative interviews. Conclusion: The study identified challenges encountered by veterans during the resettlement and transitional phase from military to civilian life. There was a general consensus, however, that military life equips individuals with valuable skills that are transferrable to successful post-military employment, known as Positive Transferable Adaptability for Employability (PTAE), (Mottershead, 2019), which can greatly empower those making the transition. These findings led the researchers to develop a new model for veteran career paths that meet the contemporary employment needs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the REVERE Transition Model, which identifies six career paths.

                Background: Horses are herd animals that have been domesticated in the last century. In several countries, an overview of risk factors and clinical evaluation in horses with colic has not been well‐described. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors and hematological profiles in horses associated with colic in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed during April - October 2019. A total of 115 horses were diagnosed based on physical examination, clinical symptoms, and rectal examination. A questionnaire was asked to the horse-owners to analyze the risk factors while the clinical examination was performed and blood samples were collected for pre-treatment and 14 days post-treatment. Hematological profile was evaluated from a whole blood sample. Serum cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations were also evaluated after separating the aliquots.  Results: Of the 115 horses, 96 were diagnosed with colic. The horses with colic showed a significant association between cases with gender (p<0.021), breed (p<0.000), wheat bran feeding (p<0.015), concentrate feeding (p<0.003), anthelmintics administration (p<0.000), gastrointestinal parasites (p<0.000), dental diseases (p<0.024), previous exposure to colic (p<0.000), body condition score (p<0.000), and access to water per day (p<0.000). Based on whole blood and serum evaluation, there were ameliorated significantly on the hematological profile (p<0.01), serum cortisol (p<0.05), and plasma epinephrine (p<0.01) at 14 days post-treatment. Conclusion: This study has identified factors associated with colic in Delman horses. The study provides crucial information to investigate cases of colic and to contribute the development of healthcare strategies during treatment and clinical evaluation.

                This paper investigates the effects of screen time on child development and cognition and the setting of ‘safe’ screen time limits for young children, specifically children aged 6-to-12 years. Guidelines on screen time vary across constituencies, and the debate around screen time is contentious with many questions yet to be answered. A review of literature was undertaken to compare current screen time recommendations against the evidence from Neuroscience, Psychiatry, Psychology and Pediatrics that quantify screen time effects on the children's brain development. Based on this comparison, conclusions are made that can guide education policies around ‘remote learning’ and ‘home schooling’ to align them with the available research on the effects of screen time on children and inform a re-evaluation of the role of parents and educators in the setting of ‘safe’ limits on screen time.

                Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a poor prognosis and is a major cause of mortality and suffering in Thailand’s Northeastern (Isaan) Region.   Methods: This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 72 newly diagnosed CCA patients; 42 patients who received cannabis treatment (CT) and 30 patients who received a standard palliative care treatment (ST). The study was carried out between 1st September 2019 to 31st October 2020.  Data were collected from patients from oncology clinics of six hospitals in five provinces of northeast Thailand. The HRQoL was measured at baseline, and at 2 and 4 months after diagnosis by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life questionnaires QLQ-C30, and QLQ-BIL21. The Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare quality of life scores between the two patient groups and Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare within groups QoL scores at pre-treatment, and 2 and 4 month follow-ups. Results: Global health status and functional scales, for both groups were high at pre-treatment. At 2 and 4 month follow-up, CT group patients had consistent statistically significantly better Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), and QoL scores, and many symptom scores than the ST group.   Conclusions: Medicinal cannabis may increase QoL for advanced CCA patients. Our findings support the importance of early access to palliative cannabis care clinic before the terminal and acceleration phase close to death.

                Background: FabB (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 1) is part of the fatty acid synthesis II pathway found in bacteria and a potential target for antibiotics. The enzyme catalyses the Claisen condensation of malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) with acyl-ACP via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Here, we report the crystal structure of the intermediate-mimicking Pseudomonas aeruginosa FabB (PaFabB) C161A variant. Methods: His-tagged PaFabB C161A was expressed in E. coli Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells, cleaved by TEV protease and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Commercial screens were used to identify suitable crystallization conditions which were subsequently improved to obtain well diffracting crystals. Results: We developed a robust and efficient system for recombinant expression of PaFabB C161A. Conditions to obtain well diffracting crystals were established. The crystal structure of PaFabB C161A was solved by molecular replacement at 1.3 Å resolution. Binding site comparison between PaFabB and PaFabF revealed a conserved malonyl binding site but differences in the fatty acid binding channel. Conclusions: The PaFabB C161A crystal structure can be used as a template to facilitate the design of FabB inhibitors.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the revealing manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of anisometropia in children and adolescents [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This research was developed to study the epidemiology of anisometropia. It aims to estimate the prevalence of anisometropia in Portuguese children and adolescents at various educational stages, studying its association with sociodemographic variables. Methods: Observational cross sectional study envolving 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) from the central region of Portugal. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field auto refractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegia and under binocular conditions, to determine the rate of anisometropia and its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Results: The prevalence of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most prevalent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical differences were found between genders or between areas of residence regarding the rate of anisometropia. Regarding spherical equivalent anisometropia, there was a pattern of variation that increased with the cycle of studies (× 2 (3)= 10.918; p = 0.012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: This study found an increase in anisometropia with the educational stage. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition beyond childhood.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lateral versus posterior surgical approach for the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Supracondylar humeral fracture (SHF) is the most common type of fracture in children. Moreover, lateral and posterior surgical approaches are the most frequently chosen approaches for open reduction surgery in displaced SHF when C-arm is unavailable. However, previous literature showed mixed findings regarding functional and cosmetic outcomes. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has compared these two procedures.  Methods: Our protocol was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021213763). We conducted a comprehensive electronic database search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract, followed by full-text reading and study selection based on eligibility criteria. The quality of the selected studies was analyzed with the ROBINS-I tool. Meta-analysis was carried out to compare the range of motion (functional outcome) and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn’s criteria. This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and Cochrane handbook guidelines.  Results: Our initial search yielded 163 studies, from which we included five comparative studies comprising 231 children in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.69, 95% CI [0.97-2.93]) and good (OR 1.12, 95% CI [0.61-2.04]) functional outcomes and less likely to result in fair (OR 0.84, 95% CI [0.34-2.13]) and poor (OR 0.42, 95% CI [0.1-1.73]) functional outcomes compared to the posterior approach. In terms of cosmetic results, both approaches showed mixed findings. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.11, 95% CI [0.61-2.02]) and fair (OR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49-2.80]) but less likely to result in good (OR 0.79, 95% CI [0.40-1.55]) cosmetic outcomes. However, none of these analyses were statistically significant (p> 0.05).  Conclusion: Lateral and posterior surgical approaches resulted in satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes. The two approaches are comparable for treating SHF in children when evaluated with Flynn’s criteria.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Self-organization of collective escape in pigeon flocks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marina Papadopoulou, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Daniel W. E. Sankey, Steven J. Portugal, Charlotte K. Hemelrijk</p>

Bird flocks under predation demonstrate complex patterns of collective escape. These patterns may emerge by self-organization from local interactions among group-members. Computational models have been shown to be valuable for identifying what behavioral rules may govern such interactions among individuals during collective motion. However, our knowledge of such rules for collective escape is limited by the lack of quantitative data on bird flocks under predation in the field. In the present study, we analyze the first GPS trajectories of pigeons in airborne flocks attacked by a robotic falcon in order to build a species-specific model of collective escape. We use our model to examine a recently identified distance-dependent pattern of collective behavior: the closer the prey is to the predator, the higher the frequency with which flock members turn away from it. We first extract from the empirical data of pigeon flocks the characteristics of their shape and internal structure (bearing angle and distance to nearest neighbors). Combining these with information on their coordination from the literature, we build an agent-based model adjusted to pigeons’ collective escape. We show that the pattern of turning away from the predator with increased frequency when the predator is closer arises without prey prioritizing escape when the predator is near. Instead, it emerges through self-organization from a behavioral rule to avoid the predator independently of their distance to it. During this self-organization process, we show how flock members increase their consensus over which direction to escape and turn collectively as the predator gets closer. Our results suggest that coordination among flock members, combined with simple escape rules, reduces the cognitive costs of tracking the predator while flocking. Such escape rules that are independent of the distance to the predator can now be investigated in other species. Our study showcases the important role of computational models in the interpretation of empirical findings of collective behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetries around the visual field: From retina to cortex to behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eline R. Kupers, Noah C. Benson, Marisa Carrasco, Jonathan Winawer</p>

Visual performance varies around the visual field. It is best near the fovea compared to the periphery, and at iso-eccentric locations it is best on the horizontal, intermediate on the lower, and poorest on the upper meridian. The fovea-to-periphery performance decline is linked to the decreases in cone density, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density, and V1 cortical magnification factor (CMF) as eccentricity increases. The origins of polar angle asymmetries are not well understood. Optical quality and cone density vary across the retina, but recent computational modeling has shown that these factors can only account for a small percentage of behavior. Here, we investigate how visual processing beyond the cone photon absorptions contributes to polar angle asymmetries in performance. First, we quantify the extent of asymmetries in cone density, midget RGC density, and V1 CMF. We find that both polar angle asymmetries and eccentricity gradients increase from cones to mRGCs, and from mRGCs to cortex. Second, we extend our previously published computational observer model to quantify the contribution of phototransduction by the cones and spatial filtering by mRGCs to behavioral asymmetries. Starting with photons emitted by a visual display, the model simulates the effect of human optics, cone isomerizations, phototransduction, and mRGC spatial filtering. The model performs a forced choice orientation discrimination task on mRGC responses using a linear support vector machine classifier. The model shows that asymmetries in a decision maker’s performance across polar angle are greater when assessing the photocurrents than when assessing isomerizations and are greater still when assessing mRGC signals. Nonetheless, the polar angle asymmetries of the mRGC outputs are still considerably smaller than those observed from human performance. We conclude that cone isomerizations, phototransduction, and the spatial filtering properties of mRGCs contribute to polar angle performance differences, but that a full account of these differences will entail additional contribution from cortical representations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Profiling transcription factor activity dynamics using intronic reads in time-series transcriptome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yan Wu, Lingfeng Xue, Wen Huang, Minghua Deng, Yihan Lin</p>

Activities of transcription factors (TFs) are temporally modulated to regulate dynamic cellular processes, including development, homeostasis, and disease. Recent developments of bioinformatic tools have enabled the analysis of TF activities using transcriptome data. However, because these methods typically use exon-based target expression levels, the estimated TF activities have limited temporal accuracy. To address this, we proposed a TF activity measure based on intron-level information in time-series RNA-seq data, and implemented it to decode the temporal control of TF activities during dynamic processes. We showed that TF activities inferred from intronic reads can better recapitulate instantaneous TF activities compared to the exon-based measure. By analyzing public and our own time-series transcriptome data, we found that intron-based TF activities improve the characterization of temporal phasing of cycling TFs during circadian rhythm, and facilitate the discovery of two temporally opposing TF modules during T cell activation. Collectively, we anticipate that the proposed approach would be broadly applicable for decoding global transcriptional architecture during dynamic processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Molecular basis of Arginine and Lysine DNA sequence-dependent thermo-stability modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin Martin, Pablo D. Dans, Milosz Wieczór, Nuria Villegas, Isabelle Brun-Heath, Federica Battistini, Montserrat Terrazas, Modesto Orozco</p>

We have used a variety of theoretical and experimental techniques to study the role of four basic amino acids–Arginine, Lysine, Ornithine and L-2,4-Diaminobutyric acid–on the structure, flexibility and sequence-dependent stability of DNA. We found that the presence of organic ions stabilizes the duplexes and significantly reduces the difference in stability between AT- and GC-rich duplexes with respect to the control conditions. This suggests that these amino acids, ingredients of the primordial soup during abiogenesis, could have helped to equalize the stability of AT- and GC-rich DNA oligomers, facilitating a general non-catalysed self-replication of DNA. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that organic ions have an effect that goes beyond the general electrostatic screening, involving specific interactions along the grooves of the double helix. We conclude that organic ions, largely ignored in the DNA world, should be reconsidered as crucial structural elements far from mimics of small inorganic cations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpretable machine learning for high-dimensional trajectories of aging health</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Spencer Farrell, Arnold Mitnitski, Kenneth Rockwood, Andrew D. Rutenberg</p>

We have built a computational model for individual aging trajectories of health and survival, which contains physical, functional, and biological variables, and is conditioned on demographic, lifestyle, and medical background information. We combine techniques of modern machine learning with an interpretable interaction network, where health variables are coupled by explicit pair-wise interactions within a stochastic dynamical system. Our dynamic joint interpretable network (DJIN) model is scalable to large longitudinal data sets, is predictive of individual high-dimensional health trajectories and survival from baseline health states, and infers an interpretable network of directed interactions between the health variables. The network identifies plausible physiological connections between health variables as well as clusters of strongly connected health variables. We use English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data to train our model and show that it performs better than multiple dedicated linear models for health outcomes and survival. We compare our model with flexible lower-dimensional latent-space models to explore the dimensionality required to accurately model aging health outcomes. Our DJIN model can be used to generate synthetic individuals that age realistically, to impute missing data, and to simulate future aging outcomes given arbitrary initial health states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A lexical approach for identifying behavioural action sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gautam Reddy, Laura Desban, Hidenori Tanaka, Julian Roussel, Olivier Mirat, Claire Wyart</p>

Animals display characteristic behavioural patterns when performing a task, such as the spiraling of a soaring bird or the surge-and-cast of a male moth searching for a female. Identifying such recurring sequences occurring rarely in noisy behavioural data is key to understanding the behavioural response to a distributed stimulus in unrestrained animals. Existing models seek to describe the dynamics of behaviour or segment individual locomotor episodes rather than to identify the rare and transient sequences of locomotor episodes that make up the behavioural response. To fill this gap, we develop a lexical, hierarchical model of behaviour. We designed an unsupervised algorithm called “BASS” to efficiently identify and segment recurring behavioural action sequences transiently occurring in long behavioural recordings. When applied to navigating larval zebrafish, BASS extracts a dictionary of remarkably long, non-Markovian sequences consisting of repeats and mixtures of slow forward and turn bouts. Applied to a novel chemotaxis assay, BASS uncovers chemotactic strategies deployed by zebrafish to avoid aversive cues consisting of sequences of fast large-angle turns and burst swims. In a simulated dataset of soaring gliders climbing thermals, BASS finds the spiraling patterns characteristic of soaring behaviour. In both cases, BASS succeeds in identifying rare action sequences in the behaviour deployed by freely moving animals. BASS can be easily incorporated into the pipelines of existing behavioural analyses across diverse species, and even more broadly used as a generic algorithm for pattern recognition in low-dimensional sequential data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of ancestry heterozygosity suggests that hybrid incompatibilities in threespine stickleback are environment dependent</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ken A. Thompson, Catherine L. Peichel, Diana J. Rennison, Matthew D. McGee, Arianne Y. K. Albert, Timothy H. Vines, Anna K. Greenwood, Abigail R. Wark, Yaniv Brandvain, Molly Schumer, Dolph Schluter</p>

Hybrid incompatibilities occur when interactions between opposite ancestry alleles at different loci reduce the fitness of hybrids. Most work on incompatibilities has focused on those that are “intrinsic,” meaning they affect viability and sterility in the laboratory. Theory predicts that ecological selection can also underlie hybrid incompatibilities, but tests of this hypothesis using sequence data are scarce. In this article, we compiled genetic data for F<sub>2</sub> hybrid crosses between divergent populations of threespine stickleback fish (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i> L.) that were born and raised in either the field (seminatural experimental ponds) or the laboratory (aquaria). Because selection against incompatibilities results in elevated ancestry heterozygosity, we tested the prediction that ancestry heterozygosity will be higher in pond-raised fish compared to those raised in aquaria. We found that ancestry heterozygosity was elevated by approximately 3% in crosses raised in ponds compared to those raised in aquaria. Additional analyses support a phenotypic basis for incompatibility and suggest that environment-specific single-locus heterozygote advantage is not the cause of selection on ancestry heterozygosity. Our study provides evidence that, in stickleback, a coarse—albeit indirect—signal of environment-dependent hybrid incompatibility is reliably detectable and suggests that extrinsic incompatibilities can evolve before intrinsic incompatibilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Stem cell therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease leading to loss of upper and lower motor neurons at both spinal and bulbar levels.   For patients with ALS rehabilitation is important to maintain functional independence, ensure safety and optimize quality of life but is not curative. Stem cell therapy (SCT) provides a new approach to treat previously incurable diseases although peer reviewed published evidence has shown no benefit in ALS for slowing disease progression or functional loss.   This case report presents a patient with ALS who underwent SCT but deteriorated rapidly after the procedure. Whether the deterioration was due to the natural progress of the disease or expedited by SCT remains unknown. The ethical considerations of how marketing influences healthcare and individuals’ decisions in desperate situations along with reasons for taking desperate measures are discussed.  Patient education and open communication with ALS patients are imperative in gaining patient satisfaction and overcoming ill effects that marketing could have on unconventional methods of intervention. Raising awareness about the availability and access to multidisciplinary care, the timing of decisions with regards to symptom management and end of life care have proven to enhance the quality of life for such patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in children undergoing elective surgeries: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prehabilitation is a therapeutic strategy involving preoperative physical exercises, nutritional support, and stress and anxiety reduction. This approach has been gaining popularity and has been seeing effective results in adults in terms of improving pre and postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this review was to summarise the evidence about the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation programs on various outcome measures in children post elective surgeries.­­ Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL/EBSCO and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Based on the inclusion criteria, titles and abstracts were independently screened by the authors. After that, a data extraction table of the selected studies which included the participants, type, and details of exercise intervention, outcome measures and results were analysed after which the quality assessment of the studies was done. Results: The search yielded 2219 articles of which three articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria with two studies being randomized controlled trials and one being a quasi-experimental pre-post type of study. One randomized controlled trial was on the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in reducing pulmonary complications post cardiac surgeries in children and the other two studies were on the effects of prehabilitation on functional capacity & pulmonary function. All the three articles found that exercise-based prehabilitation had a positive effect on children’s post-surgery. Conclusion: Although there is a paucity of evidence-based literature, we conclude based on the existing literature retrieved by our review that exercise-based prehabilitation improves postoperative outcomes and helps in reducing postoperative complications in children undergoing various surgeries.

                Backgroundː Numerous in vivo human cohort studies have suggested that the apolipoprotein B100/apolipoprotein AI (ApoB100/ApoAI) ratio might be a risk factor in coronary heart disease. The aim of this study was to measure ApoB100/ApoAI ratio changes in cell secretions by incubating HepG2 cells with various amounts of glucose in vitro. Methods ː HepG2 cells were cultured in low-, normal- or high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (1, 4.5 and 10g/L, respectively). Levels of ApoAI and ApoB100 were measured with commercial sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (cat#: H0123 and H0124) from ShangHai MEIXUAN Biological Science and Technology Ltd (Shanghai, China). Experiments were repeated six times for each assay. Resultsː The results showed that ApoB100/ApoAI ratio have positive correlations with the glucose concentration increase. Conclusionsː A higher concentration of glucose induced an undesirable ApoB100/ApoAI ratio change, which suggests a new regulatory pathway in lipoprotein catabolism and provides a cell model for further mechanism study. This finding may lead to novel therapeutic ways for diagnosis and treatment for coronary artery disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of accidental pediatric scald burns in a tertiary care center: hot cauldron burns versus accidental spill burns [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scald burns result from exposure to high-temperature fluids and are more common in the pediatric age group. They occur mainly by two mechanisms: (i) spill and (ii) immersion (hot cauldron) burns. These two patterns differ in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Scalds cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. The objective of this study was to compare accidental spill burns and hot cauldron burns in a hospital setting. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the secondary data of scald cases admitted during the years 2019 and 2020 in a burn-dedicated tertiary care center. Total population sampling was adopted. Data analysis was done partly using SPSS, version-23, and Stata-15. Mann Whitney U-test and Chi-square/Fisher's exact test were done appropriately to find associations between different variables. Binary regression analysis was performed taking mortality events as the outcome of interest. Results: Out of 108 scald cases, 43 (39.8%) had hot cauldron burns and 65 (60.2%) had accidental spill burns. Overall mortality was 16 (14.8%), out of which hot cauldron burns and accidental spill burns comprised 12 (75.0%) and 4 (25.0%), respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis showed the type of scald, age, and Baux score found to be associated with mortality. Every one-year increment in age had a 29% lower odds of occurrence of mortality event (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.99, p=0.042). Likewise, every one-point increment in Baux score was associated with 19% higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.190; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; p<0.001). Conclusions: Accidental spill burn was more common but mortality was significantly higher for hot cauldron burns. The risk of mortality was significantly higher in burn events occurring outside the house, and burns involving back, buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities.

                Recent initiatives to improve translation of findings from animal models to human disease have focussed on reproducibility but quantifying the relevance of animal models remains a challenge. Here, we use comparative transcriptomics of blood to evaluate the systemic host response and its concordance between humans with different clinical manifestations of malaria and five commonly used mouse models. <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> 17XL infection of mice most closely reproduces the profile of gene expression changes seen in the major human severe malaria syndromes, accompanied by high parasite biomass, severe anemia, hyperlactatemia, and cerebral microvascular pathology. However, there is also considerable discordance of changes in gene expression between the different host species and across all models, indicating that the relevance of biological mechanisms of interest in each model should be assessed before conducting experiments. These data will aid the selection of appropriate models for translational malaria research, and the approach is generalizable to other disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional CDKN2A assay identifies frequent deleterious alleles misclassified as variants of uncertain significance</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic germline <i>CDKN2A</i> variants are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). <i>CDKN2A</i> variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) are reported in up to 4.3% of patients with PDAC and result in significant uncertainty for patients and their family members as an unknown fraction are functionally deleterious, and therefore, likely pathogenic. Functional characterization of <i>CDKN2A</i> VUSs is needed to reclassify variants and inform clinical management. 29 germline <i>CDKN2A</i> VUSs previously reported in patients with PDAC or in ClinVar were evaluated using a validated <i>in vitro</i> cell proliferation assay. 12 of the 29 <i>CDKN2A</i> VUSs were functionally deleterious (11 VUSs) or potentially functionally deleterious (1 VUS) and were reclassified as likely pathogenic variants. Thus, over 40% of <i>CDKN2A</i> VUSs identified in patients with PDAC are functionally deleterious and likely pathogenic. When incorporating VUSs found to be functionally deleterious, and reclassified as likely pathogenic, the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic <i>CDKN2A</i> in patients with PDAC reported in the published literature is increased to up to 4.1% of patients, depending on family history. Therefore, <i>CDKN2A</i> VUSs may play a significant, unappreciated role in risk of pancreatic cancer. These findings have significant implications for the counselling and care of patients and their relatives.

                Parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons are critically involved in producing rapid network oscillations and cortical microcircuit computations but the significance of PV<sup>+</sup> axon myelination to the temporal features of inhibition remains elusive. Here using toxic and genetic mouse models of demyelination and dysmyelination, respectively, we find that loss of compact myelin reduces PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron presynaptic terminals, increases failures and the weak phasic inhibition of pyramidal neurons abolishes optogenetically driven gamma oscillations<i> in vivo</i>. Strikingly, during behaviors of quiet wakefulness selectively theta rhythms are amplified and accompanied by highly synchronized interictal epileptic discharges. In support of a causal role of impaired PV-mediated<sup> </sup>inhibition, optogenetic activation of myelin-deficient PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons attenuated the power of slow theta rhythms and limited interictal spike occurrence. Thus, myelination of PV axons is required to consolidate fast inhibition of pyramidal neurons and enable behavioral state-dependent modulation of local circuit synchronization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Correlative all-optical quantification of mass density and mechanics of sub-cellular compartments with fluorescence specificity</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative measurements of physical parameters become increasingly important for understanding biological processes. Brillouin microscopy (BM) has recently emerged as one technique providing the 3D distribution of viscoelastic properties inside biological samples - so far relying on the implicit assumption that refractive index (RI) and density can be neglected. Here, we present a novel method (FOB microscopy) combining BM with optical diffraction tomography and epi-fluorescence imaging for explicitly measuring the Brillouin shift, RI and absolute density with specificity to fluorescently labeled structures. We show that neglecting the RI and density might lead to erroneous conclusions. Investigating the nucleoplasm of wild-type HeLa cells, we find that it has lower density but higher longitudinal modulus than the cytoplasm. Thus, the longitudinal modulus is not merely sensitive to the water content of the sample - a postulate vividly discussed in the field. We demonstrate the further utility of FOB on various biological systems including adipocytes and intracellular membraneless compartments. FOB microscopy can provide unexpected scientific discoveries and shed quantitative light on processes such as phase separation and transition inside living cells.

                Debates have arisen as to whether non-human animals actually can learn abstract non-symbolic numerousness or whether they always rely on some continuous physical aspect of the stimuli, covarying with number. Here we investigated archerfish (<i>Toxotes jaculatrix</i>) non-symbolic numerical discrimination with accurate control for co-varying continuous physical stimulus attributes. Archerfish were trained to select one of two groups of black dots (Exp. 1: 3 <i>vs. </i>6 elements; Exp. 2: 2 <i>vs.</i> 3 elements); these were controlled for several combinations of physical variables (elements’ size, overall area, overall perimeter, density and sparsity), ensuring that only numerical information was available. Generalization tests with novel numerical comparisons (2 <i>vs.</i> 3, 5 <i>vs.</i> 8 and 6 <i>vs.</i> 9 in Exp. 1; 3 <i>vs.</i> 4, 3 <i>vs.</i> 6 in Exp. 2) revealed choice for the largest or smallest numerical group according to the relative number that was rewarded at training. None of the continuous physical variables, including spatial frequency, were affecting archerfish performance. Results provide evidence that archerfish spontaneously use abstract relative numerical information for both small and large numbers when only numerical cues are available.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNA N6-methyladenosine modulates endothelial atherogenic responses to disturbed flow in mice</a></h4>

              
                Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in atheroprone vasculature where human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are exposed to disturbed flow. Disturbed flow is associated with vascular inflammation and focal distribution. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of epigenetic regulation in atherosclerosis progression. <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent internal modiﬁcation of eukaryotic mRNA, but its function in endothelial atherogenic progression remains unclear. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A mediates the EGFR signaling pathway during EC activation to regulate the atherosclerotic process. Oscillatory stress (OS) reduced the expression of METTL3, the primary m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase. Through m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing and functional studies, we determined that m<sup>6</sup>A mediates the mRNA decay of the vascular pathophysiology gene <i>EGFR</i> which leads to EC dysfunction. m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the <i>EGFR</i> 3'UTR accelerated its mRNA degradation. Double mutation of the <i>EGFR </i>3'UTR abolished METTL3-induced luciferase activity. Adenovirus-mediated METTL3 overexpression significantly reduced EGFR activation and endothelial dysfunction in the presence of OS. Furthermore, TSP-1, an EGFR ligand, was specifically expressed in atheroprone regions without being affected by METTL3. Inhibition of the TSP-1/EGFR axis by using shRNA and AG1478 significantly ameliorated atherogenesis. Overall, our study revealed that METTL3 alleviates endothelial atherogenic progression through m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent stabilization of <i>EGFR</i> mRNA, highlighting the important role of RNA transcriptomics in atherosclerosis regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural and functional properties of a magnesium transporter of the SLC11/NRAMP family</a></h4>

              
                Members of the ubiquitous SLC11/NRAMP family catalyze the uptake of divalent transition metal ions into cells. They have evolved to efficiently select these trace elements from a large pool of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which are both orders of magnitude more abundant, and to concentrate them in the cytoplasm aided by the cotransport of H<sup>+</sup> serving as energy source. In the present study, we have characterized a member of a distant clade of the family found in prokaryotes, termed NRMTs, that were proposed to function as transporters of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The protein transports Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup> by a mechanism that is not coupled to H<sup>+</sup>. Structures determined by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography revealed a generally similar protein architecture compared to classical NRAMPs, with a restructured ion binding site whose increased volume provides suitable interactions with ions that likely have retained much of their hydration shell.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust Working Memory through Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Working memory has long been thought to arise from sustained spiking/attractor dynamics. However, recent work has suggested that short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may help maintain attractor states over gaps in time with little or no spiking. To determine if STSP endows additional functional advantages, we trained artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without STSP to perform an object working memory task. We found that RNNs with and without STSP were both able to maintain memories over distractors presented in the middle of the memory delay. However, RNNs with STSP showed activity that was similar to that seen in the cortex of monkeys performing the same task. By contrast, RNNs without STSP showed activity that was less brain-like. Further, RNNs with STSP were more robust to noise and network degradation than RNNs without STSP. These results show that STSP can not only help maintain working memories, it also makes neural networks more robust.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Critical-like bistable dynamics in the resting-state human brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity exhibits scale-free avalanche dynamics and power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) across the nervous system. This has been thought to reflect "brain criticality", i.e., brains operating near a critical phase transition between disorder and excessive order. Neuronal activity is, however, metabolically costly and may be constrained by activity-limiting mechanisms and resource depletion, which could make the phase transition discontinuous and bistable. Observations of bistability in awake human brain activity have nonetheless remained scarce and its functional significance unclear. First, using computational modelling where bistable synchronization dynamics emerged through local positive feedback, we found bistability to occur exclusively in a regime of critical-like dynamics. We then assessed bistability in vivo with resting-state magnetoencephalography and stereo-encephalography. Bistability was a robust characteristic of cortical oscillations throughout frequency bands from {delta} (3-7 Hz) to high-{gamma} (100-225 Hz). As predicted by modelling, bistability and LRTCs were positively correlated. Importantly, while moderate levels of bistability were positively correlated with executive functioning, excessive bistability was associated with epileptic pathophysiology and predictive of local epileptogenicity. Critical bistability is thus a salient feature of spontaneous human brain dynamics in awake resting-state and is both functionally and clinically significant. These findings expand the framework of brain criticality and show that critical-like neuronal dynamics in vivo involves both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions in a frequency-, neuroanatomy-, and state-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multi-lineage cellular dysregulation and myelin loss in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Survivors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection frequently experience lingering neurological symptoms, including impairment in attention, concentration, speed of information processing and memory. This long-COVID cognitive syndrome shares many features with the syndrome of cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). Neuroinflammation, particularly microglial reactivity and consequent dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, is central to CRCI. We hypothesized that similar cellular mechanisms may contribute to the persistent neurological symptoms associated with even mild SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection. Here, we explored neuroinflammation caused by mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection, without neuroinvasion, and effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and the oligodendroglial lineage. Using a mouse model of mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection induced by intranasal SARS-CoV-2 delivery, we found white matter-selective microglial reactivity, a pattern observed in CRCI. Human brain tissue from 9 individuals with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits the same pattern of prominent white matter-selective microglial reactivity. In mice, pro-inflammatory CSF cytokines/chemokines were elevated for at least 7-weeks post-infection; among the chemokines demonstrating persistent elevation is CCL11, which is associated with impairments in neurogenesis and cognitive function. Humans experiencing long-COVID with cognitive symptoms (48 subjects) similarly demonstrate elevated CCL11 levels compared to those with long-COVID who lack cognitive symptoms (15 subjects). Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, decreased oligodendrocytes and myelin loss in subcortical white matter were evident at 1 week, and persisted until at least 7 weeks, following mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Taken together, the findings presented here illustrate striking similarities between neuropathophysiology after cancer therapy and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and elucidate cellular deficits that may contribute to lasting neurological symptoms following even mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                Neuronal axons must navigate a mechanically heterogeneous environment to reach their targets, but the biophysical mechanisms coupling mechanosensation, growth, and branching are not fully understood. Here, we show that local changes in membrane tension propagate along axons at approximately 20 m/s, more than 1000-fold faster than in other non-motile cells. This rapid and long-range mechanical signaling mediates bidirectional competition between axonal branch initiation and growth cone extension. Our data suggest a mechanism by which mechanical cues at one part of a growing axon can affect growth dynamics remotely.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glucocorticoid receptor dysregulation underlies 5-HT2A receptor-dependent synaptic and behavioral deficits in a mouse neurodevelopmental disorder model</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal environmental insults increase the risk of neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions in the offspring. Structural modifications of dendritic spines are central to brain development and plasticity. Using maternal immune activation (MIA) as a rodent model of prenatal environmental insult, previous results have reported dendritic structural deficits in the frontal cortex. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying MIA-induced synaptic structural alterations in the offspring. Using prenatal (E12.5) injection with poly-(I:C) as a mouse MIA model, we show that upregulation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is at least in part responsible for some of the effects of prenatal insults on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and sensorimotor gating processes. Mechanistically, we report that this upregulation of frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression is associated with MIA-induced reduction of nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, consequently, a decrease in the enrichment of GR at the 5-HT2AR promoter. The translational significance of these preclinical findings is supported by data in postmortem human brain samples suggesting dysregulated nuclear GR translocation in frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. Repeated (twice a day for 4 days) corticosterone administration augmented frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression and reduced GR binding to the 5-HT2AR promoter. However, virally (AAV)-mediated augmentation of GR function reduced frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression and improved sensorimotor gating processes via 5-HT2AR. Together, these data support a negative regulatory relationship between GR signaling and 5-HT2AR expression in mouse frontal cortex that may carry implications for the pathophysiology underlying 5-HT2AR dysregulation in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of non-human primates. However, how these species with their small brains achieve such feats remains elusive. Recent studies suggest that cognitive capabilities could be based on the total numbers of telencephalic neurons. Here we extend this hypothesis further and posit that especially high neuron counts in associative pallial areas drive flexible, complex cognition. If true, avian species like corvids should specifically accumulate neurons in the avian associative areas meso- and nidopallium. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed the neuronal composition of telencephalic areas in corvids and non-corvids (chicken, pigeons, and ostriches - the species with the largest bird brain). The overall number of pallial neurons in corvids was much higher than in chicken and pigeons and comparable to those of ostriches. However, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids and, in correlation with these associative areas, the corvid subpallium also contained high neuron numbers. These findings support our hypothesis that large absolute numbers of associative pallial neurons contribute to cognitive flexibility and complexity and are key to explain why crows are smart. Since meso/nidopallial and subpallial areas scale jointly, it is conceivable that associative pallio-striatal loops play a similar role in executive decision-making as described in primates.</p>

<p>Spinal A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>3</sub>AR) activation by MRS5698 transiently restores morphine antinociception in opioid-tolerant rats. Intrathecal injection of MRS5698 (“on”) on days 8, 9, 12, and 13 reinstates morphine antinociception. This response is blocked by A<sub>3</sub>AR antagonist MRS1523 and absent when intrathecal vehicle (“off”) is administered on days 10 and 11.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are potent analgesics, but their pain-relieving effects diminish with repeated use. The reduction in analgesic potency is a hallmark of opioid analgesic tolerance, which hampers opioid pain therapy. In the central nervous system, opioid analgesia is critically modulated by adenosine, a purine nucleoside implicated in the beneficial and detrimental actions of opioid medications. Here, we focus on the A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>3</sub>AR) in opioid analgesic tolerance. Intrathecal administration of the A<sub>3</sub>AR agonist MRS5698 with daily systemic morphine in male rats attenuated the reduction in morphine antinociception over 7 days. In rats with established morphine tolerance, intrathecal MRS5698 partially restored the antinociceptive effects of morphine. However, when MRS5698 was discontinued, these animals displayed a reduced antinociceptive response to morphine. Our results suggest that MRS5698 acutely and transiently potentiates morphine antinociception in tolerant rats. By contrast, in morphine-naïve rats MRS5698 treatment did not impact thermal nociceptive threshold or affect antinociceptive response to a single injection of morphine. Furthermore, we found that morphine-induced adenosine release in cerebrospinal fluid was blunted in tolerant animals, but total spinal A<sub>3</sub>AR expression was not affected. Collectively, our findings indicate that spinal A<sub>3</sub>AR activation acutely potentiates morphine antinociception in the opioid tolerant state.</p>

     alt="Endogenous µ-opioid receptor activity in the lateral and capsular subdivisions of the right central nucleus of the amygdala prevents chronic postoperative pain"/>
<p>Incision causes neuronal sensitization and acute postoperative pain. After injury resolves, endogenous µ-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suppresses latent pain sensitization. Inhibiting MOR signaling, either systemically or within the CeA, unmasks latent sensitization, leading to reinstatement of hypersensitivity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tissue injury induces a long-lasting latent sensitization (LS) of spinal nociceptive signaling that is kept in remission by an opposing µ-opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity. To test the hypothesis that supraspinal sites become engaged, we induced hindpaw inflammation, waited 3 weeks for mechanical hypersensitivity to resolve, and then injected the opioid receptor inhibitors naltrexone, CTOP or β-funaltrexamine subcutaneously, and/or into the cerebral ventricles. Intracerebroventricular injection of each inhibitor reinstated hypersensitivity and produced somatic signs of withdrawal, indicative of LS and endogenous opioid dependence, respectively. In naïve or sham controls, systemic naloxone (3 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion, and systemic naltrexone (3 mg/kg) increased Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In LS animals tested 3 weeks after plantar incision, systemic naltrexone reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity and produced an even greater increase in Fos than in sham controls, particularly in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA. One third of Fos+ profiles co-expressed protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), and 35% of PKCδ neurons co-expressed tdTomato+ in <i>Oprm1<sup>Cre</sup>
</i>::tdTomato transgenic mice. CeA microinjection of naltrexone (1 µg) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity only in male mice and did not produce signs of somatic withdrawal. Intra-CeA injection of the MOR-selective inhibitor CTAP (300 ng) reinstated hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. We conclude that MORs in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA prevent the transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are potent analgesics used to manage pain in both young and old, but the increased use in the pregnant population has significant individual and societal implications. Infants dependent on opioids, either through maternal or iatrogenic exposure, undergo neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), where they may experience withdrawal symptoms ranging from mild to severe. We present a detailed and original review of NOWS caused by maternal opioid exposure (mNOWS) and iatrogenic opioid intake (iNOWS). While these two entities have been assessed entirely separately, recognition and treatment of the clinical manifestations of NOWS overlap. Neonatal risk factors such as age, genetic predisposition, drug type, and clinical factors like type of opioid, cumulative dose of opioid exposure, and disease status affect the incidence of both mNOWS and iNOWS, as well as their severity. Recognition of withdrawal is dependent on clinical assessment of symptoms, and the use of clinical assessment tools designed to determine the need for pharmacotherapy. Treatment of NOWS relies on a combination of non-pharmacological therapies and pharmacological options. Long-term consequences of opioids and NOWS continue to generate controversy, with some evidence of anatomic brain changes, but conflicting animal and human clinical evidence of significant cognitive or behavioral impacts on school-age children. We highlight the current knowledge on clinically relevant recognition, treatment, and consequences of NOWS, and identify new advances in clinical management of the neonate. This review brings a unique clinical perspective and critically analyzes gaps between the clinical problem and our preclinical understanding of NOWS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cellular and behavioral basis of cannabinioid and opioid interactions: Implications for opioid dependence and withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post-receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward-seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction-related processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Engaging endogenous opioid circuits in pain affective processes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pervasive use of opioid compounds for pain relief is rooted in their utility as one of the most effective therapeutic strategies for providing analgesia. While the detrimental side effects of these compounds have significantly contributed to the current opioid epidemic, opioids still provide millions of patients with reprieve from the relentless and agonizing experience of pain. The human experience of pain has long recognized the perceived unpleasantness entangled with a unique sensation that is immediate and identifiable from the first-person subjective vantage point as “painful.” From this phenomenological perspective, how is it that opioids interfere with pain perception? Evidence from human lesion, neuroimaging, and preclinical functional neuroanatomy approaches is sculpting the view that opioids predominately alleviate the affective or inferential appraisal of nociceptive neural information. Thus, opioids weaken pain-associated unpleasantness rather than modulate perceived sensory qualities. Here, we discuss the historical theories of pain to demonstrate how modern neuroscience is revisiting these ideas to deconstruct the brain mechanisms driving the emergence of aversive pain perceptions. We further detail how targeting opioidergic signaling within affective or emotional brain circuits remains a strong avenue for developing targeted pharmacological and gene-therapy analgesic treatments that might reduce the dependence on current clinical opioid options.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prevalence of cancer-related pain is 64% among patients with metastatic, advanced, or terminal cancer, 59% among patients undergoing anticancer treatment, and 33% among patients who completed curative treatment. According to the World Health Organization cancer pain relief guidelines, opioid analgesics are the mainstay analgesic therapy in addition to conventional first-step analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. The indications for strong opioids have recently been expanded to include mild-to-moderate pain in addition to moderate-to-severe pain. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines emphasize that realistic expectations should be weighed against potential serious harm from opioids, rather than relying on the unrealized long-term benefits of these drugs. Therefore, treatment strategies for both cancer-related chronic or acute pain have been unfortunately deviated from opioid analgesics. The barriers hindering adequate cancer-related pain management with opioid analgesics are related to the inadequate knowledge of opioid analgesics (e.g., effective dose, adverse effects, and likelihood of addiction or tolerance). To achieve adequate opioid availability, these barriers should be overcome in a clinically suitable manner. Genetic assessments could play an important role in overcoming challenges in opioid management. To balance the improvement in opioid availability and the prevention of opioid misuse and addiction, the following two considerations concerning opioids and genetic polymorphisms warrant attention: (A) pain severity, opioid sensitivity, and opioid tolerance; and (B) vulnerability to opioid dependence and addiction.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tolerance and hyperalgesia associated with chronic exposure to morphine are major limitations in the clinical management of chronic pain. At a cellular level, neuronal signaling can in part account for these undesired side effects, but unknown mechanisms mediated by central nervous system glial cells are likely also involved. Here we applied data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to perform a deep proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of how human astrocytes responds to opioid stimulation. We unveil time- and dose-dependent effects induced by morphine and its major active metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide that converging on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. We also find that especially longer exposure to M3G leads to significant dysregulation of biological pathways linked to extracellular matrix organization, antigen presentation, cell adhesion, and glutamate homeostasis, which are crucial for neuron– and leukocyte–astrocyte interactions.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cancer patients may experience symptom clusters, including chemotherapy-induced (CI) gut toxicity (CIGT) and cognitive impairment. Analgesic selection for pain associated with CIGT is difficult as opioids induce glial reactivity and unwanted side effects. This study quantified central glial reactivity and proinflammatory effects in rats with CIGT using three mechanistically different analgesics. Regional adaptations were indicative of immune-to-brain signaling routes. Utilizing a 5-fluorouracil-induced GT (5IGT) rat model and analgesic intervention (carprofen (CAR), buprenorphine (BUP), and tramadol (TRAM)), spinal and brain neuroimmune modulation was examined via microglial, astrocyte, and proinflammatory (cluster of differentiation molecule 11b; CD11b, glial fibrillary associated protein; GFAP, and interleukin-1 beta; IL1β) reactivity marker expression changes by western blot analysis. 5IGT significantly increased thoracic GFAP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and IL-1β (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) expression, CAR and BUP ameliorated these effects. BUP and TRAM with 5-FU synergistically increased hippocampal GFAP expression. CAR administered with 5IGT significantly elevated hippocampal and thoracic CD11b expression levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The neuroimmune responses observed in this study suggest activation of peripheral-to-central immune signaling pathways. We speculate that the opioid-induced hippocampal changes inferred a humorally mediated mechanism, whereas thoracic neuroimmune modifications indicated activation of an indirect neural route. Although TRAM ameliorated 5IGT-intestinal inflammation, this opioid presents complications relating to bodyweight and regional glial dysregulation (neuroinflammation) and may not be optimal in the management of pain associated with 5IGT. The chemotherapy-induced gut-derived neuroimmune consequences observed suggest a potential mechanistic contribution to central components of the cancer symptom cluster experience, while the opioid-related glial changes have implications for optimal pain management in this setting warranting further investigation.</p>

<p>Subanalgesic morphine augmentsfentanyl analgesia via MOP and DOP interactions that increase G proteinactivation unrelated to MOP receptor internalization.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are commonly used for the treatment of postoperative and post-traumatic pain; however, their therapeutic effectiveness is limited by undesirable and life-threatening side effects. Researchers have long attempted to develop opioid co-administration therapies that enhance analgesia, but the complexity of opioid analgesia and our incomplete mechanistic understanding has made this a daunting task. We discovered that subanalgesic morphine doses (100 ng/kg–10 µg/kg) augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl (20 µg/kg) following subcutaneous drug co-administration to male rats. In addition, administration of equivalent drug ratios to naïve rat spinal cord membranes induced a twofold increase in G protein activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis remained unchanged. We demonstrated that these behavioral and biochemical effects were mediated by the delta opioid receptor (DOP). Subanalgesic doses of the DOP-selective agonist SNC80 also augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl. Furthermore, co-administration of the DOP antagonist naltrindole with both fentanyl-morphine and fentanyl-SNC80 combinations prevented augmentation of both analgesia and G protein activation. The mu opioid receptor (MOP) antagonist cyprodime did not block augmentation. Confocal microscopy of the substantia gelatinosa of rats treated with fentanyl, subanalgesic morphine, or this combination showed that changes in MOP internalization did not account for augmentation effects. Together, these findings suggest that augmentation of fentanyl analgesia by subanalgesic morphine is mediated by increased G protein activation resulting from a synergistic interaction between or heterodimerization of MOPs and DOPs. This finding is of great therapeutic significance because it suggests a strategy for the development of DOP-selective ligands that can enhance the therapeutic index of clinically used MOP drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Differential barcoding of opioid receptors trafficking</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, studies have highlighted the δ-opioid receptor (DOPr) as a promising therapeutic target for chronic pain management. While exhibiting milder undesired effects than most currently prescribed opioids, its specific agonists elicit effective analgesic responses in numerous animal models of chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic, diabetic, and cancer-related pain. However, as compared with the extensively studied μ-opioid receptor, the molecular mechanisms governing its trafficking remain elusive. Recent advances have denoted several significant particularities in the regulation of DOPr intracellular routing, setting it apart from the other members of the opioid receptor family. Although they share high homology, each opioid receptor subtype displays specific amino acid patterns potentially involved in the regulation of its trafficking. These precise motifs or “barcodes” are selectively recognized by regulatory proteins and therefore dictate several aspects of the itinerary of a receptor, including its anterograde transport, internalization, recycling, and degradation. With a specific focus on the regulation of DOPr trafficking, this review will discuss previously reported, as well as potential novel trafficking barcodes within the opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ opioid peptide receptors, and their impact in determining distinct interactomes and physiological responses.</p>

<p>Cartoon depicting evolution of endogenous opioid systems. Our findings in this paper show the identification of an authentic mammalian-like endogenous opioid system in the Pacific Hagfish with no evidence for opioid systems in invertebrate genomes</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The actions of endogenous opioids and nociceptin/orphanin FQ are mediated by four homologous G protein-coupled receptors that constitute the opioid receptor family. However, little is known about opioid systems in cyclostomes (living jawless fish) and how opioid systems might have evolved from invertebrates. Here, we leveraged de novo transcriptome and low-coverage whole-genome assembly in the Pacific hagfish (<i>Eptatretus stoutii</i>) to identify and characterize the first full-length coding sequence for a functional opioid receptor in a cyclostome. Additionally, we define two novel endogenous opioid precursors in this species that predict several novel opioid peptides. Bioinformatic analysis shows no closely related opioid receptor genes in invertebrates with regard either to the genomic organization or to conserved opioid receptor-specific sequences that are common in all vertebrates. Furthermore, no proteins analogous to vertebrate opioid precursors could be identified by genomic searches despite previous claims of protein or RNA-derived sequences in several invertebrate species. The presence of an expressed orthologous receptor and opioid precursors in the Pacific hagfish confirms that a functional opioid system was likely present in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates some 550 million years ago, earlier than all previous authenticated accounts. We discuss the premise that the cyclostome and vertebrate opioid systems evolved from invertebrate systems concerned with antimicrobial defense and speculate that the high concentrations of opioid precursors in tissues such as the testes, gut, and activated immune cells are key remnants of this evolutionary role.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thousands of individuals die each year from opioid-related overdoses. While naloxone (Narcan®) is currently the most widely employed treatment to reverse opioid toxicity, high or repeated doses of this antidote often lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). We hypothesized that a slow linear release of naloxone from a nanoparticle would induce fewer POW symptoms compared to high-dose free naloxone. First, we measured the acute impact of covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal-<i>c</i>NPs) on morphine-induced antinociception in the hotplate test. We found that Nal-<i>c</i>NP treatment blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine within 15 min of administration. Next, we tested the impact of Nal-<i>c</i>NPs on POW symptoms in male morphine-dependent mice. To induce morphine dependence, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) twice-daily for six consecutive days. On day 7 mice received 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) injections 2 hr prior to receiving treatment of either unmodified free naloxone, a high or low dose of Nal-<i>c</i>NP, empty nanoparticle (<i>c</i>NP-empty), or saline. Behavior was analyzed for 0–6 hr followed by 24 and 48 hr time points after treatment. As expected, free naloxone induced a significant increase in POW behavior in morphine-dependent mice compared to saline-treated mice upon free naloxone administration. In comparison, reduced POW behavior was observed with both doses of Nal-<i>c</i>NP. Side effects of Nal-<i>c</i>NP on locomotion and fecal boli production were measured and no significant side-effects were observed. Overall, our data show that sustained release of naloxone from a covalent nanoparticle does not induce severe POW symptoms in morphine-dependent mice.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Latest studies have revealed that pain negatively impacts on reward processing and motivation leading to negative affective states and stress. These states not only reduce quality of life of patients by increasing the appearance of psychiatric comorbidities, but also have an important impact on vulnerability to drug abuse, including alcohol. In fact, clinical, epidemiological but also preclinical studies have revealed that the presence of pain is closely related to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). All this evidence suggests that pain is a factor that increases the risk of suffering AUD, predicting heavy drinking behavior and relapse drinking in those patients with a previous history of AUD. The negative consequences of chronic pain and its impact on stress and AUD are likely mediated by alterations in the central nervous system, especially in the stress and reward systems. Therefore, pain and stress impact on dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway can lead to an increase in drug abuse liability. In this mini review we analyze the interaction between pain, stress, and alcohol addiction, and how dynamic changes in the kappa opioid system might play a crucial role in the development of compulsive alcohol drinking in chronic pain patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Given the ubiquitous nature of opioids in the treatment of pain, it is an interesting paradox that this class of medications also represents one of the least understood components of clinical pain medicine. For many years, there has been intense interest in the mechanisms of opioid activity, but this has not resulted in a corresponding increase in convincing clinical data. This review focuses primarily on the evidence surrounding the long-term use of opioids in chronic pain, but discussions of this research are often conflated with the very different data governing acute and cancer-related pain, where evidence of efficacy is clearer. It is therefore important to clarify the evidence-based indications for opioid therapy. There remains very little evidence that opioids improve function or quality of life beyond 3 months in people with chronic pain conditions. In all three patient populations, the development of tolerance, dependence, hyperalgesia and withdrawal are key phenomena that affect the patient experience, and in particular the decision to remain on opioids in the long term. This is a common thread that connects the opioid literature in all of these spheres, and justifies the burgeoning interest in these phenomena in the basic science literature. There is an urgent need to address these negative consequences of opioid use, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit that opioids can offer.</p>

<p>The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is notable for its robust sex difference, with females being less responsive to KOR agonists than males. In this study, we use two genetic mouse models (four core genotype and XY*) to isolate the sex chromosome and gonadal hormone contribution to this observed sex difference. We determine that KOR analgesia varies with the number of X chromosomes. The presence or absence of the Y chromosome or gonadal hormones had minimal influence. This study determines that genes on the X chromosome contribute to the sex difference in KOR function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists produce robust analgesia with minimal abuse liability and are considered promising pharmacological agents to manage chronic pain and itch. The KOR system is also notable for robust differences between the sexes, with females exhibiting lower analgesic response than males. Sexually dimorphic traits can be due to either the influence of gonadal hormones during development or adulthood, or due to the complement of genes expressed on the X or Y chromosome. Previous studies examining sex differences in KOR antinociception have relied on surgical or pharmacological manipulation of the gonads to determine whether sex hormones influence KOR function. While there are conflicting reports whether gonadal hormones influence KOR function, no study has examined these effects in context with sex chromosomes. Here, we use two genetic mouse models, the four core genotypes and XY*, to isolate the chromosomal and hormonal contributions to sex differences in KOR analgesia. Mice were treated with systemic KOR agonist (U50,488H) and thermal analgesia measured in the tail withdrawal assay. We found that KOR antinociception was influenced predominantly by the number of the X chromosomes. These data suggest that the dose and/or parental imprint on X gene(s) contribute significantly to the sexually dimorphism in KOR analgesia.</p>

     alt="The CRF1 receptor mediates social behavior deficits induced by opiate withdrawal"/>
<p>Sociability deficits and aggressive behavior are common clinical features of opioid use disorders. Herein, genetic inactivation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF<sub>1</sub>) eliminated social approach deficits or hostility-linked social approach in morphine-withdrawn female or male mice, respectively. Thus, reduction of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor activity might ameliorate sociability of opiate-dependent patients.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Poor sociability and aggressive behavior are key clinical features of opioid use disorders. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system may mediate behavioral effects of substances of abuse <i>but</i> its implication in substance-induced social behavior deficits and outward-directed hostility remains largely unknown. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. The present study aimed at understanding the role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social and aggressive behavior induced by withdrawal from repeated opiate administration. Thus, wild-type (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+), CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−), and null mutant (CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−) female and male mice were treated with saline or escalating doses of morphine (20-100 mg/kg, i.p.) during six consecutive days and tested in the three-chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar same-sex conspecific vs. an object) 7 days after the last administration. Moreover, aggressive biting behavior toward the unfamiliar conspecific was assessed during the three-chamber test. Opiate withdrawal disrupted sociability in CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+ and CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−, <i>but not</i> in CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, female mice, without affecting aggressive biting behavior in any genotype. In contrast, opiate withdrawal did not affect sociability <i>but</i> increased aggressive biting behavior in male mice, independently of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor-deficiency. Nevertheless, in opiate-withdrawn CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+, <i>but not</i> CRF<sub>1</sub>+/− and CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, male mice, sociability directly correlated with aggressive biting behavior, suggesting a role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in hostility-linked social approach. These findings demonstrate the implication of the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social behavior deficits associated with repeated opiate administration and withdrawal, revealing a new potential target for the treatment of opioid use disorders.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A major challenge in medicine is developing potent pain therapies without the adverse effects of opiates. Neuroinflammation and in particular microglial activation have been shown to contribute to these effects. However, the implication of the microglial mu opioid receptor (MOR) is not known. We developed a novel conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line, wherein MOR is deleted in microglia. Morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed in both sexes in cKO mice in the hot plate assay. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) as measured in the tail immersion assay was abolished in male cKO mice, and physical dependence to morphine as assessed by naloxone-induced withdrawal was attenuated in female cKO mice. Our results show a sex-dependent contribution of microglial MOR in morphine analgesic tolerance, OIH, and physical dependence. In conclusion, our data suggest that blockade of microglial MOR could represent a therapeutic target for opiate analgesia without the opiate adverse effects.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heroin, a mu agonist, acts through the mu opioid receptor. The mu opioid receptor gene, <i>OPRM1,</i> undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating an array of splice variants that are conserved from rodent to humans. Increasing evidence suggests that these <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants are pharmacologically important in mediating various actions of mu opioids, including analgesia, tolerance, physical dependence, rewarding behavior, as well as addiction. In the present study, we examine expression of the <i>OPRM1</i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the major brain regions involved in decision-making and drug-seeking behaviors, of male human heroin abusers and male rats that developed stable heroin-seeking behavior using an intravenous heroin self-administration (SA) model. The results show similar expression profiles among multiple <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants in both human control subjects and saline control rats, illustrating conservation of <i>OPRM1</i> alternative splicing from rodent to humans. Moreover, the expressions of several <i>OPRM1</i> splice variant mRNAs were dysregulated in the postmortem mPFCs from heroin abusers compared to the control subjects. Similar patterns were observed in the rat heroin SA model. These findings suggest potential roles of the <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin SA model.</p>

<p>Voluntary wheel running was assessed after peripheral nerve injury. Active phase running distance and speed are also measured in response to morphine alone, or in combination with antagonists of either P2X7R or TLR4.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The present series of studies examine the impact of systemically administered therapeutics on peripheral nerve injury (males; unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury [CCI])-induced suppression of voluntary wheel running, across weeks after dosing cessation. Following CCI, active phase running distance and speed are suppressed throughout the 7-week observation period. A brief course of morphine, however, increased active phase running distance and speed throughout this same period, an effect apparent only in sham rats. For CCI rats, systemic co-administration of morphine with antagonists of either P2X7 (A438079) or TLR4 ((+)-naloxone) (receptors critical to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and consequent inflammatory cascades) returned running behavior of CCI rats to that of shams through 5+ weeks after dosing ceased. This is a striking difference in effect compared to our prior CCI allodynia results using systemic morphine plus intrathecal delivery of these same antagonists, wherein a sustained albeit partial suppression of neuropathic pain was observed. This may point to actions of the systemic drugs at multiple sites along the neuraxis, modulating injury-induced, inflammasome-mediated effects at the injured sciatic nerve and/or dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and potentially higher levels. Given that our data to date point to morphine amplifying neuroinflammatory processes put into motion by nerve injury, it is intriguing to speculate that co-administration of TLR4 and/or P2X7 antagonists can intervene in these inflammatory processes in a beneficial way. That is, that systemic administration of such compounds may suppress inflammatory damage at multiple sites, rapidly and persistently returning neuropathic animals to sham levels of response.</p>

     alt="Retrospectively assessed subjective effects of initial opioid use differ between opioid misusers with opioid use disorder (OUD) and those who never progressed to OUD: Data from a pilot and a replication sample"/>
<p>Subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were assessed in two samples of opioid misusers that included low-level users who never met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD) and heavier users with OUD. In both samples, OUD+ individuals reported greater euphoria, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms (replication sample data are displayed).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Attempts to identify opioid users with increased risk of escalating to opioid use disorder (OUD) have had limited success. Retrospectively assessed subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were compared in a pilot sample of opioid misusers (nonmedical use ≤60 times lifetime) who had never met criteria for OUD (<i>N</i> = 14) and heroin-addicted individuals in treatment for OUD (<i>N</i> = 15). Relative to opioid misusers without a lifetime OUD diagnosis, individuals with OUD reported greater euphoria and other positive emotions, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms. Consistent with these findings, proxy Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) Amphetamine Group, and Morphine Benzedrine Group scale mean item scores were significantly higher in those with OUD. Replication was attempted in opioid misusers with (<i>N</i> = 25) and without OUD (<i>N</i> = 25) who were assessed as part of an ongoing genetic study. We observed similar significant between-group differences in individual subjective effect items and ARCI scale mean item scores in the replication sample. We, thus confirm findings from prior reports that retrospectively assessed subjective responses to initial opioid exposure differ significantly between opioid users who do, and do not, progress to OUD. Our report extends these findings in comparisons limited to opioid misusers. Additional research will be necessary to examine prospectively whether the assessment of subjective effects after initial use has predictive utility in the identification of individuals more likely to progress to OUD.</p>

     alt="Delta opioid receptor activation modulates affective pain and modality-specific pain hypersensitivity associated with chronic neuropathic pain"/>
<p>Delta opioid receptor agonist potency and efficacy are enhanced chronic neuropathic pain states. Activation of these receptors produces negative reinforcement in pain animals, demonstrating the importance of this receptor in its ability to modulate the tonic aversive component of pain. Neuropathic pain engages enkephalin circuits that when blocked exaggerates the affective component of pain. One of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased activity of delta opioid receptors is trafficking of receptors to cell membranes of deep dorsal horn spinal neurons. Finally, presynaptic and postsynaptic delta opioid receptors modulate thermal and mechanical nociception, respectively.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists alleviate nociceptive behaviors in various chronic pain models, including neuropathic pain, while having minimal effect on sensory thresholds in the absence of injury. The mechanisms underlying nerve injury-induced enhancement of DOR function are unclear. We used a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) model of neuropathic pain to assess changes in the function and localization of DORs in mice and rats. Intrathecal administration of DOR agonists reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The dose-dependent thermal antinociceptive effects of DOR agonists were shifted to the left in PNI rats. Administration of DOR agonists produced a conditioned place preference in PNI, but not in sham, animals, whereas the DOR antagonist naltrindole produced a place aversion in PNI, but not in sham, mice, suggesting the engagement of endogenous DOR activity in suppressing pain associated with the injury. GTPγS autoradiography revealed an increase in DOR function in the dorsal spinal cord, ipsilateral to PNI. Immunogold electron microscopy and <i>in vivo</i> fluorescent agonist assays were used to assess changes in the ultrastructural localization of DORs in the spinal dorsal horn. In shams, DORs were primarily localized within intracellular compartments. PNI significantly increased the cell surface expression of DORs within lamina IV-V dendritic profiles. Using neonatal capsaicin treatment, we identified that DOR agonist-induced thermal antinociception was mediated via receptors expressed on primary afferent sensory neurons but did not alter mechanical thresholds. These data reveal that the regulation of DORs following PNI and suggest the importance of endogenous activation of DORs in regulating chronic pain states.</p>

<p>Blockade of peripheral opioid receptors with the peripherally restricted antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), had no effect on acute morphine antinociception or development of tolerance.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are effective analgesics in the management of severe pain. However, tolerance, leading to dose escalation and adverse effects are significant limiting factors in their use. The role of peripheral opioid receptors in analgesia has been discussed especially under inflammatory conditions. The results from pharmacological and conditional knockout studies together do not provide a clear picture of the contribution of peripheral opioid receptors on antinociceptive tolerance and this needs to be evaluated. Therefore, we studied whether the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), could prevent morphine tolerance without attenuating the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 7 days with increasing subcutaneous doses of morphine (5–30 mg/kg) and were coadministered saline, MNTX (0.5 or 2 mg/kg), or naltrexone (NTX; 2 mg/kg). Nociception was assessed with tail-flick, hotplate, and von Frey tests. Morphine, MNTX, and NTX concentrations in the plasma, brain, and spinal cord were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In acute coadministration, NTX, but not MNTX, abolished the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine in all nociceptive tests. The antinociceptive tolerance after repeated morphine administration was also prevented by NTX but not by MNTX. MNTX penetrated to the spinal cord and the brain to some extent after repeated administration. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.</p>

     alt="Blockade of dopamine D1 receptors in male rats disrupts morphine reward in pain naïve but not in chronic pain states"/>
<p>We tested the hypothesis that the neural mechanism of opiate reward are dissociable in pain-naïve and chronic pain states. Using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, both CCI and sham rats displayed a CPP to morphine. The effect was blocked by dopamine D1 receptor antagonism but only in pain-naïve rats, adding to evidence that chronic pain modifies brain reward circuits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rewarding effect of opiates is mediated through dissociable neural systems in drug naïve and drug-dependent states. Neuroadaptations associated with chronic drug use are similar to those produced by chronic pain, suggesting that opiate reward could also involve distinct mechanisms in chronic pain and pain-naïve states. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of dopamine (DA) antagonism on morphine reward in a rat model of neuropathic pain.Neuropathic pain was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats through chronic constriction (CCI) of the sciatic nerve; reward was assessed in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in separate groups at early (4-8 days post-surgery) and late (11-15 days post-surgery) phases of neuropathic pain. Minimal effective doses of morphine that produced a CPP in early and late phases of neuropathic pain were 6 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg respectively. The DA D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, blocked a morphine CPP in sham, but not CCI, rats at a higher dose (0.5 mg/kg), but had no effect at a lower dose (0.1 mg/kg). The DA D2 receptor antagonist, eticlopride (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg), had no effect on a morphine CPP in sham or CCI rats, either in early or late phases of neuropathic pain. In the CPP paradigm, morphine reward involves DA D1 mechanisms in pain-naïve but not chronic pain states. This could reflect increased sensitivity to drug effects in pain versus no pain conditions and/or differential mediation of opiate reward in these two states.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Coincident with the opioid epidemic in the United States has been a dramatic increase in the number of children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a form of withdrawal resulting from opioid exposure during pregnancy. Many research efforts on NAS have focused on short-term care, including acute symptom treatment and weaning of the infants off their drug dependency prior to authorizing their release. However, investigations into the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure (POE) on brain development, from the cellular to the behavioral level, have not been as frequent. Given the importance of the perinatal period for human brain development, opioid-induced disturbances in the formation and function of nascent synaptic networks and glia have the potential to impact brain connectivity and cognition long after the drug supply is cutoff shortly after birth. In this review, we will summarize the current state of NAS research, bringing together findings from human studies and preclinical animal models to highlight what is known about how POE can induce significant, prolonged deficits in brain structure and function. With rates of NAS continuing to rise, particularly in regions that already face substantial socioeconomic challenges, we speculate as to the most promising avenues for future research to alleviate this growing multigenerational threat.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Therapeutic potentials of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the identification of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) as an endogenous ligand for the NOP receptor, ample evidence has revealed unique functional profiles of the N/OFQ-NOP receptor system. NOP receptors are expressed in key neural substrates involved in pain and reward modulation. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), NOP receptor activation effectively exerts antinociception and anti-hypersensitivity at the spinal and supraspinal levels. Moreover, NOP receptor activation inhibits dopaminergic transmission and synergistically enhances mu-opioid peptide (MOP) receptor-mediated analgesia. In this article, we have discussed the functional profiles of ligands with dual NOP and MOP receptor agonist activities and highlight their optimal functional efficacy for pain relief and drug abuse treatment. Through coactivation of NOP and MOP receptors, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor “partial” agonists (e.g., AT-121, BU08028, and BU10038) reveal a wider therapeutic window with fewer side effects. These newly developed ligands potently induce antinociception without MOP receptor agonist-associated side effects such as abuse potential, respiratory depression, itching sensation, and physical dependence. In addition, in both rodent and NHP models, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor agonists can attenuate reward processing and/or the reinforcing effects of opioids and other abused drugs. While a mixed NOP/opioid receptor “full” agonist cebranopadol is undergoing clinical trials, bifunctional NOP/MOP “partial” agonists exhibit promising therapeutic profiles in translational NHP models for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse. This class of drugs demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation, indicating a greater potential for future development.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This mini-review presents the view that contemporary approaches to stem the tide of opioid overdose deaths are insufficient to make a significant impact. Instead, a focus on the opioid receptor as the ultimate molecular target to directly abolish opioid overdose death is explored. After identifying the key brainstem neurons that control respiration which are inhibited by opioid drugs, genetic techniques targeting the <i>mu</i> opioid receptor are detailed which prevent opioid overdose. This receptor-centric solution for the opioid overdose epidemic can be realized with existing technology and, with sufficient effort, could enter clinical trials within 5 to 10 years.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-adaptive Unsupervised Auditory Attention Decoding Using EEG-based Stimulus Reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                The goal of auditory attention decoding (AAD) is to determine to which speaker out of multiple competing speakers a listener is attending based on the brain signals recorded via, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG). AAD algorithms are a fundamental building block of so-called neuro-steered hearing devices that would allow identifying the speaker that should be amplified based on the brain activity. A common approach is to train a subject-specific decoder that reconstructs the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal. However, training this decoder requires a dedicated 'ground-truth' EEG recording of the subject under test, during which the attended speaker is known. Furthermore, this decoder remains fixed during operation and can thus not adapt to changing conditions and situations. Therefore, we propose an online time-adaptive unsupervised stimulus reconstruction method that continuously and automatically adapts over time when new EEG and audio data are streaming in. The adaptive decoder does not require ground-truth attention labels obtained from a training session with the end-user, and instead can be initialized with a generic subject-independent decoder or even completely random values. We propose two different implementations: a sliding window and recursive implementation, which we extensively validate based on multiple performance metrics on three independent datasets. We show that the proposed time-adaptive unsupervised decoder outperforms a time-invariant supervised decoder, representing an important step towards practically applicable AAD algorithms for neuro-steered hearing devices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frequency Effects on Spelling Error Recognition: An ERP Study</a></h4>

              
                Spelling errors are ubiquitous in all writing systems. Most studies exploring spelling errors focused on the phonological plausibility of errors. However, unlike typical pseudohomophones, spelling errors occur in naturally produced written language with variable frequencies. We investigated the time course of recognition of the most frequent orthographic errors in Russian (error in an unstressed vowel at the root) and the effect of word frequency on this process. During ERP recording, 26 native Russian speakers silently read high-frequency correctly spelled words, low-frequency correctly spelled words, high-frequency words with errors, and low-frequency words with errors. The amplitude of P200 was more positive for correctly spelled words than for misspelled words and did not depend on the frequency of the words. Word frequency affected spelling recognition in the later stages of word processing (350-700 ms): high-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater P300 than high-frequency correctly spelled words, and low-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater N400 than low-frequency correctly spelled words. We observe spelling effects in the same time window for both the P300 and N400, which may reflect temporal overlap between mainly categorization processes based on orthographic properties for high-frequency words and phonological processes for low-frequency words. We concluded that two independent pathways can be active simultaneously during spelling recognition: one reflects mainly orthographic processing of high-frequency words and the other is the phonological processing of low-frequency words. Our findings suggest that these pathways are associated with different ERP components. Therefore, our results complement existing reading models and demonstrate that the neuronal underpinnings of spelling error recognition during reading depend on word frequency.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Noise introduced in the human nervous system from cellular to systems levels can have a major impact on signal processing. Using transcranial stimulation, electrical noise can be added to cortical circuits to modulate neuronal activity and enhance function in the healthy brain and in neurologic patients. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a promising technique that is less well understood than other non-invasive neuromodulatory methods. The aim of the present scoping review is to collate published evidence on the effects of electrical noise at the cellular, systems, and behavioral levels, and discuss how this emerging method might be harnessed to augment perceptual and motor functioning of the human nervous system. Online databases were used to identify papers published in 2008&ndash;2021 using tRNS in humans, from which we identified 70 publications focusing on sensory and motor function. Additionally, we interpret the existing evidence by referring to articles investigating the effects of noise stimulation in animal and subcellular models. We review physiological and behavioral findings of tRNS-induced offline after-effects and acute online benefits which manifest immediately when tRNS is applied to sensory or motor cortices. We link these results to evidence showing that activity of voltage-gated sodium ion channels might be an important cellular substrate for mediating these tRNS effects. We argue that tRNS might make neural signal transmission and processing within neuronal populations more efficient, which could contribute to both (1) offline after-effects in the form of a prolonged increase in cortical excitability and (2) acute online noise benefits when computations rely on weak inputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Real-Time MRI Reveals Unique Insight into the Full Kinematics of Eye Movements</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Our eyes are constantly in motion and the various kinds of eye movements are closely linked to many aspects of human cognitive processing. Measuring all possible eye movements unobtrusively is not achievable with current methods. Video-based eye-trackers only measure rotational but not translational motion of the eye, require a calibration process relying on the participant&rsquo;s self-report of accurate fixation, and do not work if vision of the eyeball is blocked. Scleral search coils attach physical weight on the eyeball and also do not measure translation. Here, we describe a novel and fully automated method to use real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for eye tracking. We achieved a temporal resolution sufficient to measure eye rotations and translations as short as those that occur within a blink and behind a closed eyelid. To demonstrate this method, we measured the full extent of the blink-related eye movement for two individuals, suggesting that the eye approaches a holding position during lid closure and can move by as much as 35&deg; in rotation and 2 mm in translation. We also investigated the coordination of gaze shifts with blinks. We found that the gaze shift is tightly coupled in time to the translational blink movement and that blinks can induce significant temporal shifts of the gaze trajectory between left and right eye. Our MR-based Eye Tracking (MREyeTrack) method allows measurement of eye movements in terms of both translation and rotation and enables new opportunities for studying ocular motility and its disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Superior Parietal Lobule of Macaque Monkey: Relative Influence of Gaze and Static Arm Position during Reaching</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The superior parietal lobule (SPL) integrates somatosensory, motor, and visual signals to dynamically control arm movements. During reaching, visual and gaze signals are used to guide the hand to the desired target location, while proprioceptive signals allow to correct arm trajectory, and keep the limb in the final position at the end of the movement. Three SPL areas are particularly involved in this process: V6A, PEc, PE. Here, we evaluated the influence of eye and arm position on single neuron activity of these areas during the holding period at the end of arm reaching movements, when the arm is motionless and gaze and hand positions are aligned. Two male macaques (<I>Macaca fascicularis</I>) performed a foveal reaching task while single unit activity was recorded from areas V6A, PEc, and PE. We found that at the end of reaching movements the neurons of all these areas were modulated by both eye position and static position of the arm. V6A and PEc showed a prevalent combination of gaze and proprioceptive input, while PE seemed to encode these signals more independently. Our results demonstrate that all these SPL areas combine gaze and proprioceptive input to provide an accurate monitoring of arm movements.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smartic: A smart tool for Big Data analytics and IoT [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Internet of Things (IoT) is leading the physical and digital world of technology to converge. Real-time and massive scale connections produce a large amount of versatile data, where Big Data comes into the picture. Big Data refers to large, diverse sets of information with dimensions that go beyond the capabilities of widely used database management systems, or standard data processing software tools to manage within a given limit. Almost every big dataset is dirty and may contain missing data, mistyping, inaccuracies, and many more issues that impact Big Data analytics performances. One of the biggest challenges in Big Data analytics is to discover and repair dirty data; failure to do this can lead to inaccurate analytics results and unpredictable conclusions. We experimented with different missing value imputation techniques and compared machine learning (ML) model performances with different imputation methods. We propose a hybrid model for missing value imputation combining ML and sample-based statistical techniques. Furthermore, we continued with the best missing value inputted dataset, chosen based on ML model performance for feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. We used k-means clustering and principal component analysis. Accuracy, the evaluated outcome, improved dramatically and proved that the XGBoost model gives very high accuracy at around 0.125 root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE). To overcome overfitting, we used K-fold cross-validation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Increasing neural network robustness improves match to macaque V1 eigenspectrum, spatial frequency preference and predictivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan C. L. Kong, Eshed Margalit, Justin L. Gardner, Anthony M. Norcia</p>

Task-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show striking similarities to the ventral visual stream. However, human-imperceptible image perturbations can cause a CNN to make incorrect predictions. Here we provide insight into this brittleness by investigating the representations of models that are either robust or not robust to image perturbations. Theory suggests that the robustness of a system to these perturbations could be related to the power law exponent of the eigenspectrum of its set of neural responses, where power law exponents closer to and larger than one would indicate a system that is less susceptible to input perturbations. We show that neural responses in mouse and macaque primary visual cortex (V1) obey the predictions of this theory, where their eigenspectra have power law exponents of at least one. We also find that the eigenspectra of model representations decay slowly relative to those observed in neurophysiology and that robust models have eigenspectra that decay slightly faster and have higher power law exponents than those of non-robust models. The slow decay of the eigenspectra suggests that substantial variance in the model responses is related to the encoding of fine stimulus features. We therefore investigated the spatial frequency tuning of artificial neurons and found that a large proportion of them preferred high spatial frequencies and that robust models had preferred spatial frequency distributions more aligned with the measured spatial frequency distribution of macaque V1 cells. Furthermore, robust models were quantitatively better models of V1 than non-robust models. Our results are consistent with other findings that there is a misalignment between human and machine perception. They also suggest that it may be useful to penalize slow-decaying eigenspectra or to bias models to extract features of lower spatial frequencies during task-optimization in order to improve robustness and V1 neural response predictivity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparing natural hydrogels to self-assembling peptides in spinal cord injury treatment: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In many cases, central nervous system (CNS) injury is unchanging due to the absence of neuronal regeneration and repair capabilities. In recent years, regenerative medicine, and especially hydrogels, has reached a significant amount of attention for their promising results for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) currently considered permanent. Hydrogels are categorized based on their foundation: synthetic, natural, and combination. The objective of this study was to compare the properties and efficacy of commonly used hydrogels, like collagen, and other natural peptides with synthetic self-assembling peptide hydrogels in the treatment of SCI.  Methods: Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. All studies from 1985 until January 2020 were included in the primary search. Eligible articles were included based on the following criteria: administering hydrogels (both natural and synthetic) for SCI treatment, solely focusing on spinal cord injury treatment, and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Data on axonal regeneration, revascularization, elasticity, drug delivery efficacy, and porosity were extracted. Results: A total of 24 articles were included for full-text review and data extraction. There was only one experimental study comparing collagen I (natural hydrogel) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in an in vitro setting. The included study suggested the behavior of cells with PEG is more expectable in the injury site, which makes it a more reliable scaffold for neurites. Conclusions: There is limited research comparing and evaluating both types of natural and self-assembling peptides (SAPs) in the same animal or in vitro study, despite its importance. Although we assume that the remodeling of natural scaffolds may lead to a stable hydrogel, there was not a definitive conclusion that synthetic hydrogels are more beneficial than natural hydrogels in neuronal regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Incidence of and Risk Factors for Perioperative Cardiovascular Complications in Spine Surgery [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An increasing number of patients are opting for spine surgery despite the associated risk of cardiovascular complications. The evidence regarding the incidence and risk factors of cardiovascular complications in spine surgery is insufficient. Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for cardiovascular complications that occur perioperatively in spine surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent spine surgery between January 2018 and December 2019 at a single center. Demographic, clinical, and operative data were collected from electronic medical records. The incidence of perioperative cardiac complications was determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the development of perioperative cardiovascular complications in the participants. Results: Of the 1,002 eligible patients enrolled in the study, six developed cardiac complications. Acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and congestive heart failure occurred in one, two, and three patients, respectively. Risk factors for cardiovascular complications included scoliosis surgery (relative risk: RR, 18.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.346-257.35) and a history of congestive heart failure (RR, 120.97; 95% CI: 2.12-6898.80). Conclusion: The incidence of perioperative cardiovascular complications in patients who underwent spine surgery was 0.6%. High-risk patients should be closely monitored optimally managed throughout the perioperative period.

                Background: This study determined the levels of organochlorine (OCPs) and organophosphate (OPPs) pesticide residues in cow milk from Kiambu and camel milk from Isiolo and Laikipia. The human dietary intake and the potential consumer health risks were also evaluated. Methods: In total, 90 cow and 82 camel milk samples were collected and analyzed using gas chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy to determine the levels of OCPs and OPPs. The levels were compared to the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius (CA), EU Pesticides Database (EUPD), and the United States Department of Agriculture. The estimated daily intake and chronic hazard quotient (cHQ) of the milk were also calculated. Results: Cow milk from Kiambu was contaminated with 11/18 of the evaluated OCPs and 13/14 of the evaluated OPPs while camel milk from Isiolo was contaminated with 9/18 of the evaluated OCPs and 9/14 of the evaluated OPPs. Camel milk from Laikipia was contaminated with 11/18 of the evaluated OCPs and 11/14 of the evaluated OPPs. The mean heptachlor value in camel milk from Isiolo was above the EUPD MRLs. The mean value of heptachlor in Camel milk from Laikipia was above the CA and EUPD MRLs. The cHQs for Disulfoton, Fenamiphos, and Methacrifos in Cow milk were above 1 for adults and children. The cHQs for Fenchlorphous and Profenofos in Camel milk were above 1 for adults and children. The cHQs for α-endosulphan, β-endosulphan, dieldrin, and heptachlor in cow milk was above 1 for adults and children while the cHQs for heptachlor in camel milk was above 1 for adults and children. Conclusions: The potential health risks from chronic dietary intake of cow and camel milk in Kenya cannot be excluded. The routine monitoring of organophosphate and organochlorine pesticide levels in milk is recommended to minimize risks to human health.

                Background: Lack of reproducibility in preclinical research poses ethical and economic challenges for biomedical science. Various institutional activities by society stakeholders of leading industrialised nations are currently underway with the aim of improving the situation. Such initiatives are usually concerned with high-level organisational issues and typically do not focus on improving experimental approaches per se. Addressing these is necessary in order to increase consistency and success rates of lab-to-lab repetitions. Methods: In this project, we statistically evaluated repetitive data of a very basic and widely applied lab procedure, namely quantifying the number of viable cells. The purpose of this was to assess the impact of different parameters and instrumentations which may constitute sources of variance in this procedure. Conclusion: By comparing the variability of data acquired under two different procedures, featuring improved stringency of protocol adherence, our project attempts to identify the sources and propose guidelines on how to reduce such fluctuations. We believe our work can contribute to tackling the repeatability crisis in biomedical research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Proactive measures to eradicate Malaysia’s poverty in IR4.0 era: a shared prosperity vision [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the country’s shared prosperity vision, Malaysia aspires to uplift the bottom 40% household income group (B40) by addressing wealth and income disparities. By 2030, the nation seeks to eradicate poverty through the provision of employment opportunities and career progression plans. A grey area between the nation’s aspirations and actions in practice can be observed because the goals have not been achieved despite numerous efforts aimed at the upliftment of the B40 group. The nation is still way behind its targeted outcomes despite various policies being implemented, which could be attributed to the mismatch between government policies and that of organisational practice. Thus, this study explores the rationale of strategic government intervention in managing B40 talent in the IR4.0 era. Methods: A general qualitative inquiry method that used 11 semi-structured interviews was carried out with representatives of Malaysia’s policy makers’, training providers, and trainees. All Interview questions centred around measures, importance and outcomes of B40 youth training from a multi-stakeholder perspective. Data were thematically analysed in five stages using NVivo. Results: Training, which includes IR4.0 era digital skills, is the key to uplifting the B40 youth to eradicate poverty. Proactive measures are imperative in the success of B40 youth training towards poverty eradication. Conclusions: This study contributes to the existing literature and helps practitioners by addressing the current gap in Malaysia’s aspirations versus organisational practice. Stakeholders should formulate proactive strategies to ensure that the right trainees are matched with the right training providers and government policies. A linkage between government policies and industry requirements needs to be established as opposed to the present discontinuity. A structured training needs analysis should be applied through a collaboration between industries and governments. Then, B40 individuals commonly found in lower-level positions can be pooled into the career pathway towards a shift into M40.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel method for measuring sublingual temperature using conventional non-contact forehead thermometer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PhenoApp: A mobile tool for plant phenotyping to record field and greenhouse observations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms are emerging for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still widely used and is a time- and money-consuming step. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards the efficient use of genetic resources and are demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open-source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and in greenhouses. It is a versatile tool that offers the possibility to fully customize the descriptors/scales for any possible scenario, also in accordance with international information standards such as MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Furthermore, PhenoApp enables the use of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. The simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). PhenoApp is therefore a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in genebank management but also contributes to breeding and breeding research by accelerating the labour intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

                Speech and innate vocalizations have stereotyped and rhythmic elements, similar to syllables, suggesting that a hardwired motor program underlies their production. Here, Wei et al. identify a vocalization central pattern generator, the first of its kind, that coordinates neonatal mouse cries with breathing and encodes the rhythmic syllable structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis for cytoplasmic dynein-1 regulation by Lis1</a></h4>

              
                The lissencephaly 1 gene, <i>LIS1</i>, is mutated in patients with the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly. The Lis1 protein is conserved from fungi to mammals and is a key regulator of cytoplasmic dynein-1, the major minus-end-directed microtubule motor in many eukaryotes. Lis1 is the only dynein regulator known to bind directly to dynein's motor domain, and by doing so alters dynein's mechanochemistry. Lis1 is required for the formation of fully active dynein complexes, which also contain essential cofactors: dynactin and an activating adaptor. Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of the yeast dynein–Lis1 complex. Our 3.1Å structure reveals, in molecular detail, the major contacts between dynein and Lis1 and between Lis1's ß-propellers. Structure-guided mutations in Lis1 and dynein show that these contacts are required for Lis1's ability to form fully active human dynein complexes and to regulate yeast dynein's mechanochemistry and in vivo function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An intestinally secreted host factor promotes microsporidia invasion of C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Microsporidia are ubiquitous obligate intracellular pathogens of animals. These parasites often infect hosts through an oral route, but little is known about the function of host intestinal proteins that facilitate microsporidia invasion. To identify such factors necessary for infection by <i>Nematocida parisii</i>, a natural microsporidian pathogen of <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i>, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify mutant animals that have a Fitness Advantage with <i>Nematocida</i> (Fawn). We isolated four <i>fawn</i> mutants that are resistant to <i>Nematocida</i> infection and contain mutations in <i>T14E8.4</i>, which we renamed <i>aaim-1 </i>(Antibacterial and Aids invasion by Microsporidia). Expression of AAIM-1 in the intestine of <i>aaim-1</i> animals restores <i>N. parisii</i> infectivity and this rescue of infectivity is dependent upon AAIM-1 secretion. <i>N. parisii </i>spores in <i>aaim-1</i> animals are improperly oriented in the intestinal lumen, leading to reduced levels of parasite invasion. Conversely, <i>aaim-1</i> mutants display both increased colonization and susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and overexpression of <i>AAIM-1</i> reduces <i>P. aeruginosa</i> colonization. Competitive fitness assays show that <i>aaim-1 </i>mutants are favoured in the presence of<i> N. parisii </i>but disadvantaged on<i> P. aeruginosa </i>compared to wild type animals<i>. </i>Together, this work demonstrates how microsporidia exploits a secreted protein to promote host invasion. Our results also suggest evolutionary trade-offs may exist to optimizing host defense against multiple classes of pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Context-dependent relationships between locus coeruleus firing patterns and coordinated neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Ascending neuromodulatory projections from the locus coeruleus (LC) affect cortical neural networks via the release of norepinephrine (NE). However, the exact nature of these neuromodulatory effects on neural activity patterns <i>in vivo</i> is not well understood. Here we show that in awake monkeys, LC activation is associated with changes in coordinated activity patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These relationships, which are largely independent of changes in firing rates of individual ACC neurons, depend on the type of LC activation: ACC pairwise correlations tend to be reduced when ongoing (baseline) LC activity increases but enhanced when external events evoke transient LC responses. Both relationships covary with pupil changes that reflect LC activation and arousal. These results suggest that modulations of information processing that reflect changes in coordinated activity patterns in cortical networks can result partly from ongoing, context-dependent, arousal-related changes in activation of the LC-NE system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stress conditions promote Leishmania hybridization in vitro marked by expression of the ancestral gamete fusogen HAP2 as revealed by single-cell RNAseq</a></h4>

              
                <i>Leishmania</i> are protozoan parasites transmitted by the bite of sand fly vectors producing a wide spectrum of diseases in their mammalian hosts. These diverse clinical outcomes are directly associated with parasite strain and species diversity. Although <i>Leishmania</i> reproduction is mainly clonal, a cryptic sexual cycle capable of producing hybrid genotypes has been inferred from population genetic studies, and directly demonstrated by laboratory crosses. Experimentally, mating competence has been largely confined to promastigotes developing in the sand fly midgut. The ability to hybridize culture promastigotes <i>in vitro</i> has been limited so far to low efficiency crosses between two <i>L. tropica</i> strains, L747 and MA37, that mate with high efficiency in flies. Here, we show that exposure of promastigote cultures to DNA damage stress produces a remarkably enhanced efficiency of <i>in vitro</i> hybridization of the <i>L. tropica</i> strains, and extends to other species, including <i>L. donovani, L. infantum,</i> and <i>L. braziliensis</i>, a capacity to generate intra- and interspecific hybrids. Whole genome sequencing and total DNA content analyses indicate that the hybrids are in each case full genome, mostly tetraploid hybrids. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the L747 and MA37 parental lines highlights the transcriptome heterogeneity of culture promastigotes and reveals discrete clusters that emerge post-irradiation in which genes potentially involved in genetic exchange are expressed, including the ancestral gamete fusogen <i>HAP2</i>. By generating reporter constructs for HAP2, we could select for promastigotes that could either hybridize or not <i>in vitro</i>. Overall, this work reveals that there are specific populations involved in <i>Leishmania</i> hybridization associated with a discernible transcriptomic signature, and that stress facilitated <i>in vitro</i> hybridization can be a transformative approach to generate large numbers of hybrid genotypes between diverse species and strains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PRC1 sustains the integrity of neural fate in the absence of PRC2 function</a></h4>

              
                Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 maintain stable cellular memories of early fate decisions by establishing heritable patterns of gene repression. PRCs repress transcription through histone modifications and chromatin compaction, but their roles in neuronal subtype diversification are poorly defined. We found that PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally-restricted spinal motor neuron (MN) subtypes, while PRC2 activity is dispensable to maintain MN positional identities during terminal differentiation. Mutation of the core PRC1 component <i>Ring1</i> in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including <i>Hox</i> transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in <i>Ring1</i> mutants is due to the suppression of Hox-dependent specification programs by derepressed<i> Hox13</i> paralogs (<i>Hoxa13</i>, <i>Hoxb13</i>, <i>Hoxc13</i>, <i>Hoxd13</i>). These results indicate that PRC1 can function in the absence of <i>de novo</i> PRC2-dependent histone methylation to maintain chromatin topology and postmitotic neuronal fate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of ultrapotent chemogenetic ligands for research applications in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Chemogenetics is a technique for obtaining selective pharmacological control over a cell population by expressing an engineered receptor that is selectively activated by an exogenously administered ligand. A promising approach for neuronal modulation involves the use of "Pharmacologically Selective Actuator Modules" (PSAMs); these chemogenetic receptors are selectively activated by ultrapotent "Pharmacologically Selective Effector Molecules" (uPSEMs). To extend the use of PSAM/PSEMs to studies in nonhuman primates it is necessary to thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safety of these tools. We describe the time course and brain penetrance in rhesus monkeys of two compounds with promising binding specificity and efficacy profiles in in vitro studies, uPSEM792 and uPSEM817, after systemic administration. Rhesus macaques received subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration of uPSEM817(0.064 mg/kg) or uPSEM792 (0.87 mg/kg) and plasma and CSF samples were collected over the course of 48 hours. Both compounds exhibited good brain penetrance, relatively slow washout and negligible conversion to potential metabolites - varenicline or hydroxyvarenicline. In addition, we found that neither of these uPSEMs significantly altered heart rate or sleep. Our results indicate that both compounds are suitable candidates for neuroscience studies using PSAMs in nonhuman primates.

                Identifying causative gene(s) within disease-associated large genomic regions of copy number variants (CNVs) is challenging. Here, by targeted sequencing of genes within schizophrenia (SZ)-associated CNVs in 1,779 SZ cases and 1,418 controls, we identified three rare putative loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in OTU deubiquitinase 7A (OTUD7A) within the 15q13.3 deletion in cases, but none in controls. To tie OTUD7A LoF with any SZ-relevant cellular phenotypes, we modeled the OTUD7A LoF mutation, rs757148409, in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived induced excitatory neurons (iNs) by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering. The mutant iNs showed a [~]50% decrease in OTUD7A expression without undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutant iNs also exhibited marked reduction of dendritic complexity, density of synaptic proteins GluA1 and PSD-95, and neuronal network activity. Congruent with the neuronal phenotypes in mutant iNs, our transcriptomic analysis showed that the set of OTUD7A LoF-downregulated genes was enriched for those relating to synapse development and function, and was associated with SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders. These results suggest that OTUD7A LoF impairs synapse development and neuronal function in human neurons, providing mechanistic insight into the possible role of OTUD7A in driving neuropsychiatric phenotypes associated with the 15q13.3 deletion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure on interneurons and their surrounding perineuronal nets in adulthood.</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundBinge alcohol exposure during adolescence results in long-lasting alterations in brain and behavior. For example, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in rodents results in long-term loss of functional connectivity among prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatal regions as well as a variety of neurochemical, molecular, and epigenetic alterations. Interneurons in the PFC and striatum play critical roles in behavioral flexibility and functional connectivity. For example, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are known to contribute to neural synchrony, and cholinergic interneurons contribute to strategy selection. Furthermore, extracellular perineuronal nets (PNNs) surround some interneurons, particularly PV+ interneurons, to further regulate cellular plasticity. The effect of AIE exposure on expression of these markers within the PFC is not well understood.

MethodsThe present study tested the hypothesis that AIE exposure reduces expression of PV+ and ChAT+ interneurons in the adult PFC and striatum and increases related expression of PNNs (marked by binding of Wisteria Floribunda agglutinin lectin; WFA) in adulthood. Male rats were exposed to AIE (5 g/kg/day, 2-days-on/2-days-off, i.g., P25-P54) or water (CON), and brain tissue was harvested in adulthood (> P80). Immunohistochemistry and co-immunofluorescence were used to assess expression of ChAT, PV, and WFA labeling within the adult PFC and striatum following AIE exposure.

ResultsChAT and PV interneuron numbers in the striatum and PFC were unchanged after AIE exposure. However, WFA labeling in the PFC of AIE-exposed rats was increased compared to CON rats. Moreover, significantly more PV neurons were surrounded by WFA labeling in AIE-exposed subjects relative to controls in both PFC subregions assessed: the orbitofrontal cortex (CON = 34%; AIE = 40%) and the medial PFC (CON = 10%; AIE = 14%).

ConclusionsThese findings indicate that while PV interneuron expression in the adult PFC and striatum is unaltered following AIE exposure, PNNs surrounding these neurons (indicated by extracellular WFA binding) are increased. This increase in PNNs may restrict plasticity of the ensheathed neurons, thus contributing to impaired microcircuitry in frontostriatal connectivity and related behavioral impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relapse-like behavior and nAChR sensitization following intermittent access nicotine self-administration</a></h4>

              
                ABSTRACTMany tobacco smokers consume nicotine intermittently, but the underlying mechanisms and neurobiological changes associated with intermittent nicotine intake are unclear. Understanding intermittent nicotine intake is a high priority, as it could promote therapeutic strategies to attenuate tobacco consumption. We examined nicotine intake behavior and neurobiological changes in male rats that were trained to self-administer nicotine during brief (5 min) trials interspersed with longer (15 min) drug-free periods. Rats readily adapted to intermittent access (IntA) SA following acquisition on a continuous access (ContA) schedule. Probabilistic analysis of IntA nicotine SA suggested reduced nicotine loading behavior compared to ContA, and nicotine pharmacokinetic modeling revealed that rats taking nicotine intermittently may have increased intake to maintain blood levels of nicotine that are comparable to ContA SA. After IntA nicotine SA, rats exhibited an increase in unreinforced responses for nicotine-associated cues (incubation of craving) and specific alterations in the striatal proteome after 7 days without nicotine. IntA nicotine SA also induced nAChR functional upregulation in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), and it enhanced nicotine binding in the brain as determined via [11C]nicotine positron emission tomography. Reducing the saliency of the cue conditions during the 5 min access periods attenuated nicotine intake, but incubation of craving was preserved. Together, these results indicate that IntA conditions promote nicotine SA and nicotine seeking after a nicotine-free period.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sustained upregulation of widespread hippocampal-neocortical coupling following memory encoding</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation of new experiences into lasting episodic memories involves interactions between hippocampus and the neocortex. Evidence of this process is seen already during early awake post-encoding rest periods. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated increased hippocampal coupling with task-relevant perceptual regions and reactivation of stimulus-specific encoding patterns following intensive encoding tasks. Here we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of these hippocampally anchored post-encoding neocortical modulations. Eighty-nine adults participated in an experiment consisting of interleaved memory task- and resting-state periods. As expected, we observed increased post-encoding functional connectivity between hippocampus and individually localized neocortical regions responsive to stimulus categories encountered during memory encoding. Post-encoding modulations were however not restricted to stimulus-selective cortex, but manifested as a nearly system-wide upregulation in hippocampal coupling with all major functional networks. The spatial configuration of these extensive modulations resembled hippocampal-neocortical interaction patterns estimated from active encoding operations, suggesting hippocampal post-encoding involvement by far exceeds reactivation of perceptual aspects. This reinstatement of encoding patterns during immediate post-encoding rest was not observed in resting-state scans collected 12 hours later, nor in control analyses estimating post-encoding neocortical modulations in functional connectivity using other candidate seed regions. The broad similarity in hippocampal functional coupling between online memory encoding and offline post-encoding rest suggests reactivation in humans may involve a spectrum of cognitive processes engaged during experience of an event.

Significance statementStabilization of newly acquired information into lasting memories occurs through systems consolidation - a process which gradually spreads the locus of memory traces from hippocampus to more distributed neocortical representations. One of the earliest signs of consolidation is the upregulation of hippocampal-neocortical interactions during periods of awake rest following an active encoding task. We here show that these modulations involve much larger parts of the brain than previously reported in humans. Comparing changes in hippocampal coupling during post-encoding rest with those observed under active encoding, we find evidence for encoding-like hippocampal reinstatement throughout cortex during task-free periods. This suggests early systems consolidation of an experience involves reactivating not only core sensory details but multiple additional aspects of the encoding event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Busy and confused? High risk of missed alerts in the cockpit: an electrophysiological study</a></h4>

              
                Of evolutionary importance, the ability to react to unexpected auditory stimuli remains critical today, especially in settings such as aircraft cockpits or air traffic control towers, characterized by high mental and auditory loads. Evidences show that both factors can negatively impact auditory attention and prevent appropriate reactions in hazardous situations. In the present study, sixty participants performed a simulated aviation task, varying in terms of mental load (no, low, high mental load), that was embedded with a concurrent tone detection paradigm, in which auditory load was manipulated by the number of different tones (1, 2 or 3). We measured both detection performance (miss, false alarm) and brain activity (event-related potentials) related to the target tone. Our results showed that both mental and auditory loads affected tone detection performance. Importantly, their combined effects had a massive impact on the percentage of missed target tones. While, in the no mental load condition, miss rate was very low with 1 (0.53%) and 2 tones (1.11%), it increased drastically with 3 tones (24.44%), and this effect was accentuated as mental load increased, yielding to the higher miss rate in the 3-tone paradigm under high mental load conditions (68.64%). Increased mental load, auditory load, and miss rate, were all associated with disrupted brain response to the target tone as showed by reductions of the P3b amplitude. In sum, our results highlight the importance of balancing mental and auditory loads to maintain or improve efficient reactions to alarms in complex environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common neural functions during children's naturalistic and controlled laboratory mathematics learning</a></h4>

              
                A major goal of human neuroscience is to understand how the brain functions in the real world, and to measure neural processes under conditions that are ecologically valid. A critical step toward this goal is understanding how brain activity during naturalistic tasks that mimic the real world, relates to brain activity in more traditional laboratory tasks. In the present study, we used intersubject correlations to locate reliable stimulus-driven cerebral processes among children and adults in a naturalistic video lesson and a laboratory forced-choice task that shared the same arithmetic concept. We show that relative to a control condition with grammatical content, naturalistic and laboratory arithmetic tasks evoked overlapping activation within brain regions previously associated with math semantics. The regions of specific functional overlap between the naturalistic mathematics lesson and laboratory mathematics task included bilateral intraparietal cortex, which confirms that this region processes mathematical content independently of differences in task mode. These findings suggest that regions of the intraparietal cortex process mathematical content when children are learning about mathematics in the real world.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is understudied, especially regarding neural mechanisms such as oscillatory control of attention sampling. We report an electroencephalography (EEG) study of such cortical mechanisms, in ADHD-diagnosed adults during administration of Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), a gold-standard continuous performance test for ADHD that measures the ability to sustain attention and inhibit impulsivity. We recorded 53 adults (28 female, 25 male, aged 18&ndash;60), and 18 matched healthy controls, using 128-channel EEG. We analyzed sensor-space features established as neural correlates of attention: timing-sensitivity and phase-synchrony of response activations, and event-related (de)synchronization (ERS/D) of &alpha; and  frequency band activity; in frontal and parietal scalp regions. TOVA test performance significantly distinguished ADHD adults from neurotypical controls, in commission errors, response time variability (RTV) and d' (response sensitivity). The ADHD group showed significantly weaker target-locked and response-locked amplitudes, that were strongly right-lateralized at the N2 wave, and weaker phase synchrony (longer reset poststimulus). They also manifested significantly less parietal prestimulus 8-Hz  ERS, less frontal and parietal poststimulus 4-Hz  ERS, and more frontal and parietal prestimulus &alpha; ERS during correct trials. These differences may reflect excessive modulation of endogenous activity by strong entrainment to stimulus (&alpha;), combined with deficient modulation by neural entrainment to task (), which in TOVA involves monitoring stimulus spatial location (not predicted occurrence onset which is regular and task-irrelevant). Building on the hypotheses of  coding for relational structure and rhythmic attention sampling, our results suggest that ADHD adults have impaired attention sampling in relational categorization tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in BNST and Amygdala Activation by Contextual, Cued, and Unpredictable Threats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fear and anxiety can be described as emotional and physical responses to predictable and unpredictable threats. While the amygdala is necessary for context and cued fear conditioning, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for anxiety-like behavior and conditioned responses to diffuse and/or unpredictable threats. However, we still lack knowledge about how the BNST and amygdala nuclei act in coordination. Moreover, the incidence of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is substantially higher in women than in men, but most studies of fear conditioning are conducted in male rodents. Here, we asked whether the BNST and the lateral, basal, and central nuclei of the amygdala are active during the expression of fear conditioning in male and female rats using FOS immunohistochemistry. We first show that the BNST is indeed involved in context fear expression in males, but not in females. The lateral amygdala was active in both sexes during context fear expression. We next trained animals using tone cues paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), or tone cues which were unpaired with the US, and thus nonpredictive. Females displayed greater fear expression to these unpaired tones than males. FOS was upregulated in both the BNST and the basal amygdala during fear expression to unpaired tones in both sexes. The differential processing of fear responses by males and females highlights the need to acknowledge sex differences in conditioned fear memory.</p>

                Background: In 2019, the Namibian Ministry of Health introduced HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an additional strategy to increase uptake of HIV self-testing in traditionally hard-to-reach subpopulations, such as young adults and males. It is unclear how the utilisation of HIV self-testing iw optimised in young adults. The study objective is understanding knowledge, attitudes, and perception levels amongst college-going young adults in Namibia. Methods: This quantitative study utilised a sample of 97 young college students who received a pre-test structured questionnaire. One sample t-test was used to analyse the average score from the Likert scale. A cut-off p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance of variables was used. Logistic regression computation was used to identify independent variables significantly associated with the dependent variable. A univariate analysis was done on awareness and acceptability with statistical significance of p<0.05 to obtain preliminary insights into the association between independent and dependent variables. The net effect variables are assessed using multivariate analysis using STATA 13.1, taking into account confounding factors. Results: Out of the 97 participants, only 23.7% knew about HIV self-testing. The logistic regression had a significant association with awareness of HIV self-testing (p≤0.05): on condom use during a first sexual encounter; being with a single sexual partner in the last 12 months; not having a sexually transmitted infection. The univariate analysis revealed an association with the acceptability of HIV self-testing from females; those who live in urban settlements; having not had sexually transmitted infection in the last twelve months. Moreover, findings reveal there are low levels of awareness, yet participants had positive attitudes and levels of acceptability to HIV self-testing. Conclusion: This study shows promise if awareness through health education and promotion about HIV self-testing can be increased. This can form part of scaling up HIV testing in Namibia.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Contextual features in the developing hippocampus: A representational similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Functional divisions of labor in support of memory have been reported along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. However, little is known about how the developing hippocampus represents associative memories along this axis. The present research employed representational similarity analysis to ask whether developmental differences exist in the extent to which the anterior versus the posterior hippocampus represent features of the context and associative memories. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during the retrieval phase of an associative recognition task from 8-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and adults (<i>N</i> = 58). Participants were asked to retrieve pairs of items, which were presented either in the same location as during encoding or in a flipped location. In the anterior hippocampus and only for adults, pattern similarity between the two studied pair conditions was greater than pattern similarity between studied pairs presented in the same location and novel pairs. In contrast, this difference was not significant in the posterior hippocampus. Older, but not younger, children showed a similar, albeit attenuated, similarity pattern to that of adults, but measures of patterns similarity predicted associative recognition across ages. In addition, exploratory analyses showed that similarity patterns in the adult posterior, but not anterior, hippocampus tracked the order of the runs. Overall, the results suggest functional and developmental dissociations in processing different contextual features, with the anterior hippocampus responding to salient and rapid-changing features and the posterior hippocampus responding to slower-changing features of the context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of risk perception and risk communication regarding COVID-19 among healthcare providers: An explanatory sequential mixed-method study in Bangladesh [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Any public health emergency demands adequate risk communication with the vulnerable population along with their optimized perception about the impending risk to ensure proper risk management and crisis control. Hence, we conducted this study to explore healthcare providers’ perceptions regarding risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as how they are being communicated to about the risk, and how they practice risk reduction measures. Methods: We conducted a two-phased explanatory sequential mixed-method study among physicians and nurses from randomly selected tertiary healthcare facilities in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In the first phase, we assessed the general pattern and quantifiable measures of risk perception, risk communication, and infection prevention practices quantitatively. We performed multiple linear regression analyses to explore how much variability of risk perception was predicted by risk communication methods and contents. In the second phase, we collected qualitative data for in-depth understanding and exploration of participants’ experiences and insights regarding COVID-19 risk through interviews and document reviews. We manually performed thematic content analysis of the qualitative data. Finally, we triangulated findings from both phases to illustrate the research objectives. Discussion: Based on the psychometric dimensions of risk perception and psycho-social theory of the health belief model, perceptions of COVID-19 risk among healthcare providers were evaluated in this study. The relationship between risk perception and infection prevention and control practices among healthcare providers were also investigated. The explanatory sequential design of this study is expected to generate hypotheses on how risk perception is being shaped in a time of uncertainty and, thus, will help to build a proper risk communication strategy for the healthcare providers

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The characteristics of early-stage research into human genes are substantially different from subsequent research</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Stoeger, Luís A. Nunes Amaral</p>

Throughout the last 2 decades, several scholars observed that present day research into human genes rarely turns toward genes that had not already been extensively investigated in the past. Guided by hypotheses derived from studies of science and innovation, we present here a literature-wide data-driven meta-analysis to identify the specific scientific and organizational contexts that coincided with early-stage research into human genes throughout the past half century. We demonstrate that early-stage research into human genes differs in team size, citation impact, funding mechanisms, and publication outlet, but that generalized insights derived from studies of science and innovation only partially apply to early-stage research into human genes. Further, we demonstrate that, presently, genome biology accounts for most of the initial early-stage research, while subsequent early-stage research can engage other life sciences fields. We therefore anticipate that the specificity of our findings will enable scientists and policymakers to better promote early-stage research into human genes and increase overall innovation within the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Fos regulates macrophage infiltration against surrounding tissue resistance by a cortical actin-based mechanism in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vera Belyaeva, Stephanie Wachner, Attila Gyoergy, Shamsi Emtenani, Igor Gridchyn, Maria Akhmanova, Markus Linder, Marko Roblek, Maria Sibilia, Daria Siekhaus</p>

The infiltration of immune cells into tissues underlies the establishment of tissue-resident macrophages and responses to infections and tumors. Yet the mechanisms immune cells utilize to negotiate tissue barriers in living organisms are not well understood, and a role for cortical actin has not been examined. Here, we find that the tissue invasion of <i>Drosophila</i> macrophages, also known as plasmatocytes or hemocytes, utilizes enhanced cortical F-actin levels stimulated by the <i>Drosophila</i> member of the fos proto oncogene transcription factor family (Dfos, Kayak). RNA sequencing analysis and live imaging show that Dfos enhances F-actin levels around the entire macrophage surface by increasing mRNA levels of the membrane spanning molecular scaffold tetraspanin TM4SF, and the actin cross-linking filamin Cheerio, which are themselves required for invasion. Both the filamin and the tetraspanin enhance the cortical activity of Rho1 and the formin Diaphanous and thus the assembly of cortical actin, which is a critical function since expressing a dominant active form of Diaphanous can rescue the <i>Dfos</i> macrophage invasion defect. In vivo imaging shows that Dfos enhances the efficiency of the initial phases of macrophage tissue entry. Genetic evidence argues that this Dfos-induced program in macrophages counteracts the constraint produced by the tension of surrounding tissues and buffers the properties of the macrophage nucleus from affecting tissue entry. We thus identify strengthening the cortical actin cytoskeleton through Dfos as a key process allowing efficient forward movement of an immune cell into surrounding tissues.

                Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Among the risk factors associated with the severity of this disease is the presence of several metabolic disorders. For this reason, the aim of this research was to identify the comorbidities and laboratory parameters among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), comparing the patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with those who did not require IMV, in order to determine the clinical characteristics associated with the COVID-19 severity. Methods. We carried out a cross-sectional study among 152 patients who were admitted to the ICU from April 1st to July 31st, 2021, in whom the comorbidities and laboratory parameters associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection severity were identified. The data of these patients was grouped into two main groups: “patients who required IMV” and “patients who did not require IMV”. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data and the χ2 test for categorical data were used to compare the variables between both groups. Results. Of the 152 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU, 66 required IMV and 86 did not require IMV. Regarding the comorbidities found in these patients, a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and obesity was observed among patients who required IMV vs. those who did not require IMV (p<0.05). Concerning laboratory parameters, only glucose, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher among patients who required IMV than in those who did not require IMV (p<0.05). Conclusion. This study performed in a Mexican population indicates that comorbidities such as: T2DM, hypertension and obesity, as well as elevated levels of glucose, IL-6, LDH and CRP are associated with the COVID-19 severity.

                Background: Male genital injuries are urological emergencies which if not promptly treated with correct therapeutic intervention may lead to loss of fertility due to infections and anatomical disruption of normalcy. This study highlights the clinical scenarios, etiology and outcome of male genital injury cases that were managed at a tertiary care center in Nepal. Such injuries are not frequently encountered as patients are hesitant to report such injuries. The present study is the first from Nepal which depicts a comprehensive report on male genital injuries.   Methods: A retrospective analysis of discharge summaries of the cases of male genital injuries was reviewed during June 2020. All the treated cases during the two-year period from April 2018 to April 2020 at Lumbini Medical College, Nepal were included in the study.  Results: There were eight cases of genital trauma admitted and treated during the study period. All the patients were males and age ranged from six to 71 years with a mean age of 33 ± 21.45 years. Fall injury and road traffic accidents (RTA) were observed to be the primary cause in the majority of cases.  Conclusion: Superficial injuries to the penis and scrotum do not require surgical exploration and could be managed conservatively. However, deeper and complicated injuries, testicular preservation, the functionality of the part and cosmetic issues are taken into consideration which might require a multi-disciplinary approach. Apart from the medical issues pertaining to genital injuries, there are legal and psychological aspects of such events too which should not be ignored.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the Effects of Nonsynonymous Variants on SARS-CoV-2 Proteins [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus is a highly transmissible pathogen that causes COVID-19. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A number of nonsynonymous mutations located at different SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been reported by multiple studies. However, there are limited computational studies on the biological impacts of these mutations on the structure and function of the proteins.   Methods: In our study nonsynonymous mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their frequencies were identified from 30,229 sequences. Subsequently, the effects of the top 10 nonsynonymous mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed using bioinformatics tools including co-mutation analysis, prediction of the protein structure stability and flexibility analysis, and prediction of the protein functions.   Results: A total of 231 nonsynonymous mutations were identified from 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The top 10 nonsynonymous mutations affecting nine amino acid residues were ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF1b nsp12 P323L and A423V, S protein N501Y and D614G, ORF3a Q57H, N protein P151L, R203K and G204R. Many nonsynonymous mutations showed a high concurrence ratio, suggesting these mutations may evolve together and interact functionally. Our result showed that ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF3a Q57H and N protein P151L mutations may be deleterious to the function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In addition, ORF1a nsp5 P108S and S protein D614G may destabilize the protein structures while S protein D614G may have a more open conformation compared to the wild type.   Conclusion: The biological consequences of these nonsynonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins should be further validated by in vivo and in vitro experimental studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Soluble TAM receptors sAXL and sTyro3 predict structural and functional protection in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                In the DELCODE and F.ACE cohorts, Brosseron, Maass, Kleineidam, et al. find that inflammatory CSF biomarkers rise in pre-dementia stages alongside tau and neurodegeneration markers. Within this pattern, soluble TAM receptors sTyro3 and sAXL positively relate to MRI structure and cognition, potentially as proxies of immune regulatory protective mechanisms.
