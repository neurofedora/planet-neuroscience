                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) safety and efficacy in patients with large core infarcts receiving oral anticoagulants (OAC) are unknown. In the SELECT2 trial (NCT03876457), 29 of 180 (16%; vitamin K antagonists 15, direct OACs 14) EVT, and 18 of 172 (10%; vitamin K antagonists 3, direct OACs 15) medical management (MM) patients reported OAC use at baseline. EVT was not associated with better clinical outcomes in the OAC group (EVT 6 [4–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 0.89 [0.53–1.50]), but demonstrated significantly better outcomes in patients without OAC (EVT 4 [3–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 1.87 [1.45–2.40], <i>p</i> = 0.02). The OAC group had higher comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (70% vs 17%), congestive heart failure (28% vs 10%), and hypertension (87% vs 72%), suggesting increased frailty. However, the results were consistent after adjustment for these comorbidities, and was similar regardless of the type of OACs used. Whereas any hemorrhage rates were higher in the OAC group receiving EVT (86% in OAC vs 70% in no OAC), no parenchymal hemorrhage or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed with OAC use in both the EVT and MM arms. Although we did not find evidence that the effect was due to excess hemorrhage or confounded by underlying cardiac disease or older age, OAC use alone should not exclude patients from receiving EVT. Baseline comorbidities and ischemic injury extent should be considered while making individualized treatment decisions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <p>The adult turtle spinal cord can generate multiple kinds of limb movements, including swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal (flexion reflex), even without brain input and sensory feedback. There are many multifunctional spinal neurons, activated during multiple motor patterns, and some behaviorally specialized neurons, activated during only one. How do multifunctional and behaviorally specialized neurons each contribute to motor output? We analyzed in vivo intracellular recordings of multifunctional and specialized neurons. Neurons tended to spike in the same phase of the hip-flexor (HF) activity cycle during swimming and scratching, though one preferred opposite phases. During both swimming and scratching, a larger fraction of multifunctional neurons than specialized neurons were highly rhythmic. One group of multifunctional neurons was active during the HF-on phase and another during the HF-off phase. Thus, HF&ndash;extensor alternation may be generated by a subset of multifunctional spinal neurons during both swimming and scratching. Scratch-specialized neurons and flexion reflex-selective neurons may instead trigger their respective motor patterns, by biasing activity of multifunctional neurons. In phase-averaged membrane potentials of multifunctional neurons, trough phases were more highly correlated between swimming and scratching than peak phases, suggesting that rhythmic inhibition plays a greater role than rhythmic excitation. We also provide the first intracellular recording of a turtle swim-specialized neuron: tonically excited during swimming but inactive during scratching and flexion reflex. It displayed an excitatory postsynaptic potential following each swim-evoking electrical stimulus and thus may be an intermediary between reticulospinal axons and the swimming CPG they activate.</p>

                <p>The gaze-following patch (GFP) is located in the posterior temporal cortex and has been described as a cortical module dedicated to processing other people's gaze-direction in a domain-specific manner. Thus, it appears to be the neural correlate of Baron-Cohen's eye direction detector (EDD) which is one of the core modules in his mindreading system&mdash;a neurocognitive model for the theory of mind concept. Inspired by Jerry Fodor's ideas on the modularity of the mind, Baron-Cohen proposed that, among other things, the individual modules are domain specific. In the case of the EDD, this means that it exclusively processes eye-like stimuli to extract gaze-direction and that other stimuli, which may carry directional information as well, are processed elsewhere. If the GFP is indeed EDD's neural correlate, it must meet this expectation. To test this, we compared the GFP's BOLD activity during gaze-direction following with the activity during arrow-direction following in the present human fMRI study. Contrary to the expectation based on the assumption of domain specificity, we did not find a differentiation between gaze- and arrow-direction following. In fact, we were not able to reproduce the GFP as presented in the previous studies. A possible explanation is that in the present study&mdash;unlike the previous work&mdash;the gaze stimuli did not contain an obvious change of direction that represented a visual motion. Hence, the critical stimulus component responsible for the identification of the GFP in the previous experiments might have been visual motion.</p>

                <p>by Hsun Chiang, Chih-Ang Chung</p>

Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term <i>in vitro</i> capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model, the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming the network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously.

                <p>by Simon K. S. Chu, Kush Narang, Justin B. Siegel</p>

Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as food processing, therapeutics, and the identification of pathogenic mutations. Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability, and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. In this work, we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction. ESM<sub>therm</sub> is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and <i>de novo</i> sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESM<sub>therm</sub> performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature.

                <p>by Florian Borse, Dovydas Kičiatovas, Teemu Kuosmanen, Mabel Vidal, Guillermo Cabrera-Vives, Johannes Cairns, Jonas Warringer, Ville Mustonen</p>

Quantitative understanding of microbial growth is an essential prerequisite for successful control of pathogens as well as various biotechnology applications. Even though the growth of cell populations has been extensively studied, microbial growth remains poorly characterised at the spatial level. Indeed, even isogenic populations growing at different locations on solid growth medium typically show significant location-dependent variability in growth. Here we show that this variability can be attributed to the initial physiological states of the populations, the interplay between populations interacting with their local environment and the diffusion of nutrients and energy sources coupling the environments. We further show how the causes of this variability change throughout the growth of a population. We use a dual approach, first applying machine learning regression models to discover that location dominates growth variability at specific times, and, in parallel, developing explicit population growth models to describe this spatial effect. In particular, treating nutrient and energy source concentration as a latent variable allows us to develop a mechanistic resource consumer model that captures growth variability across the shared environment.
As a consequence, we are able to determine intrinsic growth parameters for each local population, removing confounders common to location-dependent variability in growth. Importantly, our explicit low-parametric model for the environment paves the way for massively parallel experimentation with configurable spatial niches for testing specific eco-evolutionary hypotheses.

                <p>by Yanel E. Bernardi, Estefania Sanchez-Vasquez, Rocío Belén Márquez, Michael L. Piacentino, Hugo Urrutia, Izadora Rossi, Karina L. Alcântara Saraiva, Antonio Pereira-Neves, Marcel I. Ramirez, Marianne E. Bronner, Natalia de Miguel, Pablo H. Strobl-Mazzulla</p>

While interactions between neural crest and placode cells are critical for the proper formation of the trigeminal ganglion, the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely uncharacterized. Here, by using chick embryos, we show that the microRNA (miR)-203, whose epigenetic repression is required for neural crest migration, is reactivated in coalescing and condensing trigeminal ganglion cells. Overexpression of miR-203 induces ectopic coalescence of neural crest cells and increases ganglion size. By employing cell-specific electroporations for either miR-203 sponging or genomic editing using CRISPR/Cas9, we elucidated that neural crest cells serve as the source, while placode cells serve as the site of action for miR-203 in trigeminal ganglion condensation. Demonstrating intercellular communication, overexpression of miR-203 in the neural crest in vitro or in vivo represses an miR-responsive sensor in placode cells. Moreover, neural crest-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), visualized using pHluorin-CD63 vector, become incorporated into the cytoplasm of placode cells. Finally, RT-PCR analysis shows that small EVs isolated from condensing trigeminal ganglia are selectively loaded with miR-203. Together, our findings reveal a critical role in vivo for neural crest-placode communication mediated by sEVs and their selective microRNA cargo for proper trigeminal ganglion formation.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

The present study aims to assess the accuracy of diagnostic and procedural codes as recorded by the hospital’s coders and to also evaluate their impact on the hospital’s revenue. Methods In a local hospital in Najran, Saudi Arabia, a cross-sectional observational analysis was conducted on patients with a clinical coder. The percentage of precision and error following the re-coding of cases was calculated using a statistical analysis. Results Primary diagnosis was incorrectly coded in 57 (26 per cent) records, and secondary diagnosis was incorrectly coded in 21 (9.9 per cent) records. Inaccurate medical labelling has been seen in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and gynaecology facilities. Discussion The percentage of records with the most incorrect coding was found to be 16 (7.5 per cent) in the emergency room, 10 (4.7 per cent) in the surgical clinic, and 5 (2.3 per cent) in the gynaecology/OBS clinic. Six (2.8 per cent) records in the private clinic had inaccurate secondary diagnoses, followed by four (1.9 per cent) and two (1 per cent) records in nephrology. Conclusion The percentage of inaccurate clinical codes in primary diagnoses reached (26.8 per cent) and the percentage of incorrect clinical codes in secondary diagnoses reached (9.9 per cent).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis consumption has increased from 1.5% to 2.5% in Canada between 2012 and 2019. Clinical studies have indicated effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on birth weight, substance use, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but are confounded by several difficult to control variables. Animal models allow for examination of the mechanism of cannabis-induced changes in neurodevelopment and behavior, while controlling dose and timing. Several animal models of prenatal cannabis exposure exist which provide varying levels of construct validity, control of dose, and exposure to maternal stress. Using a voluntary oral consumption model, mouse dams received 5 mg/kg Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) whole cannabis oil in peanut butter daily from gestational day 1 (GD1) to postnatal day 10 (PD10). At GD1, GD18, PD1, PD10, and PD15, maternal plasma was collected; pup brains were collected from GD18 onward. Pup brains had higher levels of THC and cannabidiol at each time point, each of which persisted in maternal plasma and pup brains past the end of treatment (PD15). Male and female adolescent offspring were examined for changes to ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity and cocaine-seeking behavior. Prenatal and early postnatal (GD1–PD10) cannabis-exposed male, but not female mice had decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) input, depolarized resting membrane potential, and increased spontaneous firing of VTA dopamine neurons. Cannabis-exposed offspring showed faster decay of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) currents in both sexes. However, no differences in cocaine-seeking behavior were noted. These data characterize a voluntary prenatal cannabis exposure model and demonstrates VTA dopamine neuronal activity is disinhibited in offspring.</p>

                Improvements in DNA sequencing technology are allowing the dramatic increase of whole genome data for a wide variety of species. Such genome sequence data can assist the monitoring of intraspecific genetic diversity, but is often lacking for threatened species. In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae. Our data presentation highlights potential systematic limitations in genome sequencing (e.g., budget for sequencing large genomes of amphibians) and instructs future policies including which taxon needs more effort for genome sequencing. The resultant tables are available in the original website https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/redlist/ and are regularly updated.

<p>Proteoglycans are important multifunctional components of the central and peripheral nervous systems and represent a diverse group of specialized proteins that stabilize and functionalize these tissues.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Central and peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) proteoglycans (PGs) have diverse functional roles, this study examined how these control cellular behavior and tissue function. The CNS/PNS extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic, responsive, highly interactive, space-filling, cell supportive, stabilizing structure maintaining tissue compartments, ionic microenvironments, and microgradients that regulate neuronal activity and maintain the neuron in an optimal ionic microenvironment. The CNS/PNS contains a high glycosaminoglycan content (60% hyaluronan, HA) and a diverse range of stabilizing PGs. Immobilization of HA in brain tissues by HA interactive hyalectan PGs preserves tissue hydration and neuronal activity, a paucity of HA in brain tissues results in a pro-convulsant epileptic phenotype. Diverse CS, KS, and HSPGs stabilize the blood–brain barrier and neurovascular unit, provide smart gel neurotransmitter neuron vesicle storage and delivery, organize the neuromuscular junction basement membrane, and provide motor neuron synaptic plasticity, and photoreceptor and neuron synaptic functions. PG-HA networks maintain ionic fluxes and microgradients and tissue compartments that contribute to membrane polarization dynamics essential to neuronal activation and neurotransduction. Hyalectans form neuroprotective perineuronal nets contributing to synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognitive learning. Sialoglycoprotein associated with cones and rods (SPACRCAN), an HA binding CSPG, stabilizes the inter-photoreceptor ECM. HSPGs pikachurin and eyes shut stabilize the photoreceptor synapse aiding in phototransduction and neurotransduction with retinal bipolar neurons crucial to visual acuity. This is achieved through Laminin G motifs in pikachurin, eyes shut, and neurexins that interact with the dystroglycan–cytoskeleton–ECM-stabilizing synaptic interconnections, neuronal interactive specificity, and co-ordination of regulatory action potentials in neural networks.</p>

                Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by neuronal loss accompanied by α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in the brain. While research conventionally focused on brain pathology, there is growing interest in peripheral alterations. Erythrocytes, which are rich in α-syn, have emerged as a compelling site for synucleinopathies-related alterations. Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing pathological α-syn species, can traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions and the gastrointestinal tract, where α-syn and gut microbiota interact extensively. This review explores the accumulating evidence of erythrocyte involvement in synucleinopathies, as well as their potential in disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. Given their unique properties, erythrocytes and erythrocyte-derived EVs may also serve as an ideal therapeutic platform for treating synucleinopathies and beyond.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93983">Neural activity ramps in frontal cortex signal extended motivation during learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning requires the ability to link actions to outcomes. How motivation facilitates learning is not well understood. We designed a behavioral task in which mice self-initiate trials to learn cue-reward contingencies and found that the anterior cingulate region of the prefrontal cortex (ACC) contains motivation-related signals to maximize rewards. In particular, we found that ACC neural activity was consistently tied to trial initiations where mice seek to leave unrewarded cues to reach reward-associated cues. Notably, this neural signal persisted over consecutive unrewarded cues until reward-associated cues were reached, and was required for learning. To determine how ACC inherits this motivational signal we performed projection-specific photometry recordings from several inputs to ACC during learning. In doing so, we identified a ramp in bulk neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-to-ACC projections as mice received unrewarded cues, which continued ramping across consecutive unrewarded cues, and finally peaked upon reaching a reward-associated cue, thus maintaining an extended motivational state. Cellular resolution imaging of OFC confirmed these neural correlates of motivation, and further delineated separate ensembles of neurons that sequentially tiled the ramp. Together, these results identify a mechanism by which OFC maps out task structure to convey an extended motivational state to ACC to facilitate goal-directed learning.

                HERV-K(HML-2), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact ORFs, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between <i>env</i> and the 3' LTR, derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K(HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8 derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87055">Firing rate adaptation affords place cell theta sweeps, phase precession, and procession</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells in freely moving rodents display both theta phase precession and procession, which is thought to play important roles in cognition, but the neural mechanism for producing theta phase shift remains largely unknown. Here, we show that firing rate adaptation within a continuous attractor neural network causes the neural activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling theta sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. These forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. By tuning the adaptation strength, our model explains the difference between ‘bimodal cells’ showing interleaved phase precession and procession, and ‘unimodal cells’ in which phase precession predominates. Our model also explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells’ firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. We hope that this study will aid an understanding of the neural mechanism supporting theta phase coding in the brain.

                To what extent does speech and music processing rely on domain-specific and domain-general neural networks? Using whole-brain intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural, continuous speech or music, we investigated the presence of frequency-specific and network-level brain activity. We combined it with a statistical approach in which a clear operational distinction is made between <i>shared</i>, <i>preferred,</i> and domain-<i>selective</i> neural responses. We show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of anatomical regional selectivity. Instead, domain-selective neural responses are restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints. Our work highlights the importance of considering natural stimuli and brain dynamics in their full complexity to map cognitive and brain functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97256">Energetic demands regulate sleep-wake rhythm circuit development</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life. As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In <i>Drosophila</i>, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory (LTM). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage (L3). Forcing mature (L3) animals to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock (DN1a)-arousal (Dh44) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94007">Multi-omic analysis of bat versus human fibroblasts reveals altered central metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Bats have unique characteristics compared to other mammals, including increased longevity and higher resistance to cancer and infectious disease. While previous studies have analyzed the metabolic requirements for flight, it is still unclear how bat metabolism supports these unique features, and no study has integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to characterize bat metabolism. In this work, we performed a multi-omics data analysis using a computational model of metabolic fluxes to identify fundamental differences in central metabolism between primary lung fibroblast cell lines from the black flying fox fruit bat (<i>Pteropus alecto</i>) and human. Bat cells showed higher expression levels of Complex I components of electron transport chain (ETC), but, remarkably, a lower rate of oxygen consumption. Computational modeling interpreted these results as indicating that Complex II activity may be low or reversed, similar to an ischemic state. An ischemic-like state of bats was also supported by decreased levels of central metabolites and increased ratios of succinate to fumarate in bat cells. Ischemic states tend to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which would be incompatible with the longevity of bats. However, bat cells had higher antioxidant reservoirs (higher total glutathione and higher ratio of NADPH to NADP) despite higher mitochondrial ROS levels. In addition, bat cells were more resistant to glucose deprivation and had increased resistance to ferroptosis, one of the characteristics of which is oxidative stress. Thus, our studies revealed distinct differences in the ETC regulation and metabolic stress responses between human and bat cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96797">Unraveling the role of urea hydrolysis in salt stress response during seed germination and seedling growth in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                Urea is intensively utilized as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture, originating either from root uptake or from catabolism of arginine by arginase. Despite its extensive use, the underlying physiological mechanisms of urea, particularly its adverse effects on seed germination and seedling growth under salt stress remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that salt stress induces excessive hydrolysis of arginine-derived urea, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic pH within seed radical cells, which, in turn, triggers salt-induced inhibition of seed germination (SISG) and hampers seedling growth. Our findings challenge the long-held belief that ammonium accumulation and toxicity are the primary causes of SISG, offering a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying these processes. This study provides significant insights into the physiological impact of urea hydrolysis under salt stress, contributing to a better understanding of SISG.

                Functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as revealed by strong oscillatory synchronization in the theta (6–11 Hz) frequency range, correlate with memory-guided decision-making. However, the degree to which this form of long-range synchronization influences memory-guided choice remains unclear. We developed a brain-machine interface that initiated task trials based on the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization, then measured choice outcomes. Trials initiated based on strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony were more likely to be correct compared to control trials on both working memory-dependent and -independent tasks. Prefrontal-thalamic neural interactions increased with prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony and optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus primarily entrained prefrontal theta rhythms, but dynamically modulated synchrony. Together, our results show that prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization leads to a higher probability of a correct choice and strengthens prefrontal-thalamic dialogue. Our findings reveal new insights into the neural circuit dynamics underlying memory-guided choices and highlight a promising technique to potentiate cognitive processes or behavior via brain-machine interfacing.

">White matter tract crossing and bottleneck regions in the fetal brain</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing interest in using diffusion MRI to study the white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the fetal brain. Recent progress in data acquisition and processing suggests that this imaging modality has a unique role in elucidating the normal and abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment in utero. However, there have been no efforts to quantify the prevalence of crossing tracts and bottleneck regions, important issues that have been extensively researched for adult brains. In this work, we determined the brain regions with crossing tracts and bottlenecks between 23 and 36 gestational weeks. We performed probabilistic tractography on 59 fetal brain scans and extracted a set of 51 distinct white tracts, which we grouped into 10 major tract bundle groups. We analyzed the results to determine the patterns of tract crossings and bottlenecks. Our results showed that 20-25% of the white matter voxels included two or three crossing tracts. Bottlenecks were more prevalent. Between 75-80% of the voxels were characterized as bottlenecks, with more than 40% of the voxels involving four or more tracts. The results of this study highlight the challenge of fetal brain tractography and structural connectivity assessment and call for innovative image acquisition and analysis methods to mitigate these problems.

">Velocities of Hippocampal Traveling Waves Proportional to Their Coherence Frequency</a></h4>

              
                Cortical traveling waves, characterized by their spatial, temporal, and frequency attributes, offer insights into active regions, timing, frequency, and the direction of activity propagation. Recent evidence suggests that these waves' directionality and spatiotemporal extent encode cognitive processes, yet the encoding mechanism related to their frequency remains unclear. We explore the hypothesis that coherence frequency dictates the velocity of wave propagation. Using nonlinear coherence analysis to compute propagation pathways among four local-field-potential signals collected along the human hippocampus's long axis, we present evidence that the coherence frequency of traveling waves encodes temporal communication aspects. Unlike linear analyses, which may overestimate velocities due to bidirectional flow when considering multiple pair coherences, nonlinear analysis treats pathways as holistic units with affectively unidirectional flow, making it more suitable for calculating wave velocities. Our findings reveal that propagation velocities along the hippocampus at low frequencies (<~35Hz) demonstrate a linear dependency on frequency, with an increased slope at higher frequencies, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Although observed within the hippocampus, these findings capture a dependency between frequency and velocity of traveling waves which may be applicable to other cortical areas as well.

                RNA expression levels are controlled by the complementary processes of synthesis and degradation. Although mis-regulation of RNA turnover is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, how it contributes to cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we profile the RNA stability landscape of the cortex across development and demonstrate that control of stability by the CCR4-NOT complex is essential for corticogenesis in vivo. First, we use SLAM-seq to measure RNA half-lives transcriptome-wide across multiple stages of cortical development. We characterize cis-acting features associated with RNA stability and find that RNAs that are upregulated across development tend to be more stable, while downregulated RNAs are less stable. To probe how disruption of RNA turnover impacts cortical development, we assess developmental requirements of CNOT3, a core component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Mutations in CNOT3 are associated with human neurodevelopmental disorders, however its role in cortical development is unknown. Conditional knockout of Cnot3 in neural progenitors and their progeny in the developing mouse cortex leads to severe microcephaly due to reduced neuron production and p53-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned control of RNA turnover is crucial for brain development.

                The superior colliculus (SC) receives inputs from various brain regions in a layer- and radial location-specific manner, but whether the SC exhibits location-specific dynamics remains unclear. To address this issue, we recorded the spiking activity of single SC neurons while photoactivating cortical areas in awake head-fixed Thy1-ChR2 rats. We classified 309 neurons that responded significantly into 8 clusters according to the response dynamics. Among them, neurons with monophasic excitatory responses (7-12 ms latency) that returned to baseline within 20 ms were commonly observed in the optic and intermediate gray layers of centromedial and centrolateral SC. In contrast, neurons with complex polyphasic responses were commonly observed in the deep layers of the anterolateral SC. Cross-correlation analysis suggested that the complex pattern could be only partly explained by an internal circuit of the deep gray layer. Our results indicate that medial to centrolateral SC neurons simply relay cortical activity, whereas neurons in the deep layers of the anterolateral SC dynamically integrate inputs from the cortex, SNr, CN, and local circuits. These findings suggest a spatial gradient in SC integration, with a division of labor between simple relay circuits and those integrating complex dynamics.

                The superior colliculus (SC) is the main brain region regulating innate defensive behaviors to visual threat. Yet, how the SC integrates binocular visual information and to what extent binocular vision drives defensive behaviors is unknown. Here, we show that binocular vision facilitates visually-evoked escape behavior. Furthermore, we find that SC neurons respond to binocular visual input with diverse synaptic and spiking responses, and summate visual inputs largely sublinearly. Using pathway-specific optogenetic silencing we find that contralateral and ipsilateral visual information is carried to binocular SC neurons through retinal, interhemispheric and corticotectal pathways. These pathways carry binocular visual input to the SC in a layer-specific manner, with superficial layers receiving visual information through retinal input, whereas intermediate and deep layers rely on interhemispheric and corticotectal pathways. Together, our data shed light on the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying binocular visual processing in the SC and its role in escape behavior.

">ASO-enhancement of TARDBP exitron splicing mitigates TDP-43 proteinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by pathological aggregation and nuclear functional loss of TDP-431,2. Current therapies inadequately address this core pathology3,4, necessitating innovative approaches that target aggregation while preserving TDP-43's essential functions. Here we demonstrate that enhancing the splicing of the TARDBP exitron--a cryptic intron encoding the aggregation-prone intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of TDP-435,6--effectively mitigates TDP-43 pathology. This exitron splicing event, directly regulated by nuclear TDP-437-9, suppresses the expression of IDR-containing TDP-43 isoforms and generates IDR-spliced-out TDP-43 isoforms7,9,10 (which we term "IDRsTDP"). Our findings reveal that IDRsTDP, known to heterodimerize with full-length TDP-4310, inhibits TDP-43 aggregation by suppressing IDR-mediated clustering and enhances TDP-43 clearance via chaperone-mediated autophagy. In disease states, however, impaired nuclear TDP-43 function disrupts exitron splicing, leading to increased levels of IDR-containing TDP-439,11 and reduced levels of IDRsTDP, exacerbating aggregation and nuclear dysfunction6,12-17. By identifying HNRNPA1 and HNRNPC as key repressors of TARDBP exitron splicing, we designed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to block their binding and restore splicing. These ASOs suppressed TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration in both neuronal cell models with impaired nuclear transport and a mouse model of proteasome dysfunction-induced TDP-43 proteinopathy. Our strategy, by rescuing the impaired autoregulatory pathway, inhibits the pathological cycle of TDP-43 aggregation and nuclear dysfunction, offering a promising avenue for treating these currently intractable neurodegenerative diseases.

">Correlated spontaneous activity sets up multi-sensory integration in the developing higher-order cortex</a></h4>

              
                To perceive and navigate complex sensory environments, animals combine sensory information from multiple modalities in specialized brain circuits. Known as multisensory integration, this process typically depends on the existence of co-aligned topographic connections from several sensory areas to downstream circuits exhibiting multimodal representations. How such topographically co-aligned connectivity necessary for multisensory integration gets set up in early stages of development is still unknown. Inspired by the role of spontaneous activity in refining topographic connectivity between early sensory circuits, here we investigated the potential of such spontaneous activity to also guide the co-alignment of multiple sensory modalities in RL, a higher-order associative cortical area rostro-lateral to V1. Analyzing spontaneous activity simultaneously recorded in primary visual and somatosensory cortex and area RL at different developmental ages before sensory experience, we identify candidate features of this activity to guide the emergence of co-aligned topographic multisensory projections with somatosensory leading the visual projection. We confirm this hypothesis using a computational model of activity-dependent circuit refinement, and show that the correlation of spontaneous activity between the visual and somatosensory primary cortex can establish an optimal fraction of multisensory neurons in RL for stimulus decoding. Our model provides an exciting new computational perspective of the role of spontaneous activity in the emergence of topographically co-aligned multimodal sensory representations in downstream circuits, specialized for the processing of rich sensory environments.

">How do we imagine a speech? A triple network model for situationally simulated inner speech</a></h4>

              
                Inner speech is a silent verbal experience and plays central roles in human consciousness and cognition. Despite impressive studies over the past decades, the neural mechanisms of inner speech remain largely unknown. In this study, we adopted an ecological paradigm called situationally simulated inner speech. Unlike mere imaging speech of words, situationally simulated inner speech involves the dynamic integration of contextual background, episodic and semantic memories, and external events into a coherent structure. We conducted dynamic activation and network analyses on fMRI data, where participants were instructed to engage in inner speech prompted by cue words across 10 different contextual backgrounds. Our seed-based co-activation pattern analyses revealed dynamic involvement of the language network, sensorimotor network, and default mode network in situationally simulated inner speech. Additionally, frame-wise dynamic conditional correlation analysis uncovered four temporal-reoccurring states with distinct functional connectivity patterns among these networks. We proposed a triple network model for deliberate inner speech, including language network for a truncated form of overt speech, sensorimotor network for perceptual simulation and monitoring, and default model network for integration and 'sense-making' processing.

">CB-1 receptor agonist drastically changes oscillatory activity, defining active sleep</a></h4>

              
                Brain oscillations in different behavioral states are essential for cognition, and oscillopathies contribute to cognitive dysfunction in neuro-psychiatric diseases. Cannabis-1 receptor (CB1-R) activation was reported to suppress theta and fast gamma activities in rats during waking exploration, and here, we show that cannabis fundamentally alters network activity during sleep, as well. Prominent theta rhythm is present in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), whereas fast oscillations appear as regular sequences of sleep spindles during intermediate sleep (IS) - both implicated in dreaming and memory consolidation. The CB1-R agonist disrupted these mechanisms, restructuring IS-REMS episodes; IS lengthened 6-fold and intruded REMS, where on-going theta was drastically reduced. The spindle architecture was also affected; its amplitude increased, and its peak frequency down-shifted into the theta range. Cannabis is known to induce psychotic-like conditions and cognitive deficits; thus, our results may help in understanding the dual effect of cannabis on cognitive states and the role of network oscillations in psychiatric pathology.

">The Origin of Cognitive Modules for Face Processing: A Computational Evolutionary Perspective</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive research, understanding how cognitive modules emerge remains elusive due to the complex interplay of genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. Computational modeling, however, provides a means of exploring their origins by directly manipulating these factors. Here we aimed to investigate the emergence of cognitive modules by developing the Dual-Task Meta-Learning Partitioned (DAMP) model, whose plastic architecture facilitates automatic structure optimization through a genetic algorithm that emulates natural selection by iteratively selecting for efficient learning fitness. We found that a specialized module for face identification robustly emerged in the DAMP model. Critically, the emergence of the face module was not influenced by the demands of cognitive tasks (identification versus categorization) or the type of stimuli (faces versus non-face objects). Instead, it was determined by the structural constraint of sparse connectivity within the network, suggesting that the face module may arise as an adaptation strategy to challenges posed by sparse connections in neural networks, rather than being an information processor required by certain stimuli or tasks. These findings provide a new evolutionary perspective on the formation of cognitive modules in the human brain, highlighting the pivotal role of the structural properties of neural networks in shaping their cognitive functionality.

">TREM2 expression level is critical for microglial state, metabolic capacity and efficacy of TREM2 agonism</a></h4>

              
                Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a central regulator of microglial activity and sequence variants are major risk factors for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). To better understand the molecular and functional changes associated with TREM2 signalling, we generated a TREM2 reporter mouse model and observed a gradual upregulation of reporter expression with increasing plaque proximity. Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA-sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of A{beta} pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, we performed chronic treatment with a brain penetrant TREM2 agonist and identified a window of TREM2 expression where microglia are most responsive. Thus, our data provide novel insights into TREM2-mediated regulation of microglial metabolic function and informs current efforts to bring TREM2 agonists into clinical application.

">Precuneus activity during retrieval is positively associated with amyloid burden in cognitively normal older APOE4 carriers</a></h4>

              
                The precuneus is an early site of amyloid-beta accumulation. Previous cross-sectional studies reported increased precuneus fMRI activity in older adults with mild cognitive deficits or elevated amyloid-beta. However, longitudinal studies in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk stages are lacking and the interaction with Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype is unclear. In the PREVENT-AD cohort, we assessed how precuneus activity during successful memory retrieval at baseline and over time relates to future amyloid-beta and tau burden and to change in memory performance. We further studied the moderation by APOE4 genotype. We included 165 older adults (age: 62.8 years; 113 female; 66 APOE4 carriers) who were cognitively normal at baseline and had a family history of AD. All participants performed task-fMRI at baseline and underwent [18F]-flortaucipir PET and [18F]-NAV4694 amyloid PET on average 5 years later. We found that higher baseline activity and greater longitudinal change in activity in precuneus were associated with higher subsequent amyloid-beta in APOE4 carriers but not non-carriers. There were no effects of precuneus activity on tau burden. Finally, APOE4 non-carriers with low baseline activity in the precuneus exhibited better longitudinal performance in an independent memory test compared to APOE4 non-carriers with high baseline activity and APOE4 carriers. Our findings suggest that higher task-related precuneus activity at baseline and over time are associated with subsequent amyloid-beta burden in cognitively normal APOE4 carriers. Our results further indicate that the absence of hyperactivation and the absence of the APOE4 allele is related with the best future cognitive outcome in cognitively normal older adults at risk for AD.

">The interpretation attributed to observed gaze shifts affects their social-cueing effect</a></h4>

              
                In an environment busy with abundant stimulation, individuals must rely on attentional cues to select the most relevant targets. As social creatures, a crucial strategy involves monitoring where others are focusing their attention and following them, assuming that locations attended by others are more likely to yield benefits than other locations. Given that gaze shifts represent a visible shift in attention, mirroring the gaze shifts of others can serve as an effective, social-attentional strategy. Indeed, research demonstrates that observing others redirect their gaze results in a reflexive shift of attention, reflected by improved perceptual performance for objects located at the gazed-at positions. This phenomenon is known as the gaze cueing effect (GCE). However, gaze shifts may not always align with the direction of attention. Individuals often avert their gaze while they are engaged in demanding cognitive tasks. Such gaze shifts signify internal focus rather than shifting attention outward. Here we hypothesize that the response to a gaze-shift cue is not reflexive but is contingent upon social context. In two pre-registered experiments, participants viewed videos of gaze shifts and engaged in a perceptual task, with one group primed to perceive the gaze shifts as reflecting cognitive processing rather than overt attentional shifts. Results indicated that GCE was suppressed in this group, suggesting that GCE is influenced by contextual cues framing the nature of the gaze shifts. These findings suggest that social attention is flexible and depends on the specific interpretation of the social context.

                Penetrating recording neural electrodes prepared from materials with miniaturized geometrical size could improve the longevity of implants by reducing the chronic inflammatory response. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) microfibers with tunable porous structures have a large electrochemical surface area (ESA)/ geometrical surface area (GSA) ratio that has been reported to possess low impedance and high charge injection capacity (CIC), yet the control of the porous structure remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we introduce wet-spun rGO electrodes with pores tuned by sucrose concentrations in the coagulation bath. The electrochemical properties of thermally reduced rGO were optimized by adjusting the ratio of rGO to sucrose, resulting in significantly lower impedance, higher CIC, and higher charge storage capacity (CSC) than platinum microwires. Tensile and insertion tests confirmed that optimized electrodes had sufficient strength to ensure a 100% insertion success rate with low angle shift, thus allowing precise implantation without the need for additional mechanical enhancement. Acute in-vivo recordings from the auditory cortex found low impedance benefits from the recorded amplitude of spikes, leading to an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Ex-vivo recordings from hippocampal brain slices demonstrate that it is possible to record and/or stimulate with rGO electrodes with good fidelity compared with conventional electrodes.

">ARGX-119, a therapeutic agonist antibody targeting MuSK</a></h4>

              
                ARGX-119 is a novel, humanized, agonist monoclonal SIMPLE Antibody specific for muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) that is being developed for treatment of patients with neuromuscular diseases. ARGX-119 is the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the Frizzled-like domain of human, non-human primate, rat and mouse MuSK, without off-target binding, making it suitable for clinical development. Within the Fc-region, ARGX-119 harbors L234A, L235A mutations to diminish potential immune-activating effector functions. Its mode-of-action is to activate MuSK without interfering with its natural ligand neural Agrin, and cluster acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in a dose-dependent manner, thereby stabilizing neuromuscular function. In a mouse model for DOK7 congenital myasthenia (CM), ARGX-119 prevented early postnatal lethality and reversed disease relapse by restoring neuromuscular function and reducing muscle weakness and fatigability in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in non-human primates, rats and mice revealed non-linear PK behavior of ARGX-119, indicative of target-mediated-drug disposition (TMDD) and in vivo target engagement. Instability of neuromuscular synapses contributes to symptoms in many neuromuscular diseases for example congenital myasthenia (CM), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). ARGX-119 is a novel, first-in-class MuSK agonist mAb in clinical development. Based on this proof-of-concept study, it has the potential to alleviate neuromuscular diseases hallmarked by impaired neuromuscular synaptic function.

">Circulating Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell load and disease severity are associated to an enhanced oligodendroglial production in a murine model of multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of disease severity and tissue damage extent. Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results: Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion: Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.

">Multi-Omic Analysis Reveals Lipid Dysregulation Associated with Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease Brain</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent condition within the aging population. PD can be attributed to rare genetic mutations, but most cases are sporadic where the gene-environment interactions are unknown/likely contributory. Age related dysregulation of the glycosphingolipid degradation pathway has been implicated in the development of PD, however, our understanding of how brain lipids vary across different regions of the brain, with age and in disease stages, remains limited. In this study we profiled several phospho- and sphingolipid classes in eight distinct regions of the human brain and investigated the association of lipids with a spatio-temporal pathology gradient, utilising PD samples from early, mid, and late stages of the disease. We performed high-precision tissue sampling in conjunction with targeted LC-MS/MS and applied this to post-mortem samples from PD and control subjects. The lipids were analysed for correlations with untargeted proteomics and mitochondrial activity data, in a multi-omics approach. We concluded that the different brain regions demonstrated their own distinct profiles and also found that several lipids were correlated with age. The strongest differences between PD and controls were identified in ganglioside, sphingomyelin and n-hexosylceramides. Sphingomyelin was also found to correlate with several proteins implicated in Parkinson's disease pathways. Mitochondrial activity was correlated with the levels of several lipids in the putamen region. Finally, we identified a gradient corresponding to Braak's disease spread across the brain regions, where the areas closer to the brainstem/substantia nigra showed alterations in PC, LPC and glycosphingolipids, while the cortical regions showed changes in glycosphingolipids, specifically gangliosides, HexCer and Hex2Cer.

">Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase transforms carotid occlusion-mediated benign oligemia into de novo large cerebral infarction</a></h4>

              
                It remains unclear why unilateral proximal carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) causes benign oligemia, without progressing to cerebral infarction, in mice, yet leads to a wide variety of outcomes (ranging from asymptomatic to death) in humans. We hypothesized that inhibition of NOS both transforms UCAO-mediated oligemia into full infarction and expands pre-existing infarction. In support, intraperitoneal administration of N{omega}-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) followed by UCAO induced large-arterial infarction in mice, unlike UCAO alone. Six-hour laser-speckle-contrast imaging detected spreading ischemia in mice with infarction as assessed at 24h. In agreement with vasoconstriction/microthrombus formation shown by intravital microscopy, the NO-donor, molsidomine and the endothelial-NOS-activating antiplatelet, cilostazol, attenuated or prevented progression to infarction. Moreover, UCAO without L-NAME caused infarction in mice with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, which, in turn, were associated with greater symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) levels. Further, increased levels of glucose and cholesterol associated with significantly larger infarct volumes in 438 consecutive patients with UCAO-mediated infarction. Lastly, Mendelian randomization identified a causative role of NOS inhibition, particularly in elevated SDMA concentration, in ischemic stroke risk. Therefore, NOS activity is a key factor determining the fate of hypoperfused brain following acute carotid occlusion, where SDMA could be a potential risk predictor.

">Deep Neural Networks to Register and Annotate the Cells of the C. elegans Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Aligning and annotating the heterogeneous cell types that make up complex cellular tissues remains a major challenge in the analysis of biomedical imaging data. Here, we present a series of deep neural networks that allow for automatic non-rigid registration and cell identification in the context of the nervous system of freely-moving C. elegans. A semi-supervised learning approach was used to train a C. elegans registration network (BrainAlignNet) that aligns pairs of images of the bending C. elegans head with single pixel-level accuracy. When incorporated into an image analysis pipeline, this network can link neuronal identities over time with 99.6% accuracy. A separate network (AutoCellLabeler) was trained to annotate >100 neuronal cell types in the C. elegans head based on multi-spectral fluorescence of genetic markers. This network labels >100 different cell types per animal with 98% accuracy, exceeding individual human labeler performance by aggregating knowledge across manually labeled datasets. Finally, we trained a third network (CellDiscoveryNet) to perform unsupervised discovery and labeling of >100 cell types in the C. elegans nervous system by analyzing unlabeled multi-spectral imaging data from many animals. The performance of CellDiscoveryNet matched that of trained human labelers. These tools will be useful for a wide range of applications in C. elegans research and should be straightforward to generalize to many other applications requiring alignment and annotation of dense heterogeneous cell types in complex tissues.

">Leveraging Grating-Based Flickers: A Leap Toward Practical, Visually Comfortable, and High-Performance Dry EEG Code-VEP BCI</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Reactive Brain-Computer Interfaces (rBCIs) typically rely on repetitive visual stimuli, which can strain the eyes and cause attentional distraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach rooted in visual neuroscience to design visual Stimuli for Augmented Response (StAR). The StAR stimuli consist of small randomly-oriented Gabor or Ricker patches that optimize foveal neural response while reducing peripheral distraction. Methods: In a factorial design study, 24 participants equipped with an 8-dry electrodes EEG system focused on series of target flickers presented under three formats: traditional 'Plain' flickers, Gabor-based, or Ricker-based flickers. These flickers were part of a five-classes Code Visually Evoked Potentials (c-VEP) paradigm featuring low frequency, short, and aperiodic visual flashes. Results: Subjective ratings revealed that Gabor and Ricker gratings were visually comfortable and nearly invisible in peripheral vision compared to plain flickers. Moreover, Gabor and Ricker-based textures achieved higher accuracy (93.6% and 96.3%, respectively) with only 88 seconds of calibration data, compared to plain flickers (65.6%). A follow-up online implementation of this experiment was conducted to validate our findings within the frame of naturalistic operations. During this trial, remarkable accuracies of 97.5% in a cued task and 94.3% in an asynchronous digicode task were achieved, with a mean decoding time as low as 1.68 seconds. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential to expand BCI applications beyond the lab by integrating visually unobtrusive systems with gel-free, low density EEG technology, thereby making BCIs more accessible and efficient. The datasets, algorithms, and BCI implementations are shared through open-access repositories.

">The Three Stages of Learning to Master a Sensory Augmentation Device: Activation - Acquisition - Integration</a></h4>

              
                By augmenting sensory perception through technology, researchers study how humans use and perceive the novel sensory input provided. Nevertheless, little is known about how learning unfolds over time. To this end, 27 participants trained with an augmentation device (feelSpace belt), which provides tactile feedback about the direction of the cardinal north, over the course of six weeks. During the training phase, we tracked participants' progress using two different self-report questionnaires containing Likert-scale and open questions. Experts quantified responses to open questions using a previously established category system. As human raters are known to be susceptible to biases, we later reproduced the expert categorization using ChatGPT-4, finding a high congruence between the two classification approaches. The results suggest a three-stage model that best describes the process of acquiring an augmented sense. During the early activation stage, processing the augmented signal requires effort, induces fatigue, and a heightened awareness of the environment. In the knowledge acquisition phase, participants develop a more detailed cognitive spatial representation containing information about objects and places in relation to their current location. The deep integration stage is marked by participants seamlessly integrating the augmented information into existing perceptual processes and automatic use. The results support the supervised use of large language models (LLMs) for the analysis of qualitative data.

">Influence of temporal information gaps on decision making: describing the dynamics of working memory</a></h4>

              
                During decision making, choices are made based on assessing potential options and their expected outcomes. Traditional laboratory investigations of decision making often employ tasks involving the discrimination of perceptual evidence, where sensory information is constant and presented continuously. However, during natural behavior, this is unlikely the case. Usually, perceptual information is dynamic and presented intermittently, which requires maintaining information in memory. Thus, understanding decision making requires considering the dynamics of working memory. Here, we used a perceptual decision-making task where fifteen tokens jump from a central circle to one of two peripheral ones and disappear shortly after. Participants were required to report which target they believed would have received most tokens by the trial's end. Half of the trials included a temporal gap, during which no information was displayed. In those cases, we found that participants made choices with less available information, but their accuracy remained unchanged. Computational modeling revealed that this behavior was best explained by a model in which stored perceptual information leaks away due to the arrival of new information, rather than by the passage of time. Our results provide evidence of a decision-making process that evolves even in the absence of perceptual information, challenging the idea of a frozen state resilient to temporal gaps and shedding light on the dynamics of working memory. This study highlights the importance of considering working memory dynamics in understanding decision-making processes, particularly in environments with intermittent perceptual information.

">Pre-stimulus Activity Mediates Event-Related Theta Synchronization and Alpha Desynchronization During Memory Formation in Healthy Aging</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to learn is a key determinant for the quality of life but is known to decline to varying degrees with age. However, despite mounting evidence of memory deficits in older age, the neural mechanisms contributing to successful or impeded memory remain unclear. Previous research has primarily focused on memory formation through remembered versus forgotten comparisons, lacking the ability to capture the incremental nature of learning. Moreover, previous EEG studies have primarily examined oscillatory brain activity during the encoding phase, such as event-related synchronization (ERS) of mid-frontal theta and desynchronisation (ERD) of parietal alpha, while neglecting the potential influence of pre-stimulus activity. To address these limitations, we employed a sequence learning paradigm, where 113 young and 117 older participants learned a fixed sequence of visual locations through repeated observations (6423 sequence repetitions, 55 '944 stimuli). This paradigm enabled us to investigate mid-frontal theta ERS, parietal alpha ERD, and how they are affected by pre-stimulus activity during the incremental learning process. Behavioral results revealed that young subjects learned significantly faster than older subjects, in line with expected age-related cognitive decline. Successful incremental learning was directly linked to decreases of mid-frontal theta ERS and increases of parietal alpha ERD. Notably, these neurophysiological changes were less pronounced in older individuals, reflecting a slower rate of learning. Importantly, the mediation analysis revealed that in both age groups, mid-frontal pre-stimulus theta partially mediated the relationship between learning and mid-frontal theta ERS. Furthermore, the overall impact of learning on parietal alpha ERD was primarily driven by its positive influence on pre-stimulus alpha activity. Our findings offer new insights into the age-related differences in memory formation and highlight the importance of pre-stimulus activity in explaining post-stimulus responses during learning.

">Normative trajectories of R1, R2* and magnetic susceptibility in basal ganglia on healthy ageing</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative MRI techniques, including R1, R2*, and magnetic susceptibility mapping, have emerged as promising tools for generating surrogate imaging markers of brain tissue microstructure, enabling non-invasive in vivo measurements associated with myelination and iron deposition. Gaining insights into how these quantitative measurements evolve throughout a normal lifespan can enhance our understanding of brain maturation processes and facilitate the study of disease-related microstructural changes by distinguishing pathological alterations from normal brain development. In this study, we established the normative trajectories of R1, R2*, and magnetic susceptibility in the basal ganglia at 3T. We used a healthy ageing cohort comprising 260 subjects with an evenly distributed age range and sex ratio throughout adulthood. Utilizing the non-parametric Gaussian Process Regression model to derive the normative trajectories, we found that R1 in these structures predominantly exhibit a quadratic shape over age, while R2* and magnetic susceptibility are primarily linear. We validated the normative trajectories of R2* and magnetic susceptibility using an independent cohort. Additionally, we demonstrated that the spatial distributions of the quantitative MRI parameters also change with age in the putamen and caudate nucleus. This study not only reinforces existing findings on the association between age and qMRI but also provides valuable resources for studying cognitive ageing, in conjunction with the behavioural data available in the same data collection.

">Ex vivo functional characterization of mouse olfactory bulb projection neurons reveals a heterogenous continuum</a></h4>

              
                Mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) act as an input convergence hub and transmit information to higher olfactory areas. Since first characterized, they have been classed as distinct projection neurons based on size and location: laminarly-arranged mitral cells with a diameter larger than 20m in the mitral layer (ML), and smaller tufted cells spread across both the ML and external plexiform layer (EPL). Recent in vivo work has shown that these neurons encode complementary olfactory information, akin to parallel channels in other sensory systems. Yet, many ex vivo studies still collapse them into a single class, mitral/tufted, when describing their physiological properties and impact on circuit function. Using immunohistochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in fixed or acute slices from adult mice, we attempted to align in vivo and ex vivo data and test a soma size-based classifier of OB projection neurons using passive and intrinsic firing properties. We found that there is no clear separation between cell types based on passive or active properties. Rather, there is a heterogeneous continuum with three loosely clustered subgroups: EPL tufted cells, putative tufted cells, and putative mitral cells in the ML. These findings illustrate the large functional heterogeneity present within the OB projection neurons and complement existing literature highlighting how heterogeneity in sensory systems is preponderant and possibly used in the OB to decode complex olfactory information.

">Sensory dependencies rapidly and autonomously yield generalizable representations in recurrent cortical-like networks</a></h4>

              
                How biological brains can learn so quickly to become operational and achieve complex behavior remains an unresolved issue. Here we introduce a neuromorphic learning strategy that resembles how immature biological brains learn by consisting of continual random activations of a complex mechanically coupled system with rich, dynamic intrinsic sensor dependencies, in this regard reminiscent of a biological body. Using a dynamic model of biological skin tissue with embedded sensors, we trained small, recurrent networks that emulated a primordial cortex and featured excitatory and inhibitory neurons with simultaneous independent learning in both types of synapses. Training with non-repetitive, random activations of the skin, where the recurrent network activity state was inherited between activations, autonomously led to rapid acquisition of remarkably generalizable representations of a predictive nature. The network could separate inputs and solve a kinematics task that had never been encountered, also after substantial parts of the sensor population were deleted. This strategy of focussing learning on the dominant regularities in dynamic sensory information can potentially explain complex brain operation and efficient learning.

">Tensor Kernel Learning for Classification of Alzheimer's Conditions using Multimodal Data</a></h4>

              
                Early, timely, and accurate assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly at its earlier stage- mild cognitive impairment (MCI) -, is central to detecting, managing, and potentially treating the disease. The biological underpinnings of AD, however, is multifaceted, from genetic variations, abnormal protein accumulation, to irregular brain functions and structure. A joint analysis of these data, therefore, may offer potentially new insights about AD-related biomarkers and AD prediction. But such explorations must confront the complexity of these data: heterogeneity, multimodality and high-dimensionality. Here, to address these challenges, we propose a new machine-learning method, namely the tensor kernel learning (TKL), leveraging tensor methods and kernel learning, to enhance AD assessment by enhancing multi-modal data integration. More specifically, TKL first uses CP/PARAFAC decomposition and graph diffusion to fuse multiple kernels learned from four complementary data modalities (MRI, PET, CSF, and SNP data). We then used a supervised kernel for a kernel SVM classifier to identify potential patients. To evaluate the effectiveness of TKL, we apply it to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; sample size n = 331 subjects), including cognitively normal individuals (CN), MCI subjects, and AD patients. TKL improves AD classification performance in both linear and nonlinear combinations, achieving accuracies of 91.31% for CN vs. AD, 81.45% for CN vs. MCI, and 78.27% for AD vs. MCI, compared to 85.48%, 70.89%, and 73.51% using the best single modality. Additionally, TKL reveals clearer, more structured patterns in the data, enhancing interpretation and understanding of the relationships among different modalities. Detailed implementation details of our method can be found at: https://github.com/thanhvd18/Tensor-Kernel-Learning-matlab.

">Spike inference from mouse spinal cord calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Calcium imaging is a key method to record the spiking activity of identified and genetically targeted neurons. However, the observed calcium signals are only an indirect readout of the underlying electrophysiological events (single spikes or bursts of spikes) and require dedicated algorithms to recover the spike rate. These algorithms for spike inference can be optimized using ground truth data from combined electrical and optical recordings, but it is not clear how such optimized algorithms perform on cell types and brain regions for which ground truth does not exist. Here, we use a state-of-the-art algorithm based on supervised deep learning (CASCADE) and a non-supervised algorithm based on non-negative deconvolution (OASIS) to test spike inference in spinal cord neurons. To enable these tests, we recorded specific ground truth from glutamatergic and GABAergic somatosensory neurons in the dorsal horn of spinal cord in mice of both sexes. We find that CASCADE and OASIS algorithms that were designed for cortical excitatory neurons generalize well to both spinal cord cell types. However, CASCADE models re-trained on our ground truth further improved the performance, resulting in a more accurate inference of spiking activity from spinal cord neurons. We openly provide re-trained models that can be flexibly applied to spinal cord data of variable noise levels and frame rates. Together, our ground-truth recordings and analyses provide a solid foundation for the interpretation of calcium imaging data from spinal cord and showcase how spike inference can generalize between different regions of the nervous system.

">An enhancer-AAV toolbox to target and manipulate distinct interneuron subtypes</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, we and others have identified a number of enhancers that, when incorporated into rAAV vectors, can restrict the transgene expression to particular neuronal populations. Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate fine neuronal subtypes are still limited. Here, we performed systematic analysis of single cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the cortical interneuron subtypes. We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic neurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP) and manipulate (opto- or chemo-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species. Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.

">Adolescent alcohol exposure alters age-related progression of behavioral and neurotrophic dysfunction in the TgF344-AD model in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) and heavy alcohol use are widely prevalent and lead to brain pathology. Both alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) and AD result in cholinergic dysfunction, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and the emergence of hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments. It is unknown how ARBD during a critical developmental period, such as adolescents, interacts with AD-related pathologies to accelerate disease progression later in life. The current study utilized a longitudinal design to characterize behavioral and pathological changes in a transgenic rat model of AD (TgF344-AD) following adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. We found that AIE accelerates cognitive decline associated with AD transgenes in female rats at 6 months of age, and male AD-rats are impaired on spatial navigation by 3-months with no additional deficits due to AIE exposure. Protein levels of various AD-pathological markers were analyzed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of male and female rats. The data suggests that AIE-induced alterations of the tropomyosin-related kinase A receptor / p75 neurotrophin receptor ratio creates a brain that is vulnerable to age- and AD-related pathologies, which leads to an acceleration of cognitive decline, particularly in female rats.

	<p>Self-ambivalence, a prevalent phenomenon in daily life, has been increasingly substantiated by research. It refers to conflicting self-views and evaluations, primarily concerning self-worth and morality. Previous behavioral research has distinguished self-worth and moral ambivalence, but it remains unclear whether they have separable neural bases. The present study addressed this question by examining resting-state brain activity (i.e., the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and connectivity (i.e., resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC) in 112 college students. The results found that self-worth ambivalence was positively related to the fALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and left superior parietal lobule (SPL). The RSFC strength between the SPL and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was positively related to self-worth ambivalence. Moral ambivalence was positively associated with the fALFF in the left SPL (extending into the temporoparietal junction) and right SPL. The RSFC strengths between the left SPL/TPJ and OFC, as well as the RSFC strengths between the right SPL as a seed and the bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyrus, were associated with moral ambivalence. Overall, the neural bases of self-worth and moral ambivalence are associated with the SPL and OFC, involved in attentional alertness and value representation, respectively. Additionally, the neural basis of moral ambivalence is associated with the TPJ, responsible for mentalizing.</p>

	<p>In recent decades, the debate on consciousness has been conditioned by the idea of bottom-up emergence, which has influenced scientific research and raised a few obstacles to any attempt to bridge the explanatory gap. The analysis and explanation of vision conducted according to the accredited methodologies of scientific research in terms of physical stimuli, objectivity, methods, and explanation has encountered the resistance of subjective experience. Moreover, original Gestalt research into vision has generally been merged with cognitive neuroscience. Experimental phenomenology, building on the legacy of Gestalt psychology, has obtained new results in the fields of amodal contours and color stratifications, light perception, figurality, space, so-called perceptual illusions, and subjective space and time. Notwithstanding the outcomes and the impulse given to neuroscientific analyses, the research carried out around these phenomena has never directly confronted the issue of what it means to be conscious or, in other words, the nature of consciousness as self-referentiality. Research has tended to focus on the percept. Therefore, explaining the non-detachability of parts in subjective experience risks becoming a sort of impossible achievement, similar to that of Baron Munchausen, who succeeds in escaping unharmed from this quicksand by pulling himself out by his hair. This paper addresses how to analyze seeing as an undivided whole by discussing several basic dimensions of phenomenal consciousness on an experimental basis and suggesting an alternative way of escaping this quicksand. This mind-set reversal also sheds light on the organization and dependence relationships between phenomenology, psychophysics, and neuroscience.</p>

	<p>Studies on decision-making have classically focused exclusively on its cognitive component. Recent research has shown that a further essential component of decisional processes is the emotional one. Indeed, the emotional route in decision-making plays a crucial role, especially in situations characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, and risk. Despite that, individual differences concerning such components and their associations with individual traits, decisional styles, and psychophysiological profiles are still understudied. This pilot study aimed at investigating the relationship between individual propensity toward using an emotional or cognitive information-processing route in decision-making, EEG and autonomic correlates of the decisional performance as collected via wearable non-invasive devices, and individual personality and decisional traits. Participants completed a novel task based on realistic decisional scenarios while their physiological activity (EEG and autonomic indices) was monitored. Self-report questionnaires were used to collect data on personality traits, individual differences, and decisional styles. Data analyses highlighted two main findings. Firstly, different personality traits and decisional styles showed significant and specific correlations, with an individual propensity toward either emotional or cognitive information processing for decision-making. Secondly, task-related EEG and autonomic measures presented a specific and distinct correlation pattern with different decisional styles, maximization traits, and personality traits, suggesting different latent profiles.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is primarily characterized by core deficits in social skills, communication, and cognition and by repetitive stereotyped behaviors. These manifestations are variable between individuals, and ASD pathogenesis is complex, with over a thousand implicated genes, many epigenetic factors, and multiple environmental influences. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) mediated brain reward system is held to play a key role, but the rapidly expanding literature reveals intricate, nuanced signaling involving a wide array of mesolimbic loci, neurotransmitters and receptor subtypes, and neuronal variants. How altered DA signaling may constitute a downstream convergence of the manifold causal origins of ASD is not well understood. A clear working framework of ASD pathogenesis may help delineate common stages and potential diagnostic and interventional opportunities. Hence, we summarize the known natural history of ASD in the context of emerging data and perspectives to update ASD reward signaling. Then, against this backdrop, we proffer a provisional framework that organizes ASD pathogenesis into successive levels, including (1) genetic and epigenetic changes, (2) disrupted mesolimbic reward signaling pathways, (3) dysregulated neurotransmitter/DA signaling, and finally, (4) altered neurocognitive and social behavior and possible antagonist/agonist based ASD interventions. This subdivision of ASD into a logical progression of potentially addressable parts may help facilitate the rational formulation of diagnostics and targeted treatments.</p>

	<p>Breast cancer (BC) and depression are globally prevalent problems. Numerous reviews have indicated the high prevalence of depression among BC survivors. However, the long-term impact of depression on survival among BC survivors has not been well explored. For this investigation, we aimed to explore the relationship between BC, depression, and mortality from a national random sample of adult American women. Data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (years 2005&amp;amp;ndash;2010) were linked with mortality data from the National Death Index up to December 31st, 2019. A total of 4719 adult women (ages 45 years and older) were included in the study sample with 5.1% having breast cancer and more than a tenth (12.7%) having depression. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality risk among those with BC was 1.50 (95% CI = 1.05&amp;amp;ndash;2.13) compared to those without BC. In the adjusted analysis, the risk of all-cause mortality was highest among women with both depression and BC (HR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.15&amp;amp;ndash;8.05) compared to those without BC or depression. The relationship between BC and mortality was moderated by cardiovascular diseases, anemia, smoking, age, PIR, and marital status. Our analysis provides vital information on factors that could be helpful for interventions to reduce mortality risk among those with BC and depression. In addition, given the higher risk of mortality with co-occurring BC and depression, collaborative healthcare practices should help with widespread screening for and treatment of depression among BC survivors.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment impacts a sizable segment of the older population, and often evolves into dementia within a few years. At this stage, subjects may benefit from non-pharmacological therapies that can delay or stop the progression of the mild cognitive impairment into dementia and are crucial for improvement in the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, while also being easily accessible and safe for use. Many research studies have shown that a variety of exercises, including cognitive training, have the potential to enhance or optimize cognitive function and general well-being. Recently, many authors have suggested video games as a promising approach for cognitive training and neurorehabilitation in older people, thanks to their increasing motivation and training effects through immersion in stimulating environments. Under this premise, our narrative review&amp;amp;rsquo;s objective is to discuss and summarize the body of existing material on the role of video games in improving cognitive performance, daily life activities, and depression symptoms in older individuals with different levels of cognitive decline. From the papers reviewed, it emerged that older subjects trained with video games showed a significant improvement in cognitive functions, sleep quality, and psychiatric symptoms, positioning video games as an intriguing and useful tool.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This study aims to highlight the feasibility of an olfactory training program entirely monitored through online media in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Classic olfactory training was performed with a sample with olfactory loss due COVID-19 (n = 11). Participants were engaged on a weekly video call in order to improve adherence and collect information regarding the number of correct answers and the individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of olfactory function. The olfactory status after training was compared to two groups, one composed of participants who contracted COVID-19 but did not report olfactory loss (n = 11) and a sample composed of healthy participants (n = 11). Results: The experimental group showed improvements throughout the training period (TDI score on week 0 was 20.3 (5.6) and 24.6 (4.3) for week 12, and on week 24 was 25.4 (6.2) (F = 5.115, df = 2, 20, p = 0.016), and post hoc tests showed that participants significantly improved their TDI score in W12 compared to W0 (SMD = 0.869, p = 0.041) and in W24 compared to W0 (SMD = 0.859, p = 0.041). The experimental group showed lower scores when compared with both groups, and the no OT COVID-19 group showed lower scores than the healthy control group, even though they did not report olfactory alterations. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the strategies applied to improve adherence were successful since 100% of the sample completed the training adherence, offering a valuable framework for future olfactory training studies.</p>

<p>This study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap – whether low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment long after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is still effective for chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) and cognitive impairments. We have found that LD-IL-2 treatment preferentially expands meningeal regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby abolishing PTH-related behaviors and memory deficit in mice with a wide therapeutic time window. This identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for mTBI with the potential of reducing polypharmacy.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced chronic headache and cognitive deficits are poorly understood and lack effective treatments. Low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment soon after mTBI or overexpressing IL-2 in brain astrocytes prior to injury protects mice from developing post-traumatic headache (PTH)-related behaviors and cognitive decline. The present study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap: whether LD-IL-2 treatment long after the initial injury is still effective for chronic PTH and cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>mTBI was induced by a noninvasive closed-head weight drop method. LD-IL-2 was administered 4–6 weeks post-mTBI to assess its effects on chronic PTH-related facial mechanical hypersensitivity as well as mTBI-induced impairment in novel object recognition and object location tests. Endogenous regulatory T (Treg) cells were depleted to investigate the mechanism of action of LD-IL-2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Delayed LD-IL-2 treatment abolished chronic PTH-related behaviors. It also completely reversed mTBI-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. Treg cell depletion not only prolonged PTH-related behaviors but also abolished the effects of LD-IL-2. Interestingly, LD-IL-2 treatment significantly increased the number of Treg cells in dura but not in brain tissues.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that the beneficial effects of LD-IL-2 treatment are mediated through the expansion of meningeal Treg cells. Collectively, our study identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for both chronic PTH and mTBI-induced cognitive impairment for both males and females, with a wide therapeutic time window and the potential of reducing polypharmacy in mTBI treatment.

                The field of rodent behavioral neuroscience is undergoing two major sea changes: an ever-growing technological revolution, and worldwide calls to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) in experimental design. Both have enormous potential to improve the precision and rigor with which the brain can be studied, but the convergence of these shifts in scientific practice has exposed critical limitations in classic and widely used behavioral paradigms. While our tools have advanced, our behavioral metrics – mostly developed in males and often allowing for only binary outcomes – have not. This opinion article explores how this disconnect has presented challenges for the accurate depiction and interpretation of sex differences in brain function, arguing for the expansion of current behavioral constructs to better account for behavioral diversity.

	<p>Sex differences in the effect of prolonged sitting time on anxiety symptoms have not yet been explored. This study examined the sex-specific association between prolonged sitting time and anxiety prevalence in Korean adults. Community-dwelling adults aged &amp;amp;gt;18 years who underwent a cross-sectional structured study survey of physical activity and mental health tests were enrolled as part of the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Cohort Study from 2012 to 2019. The prevalence of anxiety was evaluated using the Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale (CUXOS) questionnaire. The mean daily sitting time was 7.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.4 h in men and 6.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.6 h in women. After adjustments for possible confounding factors, the adjusted mean CUXOS score was the highest in participants sitting for &amp;amp;ge;10 h, followed by 5&amp;amp;ndash;9 h, and &amp;amp;lt;5 h, in that order. In the post-hoc Bonferroni analysis, there were significant differences in the adjusted mean CUXOS scores in group comparisons. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted after adjusting for potential confounding factors. A prolonged sitting time was positively associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety in both men and women, with stronger associations in women than in men. It is necessary to prevent anxiety by adjusting or reducing sitting time in adults, especially women.</p>

	<p>Background: Stroke guideline statements are important references for clinicians due to the rapidly evolving nature of treatments. Guideline statements should be informed by up-to-date systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) because they provide the highest level of evidence. To investigate the utilization of SRs/MAs in stroke management guidelines, we conducted a literature review of guidelines and extracted relevant information regarding SRs/MAs. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed with supplementation using the Trip medical database with the term &amp;amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;amp;rdquo; as the target population, followed by using the filter &amp;amp;ldquo;guidelines&amp;amp;rdquo;. We extracted the number of included SRs/MAs, the years of publication, the country of origin, and other characteristics of interest. Descriptive statistics were generated using the R software version 4.2.1. Results: We included 27 guideline statements. The median number of overall SRs or MAs within the guidelines was 4.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2&amp;amp;ndash;9). For MAs only, the median number included in the guidelines was 3.0 (IQR = 2.0&amp;amp;ndash;5.5). Canadian guidelines had the oldest citations, with a median gap of 12.0 (IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;18.0) years for the oldest citation, followed by European (median = 12; IQR = 9.5&amp;amp;ndash;13.5) and US (median = 10.0; IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;16) guidelines. Conclusions: Stroke guideline writing groups and issuing bodies should devote greater effort to the inclusion of up-to-date SRs/MAs in their guideline statements so that clinicians can reference recent data with the highest level of evidence.</p>

                <p>Glutamatergic synapses exhibit significant molecular diversity, but circuit-specific mechanisms that underlie synaptic regulation are not well characterized. Prior reports show that Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Tiam1 regulates perforant path-&gt;dentate gyrus granule neuron synapses. In the present study, we report Tiam1's homolog Tiam2 is implicated in glutamatergic neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that Tiam2 regulates evoked excitatory glutamatergic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the catalytic Dbl-homology domain. Overall, we present evidence for RhoGEF Tiam2's role in glutamatergic synapse function at Schaffer collateral-&gt;CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses.</p>

                Fibroadenoma of the breast most often arises during the late teens and early reproductive years. It is the most prevalent tumor in women < 30 years. After the age of 40 to 45, fibroadenomas are rarely observed as new masses in women. Fibroadenomas are made up of both epithelial and stromal components. Fibroadenoma is the most frequent type of breast tumor. It is crucial to diagnose preoperatively, both clinically and pathologically, by using F.N.A.C. Postoperatively, Fibroadenoma is confirmed histopathology. However, malignant transformation is very rare in Fibroadenoma of the breast. Early identification, accurate analysis, and appropriate management are advantageous. The current study's goal is to examine preoperative and postoperative clinicopathological aspects of Fibroadenoma and to assess any differences between preoperative and postoperative diagnosis in patients admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi (M), Wardha, Maharashtra, India.

                Background/Objectives A drug-related problem (DRP) is an event or circumstance involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify and categorize the DRPs associated with the use of antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean delivery and to analyze the causes of these problems, making an improvement proposal of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) use in accordance with international guidelines. Methods Observational, retrospective, descriptive study of 814 women undergoing cesarean delivery. Prescription adequacy was assessed based on the selection, administration, dose and duration of the antibiotic therapy. DRP analysis and characterization was conducted using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) Classification V 9.1. Results DRPs were detected in all women (1125, 1.38 DRPs/patient), the most frequent ones associated to failure to administer PAP (30.10% of patients) and to unnecessary postsurgical antibiotic (100%). Of the 1935 possible causes for DRPs identified, most of them were related to inappropriate drug selection. Cefazolin was administered to 98.07% of women with PAP and 71.45% of patients received postsurgical cefalexin, with 13 different antibiotics being used in total. Conclusions The implementation of therapeutic protocols and early identification of DRPs is proposed in order to optimize antibiotic use in the institution.

                Synaptotagmin-1 is a synaptic vesicle transmembrane protein that senses calcium influx via its tandem C2-domains, triggering synchronous neurotransmitter release. Disruption to SYT1 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of identifying high-quality research reagents to enhance understanding of Synaptotagmin-1 in health and disease. Here we have characterized thirteen Synaptotagmin-1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile shelter for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds from unwanted environmental factors, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Methods Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). Physical, mechanical, microstructural, thermal, microbiological, and oxidative measurements were also performed. Results The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of films double-layered with a film containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layer films. Conclusions GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate.

                Background The profound impacts of climate change on the environment, economy, and society are anticipated to significantly influence smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods and traditional ways of life are inextricably intertwined with the natural environment. This comprehensive study delves into the multifaceted factors shaping the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and their subsequent effects on crop productivity among the small-scale farming communities in Nyimba District, situated within Zambia. Methods The study collected data from 194 smallholder farmer households across 12 villages in 4 agricultural camps of Nyimba District between June and July 2022. A logistic regression model was utilized to assess the factors influencing crop production and the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in response to climate change and variability within the study area. Furthermore, propensity score matching was performed to evaluate the impacts of adopting climate-smart agriculture by comparing adopter households with their non-adopter counterparts. Results The logit regression model’s findings from the research indicate that several factors influence smallholder farmer households’ adoption of climate-smart agricultural techniques and crop productivity. These factors include the farmer’s educational level, household size, fertilizer utilization, the household head’s age and gender, farming experience duration, livestock ownership status, annual household income, farmland size, the household head’s marital status, and access to climate-related information. Additionally, the propensity score matching analysis revealed that crop yields among smallholder farmers who adopted climate-smart agricultural practices were 20.20% higher compared to non-adopters. Furthermore, the analysis showed that implementing such practices in the study area led to a 21.50% increase in maize yields for adopter households relative to their non-adopter counterparts. Conclusion The findings of this research offer valuable insights to policymakers, guiding them in enhancing farmers’ climate change adaptation strategies and formulating relevant policies. Nevertheless, these initiatives and concerted efforts possess the potential to mitigate the detrimental impacts posed by climate change and climatic variability.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS), characterized by slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) of alternating active and silent states in the thalamocortical network, is a primary brain state during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. In the last two decades, the traditional view of SWS as a global and uniform whole-brain state has been challenged by a growing body of evidence indicating that SO can be local and can coexist with wake-like activity. However, the mechanisms by which global and local SOs arise from micro-scale neuronal dynamics and network connectivity remain poorly understood. We developed a multi-scale, biophysically realistic human whole-brain thalamocortical network model capable of transitioning between the awake state and SWS, and we investigated the role of connectivity in the spatio-temporal dynamics of sleep SO. We found that the overall strength and a relative balance between long and short-range synaptic connections determined the network state. Importantly, for a range of synaptic strengths, the model demonstrated complex mixed SO states, where periods of synchronized global slow-wave activity were intermittent with the periods of asynchronous local slow-waves. An increase in the overall synaptic strength led to synchronized global SO, while a decrease in synaptic connectivity produced only local slow-waves that would not propagate beyond local areas. These results were compared to human data to validate probable models of biophysically realistic SO. The model producing mixed states provided the best match to the spatial coherence profile and the functional connectivity estimated from human subjects. These findings shed light on how the spatio-temporal properties of SO emerge from local and global cortical connectivity and provide a framework for further exploring the mechanisms and functions of SWS in health and disease.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the progressive form of liver steatosis, the most common liver disease, and substantially increases the mortality rate. However, limited therapies are currently available to prevent MASH development. Identifying potential pharmacological treatments for the condition has been hampered by its heterogeneous and complex nature. Here, we identified a hepatic nonneuronal cholinergic signaling pathway required for metabolic adaptation to caloric overload. We found that cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit (CHRNA2) is highly expressed in hepatocytes of mice and humans. Further, CHRNA2 is activated by a subpopulation of local acetylcholine-producing macrophages during MASH development. The activation of CHRNA2 coordinates defensive programs against a broad spectrum of MASH-related pathogenesis, including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific loss of CHRNA2 signaling accelerates the disease onset in different MASH mouse models. Activation of this pathway via pharmacological inhibition of acetylcholine degradation protects against MASH development. Our study uncovers a hepatic nicotinic cholinergic receptor pathway that constitutes a cell-autonomous self-defense route against prolonged metabolic stress and holds therapeutic potential for combatting human MASH.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the complex dynamics of social communication behaviors, such as exploration, communication, courtship, mating, and aggression in animal models, is crucial to reveal key neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying these behaviors. The two-intruders test is designed to investigate residents' behavior toward both male and female intruders within the home cage of the test male. During this test imitating natural conditions, several aspects of social interaction were investigated: Exploration, courtship, mating, and aggressive behavior. As mating and aggression involve overlapping neural circuits, the behavioral setup testing both behaviors is best at reflecting their competitive nature. Our findings demonstrate that resident male mice exhibit strong preference to communicate with a female intruder, which correlates with baseline testosterone levels of test males. Relevant female preference in the two-intruders test was also found in BALB/c males. Behavioral breakdown revealed the anogenital sniffing as a key behavioral feature that discriminates resident male behavior toward intruders of different sex. Furthermore, resident male interaction with female intruder was accompanied by neuronal activation in the ventromedial hypothalamus. We demonstrate that odor recognition underlies preference toward females in male residents, as experimental anosmia reduced communication with a female intruder. We conclude the two-intruders test setup to be a useful tool to study the neurological basis of social communication in animal models, which provides detailed analysis of various aspects of the laboratory animals’ social behavior in the most natural conditions.</p>

                Background Improving awareness in patients with stroke to detect risk factors of recurrent stroke has recently become a major challenge for all health professionals in preventing recurrence among stroke survivors. Utilization of advanced technology, such as digital sensors, (a non-invasive device) is among the breakthroughs in detecting the risk of disease and promotes more effective prevention and improves quality of care. This study aims to conduct a systematic review on studies addressing early detection of the risk factors of recurrent stroke through the utilization of digital sensors. Methods A literature search was carried out on articles published between 2011 - 2018 on EBSCO, Elsevier, Science Direct, ProQuest, Springer link, PubMed, MEDLINE, PLoS, and the Journal of Community Nursing. The search identified quantitative research studies on the utilization of digital sensors in cases of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiac disorders that contributed to stroke recurrence. Each study’s bias was assessed using Review Manager 5. Results Ten articles were analyzed through data extraction. Robust assessment of independent risk factors which provoke recurrent stroke such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and heart diseases could lead to conservation of health resources. It is very important to monitor these factors. With the development of technology, the potential use of non-invasive monitoring for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and heart diseases as risk factors for recurrent stroke events is considered effective because it is easy, simple, low cost, sensitive, and does not cause additional suffering for patients. Conclusion A practical and non-invasive method for early detection and monitoring of risk factors may reduce the risk of stroke recurrence among stroke survivors.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine/chemokine profile of central nervous system (CNS) neurosarcoidosis (NS), and its utility in differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this case–control study, we validated 17 cytokines/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in a multiplexed automated immunoassay system (ELLA; Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and assessed them in CSF and serum of symptomatic patients with probable or definite CNS NS (01/2011–02/2023) with gadolinium enhancement and/or CSF pleocytosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis, primary CNS lymphoma, aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positivity, non-inflammatory disorders, and healthy individuals were used as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 32 NS patients (59% women; median age, 59 years [19–81]) were included; concurrent sera were available in 12. CSF controls consisted of 26 multiple sclerosis, 8 primary CNS lymphoma, 84 aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positive, and 34 patients with non-inflammatory disorders. Gadolinium enhancement was present in 31 of 32 NS patients, and CSF pleocytosis in 27 of 32 (84%). CSF IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in NS patients compared with non-inflammatory controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.02); elevations were more common in CSF than serum. Concurrent elevation of IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha was present in 18 of 32 NS patients, but only in 1 control. Elevated IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, CXCL9, CXL10, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha associated with measures of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NS CSF cytokine/chemokine profiles suggest T cell (mainly T helper cell type 1), macrophage, and B-cell involvement. These signatures aid in NS diagnosis, indicate disease activity, and suggest therapeutic avenues. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91054">Caenorhabditis elegans SEL-5/AAK1 regulates cell migration and cell outgrowth independently of its kinase activity</a></h4>

              
                During <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development, multiple cells migrate long distances or extend processes to reach their final position and/or attain proper shape. The Wnt signalling pathway stands out as one of the major coordinators of cell migration or cell outgrowth along the anterior-posterior body axis. The outcome of Wnt signalling is fine-tuned by various mechanisms including endocytosis. In this study, we show that SEL-5, the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of mammalian AP2-associated kinase AAK1, acts together with the retromer complex as a positive regulator of EGL-20/Wnt signalling during the migration of QL neuroblast daughter cells. At the same time, SEL-5 in cooperation with the retromer complex is also required during excretory canal cell outgrowth. Importantly, SEL-5 kinase activity is not required for its role in neuronal migration or excretory cell outgrowth, and neither of these processes is dependent on DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation. We further establish that the Wnt proteins CWN-1 and CWN-2 together with the Frizzled receptor CFZ-2 positively regulate excretory cell outgrowth, while LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Frizzled together generate a stop signal inhibiting its extension.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90690">Alzheimer’s disease linked Aβ42 exerts product feedback inhibition on γ-secretase impairing downstream cell signaling</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of γ-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Aβ, as well as cell-based and <i>ex vivo</i> assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Aβ on γ-secretases. We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17–42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90964">Myelin dystrophy impairs signal transmission and working memory in a multiscale model of the aging prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Normal aging leads to myelin alterations in the rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which are positively correlated with degree of cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized that remyelination with shorter and thinner myelin sheaths partially compensates for myelin degradation, but computational modeling has not yet explored these two phenomena together systematically. Here, we used a two-pronged modeling approach to determine how age-related myelin changes affect a core cognitive function: spatial working memory. First, we built a multicompartment pyramidal neuron model fit to monkey dlPFC empirical data, with an axon including myelinated segments having paranodes, juxtaparanodes, internodes, and tight junctions. This model was used to quantify conduction velocity (CV) changes and action potential (AP) failures after demyelination and subsequent remyelination. Next, we incorporated the single neuron results into a spiking neural network model of working memory. While complete remyelination nearly recovered axonal transmission and network function to unperturbed levels, our models predict that biologically plausible levels of myelin dystrophy, if uncompensated by other factors, can account for substantial working memory impairment with aging. The present computational study unites empirical data from ultrastructure up to behavior during normal aging, and has broader implications for many demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92110">Allosteric activation of the co-receptor BAK1 by the EFR receptor kinase initiates immune signaling</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane signaling by plant receptor kinases (RKs) has long been thought to involve reciprocal trans-phosphorylation of their intracellular kinase domains. The fact that many of these are pseudokinase domains, however, suggests that additional mechanisms must govern RK signaling activation. Non-catalytic signaling mechanisms of protein kinase domains have been described in metazoans, but information is scarce for plants. Recently, a non-catalytic function was reported for the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RK subfamily XIIa member EFR (elongation factor Tu receptor) and phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes were proposed to regulate signaling of RKs with non-RD kinase domains. Here, using EFR as a model, we describe a non-catalytic activation mechanism for LRR-RKs with non-RD kinase domains. EFR is an active kinase, but a kinase-dead variant retains the ability to enhance catalytic activity of its co-receptor kinase BAK1/SERK3 (brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 3). Applying hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis and designing homology-based intragenic suppressor mutations, we provide evidence that the EFR kinase domain must adopt its active conformation in order to activate BAK1 allosterically, likely by supporting αC-helix positioning in BAK1. Our results suggest a conformational toggle model for signaling, in which BAK1 first phosphorylates EFR in the activation loop to stabilize its active conformation, allowing EFR in turn to allosterically activate BAK1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95849">Prediction error determines how memories are organized in the brain</a></h4>

              
                How is new information organized in memory? According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: a small prediction error leads to the updating of existing memory, large prediction error leads to encoding of a new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses, and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88905">Deficiency of IQCH causes male infertility in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                IQ motif-containing proteins can be recognized by calmodulin (CaM) and are essential for many biological processes. However, the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the novel gene IQ motif-containing H (<i>IQCH</i>) in a Chinese family with male infertility characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. To verify the function of IQCH, <i>Iqch</i> knockout (KO) mice were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 technology. As expected, the <i>Iqch</i> KO male mice exhibited impaired fertility, which was related to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structures of the axoneme and mitochondria, mirroring the patient phenotypes. Mechanistically, IQCH can bind to CaM and subsequently regulate the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis. Overall, this study revealed the function of IQCH, expanded the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in reproductive processes, and provided important guidance for genetic counseling and genetic diagnosis of male infertility.

	<p>Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in many organs, resulting in clinical symptoms, mostly hepatic and neuropsychiatric. As copper accumulates in the brain during WD, and almost 50% of WD patients at diagnosis present with neurological symptoms, neuroimaging studies (especially brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) are part of WD diagnosis. The classical sequences (T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) were used to describe brain MRI; however, with the development of neuroradiology, several papers proposed the use of new MRI sequences and techniques like susceptibility-weighted images, T2*, diffusion MRI, tractography, volumetric assessment and post-processing brain MRI analysis of paramagnetic accumulation&amp;amp;mdash;quantitative susceptibility mapping. Based on these neuroradiological data in WD, currently, brain MRI semiquantitative scale and the pathognomonic neuroradiological brain MRI signs in WD were proposed. Further, the volumetric studies and brain iron accumulation MRI analysis suggested brain atrophy and iron accumulation as biomarkers of neurological WD disease severity. All these results highlight the significance of brain MRI examinations in WD. Due to the extreme progress of these studies, based on the available literature, the authors present the current state of knowledge about the significance, practical aspects, and future directions of brain MRI in WD.</p>

	<p>Recent evidence suggests a connection between hyperacusis and the motor system of the brain. For instance, our recent study reported that hyperacusis in participants with tinnitus and hearing loss is associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Given that hearing loss can affect gray matter changes in tinnitus, this study aimed to determine if the changes reported in our previous findings of smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis persist in the absence of hearing loss. Data for this study were gathered from four prior studies conducted between 2004 and 2019 at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG). A total of 101 participants with tinnitus and either clinically normal hearing (normal hearing with tinnitus or NHT, n = 35) or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (hearing loss with tinnitus or HLT, n = 66) were included across four studies. Hyperacusis was determined by a score of &amp;amp;ge;22 on the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). In the NHT group, 22 (63%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (NHT with hyperacusis: mean age 44.1 years, 12 females), while in the HLT group, 25 (38%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (HLT with hyperacusis: mean age 59.5 years, 10 females). The 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 between-group ANOVAs revealed that hyperacusis is associated with smaller SMA gray matter volumes, regardless of hearing levels. Notably, the smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis were primarily influenced by the attentional subscales of the HQ. The association between hyperacusis and the motor system may indicate a constant alertness to sounds and a readiness for motor action.</p>

	<p>Background. The majority of deaths in patients with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are caused by natural causes, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The increased risk of CVD and other somatic diseases in SMIs cannot be fully explained by the contribution of traditional risk factors, behavioral risk factors, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; lifestyle peculiarities, and the influence of antipsychotics. The present review has the following main objectives: (1) to aggregate evidence that neurodevelopmental disorders are the basis of SMIs; (2) to provide a review of studies that have addressed the shared genetic architecture of SMI and cardiovascular disease; and (3) to propose and substantiate the consideration of somatic diseases as independent endophenotypes of SMIs, which will make it possible to place the research of somatic diseases in SMIs within the framework of the concepts of the &amp;amp;ldquo;neurodevelopmental continuum and gradient&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;endophenotype&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods. A comprehensive literature search was performed on 1 July 2024. The search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases up to June 2024. Results. The current literature reveals considerable overlap between the genetic susceptibility loci for SMIs and CVDs. We propose that somatic diseases observed in SMIs that have a shared genetic architecture with SMIs can be considered distinct physical health-related endophenotypes. Conclusions. In this narrative review, the results of recent studies of CVDs in SMIs are summarized. Reframing schizophrenia as a multisystem disease should contribute to the activation of new research on somatic diseases in SMIs.</p>

                <p>In human adults, multiple cortical regions respond robustly to faces, including the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), implicated in face perception, and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), implicated in higher-level social functions. When in development, does face selectivity arise in each of these regions? Here, we combined two awake infant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to create a sample size twice the size of previous reports (<I>n</I> = 65 infants; 2.6&ndash;9.6&nbsp;months). Infants watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes, while fMRI data were collected. Despite variable amounts of data from each infant, individual subject whole-brain activation maps revealed responses to faces compared to nonface visual categories in the approximate location of OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC. To determine the strength and nature of face selectivity in these regions, we used cross-validated functional region of interest analyses. Across this larger sample size, face responses in OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC were significantly greater than responses to bodies, objects, and scenes. Even the youngest infants (2&ndash;5&nbsp;months) showed significantly face-selective responses in FFA, STS, and MPFC, but not OFA. These results demonstrate that face selectivity is present in multiple cortical regions within months of birth, providing powerful constraints on theories of cortical development.</p>

                <p>Quantifying and analyzing licking behavior can offer valuable insights into fundamental neurobiological mechanisms controlling animal consummatory behaviors. Lickometers are typically based on electrical properties, a strategy that comes with limitations, including susceptibility to electrical interference and generation of electrical disturbances in electrophysiological measurements. While optical lickometers offer an alternative method to measure licks and quantify fluid intake in animals, they are prone to false readings and susceptibility to outside light sources. To overcome this problem, we propose a low-cost open-source lickometer that combines a restricted infrared beam defined by optical fibers, with a poke design that allows easy access to the tongue while limiting access of other body parts and external light sources. This device also includes features for detecting nose pokes and presenting visual cues during behavioral tasks. We provide validation experiments that demonstrate the optical lickometer's reliability, high-sensitivity and precision, and its application in a behavioral task, showcasing the potential of this tool to study lick microstructure in combination with other techniques, such as imaging of neural activity, in freely moving mice.</p>

                Objective: To evaluate the scientific production on university social responsibility (USR) from institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted on documents published in indexed journals in the Scopus database from its inception until April 2023. Eligible documents included those on USR describing experiences carried out by universities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of articles per author, average authors per article, average citations per article, and the number of documents with one or more author were described. Bibliometric indicators regarding authors per article, co-authors per article, and institutional collaboration were presented. Bibliometric networks were constructed based on bibliographic coupling analysis of documents by countries and term co-occurrence in titles and abstracts. Results: Of a total of 4075 documents retrieved from Scopus, 150 were included. Documents published between 1997 and 2023 were identified, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. A total of 439 authors were identified, 18 articles had a single author, and an average of 0.3 articles per author and a co-authorship index of 3.13 were found. The percentage of international collaborations was 30.7%. Brazil had the highest proportion of publications (26.4%), followed by Chile (17%) and Colombia (13.2%). Opción and Revista de Ciencias Sociales were the journals with the highest number of articles published (13 each). In the analysis of term co-occurrence, recent years showed an increase in the use of terms related to e-learning, information and communication technologies, virtual education, COVID-19, sustainable development goals, and URSULA (initiative on USR in institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean). Conclusions: A growth in scientific production on USR in Latin America and the Caribbean was identified. The interest in USR documents in recent years has been focused on COVID-19 and the challenges of virtual education and sustainable development.

                Background Digital servitization is a strategic transformation where companies adopt a service-focused approach in response to the prevailing trend of digitalization. Utilizing digital technology, businesses manage product and service operations and develop new value propositions. Further research into digital servitization is essential for maintaining competitiveness and meeting evolving market demands globally. This study aims to comprehend the evolution of digital services from theoretical and practical viewpoints and examines how these challenges are tackled. Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by David A. Brewster, Martin A. Nowak, Josef Tkadlec</p>

Computing the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations is difficult. A key quantity is the fixation time of a single mutant with relative reproduction rate <i>r</i> which invades a population of residents. We say that the fixation time is “fast” if it is at most a polynomial function in terms of the population size <i>N</i>. Here we study fixation times of advantageous mutants (<i>r</i> > 1) and neutral mutants (<i>r</i> = 1) on <i>directed</i> graphs, which are those graphs that have at least some one-way connections. We obtain three main results. First, we prove that for any directed graph the fixation time is fast, provided that <i>r</i> is sufficiently large. Second, we construct an efficient algorithm that gives an upper bound for the fixation time for any graph and any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. Third, we identify a broad class of directed graphs with fast fixation times for any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. This class includes previously studied amplifiers of selection, such as Superstars and Metafunnels. We also show that on some graphs the fixation time is not a monotonically declining function of <i>r</i>; in particular, neutral fixation can occur faster than fixation for small selective advantages.

                <p>by Botond B. Antal, Anthony G. Chesebro, Helmut H. Strey, Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, Corey Weistuch</p>

All fields of science depend on mathematical models. <i>Occam’s razor</i> refers to the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully leveraged to apply Occam’s razor to model parameters. Our method, FixFit, uses a feedforward deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model’s degree of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that add value versus those that do not. In three use cases, we demonstrate the broad applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for the Kepler orbit model and a dynamic model of blood glucose regulation. In the latter, we demonstrate the ability to fit the latent parameters to real data. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale brain model and reduce the search space for viable candidate mechanisms.

During an infectious disease outbreak, public health policy makers are tasked with strategically implementing interventions whilst balancing competing objectives. To provide a quantitative framework that can be used to guide these decisions, it is helpful to devise a clear and specific objective function that can be evaluated to determine the optimal outbreak response. In this study, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework representing outbreaks of a novel emerging pathogen for which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are imposed or removed based on thresholds for hospital occupancy. These thresholds are set at different levels to define four unique strategies for disease control. We illustrate that the optimal intervention strategy is contingent on the choice of objective function. Specifically, the optimal strategy depends on the extent to which policy makers prioritise reducing health costs due to infection over the costs associated with maintaining interventions. Motivated by the scenario early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporate the development of a vaccine into our modelling framework and demonstrate that a policy maker’s belief about when a vaccine will become available in future, and its eventual coverage (and/or effectiveness), affects the optimal strategy to adopt early in the outbreak. Furthermore, we show how uncertainty in these quantities can be accounted for when deciding which interventions to introduce. This research highlights the benefits of policy makers being explicit about the precise objectives of introducing interventions.

Sensory neurons specialize in detecting and signaling the presence of diverse environmental stimuli. Neuronal injury or disease may undermine such signaling, diminishing the availability of crucial information. Can animals distinguish between a stimulus not being present and the inability to sense that stimulus in the first place? To address this question, we studied <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematode worms that lack gentle body touch sensation due to genetic mechanoreceptor dysfunction. We previously showed that worms can compensate for the loss of touch by enhancing their sense of smell, via an FLP-20 neuropeptide pathway. Here, we find that touch-deficient worms exhibit, in addition to sensory compensation, also cautious-like behavior, as if preemptively avoiding potential undetectable hazards. Intriguingly, these behavioral adjustments are abolished when the touch neurons are removed, suggesting that touch neurons are required for signaling the unavailability of touch information, in addition to their conventional role of signaling touch stimulation. Furthermore, we found that the ASE taste neurons, which similarly to the touch neurons, express the FLP-20 neuropeptide, exhibit altered FLP-20 expression levels in a touch-dependent manner, thus cooperating with the touch circuit. These results imply a novel form of neuronal signaling that enables <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> to distinguish between lack of touch stimulation and loss of touch sensation, producing adaptive behavioral adjustments that could overcome the inability to detect potential threats.

Long-read sequencing is driving rapid progress in genome assembly across all major groups of life, including species of the family Drosophilidae, a longtime model system for genetics, genomics, and evolution. We previously developed a cost-effective hybrid Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing approach and used it to assemble 101 drosophilid genomes from laboratory cultures, greatly increasing the number of genome assemblies for this taxonomic group. The next major challenge is to address the laboratory culture bias in taxon sampling by sequencing genomes of species that cannot easily be reared in the lab. Here, we build upon our previous methods to perform amplification-free ONT sequencing of single wild flies obtained either directly from the field or from ethanol-preserved specimens in museum collections, greatly improving the representation of lesser studied drosophilid taxa in whole-genome data. Using Illumina Novaseq X Plus and ONT P2 sequencers with R10.4.1 chemistry, we set a new benchmark for inexpensive hybrid genome assembly at US $150 per genome while assembling genomes from as little as 35 ng of genomic DNA from a single fly. We present 183 new genome assemblies for 179 species as a resource for drosophilid systematics, phylogenetics, and comparative genomics. Of these genomes, 62 are from pooled lab strains and 121 from single adult flies. Despite the sample limitations of working with small insects, most single-fly diploid assemblies are comparable in contiguity (>1 Mb contig N50), completeness (>98% complete dipteran BUSCOs), and accuracy (>QV40 genome-wide with ONT R10.4.1) to assemblies from inbred lines. We present a well-resolved multi-locus phylogeny for 360 drosophilid and 4 outgroup species encompassing all publicly available (as of August 2023) genomes for this group. Finally, we present a Progressive Cactus whole-genome, reference-free alignment built from a subset of 298 suitably high-quality drosophilid genomes. The new assemblies and alignment, along with updated laboratory protocols and computational pipelines, are released as an open resource and as a tool for studying evolution at the scale of an entire insect family.

                Background: Insomnia is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for at least three nights a week or more and lasting for at least 3 months. One of the molecules that play a role in the circadian rhythm of arousal system is hypocretin/orexin. Orexin activates the p38-MAPK signaling pathway and increases phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Centella asiatica (CA) has a role in the signal work of the MAPK/ERK, Akt, and p38 path in many various diseases. Methods: The research method used is true laboratory experimental. The research approach used was randomized control group post-test only. Zebrafish embryos aged 0-7 dpf were used in this study. The treatment group consisted of 5 groups: normal, insomnia, insomnia + 2.5 μg/mL CA, insomnia + 5 μg/mL CA, and insomnia + 10 μg/mL CA. The locomotor motion of zebrafish larvae was observed using Basler cameras on days five-, six- and seven-day post fertilization (dpf), then analyzed by using Western Blot method. Results: The results proved that exposure to CA extract was able to reduce the expression of orexin (91963 ± 9129) and p38 (117425 ± 6398) as an arousal trigger in the sleep-wake cycle, with the most optimal concentration of CA 5 μg/mL. Exposure to CA extract was also able to reduce the expression of ERK (94795 ± 30830) and Akt (60113.5 ± 27833.5) with an optimum concentration of CA 2.5 μg/mL. Conclusion: Exposure to CA extract was able to improve the sleep activity of zebrafish larvae insomnia model by extending the total inactivity time (cumulative duration) and shortening the duration of first sleep (latency to first) in light and dark phases through inhibition of orexin, ERK, p38, and Akt.

                Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has unpredictable severity. Its management is based on initial assessment of disease severity. It ranges from mild interstitial to severe necrotic form; the latter is associated with poor prognosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the gold standard in early detection of pancreatic necrosis and in assessing the severity of AP. Two CT grading systems exist to assess the severity of AP: CT severity Index (CSI) and modified CSI (MCSI). This study compares the usefulness of these two systems in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in AP in comparison with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based screening study of 80 patients aged >12 years with clinical diagnosis of AP who underwent contrast-enhanced CT study of the abdomen. Comparative analysis between MCSI and CSI with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters was assessed by Chi-Squared test. Results: The accuracy of CSI and MCSI in predicting the requirement of critical care, superadded infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requirement of intervention were 73.0%, 64.5%, 69.8% 60.9% and 77.2%, 76.0%, 74.4% & 56.6% respectively. Area under the curve for MCSI score was significantly higher (AUC: 0.861; 95% CI: 0.736-0.986) than CSI score (AUC:0.815;95% CI:0.749-0.941). MCSI and CSI showed significant correlation with Ranson’s criteria; however, MCSI correlation was better (r:0.53; p<0.01) than CSI (r:0.35;p:0.04). Conclusion: CSI and MCSI are better predictors of severity, clinical outcome and mortality compared with Ranson’s criteria, with MCSI being more accurate and better predictor than CSI. The accuracy of MCSI is better than CSI for prediction of requirement of critical care, development of superadded infection and development of MODS in AP. However, CSI and MCSI have low accuracy in predicting intervention in AP.

                <p>Medical school research faculty is increasingly required to complete more comprehensive and time consuming compliance steps for regulatory oversight. These relate to animal studies, information technology, biosafety, and human resources. For physician-scientists, the additional role in clinical care adds to these research areas with regulatory compliance in patient care and ever-growing web trainings. The sum of all these compliance regimes is a considerable time and cost burden, diminished research performance, and disengagement of faculty from colleagues, collaborations, and institutions. Many research and clinical compliance processes were put in place, often using legacy systems, in well-meaning attempts to address straightforward regulations in humane animal care, safe use of biological agents, and medical care delivery. However, their accumulation and negative impact on faculty performance demand time, energy, and resources that impact academic productivity. There are solutions to a relentlessly increasing regulatory load for research faculty, which involve vertical integration, convergence, and performance assessment in medical school and health system compliance regimes.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.

                We reliably judge locations of static objects when we walk despite the retinal images of these objects moving with every step we take. Here, we showed our brains solve this optical illusion by adopting an allocentric spatial reference frame. We measured perceived target location after the observer walked a short distance from the home base. Supporting the allocentric coding scheme, we found the intrinsic bias , which acts as a spatial reference frame for perceiving location of a dimly lit target in the dark, remained grounded at the home base rather than traveled along with the observer. The path-integration mechanism responsible for this can utilize both active and passive (vestibular) translational motion signals, but only along the horizontal direction. This asymmetric path-integration finding in human visual space perception is reminiscent of the asymmetric spatial memory finding in desert ants, pointing to nature’s wondrous and logically simple design for terrestrial creatures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91766">Netrin signaling mediates survival of dormant epithelial ovarian cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Dormancy in cancer is a clinical state in which residual disease remains undetectable for a prolonged duration. At a cellular level, rare cancer cells cease proliferation and survive chemotherapy and disseminate disease. We created a suspension culture model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) dormancy and devised a novel CRISPR screening approach to identify survival genes in this context. In combination with RNA-seq, we discovered the Netrin signaling pathway as critical to dormant HGSOC cell survival. We demonstrate that Netrin-1, –3, and its receptors are essential for low level ERK activation to promote survival, and that Netrin activation of ERK is unable to induce proliferation. Deletion of all UNC5 family receptors blocks Netrin signaling in HGSOC cells and compromises viability during the dormancy step of dissemination in xenograft assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and –3 overexpression in HGSOC correlates with poor outcome. Specifically, our experiments reveal that Netrin overexpression elevates cell survival in dormant culture conditions and contributes to greater spread of disease in a xenograft model of abdominal dissemination. This study highlights Netrin signaling as a key mediator HGSOC cancer cell dormancy and metastasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88173">A synergistic workspace for human consciousness revealed by Integrated Information Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                How is the information-processing architecture of the human brain organised, and how does its organisation support consciousness? Here, we combine network science and a rigorous information-theoretic notion of synergy to delineate a ‘synergistic global workspace’, comprising gateway regions that gather synergistic information from specialised modules across the human brain. This information is then integrated within the workspace and widely distributed via broadcaster regions. Through functional MRI analysis, we show that gateway regions of the synergistic workspace correspond to the human brain’s default mode network, whereas broadcasters coincide with the executive control network. We find that loss of consciousness due to general anaesthesia or disorders of consciousness corresponds to diminished ability of the synergistic workspace to integrate information, which is restored upon recovery. Thus, loss of consciousness coincides with a breakdown of information integration within the synergistic workspace of the human brain. This work contributes to conceptual and empirical reconciliation between two prominent scientific theories of consciousness, the Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while also advancing our understanding of how the human brain supports consciousness through the synergistic integration of information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90793">Selective consolidation of learning and memory via recall-gated plasticity</a></h4>

              
                In a variety of species and behavioral contexts, learning and memory formation recruits two neural systems, with initial plasticity in one system being consolidated into the other over time. Moreover, consolidation is known to be selective; that is, some experiences are more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory than others. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve synaptic plasticity rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments. We show that recall-gated consolidation gives rise to a number of phenomena that are present in behavioral learning paradigms, including spaced learning effects, task-dependent rates of consolidation, and differing neural representations in short- and long-term pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91421">Non-Hebbian plasticity transforms transient experiences into lasting memories</a></h4>

              
                The dominant models of learning and memory, such as Hebbian plasticity, propose that experiences are transformed into memories through input-specific synaptic plasticity at the time of learning. However, synaptic plasticity is neither strictly input-specific nor restricted to the time of its induction. The impact of such forms of non-Hebbian plasticity on memory has been difficult to test, and hence poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that synaptic manipulations can deviate from the Hebbian model of learning, yet produce a lasting memory. First, we established a weak associative conditioning protocol in mice, where optogenetic stimulation of sensory thalamic input to the amygdala was paired with a footshock, but no detectable memory was formed. However, when the same input was potentiated minutes before or after, or even 24 hr later, the associative experience was converted into a lasting memory. Importantly, potentiating an independent input to the amygdala minutes but not 24 hr after the pairing produced a lasting memory. Thus, our findings suggest that the process of transformation of a transient experience into a memory is neither restricted to the time of the experience nor to the synapses triggered by it; instead, it can be influenced by past and future events.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89611">Cortical plasticity is associated with blood–brain barrier modulation</a></h4>

              
                Brain microvessels possess the unique properties of a blood–brain barrier (BBB), tightly regulating the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain neuropil and vice versa. In models of brain injury, BBB dysfunction and the associated leakage of serum albumin to the neuropil have been shown to induce pathological plasticity, neuronal hyper-excitability, and seizures. The effect of neuronal activity on BBB function and whether it plays a role in plasticity in the healthy brain remain unclear. Here we show that neuronal activity induces modulation of microvascular permeability in the healthy brain and that it has a role in local network reorganization. Combining simultaneous electrophysiological recording and vascular imaging with transcriptomic analysis in rats, and functional and BBB-mapping MRI in human subjects, we show that prolonged stimulation of the limb induces a focal increase in BBB permeability in the corresponding somatosensory cortex that is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. We further show that the increased microvascular permeability depends on neuronal activity and involves caveolae-mediated transcytosis and transforming growth factor β signaling. Our results reveal a role of BBB modulation in cortical plasticity in the healthy brain, highlighting the importance of neurovascular interactions for sensory experience and learning.

	<p>Background: The role of exercise programs during substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is considered particularly supportive in fostering positive psychological and behavioral changes. The treatment of SUD is a challenging and demanding process. Therefore, it is crucial to discover innovative methods to enhance and facilitate it. Integrating exercise into a virtual environment is an innovative approach for drug rehabilitation, offering multiple benefits to individuals undergoing treatment. The aim of this feasibility study was to explore the acute effects of cycling exercise in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment on attentional control and self-efficacy expectations of individuals undergoing SUD treatment. Methods: A total of 20 individuals (mean age of 37.75 years) enrolled in a SUD treatment program participated in the study. They were instructed to complete a single session of cycling with a self-selected duration within the VR system. Results: Following the cycling session, pre-post measures indicated a statistically significant improvement in self-efficacy expectations and attentional control measured with the Stroop test. The results revealed that participants expressed high levels of intention for future use, interest/enjoyment, and positive attitudes toward the VR exercise system. Qualitative data indicated that participants found the VR exercise system enjoyable, expressed a strong intention to use it, and did not encounter technical difficulties or negative emotions. Conclusions: In conclusion, it seems that engaging in a brief period of self-selected exercise within a virtual environment can result in temporary activation of cognitive changes, heightened self-efficacy expectations, and a motivating approach to increasing physical activity participation among individuals with SUD, thus suggesting the feasibility of this approach.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent with a high subjective and socio-economic burden. Despite the effectiveness of classical treatment methods, 20&amp;amp;ndash;30% of patients stay treatment-resistant. Deep Brain Stimulation of the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle is emerging as a clinical treatment. The stimulation region (ventral tegmental area, VTA), supported by experimental data, points to the role of dopaminergic (DA) transmission in disease pathology. This work sets out to develop a workflow that will allow the performance of analyses on midbrain DA-ergic neurons and projections in subjects who have committed suicide. Human midbrains were retrieved during autopsy, formalin-fixed, and scanned in a Bruker MRI scanner (7T). Sections were sliced, stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), digitized, and integrated into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain space together with a high-resolution fiber tract atlas. Subnuclei of the VTA region were identified. TH-positive neurons and fibers were semi-quantitatively evaluated. The study established a rigorous protocol allowing for parallel histological assessments and fiber tractographic analysis in a common space. Semi-quantitative readings are feasible and allow the detection of cell loss in VTA subnuclei. This work describes the intricate workflow and first results of an investigation of DA anatomy in VTA subnuclei in a growing naturalistic database.</p>

	<p>Neurodegenerative disease is a major global health problem with 150 million people predicted to have dementia by 2050. Genetic factors, environmental factors, demographics, and some diseases have been associated with dementia. In addition to associations between diseases such as hypertension and cerebrovascular disease and dementia, emerging findings associate some psychiatric disorders with incident dementia. Because of the high and increasing global prevalence of dementia and the high worldwide prevalence of psychiatric disorders, the primary objective of this narrative review was to evaluate published findings that evaluate the association between bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and other psychosis syndromes, and personality disorders and personality traits and incident dementia. Here, we highlight findings indicating possible associations between these psychiatric disorders and subsequent dementia and suggest that some psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for incident dementia. Further research, including more large longitudinal studies and additional meta-analyses, however, is needed to better characterize the associations between psychiatric disorders and incident dementia, to identify possible mechanisms for these putative associations, and to identify risk factors within psychiatric disorders that predispose some people with a psychiatric disorder but not others to subsequent dementia. Additional important questions concern how the treatment of psychiatric disorders might affect the risk of incident dementia.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum is a conserved structure of the vertebrate brain involved in the timing and calibration of movements. Its function is supported by the convergence of fibers from granule cells (GCs) and inferior olive neurons (IONs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs). Theories of cerebellar function postulate that IONs convey error signals to PCs that, paired with the contextual information provided by GCs, can instruct motor learning. Here, we use the larval zebrafish to investigate (1) how sensory representations of the same stimulus vary across GCs and IONs and (2) how PC activity reflects these two different input streams. We use population calcium imaging to measure ION and GC responses to flashes of diverse luminance and duration. First, we observe that GCs show tonic and graded responses, as opposed to IONs, whose activity peaks mostly at luminance transitions, consistently with the notion that GCs and IONs encode context and error information, respectively. Second, we show that GC activity is patterned over time: some neurons exhibit sustained responses for the entire duration of the stimulus, while in others activity ramps up with slow time constants. This activity could provide a substrate for time representation in the cerebellum. Together, our observations give support to the notion of an error signal coming from IONs and provide the first experimental evidence for a temporal patterning of GC activity over many seconds.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0043-24.2024?rss=1">Neural Filtering of Physiological Tremor Oscillations to Spinal Motor Neurons Mediates Short-Term Acquisition of a Skill Learning Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The acquisition of a motor skill involves adaptations of spinal and supraspinal pathways to alpha motoneurons. In this study, we estimated the shared synaptic contributions of these pathways to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the short-term acquisition of a new force-matching task. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was acquired from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI; 7 males and 6 females) and tibialis anterior (TA; 7 males and 4 females) during 15 trials of an isometric force-matching task. For two selected trials (pre- and post-skill acquisition), we decomposed the HDsEMG into motor unit spike trains, tracked motor units between trials, and calculated the mean discharge rate and the coefficient of variation of interspike interval (COV<SUB>ISI</SUB>). We also quantified the post/pre ratio of motor units&rsquo; coherence within delta, alpha, and beta bands. Force-matching improvements were accompanied by increased mean discharge rate and decreased COV<SUB>ISI</SUB> for both muscles. Moreover, the area under the curve within alpha band decreased by ~22% (TA) and ~13% (FDI), with no delta or beta bands changes. These reductions correlated significantly with increased coupling between force/neural drive and target oscillations. These results suggest that short-term force-matching skill acquisition is mediated by attenuation of physiological tremor oscillations in the shared synaptic inputs. Supported by simulations, a plausible mechanism for alpha band reductions may involve spinal interneuron phase-cancelling descending oscillations. Therefore, during skill learning, the central nervous system acts as a matched filter, adjusting synaptic weights of shared inputs to suppress neural components unrelated to the specific task.</p>

                <p>Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons, classified by their expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, play crucial roles in the function and plasticity of the lateral habenular nucleus (LHb). This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the LHb by collecting information about the heterogeneity of LHb PV neurons in mice. To achieve this, we investigated the proportions of the transmitter machinery in LHb PV neurons, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter markers, using transcriptome analysis, mRNA in situ hybridization chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. LHb PV neurons comprise three subsets: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and double-positive for glutamatergic and GABAergic machinery. By comparing the percentages of the subsets, we found that the LHb was topographically organized anteroposteriorly; the GABAergic and glutamatergic PV neurons were preferentially distributed in the anterior and posterior LHb, respectively, uncovering the anteroposterior topography of the LHb. In addition, we confirmed the mediolateral topography of lateral GABAergic PV neurons. These findings suggest that PV neurons play distinct roles in different parts of the LHb along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes, facilitating the topographic function of the LHb. It would be interesting to determine whether their topography is differentially involved in various cognitive and motivational processes associated with the LHb, particularly the involvement of posterior glutamatergic PV neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e0020242024?rss=1">Distinct Action Signals by Subregions in the Nucleus Accumbens during STOP-Change Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to contribute to motivated behavior by signaling the value of reward-predicting cues and the delivery of anticipated reward. The NAc is subdivided into core and shell, with each region containing different populations of neurons that increase or decrease firing to rewarding events. While there are numerous theories of functions pertaining to these subregions and cell types, most are in the context of reward processing, with fewer considering that the NAc might serve functions related to action selection more generally. We recorded from single neurons in the NAc as rats of both sexes performed a STOP&ndash;change task that is commonly used to study motor control and impulsivity. In this task, rats respond quickly to a spatial cue on 80% of trials (GO) and must stop and redirect planned movement on 20% of trials (STOP). We found that the activity of reward-excited neurons signaled accurate response direction on GO, but not STOP, trials and that these neurons exhibited higher precue firing after correct trials. In contrast, reward-inhibited neurons significantly represented response direction on STOP trials at the time of the instrumental response. Finally, the proportion of reward-excited to reward-inhibited neurons and the strength of precue firing decreased as the electrode traversed the NAc. We conclude that reward-excited cells (more common in core) promote proactive action selection, while reward-inhibited cells (more common in shell) contribute to accurate responding on STOP trials that require reactive suppression and redirection of behavior.</p>

                <p>Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK506), are commonly used immunosuppressants for preserving transplanted organs and tissues. However, these drugs can cause severe and persistent pain. GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) are implicated in various neurological disorders, including neuropathic pain. It is unclear whether and how constitutive calcineurin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protein phosphatase, controls synaptic CP-AMPARs. In this study, we found that blocking CP-AMPARs with IEM-1460 markedly reduced the amplitude of AMPAR-EPSCs in excitatory neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2), but not in inhibitory neurons expressing vesicular GABA transporter, in the spinal cord of FK506-treated male and female mice. FK506 treatment also caused an inward rectification in the current&ndash;voltage relationship of AMPAR-EPSCs specifically in VGluT2 neurons. Intrathecal injection of IEM-1460 rapidly alleviated pain hypersensitivity in FK506-treated mice. Furthermore, FK506 treatment substantially increased physical interaction of &alpha;2-1 with GluA1 and GluA2 in the spinal cord and reduced GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions of spinal cords. Correspondingly, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with pregabalin, <I>Cacna2d1</I> genetic knock-out, or disrupting &alpha;2-1&ndash;AMPAR interactions with an &alpha;2-1 C terminus peptide reversed inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons caused by FK506 treatment. In addition, CK2 inhibition reversed FK506 treatment&ndash;induced pain hypersensitivity, &alpha;2-1 interactions with GluA1 and GluA2, and inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons. Thus, the increased prevalence of synaptic CP-AMPARs in spinal excitatory neurons plays a major role in calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain hypersensitivity. Calcineurin and CK2 antagonistically regulate postsynaptic CP-AMPARs through &alpha;2-1&mdash;mediated GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly in the spinal dorsal horn.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e0914232024?rss=1">Selective Enhancement of REM Sleep in Male Rats through Activation of Melatonin MT1 Receptors Located in the Locus Ceruleus Norepinephrine Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep disorders affect millions of people around the world and have a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. While current hypnotics mostly increase non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), drugs acting selectively on enhancing rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) are lacking. This polysomnographic study in male rats showed that the first-in-class selective melatonin MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor partial agonist UCM871 increases the duration of REMS without affecting that of NREMS. The REMS-promoting effects of UCM871 occurred by inhibiting, in a dose&ndash;response manner, the firing activity of the locus ceruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons, which express MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. The increase of REMS duration and the inhibition of LC-NE neuronal activity by UCM871 were abolished by MT<SUB>1</SUB> pharmacological antagonism and by an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, which selectively knocked down MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the LC-NE neurons. In conclusion, MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor agonism inhibits LC-NE neurons and triggers REMS, thus representing a novel mechanism and target for REMS disorders and/or psychiatric disorders associated with REMS impairments.</p>
