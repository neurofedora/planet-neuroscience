	<p>Objective: To investigate the relationship of lobar and deep brain regions with post-stroke dysphagia (PSD). Method: The databases of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from the establishment to May 2022. Studies that investigated the effects of lesions in lobar and deep brain regions on swallowing function after stroke were screened. The primary outcomes were PSD-related brain regions (including aspiration-related and oral transit time-related brain regions). The secondary outcomes were the incidence rate of PSD. The brain regions with the most overlap in the included studies were considered to be most relevant to PSD, and were presented as percentages. Data were compared utilizing the t-tests for continuous variables and &amp;amp;chi;2 for frequency-based variables. Result: A total of 24 studies and 2306 patients were included. The PSD-related lobar and deep brain regions included the insular cortex, frontal lobe, temporal gyrus, basal ganglia, postcentral, precentral, precuneus, corona radiate, etc. Among these brain regions, the insular cortex was most frequently reported (taking up 54.2%) in the included studies. Furthermore, the total incidence rate of PSD was around 40.4%, and the incidence of male was nearly 2.57 times as much as that of female (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 196.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In lobar and deep brain regions, the insular cortex may be most relevant to PSD and aspiration, which may be a potentially promising target in the treatment of PSD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estrogens dynamically regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats</a></h4>

              
                Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition but how they influence maturation pathways of new neurons is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on various aspects of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized young adult Sprague-Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17{beta}-estradiol or estrone. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused one, two, or three weeks after BrdU injection and treatment. Immunofluorescent labelling for Sox2 and Ki67 were used to examine the density of neural stem cells and proliferating cells, respectively. Double-immunofluorescent labelling of BrdU with doublecortin (DCX) or NeuN was used to examine the attrition and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estradiol reduced the density of neural stem cells in the dorsal DG, whereas estrone reduced the density of neural stem cells in the ventral DG. Furthermore, estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced, cell proliferation after one week but not after longer exposure to hormones. Both estrogens increased the density of BrdU/DCX-ir cells after one week of exposure but showed greater attrition of new neurons between one and two weeks after exposure. Lastly, estradiol decreased the percentage of BrdU/NeuN-ir cells in the dorsal DG after three weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate that estrogens have differential effects to modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the short term, but fewer effects after long-term exposure and that estradiol and estrone modulate neurogenesis via different pathways.

                Theories of attention argue that objects are the units of attentional selection. In real-word environments such objects can contain visual and auditory features. To understand how mechanisms of selective attention operate in multisensory environments, we created an audiovisual cocktail-party situation, in which two speakers (left and right of fixation) simultaneously articulated brief numerals. In three separate blocks, informative auditory speech was presented (a) alone or paired with (b) congruent or (c) uninformative visual speech. In all blocks, subjects localized a pre-defined numeral. While audiovisual-congruent and uninformative speech improved response times and speed of information uptake according to diffusion modeling, an ERP analysis revealed that this did not coincide with enhanced attentional engagement. Yet, consistent with object-based attentional selection, the deployment of auditory spatial attention (N2ac) was accompanied by visuo-spatial attentional orienting (N2pc) irrespective of the informational content of visual speech. Notably, an N2pc component was absent in the auditory-only condition, demonstrating that a sound-induced shift of visuo-spatial attention relies on the availability of audio-visual features evolving coherently in time. Additional analyses revealed cross-modal interactions in working memory and modulations of cognitive control.

	<p>Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk for challenges with aspects of executive function (EF). The current study explores whether heterogeneity in EF profiles can be detected within a sample of children with DS. Participants were 69 children with DS, ages 3&amp;amp;ndash;10 years (M = 6.23, SD = 1.91). T-scores from a caregiver-report measure of executive function were modeled using latent profile analysis, and auxiliary analyses examined the association between demographic and biomedical factors and probability of profile membership. The two-profile solution was the best fit for the sample, with a profile that involved elevated scores in working memory only (&amp;amp;ldquo;Working Memory Only&amp;amp;rdquo; profile; 43% of sample) and a &amp;amp;ldquo;Multi-Domain&amp;amp;rdquo; profile that involved elevated scores in planning, inhibition, and working memory (57%). The presence of congenital heart defects was associated with a higher probability of assignment to the Multi-Domain profile. Findings from this study contribute to the characterization of heterogeneous outcomes associated with DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild-type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blockers for the treatment of prostate cancer [version 3; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with the androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A hypothesis is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present hypothesis makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the hypothesis holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

                Background: Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a significant risk of spreading to other parts of the body early, orbital and ocular surrounding tissues metastases are uncommon. Case Report: This paper described a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with a locally advanced NPC and ocular metastasis and was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. One of the rare early presentations is orbital metastases with vision problems. Discussion: Orbital metastases in children are considerably more uncommon. Cachexia and malnutrition are prevalent problems in people with cancer, affecting life and longevity. Anaemia is a severe issue for nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Conclusion: Orbital metastases frequently arise in advanced stages of the disease and in the scenario of many metastases the persistence of therapy and the nasopharyngeal cancer patient's standard of living is linked to the occurrence of anaemia.

                This paper describes a laboratory protocol to perform the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay from nasopharyngeal swab samples.  It is urgently necessary to identify factors related to severe symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to assess the possibility of establishing preventive or preliminary therapeutic measures and to plan the services to be provided on hospital admission. At present, the samples recommended for microbiological diagnosis are those taken from the upper and/or the lower respiratory tract.  The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a method based on the direct digital detection of mRNA molecules by means of target-specific, colour-coded probe pairs, without the need for mRNA conversion to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. This platform includes advanced analysis tools that reduce the need for bioinformatics support and also offers reliable sensitivity, reproducibility, technical robustness and utility for clinical application, even in RNA samples of low RNA quality or concentration, such as paraffin-embedded samples. Although the protocols for the analysis of blood or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are provided by the manufacturer, no corresponding protocol for the analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples has yet been established. Therefore, the approach we describe could be adopted to determine the expression of target genes in samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the nCOUNTER technology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational multiplex panel reduction to maximize information retention in breast cancer tissue microarrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Ternes, Jia-Ren Lin, Yu-An Chen, Joe W. Gray, Young Hwan Chang</p>

Recent state-of-the-art multiplex imaging techniques have expanded the depth of information that can be captured within a single tissue sample by allowing for panels with dozens of markers. Despite this increase in capacity, space on the panel is still limited due to technical artifacts, tissue loss, and long imaging acquisition time. As such, selecting which markers to include on a panel is important, since removing important markers will result in a loss of biologically relevant information, but identifying redundant markers will provide a room for other markers. To address this, we propose computational approaches to determine the amount of shared information between markers and select an optimally reduced panel that captures maximum amount of information with the fewest markers. Here we examine several panel selection approaches and evaluate them based on their ability to reconstruct the full panel images and information within breast cancer tissue microarray datasets using cyclic immunofluorescence as a proof of concept. We show that all methods perform adequately and can re-capture cell types using only 18 of 25 markers (72% of the original panel size). The correlation-based selection methods achieved the best single-cell marker mean intensity predictions with a Spearman correlation of 0.90 with the reduced panel. Using the proposed methods shown here, it is possible for researchers to design more efficient multiplex imaging panels that maximize the amount of information retained with the limited number of markers with respect to certain evaluation metrics and architecture biases.

                <p>by Evangelos A. Dimopoulos, Alberto Carmagnini, Irina M. Velsko, Christina Warinner, Greger Larson, Laurent A. F. Frantz, Evan K. Irving-Pease</p>

Identification of specific species in metagenomic samples is critical for several key applications, yet many tools available require large computational power and are often prone to false positive identifications. Here we describe High-AccuracY and Scalable Taxonomic Assignment of MetagenomiC data (HAYSTAC), which can estimate the probability that a specific taxon is present in a metagenome. HAYSTAC provides a user-friendly tool to construct databases, based on publicly available genomes, that are used for competitive reads mapping. It then uses a novel Bayesian framework to infer the abundance and statistical support for each species identification and provide per-read species classification. Unlike other methods, HAYSTAC is specifically designed to efficiently handle both ancient and modern DNA data, as well as incomplete reference databases, making it possible to run highly accurate hypothesis-driven analyses (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., assessing the presence of a specific species) on variably sized reference databases while dramatically improving processing speeds. We tested the performance and accuracy of HAYSTAC using simulated Illumina libraries, both with and without ancient DNA damage, and compared the results to other currently available methods (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq, MALT/HOPS, and Sigma). HAYSTAC identified fewer false positives than both Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq and MALT in all simulations, and fewer than Sigma in simulations of ancient data. It uses less memory than Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq as well as MALT both during database construction and sample analysis. Lastly, we used HAYSTAC to search for specific pathogens in two published ancient metagenomic datasets, demonstrating how it can be applied to empirical datasets. HAYSTAC is available from https://github.com/antonisdim/HAYSTAC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hierarchical process model links behavioral aging and lifespan in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natasha Oswal, Olivier M. F. Martin, Sofia Stroustrup, Monika Anna Matusiak Bruckner, Nicholas Stroustrup</p>

Aging involves a transition from youthful vigor to geriatric infirmity and death. Individuals who remain vigorous longer tend to live longer, and within isogenic populations of <i>C</i>. <i>elegan</i>s the timing of age-associated vigorous movement cessation (VMC) is highly correlated with lifespan. Yet, many mutations and interventions in aging alter the proportion of lifespan spent moving vigorously, appearing to “uncouple” youthful vigor from lifespan. To clarify the relationship between vigorous movement cessation, death, and the physical declines that determine their timing, we developed a new version of the imaging platform called “The Lifespan Machine”. This technology allows us to compare behavioral aging and lifespan at an unprecedented scale. We find that behavioral aging involves a time-dependent increase in the risk of VMC, reminiscent of the risk of death. Furthermore, we find that VMC times are inversely correlated with remaining lifespan across a wide range of genotypes and environmental conditions. Measuring and modelling a variety of lifespan-altering interventions including a new RNA-polymerase II auxin-inducible degron system, we find that vigorous movement and lifespan are best described as emerging from the interplay between at least two distinct physical declines whose rates co-vary between individuals. In this way, we highlight a crucial limitation of predictors of lifespan like VMC—in organisms experiencing multiple, distinct, age-associated physical declines, correlations between mid-life biomarkers and late-life outcomes can arise from the contextual influence of confounding factors rather than a reporting by the biomarker of a robustly predictive biological age.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Individualised computational modelling of immune mediated disease onset, flare and clearance in psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fedor Shmarov, Graham R. Smith, Sophie C. Weatherhead, Nick J. Reynolds, Paolo Zuliani</p>

Despite increased understanding about psoriasis pathophysiology, currently there is a lack of predictive computational models. We developed a personalisable ordinary differential equations model of human epidermis and psoriasis that incorporates immune cells and cytokine stimuli to regulate the transition between two stable steady states of clinically healthy (non-lesional) and disease (lesional psoriasis, plaque) skin. In line with experimental data, an immune stimulus initiated transition from healthy skin to psoriasis and apoptosis of immune and epidermal cells induced by UVB phototherapy returned the epidermis back to the healthy state. Notably, our model was able to distinguish disease flares. The flexibility of our model permitted the development of a patient-specific “UVB sensitivity” parameter that reflected subject-specific sensitivity to apoptosis and enabled simulation of individual patients’ clinical response trajectory. In a prospective clinical study of 94 patients, serial individual UVB doses and clinical response (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) values collected over the first three weeks of UVB therapy informed estimation of the “UVB sensitivity” parameter and the prediction of individual patient outcome at the end of phototherapy. An important advance of our model is its potential for direct clinical application through early assessment of response to UVB therapy, and for individualised optimisation of phototherapy regimes to improve clinical outcome. Additionally by incorporating the complex interaction of immune cells and epidermal keratinocytes, our model provides a basis to study and predict outcomes to biologic therapies in psoriasis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prior fear learning enables the rapid assimilation of new fear memories directly into cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulia Concina, Annamaria Renna, Luisella Milano, Benedetto Sacchetti</p>

Long-term memory formation involves the reorganization of brain circuits, termed system consolidation. Whether and how a prior fear experience influences system consolidation of new memories is poorly understood. In rats, we found that prior auditory fear learning allows the secondary auditory cortex to immediately encode new auditory memories, with these new memories purely requiring the activation of cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation within secondary auditory cortex. Similar results were obtained in the anterior cingulate cortex for contextual fear memories. Moreover, prior learning enabled connections from these cortices to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to support recent memory retention. We propose that the reorganization of circuits that characterizes system consolidation occurs only in the first instance that an event is learned, subsequently allowing the immediate assimilation of new analogous events in final storage sites.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Obese male Zucker rats exhibit dendritic remodeling in neurons of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as spatial memory deficits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation. The Zucker rat displays genetic obesity due to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene; this model is of great interest because of its similarity to human obesity. Brain regions may be affected by obesity, but detailed information is lacking. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as the spatial memory of obese Zucker rats. We performed two experiments. Each experiment contained two experimental groups: the control group (male Long Evans rats) and the study group (obese male Zucker rats). We monitored the body weights of all rats over 4 weeks. In the first experiment, we analyzed the morphology of hippocampal neurons. Under anesthesia, we measured the abdominal and hip circumferences and collected at least 1 ml of blood to assess serum glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TGC), and cholesterol (COL) concentrations. We perfused the brains of these rats with 0.9% saline solution, incubated the brains in Golgi-Cox solution, and subsequently evaluated the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (the CA1-CA3 regions) and the entorhinal cortex as well as the morphology of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. In the second experiment, we assessed the spatial memory of animals with the Morris water maze. The Zucker rats had an obese phenotype, as indicated by their elevated body weight and increased abdominal and hip circumferences as well as elevated GLU, COL, and TGC concentrations. Analysis of neurons from the specified regions in obese male Zucker rats indicated reduced dendritic arborization and reduced dendritic spine density. In terms of spatial learning and memory, the obese Zucker rats exhibited intact spatial learning (i.e., of platform location) but deficits in spatial memory. These data provide evidence that obesity alters the morphology and function of hippocampal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal neurogenesis promotes effortful responding but does not regulate effort‐based choice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A fundamental trait of depression is low motivation. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with motivational deficits but detailed evidence on how it regulates human-relevant behavioral traits is still missing. We used the hGFAP-TK rat model to deplete actively dividing neural stem cells in the rat hippocampus. Use of the effort-discounting operant task allowed us to identify specific and detailed deficits in motivation behavior. In this task, rats are given a choice between small and large food rewards, where 2–20 lever presses are required to obtain the large reward (four sugar pellets) versus one press to receive the smaller reward (two sugar pellets). We found that depleting adult neurogenesis did not affect effort-based choice or general motivation to complete the task. However, lack of adult neurogenesis reduced the pressing rate and thus increased time to complete the required presses to obtain a reward. In summary, the present study finds that adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically reduces response vigor to obtain rewards and thus deepens our understanding in how neurogenesis shapes depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">High-resolution optogenetics in space and time</a></h4>

              
                To understand the neural mechanisms of behavior, it is necessary to both monitor and perturb the activity of ensembles of neurons with high specificity. While neural ensemble recordings have been available for decades, progress in high-resolution manipulation techniques has lagged behind. Optogenetics has enabled the manipulation of genetically defined cell types in behaving animals, and recent developments, including multipoint nanofabricated light sources, provide spatiotemporal resolution on a par with that of physiological recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo generation of bone marrow from embryonic stem cells in interspecies chimeras</a></h4>

              
                Generation of bone marrow (BM) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) promises to accelerate the development of future cell therapies for life-threatening disorders. However, such approach is limited by technical challenges to produce a mixture of functional BM progenitor cells able to replace all hematopoietic cell lineages. Herein, we used blastocyst complementation to simultaneously produce BM cell lineages from mouse ESCs in a rat. Based on FACS analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing, mouse ESCs differentiated into multiple hematopoietic and stromal cell types that were indistinguishable from normal mouse BM cells based on gene expression signatures and cell surface markers. Receptor-ligand interactions identified <i>Cxcl12-Cxcr4</i>, <i>Lama2-Itga6, App-Itga6</i>, <i>Comp-Cd47</i>, <i>Col1a1-Cd44</i> and <i>App-Il18rap</i> as major signaling pathways between hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells. Multiple hematopoietic progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mouse-rat chimeras derived more efficiently from mouse ESCs, whereas chondrocytes predominantly derived from rat cells. In the dorsal aorta and fetal liver of mouse-rat chimeras, mouse HSCs emerged and expanded faster compared to endogenous rat cells. Sequential BM transplantation of ESC-derived cells from mouse-rat chimeras rescued lethally-irradiated syngeneic mice and demonstrated long-term reconstitution potential of donor HSCs. Altogether, a fully functional bone marrow was generated from mouse ESCs using rat embryos as 'bioreactors'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein evidence of unannotated ORFs in Drosophila reveals diversity in the evolution and properties of young proteins</a></h4>

              
                <i>De novo</i> gene origination, where a previously non-genic genomic sequence becomes genic through evolution, has been increasingly recognized as an important source of evolutionary novelty across diverse taxa. Many <i>de novo</i> genes have been proposed to be protein-coding, and in several cases have been experimentally shown to yield protein products. However, the systematic study of <i>de novo</i> proteins has been hampered by doubts regarding the translation of their transcripts without the experimental observation of protein products. Using a systematic, ORF-focused mass-spectrometry-first computational approach, we identify almost 1000 unannotated open reading frames with evidence of translation (utORFs) in the model organism <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, 371 of which have canonical start codons. To quantify the comparative genomic similarity of these utORFs across <i>Drosophila</i> and to infer phylostratigraphic age, we further develop a synteny-based protein similarity approach. Combining these results with reference datasets on tissue- and life-stage-specific transcription and conservation, we identify different properties amongst these utORFs. Contrary to expectations, the fastest-evolving utORFs are not the youngest evolutionarily. We observed more utORFs in the brain than in the testis. Most of the identified utORFs may be of <i>de novo</i> origin, even accounting for the possibility of false-negative similarity detection. Finally, sequence divergence after an inferred <i>de novo</i> origin event remains substantial, raising the possibility that <i>de novo</i> proteins turn over frequently. Our results suggest that there is substantial unappreciated diversity in <i>de novo</i> protein evolution: many more may exist than have been previously appreciated; there may be divergent evolutionary trajectories; and <i>de novo</i> proteins may be gained and lost frequently. All in all, there may not exist a single characteristic model of <i>de novo</i> protein evolution, but instead, there may be diverse evolutionary trajectories for <i>de novo</i> proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neutrophil–B-cell axis impacts tissue damage control in a mouse model of intraabdominal bacterial infection via Cxcr4</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled systemic inflammation and coagulation, leading to multiorgan failure. Therapeutic options to prevent sepsis-associated immunopathology remain scarce. Here, we established a mouse model of long-lasting disease tolerance during severe sepsis, manifested by diminished immunothrombosis and organ damage in spite of a high pathogen burden. We found that both neutrophils and B cells emerged as key regulators of tissue integrity. Enduring changes in the transcriptional profile of neutrophils include upregulated Cxcr4 expression in protected, tolerant hosts. Neutrophil Cxcr4 upregulation required the presence of B cells, suggesting that B cells promoted disease tolerance by improving tissue damage control via the suppression of neutrophils’ tissue-damaging properties. Finally, therapeutic administration of a Cxcr4 agonist successfully promoted tissue damage control and prevented liver damage during sepsis. Our findings highlight the importance of a critical B-cell/neutrophil interaction during sepsis and establish neutrophil Cxcr4 activation as a potential means to promote disease tolerance during sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of cell size control is canalized towards adders or sizers by cell cycle structure and selective pressures</a></h4>

              
                Cell size is controlled to be within a specific range to support physiological function. To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from ‘sizers’, in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to ‘adders’, in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks.  If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells <i>in vivo</i>, sizers become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for the fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i>. For some size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division cycle of the green algae <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. That these size control networks evolved such self-organized criticality shows how the evolution of complex systems can drive the emergence of critical processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of orphan ligand-receptor relationships using a cell-based CRISPRa enrichment screening platform</a></h4>

              
                Secreted proteins, which include cytokines, hormones and growth factors, are extracellular ligands that control key signaling pathways mediating cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell-surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors ('orphans') and are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening do not work well for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for definition of new ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell-surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine like protein that binds to killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR's). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human secreted and membrane proteomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Airway basal cells show regionallydistinct potential to undergo metaplastic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Basal cells are multipotent stem cells of a variety of organs, including the respiratory tract, where they are major components of the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are, and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pool, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Lastly, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans. Together, the data provide novel insights into the origin and impact of basal cell heterogeneity on the establishment of regionally distinct responses of the airway epithelium during injury-repair and in disease conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Harmonic memory signals in the human cerebral cortex induced by sematic relatedness of words</a></h4>

              
                When we memorize multiple words simultaneously, semantic relatedness among those words assists memory. For example, the information of 'apple', 'banana' and 'orange' will be connected via a common concept of 'fruits' and become easy to retain and recall. Neural mechanisms underlying this semantic integration in verbal working memory remain unclear. Here I used electroencephalography (EEG) and investigated neural signals when healthy human participants memorized five nouns semantically related (Sem trial) or not (NonSem trial). The regularity of oscillatory signals (8 to 30 Hz) during the retention period was found to be lower in NonSem than Sem trials, indicating that memorizing words unrelated to each other induced a non-harmonic (irregular) waveform in the temporal cortex. These results suggest that (i) semantic features of a word are retained as a set of neural oscillations at specific frequencies and (ii) memorizing words sharing a common semantic feature produces harmonic brain responses through a resonance or integration (sharing) of the oscillatory signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interpretable brain decoding from sensations to cognition to action: graph neural networks reveal the representational hierarchy of human cognition</a></h4>

              
                Inter-subject modeling of cognitive processes has been a challenging task due to large individual variability in brain structure and function. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a potential way to project subject-specific neural responses onto a common representational space by effectively combining local and distributed brain activity through connectome-based constraints. Here we provide in-depth interpretations of biologically-constrained GNNs (BGNNs) that reach state-of-the-art performance in several decoding tasks and reveal inter-subject aligned neural representations underpinning cognitive processes. Specifically, the model not only segregates brain responses at different stages of cognitive tasks, e.g. motor preparation and motor execution, but also uncovers functional gradients in neural representations, e.g. a gradual progression of visual working memory (VWM) from sensory processing to cognitive control and towards behavioral abstraction. Moreover, the multilevel representations of VWM exhibit better inter-subject alignment in brain responses, higher decoding of cognitive states, and strong phenotypic and genetic correlations with individual behavioral performance. Our work demonstrates that biologically constrained deep-learning models have the potential towards both cognitive and biological fidelity in cognitive modeling, and open new avenues to interpretable functional gradients of brain cognition in a wide range of cognitive neuroscience questions.

                Speech, as the spoken form of language, is fundamental for human communication. The phenomenon of covert inner speech implies a functional independence of speech content and motor production. However, it remains unclear how a flexible mapping between speech content and production is achieved on the neural level. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans performing a rule-based vocalization task. On each trial, vocalization content (one of two vowels) and production form (overt or covert) were instructed independently. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found robust neural information about vocalization content and production, mostly originating from speech areas of the left hemisphere. Production signals dynamically transformed upon presentation of the content cue, whereas content signals remained largely stable throughout the trial. In sum, our results show dissociable neural representations of vocalization content and production in the human brain and provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying human vocalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attentional inhibition ability predicts neural representation during challenging auditory streaming</a></h4>

              
                Focusing on a single source within a complex auditory scene is challenging. M/EEG-based auditory attention detection allows to detect which stream, within a set of multiple concurrent streams, an individual is attending to. The high inter-individual variability in the AAD performance is most often attributed to physiological factors and signal to noise ratio of neural data. Here we address the hypothesis that cognitive factors and in particular sustained attention, WM and attentional inhibition, may also partly explain the variability in AAD performance, because they support the cognitive processes required when listening to complex auditory scenes. Here, we chose a particularly challenging auditory scene, by presenting dichotically polyphonic classical piano excerpts lasting one minute each. Two different excerpts were presented simultaneously in each ear. Forty-one participants, with different degrees of musical expertise, listened to these complex auditory scenes focussing on one ear while we recorded the EEG. Participants also completed several tasks assessing executive functions. As expected, attended stimuli were better decoded than unattended stimuli. Importantly, attentional inhibition ability did explain around 10% of the reconstruction accuracy and around 8% of the classification accuracy. No other cognitive function was a significant predictor of reconstruction or of classification accuracies. No clear effect of musical expertise was found on reconstruction and classification performances. In conclusion, cognitive factors seem to impact the robustness of the auditory representation and hence the performance of neural based decoding approaches. Taking advantage of this relation could be useful to improve next-generation hearing aids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accelerated signal propagation speed in human neocortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are significantly larger and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically-connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), soma-to-soma signal propagation delay is similar in humans and rodents. Thus, to compensate for the increase in neurons size, membrane potential changes must propagate faster in human axons and/or dendrites. Dual somato-dendritic and somato-axonal patch recordings show that action potentials (APs) propagation speed is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of the EPSPs and the back-propagating APs are ~1.7-fold faster in human dendrites. Faithful biophysical models of human and rat L2/3 PCs, combined with pharmacological manipulations of membrane properties, showed that the larger dendritic diameter, combined with differences in cable properties, underlie the accelerated signal propagation in human cortical circuits. The implication for information processing in the human brain are discussed.

                The present study characterized associations among brain metabolite levels, applying bivariate and multivariate (i.e., factor analysis) statistical methods to tCr-referenced estimates of the major PRESS 1H-MRS metabolites (i.e., tNAA/tCr, tCho/tCr, mI/tCr, Glx/tCr), acquired from medial parietal lobe in a large (n=299), well-characterized international cohort of healthy volunteers (Povazan et al., 2020). Results supported the hypothesis that 1H-MRS-measured metabolite estimates are moderately intercorrelated (Mr = 0.42, SDr = 0.11, ps < 0.001), with more than half (i.e., 57%) of the total variability in metabolite estimates common to (i.e., shared by) all metabolites. Older age was significantly associated with lower levels of common metabolite variance (CMV; {beta} = -0.09, p = 0.048), despite not being associated with levels of any individual metabolite. Holding CMV levels constant, females had significantly lower levels of total choline (i.e., unique metabolite variance or UMV; {beta} = -0.19, p < 0.001), mirroring significant bivariate correlations between sex and total choline reported previously. If replicated, these results would suggest that applied 1H-MRS researchers should shift their analytical framework from examining bivariate associations between individual metabolites and specialty-dependent (e.g., clinical, research) variables of interest (e.g., using t-tests) to examining multi-variable (i.e., covariate) associations between multiple metabolites and specialty-dependent variables of interest (e.g., using multiple regression). Without this shift, clear interpretation of associations of 1H-MRS metabolites with specialty-dependent variables of interest may not be possible.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate measurement of inhibition and excitation in human motor pools during sensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a pivotal approach in clinical and basic neurophysiology, allowing us to extract the summed activity of motor units in a given muscle. Due to the bipolar nature of the motor unit action potential, the sEMG is a non-linear representation of their underlying motor unit activity and therefore affected by signal cancellation. It is not clear how this signal cancellation influences stimulus evoked responses in sEMG. The aim of our study was to characterise how representative an evoked sEMG response was to the firing behaviour of the underlying motor pool. To do this, we first carried out simulations of a population of motor units (and their action potentials) that responded to a stimulus with a change in firing probability. Their activity was summed then rectified to generate a simulated sEMG signal or was rectified and then summed, to generate a sEMG signal with no cancellation. By comparing the two responses to that of the underlying pool we would then compare for discrepancies and for the contribution of signal cancellation. We repeated this process but by using the responses of tibialis anterior motor units to weak tibial nerve stimulation. We find that both for the simulated and experimental data the response measured through the sEMG is almost always an underestimate of the evoked response in the underlying motor pool. This is the case for both inhibitory and excitatory evoked responses. The magnitude of the inaccuracy depends on the size of the evoked response, but it cannot be accounted solely by signal cancellation, suggesting other factors may also contribute.

                Extinction is a fundamental form of inhibitory learning that is important for adapting to changing environmental contingencies. While numerous studies have investigated the neural correlates of extinction using Pavlovian fear conditioning and appetitive operant reward-seeking procedures, less is known about the neural circuitry mediating the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding. Here, we aimed to generate an extensive brain activation map of extinction learning in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. Male Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a conditioned stimulus (CS; 20 s white noise) with the delivery of a 10% sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.3 ml/CS) to a fluid port. Control groups also received CS presentations, but sucrose was delivered either during the inter-trial interval or in the home-cage. After conditioning, 1 or 6 extinction sessions were conducted in which the CS was presented but sucrose was withheld. We performed Fos immunohistochemistry and network connectivity analyses on a set of cortical, striatal, thalamic, and amygdalar brain regions. Neural activity in the prelimbic cortex, ventral orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was greater during recall relative to extinction. Conversely, prolonged extinction following 6 sessions induced increased neural activity in the infralimbic cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens shell compared to home-cage controls. All these structures were similarly recruited during recall on the first extinction session. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of brain areas and neural networks that are differentially involved in the recall versus extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voxel-Wise Brain Graphs from Diffusion MRI: Intrinsic Eigenspace Dimensionality and Application to fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Structural brain graphs are conventionally limited to defining nodes as gray matter regions from an atlas, with edges reflecting the density of axonal projections between pairs of nodes. Here we explicitly model the entire set of voxels within a brain mask as nodes of high-resolution, subject-specific graphs. We define the strength of local voxel-to-voxel connections using diffusion tensors and orientation distribution functions derived from diffusion-weighted MRI data. We study the graphs' Laplacian spectral properties on data from the Human Connectome Project. We then assess the extent of inter-subject variability of the Laplacian eigenmodes via a procrustes validation scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the extent to which functional MRI data are shaped by the underlying anatomical structure via graph signal processing. The graph Laplacian eigenmodes manifest highly resolved spatial profiles, reflecting distributed patterns that correspond to major white matter pathways. We show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the eigenspace of such high-resolution graphs is only a mere fraction of the graph dimensions. By projecting task and resting-state data on low-frequency graph Laplacian eigenmodes, we show, firstly, that brain activity can be well approximated by a small subset of low-frequency components, and secondly, that spectral graph energy profiles differ under different functional loads. The proposed graphs open new avenues in studying the brain, be it, by exploring their organisational properties via graph or spectral graph theory, or by treating them as the scaffold on which brain function is observed at the individual level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of the speech envelope from EEG using the VLAAI deep neural network.</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the processing of speech in the brain, commonly simple linear models are used to establish a relationship between brain signals and speech features. However, these linear models are ill-equipped to model a highly-dynamic, complex non-linear system like the brain, and they often require a substantial amount of subject-specific training data. This work introduces a novel speech decoder architecture: the Very Large Augmented Auditory Inference (VLAAI) network. The VLAAI network outperformed state-of-the-art subject-independent models (median Pearson correlation of 0.19, p < 0.001), yielding an increase over the well-established linear model by 52%. Using ablation techniques we identified the relative importance of each part of the VLAAI network and found that the non-linear components and output context module influenced model performance the most (10% relative performance increase). Subsequently, the VLAAI network was evaluated on a holdout dataset of 26 subjects and publicly available unseen dataset to test generalization for unseen subjects and stimuli. No significant difference was found between the holdout subjects and the default test set, and only a small difference between the default test set and the public dataset was found. Compared to the baseline models, the VLAAI network still significantly outperformed all baseline models on the public dataset. We evaluated the effect of training set size by training the VLAAI network on data from 1 up to 80 subjects and evaluated on 26 holdout subjects, revealing a logarithmic relationship between the number of subjects in the training set and the performance on unseen subjects. Finally, the subject-independent VLAAI network was fine-tuned for 26 holdout subjects to obtain subject-specific VLAAI models. With 5 minutes of data or more, a significant performance improvement was found, up to 34% (from 0.18 to 0.25 median Pearson correlation) with regards to the subject-independent VLAAI network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MicroRNA-335-5p suppresses voltage-gated sodium channel expression and may be a target for seizure control</a></h4>

              
                There remains an urgent need for new therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Sodium channel blockers are effective for seizure control in common forms of epilepsy, but loss of sodium channel function underlies some genetic forms of epilepsy. Approaches that provide bi-directional control of sodium channel expression are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs which negatively regulate gene expression. Here, we show that genome-wide miRNA screening of hippocampal tissue from a rat epilepsy model, mice treated with the novel anti-seizure medicine cannabidiol (CBD) and plasma from patients with DRE, converge on a single target, miR-335-5p. Pathway analysis on predicted and validated miR-335-5p targets identified multiple voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). Intracerebroventricular injection of antisense oligonucleotides against miR-335-5p resulted in upregulation of Scn1a, Scn2a and Scn3a in the mouse brain and an increased action potential rising phase and greater excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in brain slice recordings, consistent with VGSCs as functional targets of miR-335-5p. Blocking of miR-335-5p also increased voltage-gated sodium currents in human iPSC-derived neurons. Inhibition of miR-335-5p increased susceptibility to tonic-clonic seizures in the pentylenetetrazole seizure model, whereas AAV9-mediated overexpression of miR-335-5p reduced seizure severity and improved survival. These studies suggest modulation of miR-335-5p may be a means to regulate VGSCs and affect brain excitability and seizures. Changes to miR-335-5p may reflect compensatory mechanisms to control excitability and could provide new biomarker or therapeutic strategies for different types of drug-resistant epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine regulates decision thresholds in human reinforcement learning.</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine fundamentally contributes to reinforcement learning by encoding predictions errors, deviations of an outcome from expectation. Prediction error coding in dopaminergic regions in human functional neuroimaging studies is well replicated. In contrast, replications of behavioral and neural effects of pharmacological modulations of the dopamine system in human reinforcement learning are scarce. Additionally, dopamine contributes to action selection, but direct evidence and process-specific accounts in human reinforcement learning are lacking. Here we examined dopaminergic mechanisms underlying human reinforcement learning in a within-subjects pharmacological approach in male human volunteers (n=31, within-subjects design; Placebo, 150mg L-dopa, 2mg Haloperidol) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging and a stationary reinforcement learning task. We had two aims. First, we aimed to replicate previously reported beneficial effects of L-dopa vs. Haloperidol on reinforcement learning from gains. This replication was not successful. We observed no performance benefit of L-Dopa vs. Haloperidol, and no evidence for alterations in neural prediction error signaling. In contrast, Bayesian analyses provided moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. This unsuccessful replication is likely at least partly due to a number of differences in experimental design. Second, using combined reinforcement learning drift diffusion models, we tested the recent proposal that dopamine contributes to action selection by regulating decision thresholds. Model comparison revealed that the data were best accounted for by a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model with separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors. The model accounted for both reductions in RTs and increases in accuracy over the course of learning. The only parameter showing robust drug effects was the boundary separation parameter, which revealed reduced decision thresholds under both L-Dopa and Haloperidol, compared to Placebo, and the degree of threshold reduction accounted for individual differences in RTs between conditions. Results are in line with the idea that striatal dopamine regulates decision thresholds during action selection, and that lower dosages of D2 receptor antagonists increase striatal DA release via an inhibition of autoreceptor-mediated feedback mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phosphatidylserine controls synaptic targeting and membrane stability of ASIC1a</a></h4>

              
                Phospholipid-protein interaction is highly specialized at the membranous nanodomains and critical for membrane receptor signaling. Calcium-permeable acid-sensing ion channel isoform 1a (ASIC1a) is a major neuronal proton sensor that contributes to synaptic plasticity. The functional outcome of ASIC1a is dependent on its surface targeting in synaptic subdomains; however, the lipid environment for ASIC1a and its role in channel targeting remain poorly understood. Here, we report that anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) is enriched in dendritic spines during neurodevelopment and it directly binds to ASIC1a through an electrostatic interaction with a di-arginine motif at ASIC1a C-terminus. PS regulates the membrane targeting and function of ASIC1a, which are both strongly suppressed by inhibition of PS synthesis. In cortical neuron dendrites, both PS and ASIC1a are predominately localized to peri-synaptic sites of spine heads, surrounding instead of overlapping with postsynaptic markers, PSD-95 and GluN1. Uncoupling the interaction between PS and ASIC1a by changing the charges to neutral or acidic at the di-arginine PS-binding motif, or applying a membrane penetrating competing peptide, caused mistargeting of ASIC1a at the synaptic sites, an overall increase in internalization and/or cytoplasmic accumulation of ASIC1a, and a decrease in its channel function. Together, our results provide novel insights on lipid microenvironment that governs ASIC1a expression and function at the membrane surface, especially peri-synaptic regions of dendritic spines, through an electrostatic interaction with anionic phospholipids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macaque amygdala, claustrum and pulvinar support the cross-modal association of social audio-visual stimuli based on meaning</a></h4>

              
                Social communication draws on several cognitive functions such as perception, emotion recognition and attention. In a previous study, we demonstrated that macaques associate audio-visual information when processing their species-specific communicative signals. Specifically, cortical activation is inhibited when there is a mismatch between vocalisations and social visual information whereas activation is enhanced in the lateral sulcus, superior temporal sulcus as well as a larger network composed of early visual and prefrontal areas when vocalisations and social visual information match. Here, we use a similar task and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the role of subcortical structures. We identify three subcortical regions involved in audio-visual processing of species-specific communicative signal: the amygdala, the claustrum and the pulvinar. Like the cortex, these subcortical structures are not activated when there is a mismatch between visual and acoustic information. In contrast, the amygdala and claustrum are activated by visual, auditory congruent and audio-visual stimulations. The pulvinar responds in a task-dependent manner, along a specific spatial sensory gradient. Anterior pulvinar responds to auditory stimuli, medial pulvinar is activated by auditory, audio-visual and visual stimuli and the dorsal lateral pulvinar only responds to visual stimuli in a pure visual task. The medial pulvinar and the amygdala are the only subcortical structures integrating audio-visual social stimuli. We propose that these three structures belong to a multisensory network that modulates the perception of visual socioemotional information and vocalizations as a function of the relevance of the stimuli in the social context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Apolipoprotein E4 modulates astrocyte neuronal support functions in the presence of amyloid-β</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a lipid transporter produced predominantly by astrocytes in the brain. The {epsilon}4 variant of APOE (APOE4) is the strongest and most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Although the molecular mechanisms of this increased risk are unclear, APOE4 is known to alter immune signaling and lipid and glucose metabolism. Astrocytes provide various forms of support to neurons, including regulating neuron metabolism and immune responses through cytokine signaling. Changes in astrocyte function due to APOE4 may therefore decrease neuronal support, leaving neurons more vulnerable to stress and disease insults. To determine whether APOE4 alters astrocyte neuronal support functions, we measured glycolytic and oxidative metabolism of neurons treated with conditioned media from APOE4 or APOE3 (the common, risk-neutral variant) primary astrocyte cultures. We found that APOE4 neurons treated with conditioned media from resting APOE4 astrocytes had similar metabolism to APOE3 astrocytes, but treatment with ACM from astrocytes challenged with amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a key pathological protein in AD, caused APOE4 neurons to increase their basal mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolic rates more than APOE3 neurons. These changes were not due to differences in astrocytic lactate production or glucose utilization, but instead correlated with increased glycolytic ATP production and a lack of cytokine secretion response to A{beta}. Together, these findings suggest that in the presence of A{beta}, APOE4 astrocytes alter immune and metabolic functions that result in a compensatory increase in neuronal metabolic stress.

                Adult mammalian spinal cord stops re-entering sensory axons, resulting in incurable sensory loss after dorsal root injury. Challenging the prevailing view, we previously showed that axons rapidly stop by forming synaptic, not dystrophic endings, and that myelin inhibitors and CSPGs are not the primary mechanism arresting axons. Here, we report that in adult mice dystrophic endings are formed by occasional axons embedded in fibrous collagens, exclusively at the CNS:PNS boundary where oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs, or NG2 glia) are sparse. Most axons stop beyond the boundary in extensive contacts with OPC processes. Live imaging, immuno-EM and OPC-DRG co-culture show that axonal synapses form on OPCs. Genetic OPC ablation, although incomplete, enables many axons to continue regenerating deep into the spinal cord. These data, together with earlier findings, conclusively demonstrate that axons stop largely because OPCs stimulate presynaptic differentiation. We identify OPCs as a major regenerative barrier at the CNS:PNS border.

                Identifying white matter (WM) microstructure parameters that reflect the underlying biology of the brain will advance our understanding of ageing and brain health. In this extensive comparison of brain age predictions and age-associations of WM features from different diffusion approaches, we analysed UK Biobank diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data across midlife and older age (N = 35,749, 44.6 to 82.8 years of age). Conventional and advanced dMRI approaches were consistent in predicting brain age; with their WM-features similarly related to and predicted by age. However, brain age was estimated best when combining approaches, showing different aspects of WM to contribute to brain age. Fornix was found as the central region for brain age predictions across diffusion approaches. We encourage the application of multiple dMRI approaches for detailed insights into WM, and the further investigation of fornix as a potential biomarker of brain age and ageing.

                Brain states are frequently represented using a unidimensional scale measuring the richness of subjective experience (level of consciousness). This description assumes a mapping between the high-dimensional space of whole-brain configurations and the trajectories of brain states associated with changes in consciousness, yet this mapping and its properties remain unknown. We combined whole-brain modelling, data augmentation and deep learning for dimensionality reduction to determine a mapping representing states of consciousness in a low-dimensional space, where distances parallel similarities between states. An orderly trajectory from wakefulness to brain injured patients is revealed in a latent space whose coordinates represent metrics related to functional modularity and structure-function coupling, both increasing alongside loss of consciousness. Finally, we investigated the effects of model perturbations, providing geometrical interpretation for the stability and reversibility of states. We conclude that conscious awareness depends on functional patterns encoded as a low-dimensional trajectory within the vast space of brain configurations.

                Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by alternating manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes, with rare reports on the mechanism of manic/depressive behavior switching. Our study revealed that knockdown of Per2 in the hippocampal CA1 brain region induced manic-like behavior in rats, in contrast, over-expression of the Per2 gene in the same brain region results in depression-like behavior, indicating that Per2 mediates the manic/depressive phenotype switch. It is known that pCREB is the transcription factor of Per2. We found that pCREB regulates the expression of Per2 and pCREB-Per2 pathway mediates the manic/depressive behavioral switch. This provides a novel animal model of bipolar disorder, which may be the first animal model that presents both mania and depression-like behaviors,and may promote the progress of research into bipolar disorder.

                Cortical state is modulated by myriad cognitive and physiological mechanisms. Yet it is still unclear how changes in cortical state relate to changes in neuronal processing. Previous studies have reported state dependent changes in response gain or population-wide shared variability, motivated by the fact that both are important determinants of the performance of any population code. However, if the state-conditioned cortical regime is well-captured by a linear input-output response (as is often the case), then the linear Fisher information (FI) about a stimulus available to a decoder is invariant to state changes. In this study we show that by contrast, when one restricts a decoder to a subset of a cortical population, information within the subpopulation can increase through a modulation of cortical state. A clear example of such a subpopulation code is one in which decoders only receive projections from excitatory cells in a recurrent excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) network. We demonstrate the counterintuitive fact that when decoding only from E cells, it is exclusively the I cell response gain and connectivity which govern how information changes. Additionally, we propose a parametrically simplified approach to studying the effect of state change on subpopulation codes. Our results reveal the importance of inhibitory circuitry in modulating information flow in recurrent cortical networks, and establish a framework in which to develop deeper mechanistic insight into the impact of cortical state changes on information processing in these circuits.

                Finding reliable imaging biomarkers of mental illness has been a major challenge, on a par with the quest for biomarkers of the male versus the female brain, as the two types of imaging inform one another. We explored the hypothesis that the degree of coherence (internal isomorphism) between brain volumes of the left versus the right hemisphere for patients with psychopathological conditions follows the brain coherence pattern of the healthy male or healthy female. We developed the distance index (DI) as a biomarker of brain coherence and compared it with three ad hoc coherence measures. We found that only DI could reliably distinguish males from females and patients from controls. Also, cortical regions with highest DI scores were swapped between males and females across groups following male/female models of psychopathology. Furthermore, although indices were similar in predicting cognitive performance, DI provided a more proportionate prediction pattern across diagnosis groups, and more robust interactions with males/females. These findings highlight the importance of brain coherence, particularly measured by DI, for phenotyping sex and mental illness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The BeMoBIL Pipeline for automated analyses of multimodal mobile brain and body imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in hardware technology and analysis methods allow more and more mobility in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) studies may record various types of data such as motion or eye tracking in addition to neural activity. Although there are options available to analyze EEG data in a standardized way, they do not fully cover complex multimodal data from mobile experiments. We thus propose the BeMoBIL Pipeline, an easy-to-use pipeline in MATLAB that supports the time-synchronized handling of multimodal data. It is based on EEGLAB and fieldtrip and consists of automated functions for EEG preprocessing and subsequent source separation. It also provides functions for motion data processing and extraction of event markers from different data modalities, including the extraction of events from EEG using independent component analysis. The pipeline introduces a new robust method for region-of-interest-based group-level clustering of independent EEG components. Finally, the BeMoBIL Pipeline provides analytical visualizations at various processing steps, keeping the analysis transparent and allowing for quality checks of the resulting outcomes. All parameters and steps are documented within the data structure and can be fully replicated using the same scripts. This pipeline makes the processing and analysis of (mobile) EEG and body data more reliable and independent of the prior experience of the individual researchers, thus facilitating the use of EEG in general and MoBI in particular. It is an open-source project available for download at https://github.com/BeMoBIL/bemobil-pipeline which allows for community-driven adaptations in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fluorescence lifetime enables high-resolution analysis of neuromodulator dynamics across time and animals</a></h4>

              
                Optical sensors have transformed the field of neuromodulation because neuromodulator dynamics are essential for their function. Despite their high spatial and temporal resolution, these fluorescence intensity-based sensors are sensitive to sensor expression level and excitation light fluctuation, thus preventing analysis of neuromodulators across time or animals. Here, we screened neuromodulator sensors and discovered that multiple sensors showed response in fluorescence lifetime, a property independent of sensor expression or excitation light power. The acetylcholine sensor GRAB-ACh3.0 showed the largest lifetime change. Fluorescence lifetime of GRAB-ACh3.0 responds to transient ACh release, is dose sensitive, and is insensitive to excitation laser power. In mice across sleep/wake and running/resting states, fluorescence lifetime, in contrast to intensity, predicts behavior states accurately despite change in sensor expression level across weeks and animals. Thus, fluorescence lifetime of neuromodulator sensors enables comparison of neuromodulator dynamics at high resolution across different animals, brain regions, disease models, and chronic time scales.

                Binge eating (BE) is a persistent behavior associated with a chronic course of illness and poor treatment outcomes. While clinical research is unable to capture the full course of BE, pre-clinical approaches offer the opportunity to examine binge-like eating from onset through chronic durations, allowing identification of factors contributing to BE persistence. The current study quantified the trajectories of binge-like eating onset and modeled cycles of abstinence/relapse to develop a translational model for BE persistence. Adult male and female C57Bl6/J mice were randomized to a binge-like palatable food (PF) access schedule (daily 2-hour, 3x/week) or continuous, non-binge like PF access for 12 days (Experiment 1). Persistence of PF consumption in both binge-like PF access groups was then examined across three cycles of forced abstinence and re-exposure to PF (incubation) to model the persistence of BE in clinical populations. Mice with daily 2 hour PF access escalated their intake more than mice in the 3x/week or continuous groups (Experiment 1). This pattern was more pronounced in females. In addition, this pattern of PF intake re-emerged across multiple cycles of behavioral incubation (Experiment 2). These findings provide a model of binge-like eating in mice that can be used in future studies examining both environmental factors and neural mechanisms contributing to BE persistence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">kcna1a mutant zebrafish as a model of episodic ataxia type 1 and epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: KCNA1 mutations are associated with a rare neurological movement disorder known as episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), with epilepsy as a common comorbidity. Current medications only provide partial relief to ataxia and/or seizures, making new drugs needed. Here, we investigate the utility of zebrafish kcna1a-/- as a model of EA1 with epilepsy by characterizing its phenotype and comparing the efficacy of the first-line therapy carbamazepine in kcna1a-/- zebrafish to Kcna1-/- rodents. Methods: We used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to introduce a mutation in the sixth segment of the zebrafish Kcna1 protein. Behavioral and electrophysiological assays were performed on kcna1a-/- larvae to assess ataxia- and epilepsy-related phenotypes. We also carried out real-time qPCRs to measure the transcript levels of brain hyperexcitability markers and bioenergetic profiling of kcna1a-/- larvae to evaluate their metabolic health. Carbamazepine efficacy was tested using behavioral assessments in kcna1a-/- zebrafish and seizure frequency in Kcna1-/- mice. Results: kcna1a-/- zebrafish showed uncoordinated movements and locomotor deficits. The mutants also exhibited impaired startle responses when exposed to light-dark flashes and acoustic stimulation. Extracellular field recordings and upregulated fosab transcript levels showed hyperexcitability of the kcna1a-/- brain. Further, vglut2a and gad1b transcript levels were altered, indicative of neuronal excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in the kcna1a-/- brain. Metabolic health was also compromised in kcna1a-/- as seen by a significant reduction in measures of cellular respiration. Notably, carbamazepine reduced the impaired startle response in kcna1a-/- zebrafish but had no effect on the seizure frequency in Kcna1-/- mice, suggesting that this EA1 zebrafish model might better translate to human efficacy compared to rodents. Significance: We conclude that zebrafish kcna1a-/- larvae show ataxia and epilepsy-related phenotypes and that they are responsive to carbamazepine treatment, consistent with EA1 patients. This study supports the notion that these zebrafish disease models can be useful for drug screening as well as studying the underlying disease biology.

                The human thalamus is a highly connected brain structure, which is key for the control of numerous functions and is involved in several neurological disorders. Recently, neuroimaging studies have increasingly focused on the volume and connectivity of the specific nuclei comprising this structure, rather than looking at the thalamus as a whole. However, accurate identification of cytoarchitectonically designed histological nuclei on standard in vivo structural MRI is hampered by the lack of image contrast that can be used to distinguish nuclei from each other and from surrounding white matter tracts. While diffusion MRI may offer such contrast, it has lower resolution and lacks some boundaries visible in structural imaging. In this work, we present a Bayesian segmentation algorithm for the thalamus. This algorithm combines prior information from a probabilistic atlas with likelihood models for both structural and diffusion MRI, allowing label boundaries to be informed by both modalities. We present an improved probabilistic atlas, incorporating 26 thalamic nuclei identified from histology and 45 white matter tracts identified in ultra-high gradient strength diffusion imaging. We present a family of likelihood models for diffusion tensor imaging, ensuring compatibility with the vast majority of neuroimaging datasets that include diffusion MRI data. The use of these diffusion likelihood models greatly improves identification of nuclei versus segmentation based solely on structural MRI. Dice comparison of 5 manually identifiable groups of nuclei to ground truth segmentations show improvements of up to 10 percentage points. Additionally, our chosen model shows a high degree of reliability, with median test-retest Dice scores above 0.85 for four out of five nuclei groups, whilst also offering improved detection of differential thalamic involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AUROC 83.36%). The probabilistic atlas and segmentation tool will be made publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.

                Social decision-making is omnipresent in everyday life, carrying the potential for both positive and negative consequences for the decision-maker and those closest to them. While evidence suggests that decision makers use value-based heuristics to guide choice behavior, very little is known about how decision makers' representations of other agents influence social choice behavior. We used multivariate pattern expression analyses on fMRI data to understand how value-based processes shape neural representations of those affected by one's social decisions and whether value-based encoding is associated with social decision preferences. We found that stronger value-based encoding of a given close other (e.g., parent) relative to a second close other (e.g., friend) was associated with a greater propensity to favor the former during subsequent social decision-making. These results are the first to our knowledge to explicitly show that value-based processes affect decision behavior via representations of close others.

                Transient synchronization of bursting activity in neural networks, which occurs in patterns of metastable phase relationships between neurons, is a notable feature of network dynamics observed in vivo. However, the mechanisms that contribute to this dynamical complexity in neural circuits are not well understood. Local circuits in cortical regions consist of populations of neurons with diverse intrinsic oscillatory features. In this study, we numerically show that the phenomenon of transient synchronization, also referred to as metastability, emerges in an inhibitory neural population when the neurons' intrinsic fast-spiking dynamics are appropriately modulated by slower inputs from an excitatory neural population. Using a compact model of a mesoscopic-scale network consisting of excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory fast-spiking neurons, our work demonstrates a relationship between the frequency of neural oscillations and the features of emergent metastability. In addition, a novel metric is formulated to characterize collective transitions in metastable networks. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our compact representation of mesoscopic network metastability in modeling whole-brain resting-state dynamics using empirically estimated anatomical connectivity.

It is widely accepted that the sex hormone estrogen plays a protective metabolic role in premenopausal women, in part through central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms. However, most work to date has focused on the loss of estrogen in females (e.g., menopause). Interestingly, transgender individuals receiving feminizing gender affirming therapy (i.e., estrogen) are relatively protected from metabolic syndrome conditions, pointing to a role for CNS estrogen in the development of metabolic syndrome in men. Here, we show that estrogen signaling in the brain protects males from metabolic syndrome and obesity related complications. First, short-term CNS specific supplementation of low-dose 17-&amp;amp;beta;-estradiol in diet-induced obese male mice resulted in a significant reduction in body weight in parallel with a decrease in food intake without alterations in energy expenditure. In conjunction, central supplementation of estrogen reduced visceral adiposity, including epididymal and abdominal regions, with slighter decreases in subcutaneous inguinal and thermogenic brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, central estrogen administration reduced the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome including hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings indicate that a lack of estrogen action in the brain may predispose males to metabolic syndrome pathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Background: Chronic pain and body perception disturbance are common following stroke. It is possible that an interaction exists between pain and body perception disturbance, and that a change in one may influence the other. We therefore investigated the presence of body perception disturbance in individuals with stroke, aiming to determine if a perceived change in hand size contralateral to the stroke lesion is more common in those with chronic pain than in those without. Methods: Stroke survivors (N = 523) completed an online survey that included: stroke details, pain features, and any difference in perceived hand size post-stroke. Results: Individuals with stroke who experienced chronic pain were almost three times as likely as those without chronic pain to perceive their hand as now being a different size (OR = 2.895; 95%CI 1.844, 4.547). Further, those with chronic pain whose pain included the hand were almost twice as likely to perceive altered hand size than those whose pain did not include the hand (OR = 1.862; 95%CI 1.170, 2.962). This was not influenced by hemisphere of lesion (p = 0.190). Conclusions: The results point to a new characteristic of chronic pain in stroke, raising the possibility of body perception disturbance being a rehabilitation target to improve function and pain-related outcomes for stroke survivors.</p>

	<p>A potential relationship between unrestricted sucrose intake (USI), overweight, and emotional/behavioral control has not been well documented. We examined the influence of USI and having less sweetness than expected on body weight (BW), motor/exploratory, anxiety-like, and social dominant behavior in adult C57BL/6J male mice. Animals had free access to water (group 1) or 32% sucrose and water (sucrose groups 2&amp;amp;ndash;5) for 10 days. Then, group 2 remained with 32% sucrose while groups 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 were subjected to the downshift (24 h access to 4%, 8%, or 16% sucrose). All experimental groups were weighed and tested in the novel-open arena (NA), elevated plus maze (EPM), and tube tests to assess BW, motor/exploratory, anxiety-like, and social dominance behavior, respectively. USI did not influence animals&amp;amp;rsquo; BW but produced hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behavior, which was evident in EPM but not in NA; the outcomes of the downshift were comparable. USI did not influence successes/wins in the tube test but altered emotions that drive the winning, favoring a less anxious behavioral phenotype; this was not evident in the downshifted groups. Observed findings suggest that USI promotes sensation-seeking and motivates dominance, without changing BW, while blunted emotional base of social dominance might be an early mark of the downshift.</p>

	<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality and substantial long-term morbidity. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a new pathogen that causes a disease with variable clinical manifestations. Although the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulopathy, patients may also present with cerebral hemorrhage, including SAH. The present paper reports a protocol for a scoping review that is aimed to provide a comprehensive report on existing literature by examining data on SAH associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective is to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of SAH in patients with COVID-19 and to explore the etiology and possible interventions in this pathology. Using appropriate search terms, we will search LitCOVID, the WHO database on COVID-19, and MedRxiv. The inclusion criteria are pre-defined. We will extract the data of eligible studies in standardized forms and will report the results in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We will provide information for clinicians, healthcare providers, and public health specialists.</p>

	<p>Background and Purpose: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) leads to ulceration, noninvasive amputation, and long-term disability. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for forecasting the probability of DPN in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Methods: From February 2017 to May 2021, 778 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in this study. We confirmed the diagnosis of DPN according to the Toronto Expert Consensus. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 519) and a validation cohort (n = 259). In the training cohort, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, and a simple nomogram was built using the stepwise method. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis were computed in order to validate the discrimination and clinical value of the nomogram model. Results: About 65.7% and 72.2% of patients were diagnosed with DPN in the training and validation cohorts. We developed a novel nomogram to predict the probability of DPN based on the parameters of age, gender, duration of diabetes, body mass index, uric acid, hemoglobin A1c, and free triiodothyronine. The areas under the curves (AUCs) of the nomogram model were 0.763 in the training cohort and 0.755 in the validation cohort. The calibration plots revealed well-fitted accuracy between the predicted and actual probability in the training and validation cohorts. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical value of the nomogram. In subgroup analysis, the predictive ability of the nomogram model was strong. Conclusions: The nomogram of age, gender, duration of diabetes, body mass index, uric acid, hemoglobin A1c, and free triiodothyronine may assist clinicians with the early identification of DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

	<p>Excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated through N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) is essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. While under pathological states, abnormal NMDAR activation is involved in the occurrence and development of psychiatric disorders, which suggests a directional modulation of NMDAR activity that contributes to the remission and treatment of psychiatric disorders. This review thus focuses on the involvement of NMDARs in the pathophysiological processes of psychiatric mood disorders and analyzes the neuroprotective mechanisms of NMDARs. Firstly, we introduce NMDAR-mediated neural signaling pathways in brain function and mood regulation as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms of NMDARs in emotion-related mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Then, we provide an in-depth summary of current NMDAR modulators that have the potential to be developed into clinical drugs and their pharmacological research achievements in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Based on these findings, drug-targeting for NMDARs might open up novel territory for the development of therapeutic agents for refractory anxiety and depression.</p>

	<p>Background: The treatment of benign skull base tumors remains challenging. These tumors are often located in close relationship to critical structures. Therefore, radical resection of these tumors can be associated with high morbidity. Multimodal treatment concepts, including controlled partial tumor resection followed by radiosurgery, should be considered. Methods: Adaptive hybrid surgery analysis (AHSA) is an intraoperative tool that has been introduced for the automatic assessment of tumor properties, and virtual real-time radiosurgical treatment simulation and continuous feasibility analysis of adjuvant radiosurgery. The AHSA method (Brainlab&amp;amp;reg;, Munich, Germany) was applied to five patients who underwent partial resection of a benign skull base tumor. Tumor volumetry was obtained on pre- and postoperative MR scans. Organs at risk were, preoperative, automatically delineated with atlas mapping software (Elements&amp;amp;reg; Segmentation Cranial), and adaptations were made if necessary. Results: Five patients with benign skull base lesions underwent planned partial tumor resection in a multimodal therapeutic surgery followed by radiosurgery. The preoperative tumor volumes ranged between 8.52 and 25.2 cm3. The intraoperative residual tumor volume measured with the AHSA&amp;amp;reg; software ranged between 2.13&amp;amp;ndash;12.17 cm3 (25&amp;amp;ndash;52% of the preoperative tumor volume). The intraoperative automatic AHSA plans of the remaining tumor volume suggested, in all five patients, that safe hypofractionated radiation was feasible. Patients were followed for 69.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.04 months, and no complications occurred after the patients were treated with radiation. Conclusions: Intraoperative SRS planning based on volumetric assessments during resection of skull base tumors using AHSA&amp;amp;reg; is feasible and safe. The AHSA method allows the neurosurgeon to continuously evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant radiosurgery while planning and performing a surgical resection. This method supports the treatment strategy of a complementary approach during surgical resection of complex skull base tumors and might contribute to preventing surgical and radiosurgical complications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Improved Manual Annotation of EEG Signals through Convolutional Neural Network Guidance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of validated algorithms for automated handling of artifacts is essential for reliable and fast processing of EEG signals. Recently, there have been methodological advances in designing machine-learning algorithms to improve artifact detection of trained professionals who usually meticulously inspect and manually annotate EEG signals. However, validation of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard as data are mostly private and data annotation is time consuming and error prone. In the effort to circumvent these issues, we propose an iterative learning model to speed up and reduce errors of manual annotation of EEG. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train on expert-annotated eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG data from typically developing children (<I>n</I> = 30) and children with neurodevelopmental disorders (<I>n</I> = 141). To overcome the circular reasoning of aiming to develop a new algorithm and benchmarking to a manually-annotated gold standard, we instead aim to improve the gold standard by revising the portion of the data that was incorrectly learned by the network. When blindly presented with the selected signals for re-assessment (23% of the data), the two independent expert-annotators changed the annotation in 25% of the cases. Subsequently, the network was trained on the expert-revised gold standard, which resulted in improved separation between artifacts and nonartifacts as well as an increase in balanced accuracy from 74% to 80% and precision from 59% to 76%. These results show that CNNs are promising to enhance manual annotation of EEG artifacts and can be improved further with better gold-standard data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Comprehensive Behavioral Analysis of Opsin 3 (Encephalopsin)-Deficient Mice Identifies Role in Modulation of Acoustic Startle Reflex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opsin-3 (<I>Opn3</I>, encephalopsin) was the first nonvisual opsin gene discovered in mammals. Since then, several <I>Opn3</I> functions have been described, and in two cases (adipose tissue, smooth muscle) light sensing activity is implicated. In addition to peripheral tissues, <I>Opn3</I> is robustly expressed within the central nervous system, for which it derives its name. Despite this expression, no studies have investigated developmental or adult CNS consequences of <I>Opn3</I> loss-of-function. Here, the behavioral consequences of mice deficient in <I>Opn3</I> were investigated. <I>Opn3</I>-deficient mice perform comparably to wild-type mice in measures of motor coordination, socialization, anxiety-like behavior, and various aspects of learning and memory. However, <I>Opn3</I>-deficient mice have an attenuated acoustic startle reflex (ASR) relative to littermates. This deficit is not because of changes in hearing sensitivity, although Opn3 was shown to be expressed in auditory and vestibular structures, including cochlear outer hair cells. Interestingly, the ASR was not acutely light-dependent and did not vary between daytime and nighttime trials, despite known functions of <I>Opn3</I> in photoreception and circadian gene amplitude. Together, these results demonstrate the first role of <I>Opn3</I> on behavior, although the role of this opsin in the CNS remains largely elusive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Contributes to Human Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>This study assesses the involvement in human motor learning, of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9/46v), a somatic region in the middle frontal gyrus. The potential involvement of this cortical area in motor learning is suggested by studies in nonhuman primates which have found anatomic connections between this area and sensorimotor regions in frontal and parietal cortex, and also with basal ganglia output zones. It is likewise suggested by electrophysiological studies which have shown that activity in this region is implicated in somatic sensory memory and is also influenced by reward. We directly tested the hypothesis that area 9/46v is involved in reinforcement-based motor learning in humans. Participants performed reaching movements to a hidden target and received positive feedback when successful. Before the learning task, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt activity in 9/46v in the left or right hemisphere. A control group received sham cTBS. The data showed that cTBS to left 9/46v almost entirely eliminated motor learning, whereas learning was not different from sham stimulation when cTBS was applied to the same zone in the right hemisphere. Additional analyses showed that the basic reward-history-dependent pattern of movements was preserved but more variable following left hemisphere stimulation, which suggests an overall deficit in somatic memory for target location or target directed movement rather than reward processing per se. The results indicate that area 9/46v is part of the human motor learning circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parents’ perceptions on policies of early childhood care and education programmes in selected states of Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposed global equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all children. The quality of early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs helps shape children’s minds, attitudes and behaviors, and has short and long-term effects on a child, a family and a country. In Malaysia, the government has formulated some policies and laws to protect children’s rights. However, ECCE is facing some challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate parents’ perceptions of the quality of ECCE programs implemented by Malaysian government. Methods: A mixed method was used to collect data on parents’ perceptions of ECCE policies in selected states in Malaysia. The questionnaires, (P1/POL) from the research project “Development of a Comprehensive and Integrated Model of Quality Malaysian ECCE”, were distributed among 629 respondents who have a child in a preschool, and 22 participants were randomly selected to take part in five focus group interviews Results: The key findings of the study revealed 68% parents were not familiar with ECCE Malaysian government policy, however 84.3% stressed it is important for the government to educate them about ECCE. Thus findings indicated that the majority of parents lack awareness of the ECCE policies and quality of early childhood care and education programs related to the policies remain the issue. While interviewing the focus group ,most of them were not aware of ECCE and pointed out parents are stressing children’s academic learning in particular preschools. Conclusions: It is concluded that parents’ awareness regarding the ECCE program must be part of the policies and needs to improve. It is recommended that the government of Malaysia should supply more information on ECCE policies to parents and focus on policy implementation. Moreover, the quality of ECCE programs should be improved based on the parents’ perceptions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Machine learning-based heart attack prediction: A  symptomatic heart attack prediction method and exploratory analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background; Heart attack prediction is one of the serious causes of morbidity in the world’s population. The clinical data analysis includes a very crucial disease i.e., cardiovascular disease as one of the most important sections for the prediction. Data Science and machine learning (ML) can be very helpful in the prediction of heart attacks in which different risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, diabetes, etc... can be considered. The objective of this study is to optimize the prediction of heart disease using ML. Methods: In this paper, we are presenting a machine learning-based heart attack prediction (ML-HAP) method in which the analysis of different risk factors and prediction for heart attacks is done using ML approaches of Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and XGBoost. The data of heart disease  symptoms has been collected from the UCI ML Repository and analysis has been performed on the data using ML methods. The focus has been on optimizing the prediction on the basis of different parameters. Results: XGBoost provided the best prediction among the four. The Area under the curve achieved with XGBoost is .94 and Logistic Regression is .92. The prediction with ML models in identifying heart attack symptoms is highly efficient, especially with boosting algorithms. The prediction was done to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve. ML models are being trained to perform optimized predictions. Conclusions: This prediction can help clinically in analyzing the risk factors of the disease and interpretation of the patient scenario. Boosting the algorithm provided promising results to predict symptoms of heart disease. It can further be optimized by working further on risk factors associated with this condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indoor air quality at the Arab governmental girls’ schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: Seventeen girls’ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. In addition, a pre-designed questionnaire was used to evaluate the safety preparedness in the same selected schools. Results: Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. Levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmental constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion: The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease and viruses as negative factor prohibiting the growth of broiler chicken embryo as research topic trend: a bibliometric review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Broiler chickens have properties as meat-producing poultry and produce meat with soft fiber quality. Broiler’s embryo needs to be given attention, especially against disease. The purpose of the study was to observe the trend of the research topic and external factors which could affect the embryo’s growth of broiler. Methods This study used meta-data from Scopus. There were 162 samples started from 2006-to 2022. The data were analyzed using a bibliometric method with two software, Vosviewer, and Biblioshiy from R studio. Results It was found that the study of broiler chicken embryos had developed well, especially those related to genetics, disease, and also the immunity system. But the result showed that topics about the disease, viruses, and bacteria were more popular than topics about the gene. The result also showed that based on the importance and development of topics, the words such as “chicken”, “genes”, “development”, “effect”, growth”, and “control” had importance for the study and developed well in research. It means that genes influenced the growth of the embryo of a chicken. But still, even though a chicken gene was predetermined, the genetic engineering of chicken insemination to produce a superior breed with a fast-growing rate of the embryo could be used. Conclusions It could be stated that disease, especially research about the virus is one of the main determinants that could affect the growth of the embryo of broiler chicken.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dataset for the attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 preventive measures in diverse settings of Mozambique: a qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this data note, we provide the details of a qualitative study database conducted before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mozambique. During this period (from September 2020), several compulsory COVID-19 preventive measures were put forth as a response to the emerging pandemic in the country. Data were collected aiming to evaluate home confinement behaviours, household members’ mobility, and the mobility routes and other attitudes and practices related to COVID-19 preventive measures at the community level. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, mixed method study was conducted involving adults from different regions in Mozambique. Data were collected using a combination of rapid ethnography and rapid rural assessment methods consisting of telephone-based semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, non-participant observations and short questionnaires. The COREQ guidelines for reporting qualitative studies were performed. Results: 295 semi-structured interviews (SSI) with adult household members were included in the study. Of these, 23 were conducted face-to-face and 272 by telephone, covering 24 districts and cities in 9 provinces. More than half (53.9%) of participants were females and aged 18 - 98 years old (median [interquartile range] = 35 [29-43]). Most had a relevant role in the household, with formal education and had to leave home for income generating. Conclusion: This data, available in our repository, favours several angles of assessments of behaviour related to home confinement, mobility and routes of a population group prior to the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for the perioperative outcome risk assessment with computer learning enhancement (Periop ORACLE) randomized study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery. Registration: ORACLE is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05042804; registered September 13, 2021.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Librarian: A quality control tool to analyse sequencing library compositions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Robust analysis of DNA sequencing data needs to include a set of quality control steps to ensure that technical bias is kept to a minimum. A metric easily obtained is the frequency of each of the nucleobases for each position across all sequencing reads. Here, we explore the differences in nucleobase compositions of various library types produced by standard experimental methodologies.  Methods: We obtained the compositions of nearly 3000 publicly available datasets and subjected them to Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction for a two-dimensional representation of their composition characteristics.   Results: We find that most library types result in a specific composition profile. We use this to give an estimate of how strongly the composition of a test library resembles the profiles of previously published libraries, and how likely the test sample is to be of a particular type. We introduce Librarian, a user-friendly web application and command line tool which enables checking base compositions of test libraries against known library types.   Conclusions: Library preparation methods strongly influence the per position nucleobase content. By comparing test libraries to a database of previously published library types we can make predictions regarding the library preparation method. Librarian is a user-friendly tool to access this information for quality assurance purposes as discrepancies can flag potential irregularities very early on.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling enculturated bias in entrainment to rhythmic patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Kaplan, Jonathan Cannon, Lorenzo Jamone, Marcus Pearce</p>

Long-term and culture-specific experience of music shapes rhythm perception, leading to enculturated expectations that make certain rhythms easier to track and more conducive to synchronized movement. However, the influence of enculturated bias on the moment-to-moment dynamics of rhythm tracking is not well understood. Recent modeling work has formulated entrainment to rhythms as a formal inference problem, where phase is continuously estimated based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing). Here we propose that the problem of optimally tracking a rhythm also requires an ongoing process of inferring which pattern of event timing expectations is most suitable to predict a stimulus rhythm. We formalize this insight as an extension of PIPPET called pPIPPET (PIPPET with pattern inference). The variational solution to this problem introduces terms representing the likelihood that a stimulus is based on a particular member of a set of event timing patterns, which we initialize according to culturally-learned prior expectations of a listener. We evaluate pPIPPET in three experiments. First, we demonstrate that pPIPPET can qualitatively reproduce enculturated bias observed in human tapping data for simple two-interval rhythms. Second, we simulate categorization of a continuous three-interval rhythm space by Western-trained musicians through derivation of a comprehensive set of priors for pPIPPET from metrical patterns in a sample of Western rhythms. Third, we simulate iterated reproduction of three-interval rhythms, and show that models configured with notated rhythms from different cultures exhibit both universal and enculturated biases as observed experimentally in listeners from those cultures. These results suggest the influence of enculturated timing expectations on human perceptual and motor entrainment can be understood as approximating optimal inference about the rhythmic stimulus, with respect to prototypical patterns in an empirical sample of rhythms that represent the music-cultural environment of the listener.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Generative and interpretable machine learning for aptamer design and analysis of in vitro sequence selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrea Di Gioacchino, Jonah Procyk, Marco Molari, John S. Schreck, Yu Zhou, Yan Liu, Rémi Monasson, Simona Cocco, Petr Šulc</p>

Selection protocols such as SELEX, where molecules are selected over multiple rounds for their ability to bind to a target of interest, are popular methods for obtaining binders for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), an unsupervised two-layer neural network architecture, can successfully be trained on sequence ensembles from single rounds of SELEX experiments for thrombin aptamers. RBMs assign scores to sequences that can be directly related to their fitnesses estimated through experimental enrichment ratios. Hence, RBMs trained from sequence data at a given round can be used to predict the effects of selection at later rounds. Moreover, the parameters of the trained RBMs are interpretable and identify functional features contributing most to sequence fitness. To exploit the generative capabilities of RBMs, we introduce two different training protocols: one taking into account sequence counts, capable of identifying the few best binders, and another based on unique sequences only, generating more diverse binders. We then use RBMs model to generate novel aptamers with putative disruptive mutations or good binding properties, and validate the generated sequences with gel shift assay experiments. Finally, we compare the RBM’s performance with different supervised learning approaches that include random forests and several deep neural network architectures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of the firing behaviour of a complete motoneuron pool by combining electromyography signal decomposition and realistic motoneuron modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arnault H. Caillet, Andrew T. M. Phillips, Dario Farina, Luca Modenese</p>

Our understanding of the firing behaviour of motoneuron (MN) pools during human voluntary muscle contractions is currently limited to electrophysiological findings from animal experiments extrapolated to humans, mathematical models of MN pools not validated for human data, and experimental results obtained from decomposition of electromyographical (EMG) signals. These approaches are limited in accuracy or provide information on only small partitions of the MN population. Here, we propose a method based on the combination of high-density EMG (HDEMG) data and realistic modelling for predicting the behaviour of entire pools of motoneurons in humans. The method builds on a physiologically realistic model of a MN pool which predicts, from the experimental spike trains of a smaller number of individual MNs identified from decomposed HDEMG signals, the unknown recruitment and firing activity of the remaining unidentified MNs in the complete MN pool. The MN pool model is described as a cohort of single-compartment leaky fire-and-integrate (LIF) models of MNs scaled by a physiologically realistic distribution of MN electrophysiological properties and driven by a spinal synaptic input, both derived from decomposed HDEMG data. The MN spike trains and effective neural drive to muscle, predicted with this method, have been successfully validated experimentally. A representative application of the method in MN-driven neuromuscular modelling is also presented. The proposed approach provides a validated tool for neuroscientists, experimentalists, and modelers to infer the firing activity of MNs that cannot be observed experimentally, investigate the neuromechanics of human MN pools, support future experimental investigations, and advance neuromuscular modelling for investigating the neural strategies controlling human voluntary contractions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interaction between games give rise to the evolution of moral norms of cooperation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Salahshour</p>

In many biological populations, such as human groups, individuals face a complex strategic setting, where they need to make strategic decisions over a diverse set of issues and their behavior in one strategic context can affect their decisions in another. This raises the question of how the interaction between different strategic contexts affects individuals’ strategic choices and social norms? To address this question, I introduce a framework where individuals play two games with different structures and decide upon their strategy in a second game based on their knowledge of their opponent’s strategy in the first game. I consider both multistage games, where the same opponents play the two games consecutively, and reputation-based model, where individuals play their two games with different opponents but receive information about their opponent’s strategy. By considering a case where the first game is a social dilemma, I show that when the second game is a coordination or anti-coordination game, the Nash equilibrium of the coupled game can be decomposed into two classes, a defective equilibrium which is composed of two simple equilibrium of the two games, and a cooperative equilibrium, in which coupling between the two games emerge and sustain cooperation in the social dilemma. For the existence of the cooperative equilibrium, the cost of cooperation should be smaller than a value determined by the structure of the second game. Investigation of the evolutionary dynamics shows that a cooperative fixed point exists when the second game belongs to coordination or anti-coordination class in a mixed population. However, the basin of attraction of the cooperative fixed point is much smaller for the coordination class, and this fixed point disappears in a structured population. When the second game belongs to the anti-coordination class, the system possesses a spontaneous symmetry-breaking phase transition above which the symmetry between cooperation and defection breaks. A set of cooperation supporting moral norms emerges according to which cooperation stands out as a valuable trait. Notably, the moral system also brings a more efficient allocation of resources in the second game. This observation suggests a moral system has two different roles: Promotion of cooperation, which is against individuals’ self-interest but beneficial for the population, and promotion of organization and order, which is at both the population’s and the individual’s self-interest. Interestingly, the latter acts like a Trojan horse: Once established out of individuals’ self-interest, it brings the former with itself. Importantly, the fact that the evolution of moral norms depends only on the cost of cooperation and is independent of the benefit of cooperation implies that moral norms can be harmful and incur a pure collective cost, yet they are just as effective in promoting order and organization. Finally, the model predicts that recognition noise can have a surprisingly positive effect on the evolution of moral norms and facilitates cooperation in the Snow Drift game in structured populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Generalism drives abundance: A computational causal discovery approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chuliang Song, Benno I. Simmons, Marie-Josée Fortin, Andrew Gonzalez</p>

A ubiquitous pattern in ecological systems is that more abundant species tend to be more generalist; that is, they interact with more species or can occur in wider range of habitats. However, there is no consensus on whether generalism drives abundance (a selection process) or abundance drives generalism (a drift process). As it is difficult to conduct direct experiments to solve this chicken-and-egg dilemma, previous studies have used a causal discovery method based on formal logic and have found that abundance drives generalism. Here, we refine this method by correcting its bias regarding skewed distributions, and employ two other independent causal discovery methods based on nonparametric regression and on information theory, respectively. Contrary to previous work, all three independent methods strongly indicate that generalism drives abundance when applied to datasets on plant-hummingbird communities and reef fishes. Furthermore, we find that selection processes are more important than drift processes in structuring multispecies systems when the environment is variable. Our results showcase the power of the computational causal discovery approach to aid ecological research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep-promoting neurons remodel their response properties to calibrate sleep drive with environmental demands</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephane Dissel, Markus K. Klose, Bruno van Swinderen, Lijuan Cao, Melanie Ford, Erica M. Periandri, Joseph D. Jones, Zhaoyi Li, Paul J. Shaw</p>

Falling asleep at the wrong time can place an individual at risk of immediate physical harm. However, not sleeping degrades cognition and adaptive behavior. To understand how animals match sleep need with environmental demands, we used live-brain imaging to examine the physiological response properties of the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) following interventions that modify sleep (sleep deprivation, starvation, time-restricted feeding, memory consolidation) in <i>Drosophila</i>. We report that dFB neurons change their physiological response-properties to dopamine (DA) and allatostatin-A (AstA) in response to different types of waking. That is, dFB neurons are not simply passive components of a hard-wired circuit. Rather, the dFB neurons intrinsically regulate their response to the activity from upstream circuits. Finally, we show that the dFB appears to contain a memory trace of prior exposure to metabolic challenges induced by starvation or time-restricted feeding. Together, these data highlight that the sleep homeostat is plastic and suggests an underlying mechanism.

                Background: Construction development in Indonesia is growing rapidly, especially in Central Aceh District. Construction projects often experience risks, so that risk events can have a serious impact on the viability of the project. Project delays can result in cost overruns and project losses. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factors causing project delays.The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the risk factors that cause delays in construction projects and (2) determine those particular risk factors that have a greater influence on construction projects. The location of this research was Central Aceh District. Methods: The data in this study were primary data in the form of a questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the literature related to this particular type of research. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents, namely contractor companies located in the Central Aceh District. The questionnaires were distributed to determine respondents' opinions about the level of influence of risk factors causing project delays. We used a validity test, reliability test, and descriptive analysis for data processing. Results: Based on the results of the study from 47 respondents, the “very high influence” category (Mode=5) for the tool malfunction factor, cost estimation inaccuracy, increased work costs, implementation of new technologies, details, accuracy and conformity to specifications that are not appropriate, worker quarrels, poor project planning and management, poor condition at locations and accessibility difficulty. Conclusions: Of the 80 risk factors that caused project delays, eight risk factors were found to have a very high influence on the implementation of construction projects in Central Aceh District. Practical implications: The results of this study provide knowledge to contractor companies about the delay factors that have the most influence on project implementation so that they are expected to be able to manage risks to avoid losses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A study protocol to prepare an RBD protein for vaccine against COVID-19 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global threat to humans and the world’s economy. Effective and safe vaccines against this virus are essential to control and eradicate the pandemic. The currently applied vaccines carry SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein mRNA/cDNA. These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.  Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying three types of  DNA sequences: RBD cDNA, FP (fusion peptide) DNA and sfGFP(superfolder-green-fluorescent-protein), cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open-reading-frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic-interaction-chromatography), detected with a BioVision-Elisa-Kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nm and immune simulation will be carried out using C57BL mice.  Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant) gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure immunoreactive RBD protein.  Conclusion: A positive BioVision-ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.

                Background Multiplexing tissue imaging is developing as a complement for single cell analysis, bringing the spatial information of cells in tissue in addition to multiple parameters measurements. More and more commercial or home-made systems are available. These techniques allow the imaging of tens of fluorescent reporters, where the spectral overlap is solved by imaging by cycles the fluorophores using microfluidics to change the reporters between each cycle. Methods For several systems, the acquisition system coupled to the microfluidic system is a wide field microscope, and the acquisition process is done by mosaicking to cover a large field of view, relying on image processing to obtain the data set to be analysed in intensity. The processed data set allows the identification of different populations, quite similarly to cytometry analysis, but with spatial information in addition. To obtain the final image for analysis from the raw acquisitions, several preprocessing steps are needed for inter-cycle registration, tissue autofluorescence correction or mosaicking. We propose a workflow for this preprocessing, implemented as an open source software (as a library, command line tool and standalone). Results We exemplify the workflow on the commercial system PhenoCycler® (formerly named CODEX®) and provide a reduced size data set for testing. Conclusions We compare our processor with the commercially provided processor and show that we solve some problems also reported by other users.

                Background: Dermatoglyphics can be utilised in clinical settings to identify those who are more likely to have impacted teeth. Additionally, dermatoglyphics looks to have potential as a non-invasive diagnostic method for predicting the presence or absence of an impacted tooth. The goal of this study was to look at the most common dermatoglyphic pattern in people who had or didn't have an impacted mandibular third molar teeth and see if there was a dermatoglyphic signature. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 180 participants was conducted (90 cases and 90 controls). The rolling impression technique was used to apply blue duplicating ink to participants' fingertips, which was then recorded. There was an increase in the frequency of the whorl-plain pattern in the right-hand ring finger (60%; p=0.028) and left-hand little finger (33.3%; p=0.009), as well as the loop-ulnar pattern in the right-hand middle finger (74.4%; p=0.024) in individuals with a predisposition to the presence of impacted teeth. Results: The left-hand little finger was found to be the most predictive for impaction in a forward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Dermatoglyphics could be used as a non-invasive sign to predict whether or not a tooth is affected. Its value comes in early detection, which helps to avoid the surgical problems that come with symptomatic extraction of an impacted tooth.

                Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare condition marked by uncontrolled histiocyte proliferation and activation, and phagocytosis of normal hematopoietic cells. This disease is rare, and a concurrent presentation with acute polymyositis is rare. A 14-year-old male was admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital with a high-grade fever for 25 days, generalized severe body aches, and multiple large joint pain in the lower limb for the same duration. On examination, the patient was found to have splenomegaly, tenderness in both knee joints, symmetrical proximal weakness of both lower limbs, several sensory losses, and loss of bowel and bladder control. The laboratory data showed that he had anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypoalbuminemia, raised D-dimer, and serum creatine phosphokinase (S. CPK). Along with these, a bone marrow biopsy revealed hemophagocytic cells, and he was diagnosed with HLH with acute polymyositis (PM). The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone and dexamethasone. Clinical stability was achieved with gradual improvement of initial symptoms and biochemical markers. The patient was discharged with oral steroids at a tapering dose and was advised to regularly follow-up.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of genetic factors in microtia: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microtia is a congenital malformation of the outer ears caused by improper embryonic development. The origin of microtia and causes of its variations remain unknown. Because of the lack of clarity regarding the role of genetic variables in microtia, we conducted a systematic review to qualitatively identify the genes most important in the development of microtia to provide an up-to-date review. Methods: Using six search engines, we searched all published studies related to the genetic factors of isolated microtia and syndromic microtia. The identified publications were screened and selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by the authors and assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. We found 40 studies, including 22 studies on syndromic microtia and 18 studies on isolated microtia. Data extraction of each study was arranged in tabulation for syndromic and isolated microtia. The extracted data were: first author’s surname, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample characteristic and gene assessed. Results: After the data were extracted, analyzed, and reviewed, the most common gene suspected to be involved in isolated microtia was Homeobox A2 (HOXA2, 12.1%). Conversely, in syndromic microtia, the two most common genes supposed to play a role were Fibroblast Growth Factor 3 (FGF3, 47.2%) and Treacher–Collins–Franceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1, 30.2%). From the studies, the three most prevalent genes associated with microtia were HOXA2 (10%), FGF3 (8.4%), and TCOF1 (5.4%). In syndromic microtia, the most common mutation types were deletion in TCOF1 (46.9%) and missense and deletion in FGF3 (both 38%), and in isolated microtia, the most common mutation type was silent in HOXA2 (54.2%). Conclusions: In summary, genetic factors are involved in microtia; thus, molecular analysis is strongly advised. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021287294 (25/10/21).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of bypassing Microsoft Windows Security using the MITRE CALDERA Framework [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microsoft Windows Security is a recently implemented safeguard for the Windows operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows10 and 11. However, there is a major shortcoming in this system to stop Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These are government-financed groups that are funded to attack other government entities. Following the initial security breach, the hacked Windows device is used to access the rest of the network devices in order to transfer data to external storage (Exfiltration). Methods: In this work, we have tested the Microsoft Windows Security system using MITRE CALDERA and ATT&CK frameworks and explain how APT groups are able to bypass Windows Security. Results: In this study we used "54ndc47" agent through GoLang feature in MITRE CALDERA platform to test and bypass Microsoft Windows Security systems (MS Windows 10). Through it, we were able to bypass the Windows Security system and display entire files in the victim's device. Conclusions: In this paper, we have provided recommendations to Microsoft to improve their Windows Security tool through the use of Artificial intelligence (AI).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Experimental study and machine learning model to predict formability of magnesium alloy sheet [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnesium alloy is not only light in weight but also possesses moderate strength. Magnesium AZ31-H24 alloy sheet has many applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Experimental stretch forming tests are performed on this sheet to measure the material’s formability by constructing forming limit diagrams. Methods: Several tests of Nakazima were carried out on rectangular samples at 24, 250, 350°C and 0.01, 0.001 mm/s using a hemispherical punch. The work done to predict the formability of magnesium alloys has not been recorded in recent literature on machine learning models. Hence, the researchers of this article choose to explore the same and build three models to predict the formability of magnesium alloy through Random Forest algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multiple linear Regression. Results: The Random Forest showed high accuracy of 96% in prediction. Conclusions: It is concluded that the need for physical experiments can be greatly minimized in formability studies by using machine learning concepts.

                The past three decades have seen a major shift in our understanding of the strong links between autism and identity. These developments have called for careful consideration of the language used to describe autism. Here, we briefly discuss some of these deliberations and provide guidance to researchers around language use in autism research.

                The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape neutralization can jeopardize the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Chen et al. report the isolation of potent human antibodies that neutralize emerging variants of concern, including various Omicron sublineages. These antibodies show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the hamster model.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 29 September 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03065-0">doi:10.1038/d41586-022-03065-0</a></p>An analysis of faculty members employed at academic institutions in the United States reveals that most employees were trained at just a few universities. The finding provides insights into how hiring perpetuates inequalities.

This facilitation determines which branches of sensory axons conduct action potentials to motor neurons, enabling computation at the level of the node to regulate sensory feedback.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 29 September 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33233-9">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-33233-9</a></p>In this study the authors investigate household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway. They find that the secondary attack rate was higher for Omicron than Delta, but that among three-dose vaccinated contacts the secondary attack rate was lower for both variants compared to contacts with two doses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current">Genomic analyses of rice bean landraces reveal adaptation and yield related loci to accelerate breeding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 29 September 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33515-2">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-33515-2</a></p>Rice bean is an underexploited legume crop that has many desirable properties against bio and abiotic stresses. Here, the authors report the genome assembly of this species, conduct population genetics studies and reveal the genetic variations associated with adaptation and yield traits.
