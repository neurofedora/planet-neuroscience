">Transplantation of GABAergic Interneuron Progenitors Restores Cortical Circuit Function in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                In addition to dementia, Alzheimer's patients suffer from sleep impairments and aberrations in sleep-dependent brain rhythms. Deficits in inhibitory GABAergic interneuron function disrupt one of those rhythms, slow oscillation in particular, and actively contribute to Alzheimer's progression. We tested the degree to which transplantation of healthy donor interneuron progenitors would restore slow oscillation in young APP mice. We harvested medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) progenitors from mouse embryos and transplanted them into host APP mutant cortices. 3D light-sheet and structured illumination microscopy revealed that transplanted MGE progenitors survived and matured into healthy interneurons. In vivo multiphoton calcium imaging and voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed functional integration and slow oscillation rescue in absence or presence of optogenetic stimulation. Our work provides proof-of-concept evidence that stem cell therapy may serve as a viable strategy to rescue functional impairments in cortical circuits of APP mice and potentially those of Alzheimer's patients.

">The mGluR5 Agonist, CHPG, Enhances Numbers of Differentiated Human Oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies on adult mice indicate that the mGluR5 agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenyl glycine (CHPG), reduces cuprizone-elicited losses in myelin. This effect is partly mediated by CHPG binding to mGluR5 receptors on reactive astrocytes, triggering the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in an increase in myelin, and alleviates behavioral deficits. However, it remains unclear whether CHPG has similar beneficial effects on human cells. To address this issue, we examined effects of CHPG on human cells using both human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes and primary human fetal brain cells. Treatment of hiPSCs (30M, 5 days) or primary cells (30M, 3 days) with CHPG increases the percent of MBP+O4+ mature oligodendrocytes relative to total O4+cells, without affecting survival. When effects of CHPG were evaluated on proliferating OPCs, effects on proliferation are observed. In contrast, when CHPG was evaluated in young oligodendrocytes, effects on proliferation were gone, suggesting that in this population CHPG is influencing differentiation. Interestingly, in contrast to observations in mice, mGluR5 expression in humans is localized on PDGFR+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and O4+ immature oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes. Moreover, using purified human OPC cultures, we show a direct effect of CHPG in enhanced differentiation. To identify potential cellular targets of CHPG in the adult human brain, we analyzed postmortem tissue from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls. In contrast to the hiPSCs or fetal cells, demyelinated white matter from MS patients showed elevated mGluR5 mRNA expression in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that CHPG enhances the differentiation of human OPCs during development through a mechanism distinct from that observed in adult cuprizone-treated mice. Moreover, astrocytes in MS pathology upregulate mGluR5, suggesting they may become responsive to CHPG under disease conditions.

<p>In this study, we found that astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout in male mice led to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence, disrupting neurotransmitter receptor expression and synaptic proteins, impairing neuroregeneration.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in astrocytes and has a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) health. However, how HSP60 regulates the mitochondrial function of astrocytes to inhibit neuroregeneration remains unknown. In this study, we generated astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout male mice to investigate the consequences of HSP60 deficiency. Firstly, our results confirmed that HSP60 deficiency caused abnormal expression of mitochondrial function-related genes, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggered cellular senescence in astrocytes. Moreover, the alterations of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression suggested a disruption in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the increased levels of site-1 protease (S1P), truncated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (truncated-BDNF), and synaptophysin indicate synaptic structural and functional impairments. Expectedly, our findings demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in astrocytes, leading to altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the cortex, as well as reduced neuronal numbers and neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus after the deletion of HSP60 in astrocytes of the male mice. Notably, Urolithin A (UA) and the S1P inhibitor, PF429242, were found to alleviate astrocyte senescence and promote neuronal regeneration by inhibiting truncated BDNF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that HSP60 deficiency in astrocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence via the S1P/truncated-BDNF pathway, resulting in disrupted neurotransmitter receptor expression, synaptic protein alterations, and impaired neuroregeneration. These insights underscored the importance of HSP60 in CNS health and provided promising avenues for developing treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Immune pathways and cell types that protect against neurodegenerative processes with aging remain poorly understood. Sulka et al. demonstrate that the innate immune adaptor, STING, provides essential protection against blood-brain barrier breaches and neuromotor deficits during physiological aging. Furthermore, microglial STING is sufficient to protect against these aspects of age-associated decline.

">Influenza A virus infection during pregnancy increases transfer of maternal bloodborne molecules to fetal tissues</a></h4>

              
                Influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy is linked to heightened risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in the offspring. The precise pathophysiological mechanism(s) underling this association remains an active topic of research. We propose that maternal immune activation (MIA) triggered by IAV infection can disrupt selective permeability at the maternal-fetal interface, leading to increased transfer of blood-derived molecules into the fetal compartment. Some of these molecules might be responsible for the initiation of inflammatory cascades implicated in NDD etiology. Using a murine model of seasonal IAV infection during pregnancy, we examined placental and fetal brain barrier properties following maternal IAV challenge. Our findings demonstrate an enhanced transplacental transfer of fluorescently labeled tracers from maternal circulation to key neurodevelopmental regions, including the subventricular zone (SVZ) and choroid plexus (ChP) of fetal brains. This effect was most pronounced in fetuses from dams exposed to the highest dose of IAV. Notably, a similar pattern was observed for accumulation of the bloodborne neuroinflammatory molecule fibrinogen in these same brain regions, which was further amplified in response to the highest IAV dose. Moreover, fibrinogen accumulation was positively correlated with Iba1+ cell immunofluorescence, suggesting a potential interaction between fibrinogen and Iba1+ cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that IAV-induced MIA enhances transplacental transfer of blood-derived molecules into fetal tissues, potentially activating proinflammatory pathways in Iba1+ cells.

">Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Impairs Striatal Cholinergic Function and Cognitive Flexibility in Adult Offspring</a></h4>

              
                Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. Using ChAT-Cre;Ai14-tdTomato mice combined with ChAT staining, we found substantial reductions in CIN number within the striatum of adult PAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PAE-exposed offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PAE-exposed mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.

">Tactile and Visual Spatial Frequency Perception Follows Optimal Integration but Is Not Affected by Spatial Proximity</a></h4>

              
                Spatial frequency is a fundamental feature in both visual and somatosensory perception, yet how these modalities integrate spatial frequency information remains unclear. This study investigates whether visuotactile spatial frequency perception follows the principles of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and whether spatial proximity influences multisensory integration, using virtual reality (VR) and high-precision 3D-printed tactile stimuli. Experiment 1 found that the visuotactile integration of spatial frequency cues follows the MLE rule. However, Experiment 2 revealed that this integration is not affected by spatial proximity. These findings provide additional insights into the feature dependency of multisensory integration between vision and touch and highlight the potential for independent processing before integration, offering new perspectives on the mechanisms of spatial frequency processing in both visual and tactile modalities.

">Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter protects hippocampal CA2 neurons from excitotoxic injury</a></h4>

              
                Background. The hippocampal region CA2, unlike neighboring CA1, is exceptionally resistant to excitotoxicity, although the mechanisms behind this phenotype are unknown. Given the importance of mitochondrial calcium buffering, we investigated whether the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU), recently found to be enriched in CA2, contributes to this resistance. Methods. We employed immunostaining techniques in rodent brain tissue and organotypic slice cultures to visualize MCU distribution across hippocampal regions under both resting and excitotoxic conditions. Subsequently, we pharmacologically modulated MCU in an organotypic model of hippocampal excitotoxicity to assess its contribution to regional resistance to NMDA. Results. We found a strong spatial correlation between resistance to excitotoxic injury and MCU expression. Notably, NMDA exposure resulted in MCU upregulation in CA2, and pharmacological inhibition of MCU sensitized CA2 neurons to excitotoxic damage in a dose-dependent manner, while having minimal effect on the already vulnerable CA1 neurons, which express low MCU levels. Conclusions. MCU is known to exacerbate NMDA-induced cell injury, although our data indicate that CA2 neurons possess unique mitochondrial calcium handling capabilities enabling MCU to support neuroprotection. Our study provides novel insight into mechanisms supporting CA2 resistance to excitotoxic death and emphasizes context-dependent roles of MCU in neuronal injury or survival.

">Neural hierarchy for coding articulatory dynamics in speech imagery and production</a></h4>

              
                Mental imagery is a hallmark of human cognition, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these internal states remain poorly understood. Speech imagery, the internal simulation of speech without overt articulation, has been proposed to partially share neural substrates with actual speech articulation. However, the precise feature encoding and spatiotemporal dynamics of this neural architecture remain controversial, constraining the understanding of mental states and the development of reliable speech imagery decoders. Here, we leveraged high-resolution electrocorticography recordings to investigate the shared and modality-specific cortical coding of articulatory kinematic trajectories (AKTs) during speech imagery and articulation. Applying a linear model, we identified robust neural dynamics in frontoparietal cortex that encoded AKTs across both modalities. Shared neural populations across the middle premotor cortex, subcentral gyrus, and postcentral-supramarginal junction exhibited consistent spatiotemporal stability during the integrative articulatory planning. In contrast, modality-specific populations for speech imagery and articulation were somatotopically interleaved along the primary sensorimotor cortex, revealing a hierarchical spatiotemporal organization distinct from shared encoding regions. We further developed a generalized neural network to decode multi-population neural dynamics. The model achieved high syllable prediction accuracy for speech imagery (79% median accuracy), closely matching the performance of speech articulation (81%). This model robustly extrapolated AKT decoding to untrained syllables within each modality while demonstrating cross-modal generalization across shared populations. These findings uncover a somato-cognitive hierarchy linking high-level supramodal planning with modality-specific neural manifestation, revolutionizing an imagery-based brain-computer interface that directly decodes thoughts for synthetic telepathy.

">Adaptive transcranial ultrasound Doppler imaging of the brain</a></h4>

              
                The development of fully noninvasive, transcranial functional ultrasound (fUS) would increase the translatability and clinical potential of this neuroimaging modality. Unfortunately, transcranial fUS is hindered by skull-induced aberrations which degrade power Doppler image quality and lower sensitivity. As a result, a majority of fUS imaging studies rely on craniotomies or acoustically transparent cranial windows. To advance fUS technology further, we present an adaptive aberration correction method based on ray-tracing through 4 tissue layers (transducer lens, gel & skin, bone and brain tissue). Our method segments these layers, and estimates ultrasound wave speeds in each layer iteratively. Once a velocity model of the imaging plane of interest is retrieved, ultrafast power Doppler imaging of the brain is performed using a ray-tracing beamformer that accounts for wave refraction. We tested our method in three adult rats, and estimated wave speeds for the skin/gel layer (1628 {+/-} 7 m/s), skull bone (3247 {+/-} 110 m/s), and brain tissue (1526 {+/-} 55 m/s). After aberration correction, we measured an average adult rat skull thickness of 388 {+/-} 41 m in agreement with anatomical records. The largest improvements in Doppler imaging quality were observed in cortical brain layers adjacent to the skull, specifically lateral spatial resolution was improved by 32%. Our method consistently outperformed Doppler imaging based on traditional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, which assumes a uniform sound speed.

">Beyond deep versus superficial: true laminar inference with MEG</a></h4>

              
                Neural dynamics at the laminar level are critical components of cortical computations, but in humans, non-invasive methods to study these dynamics have been limited to coarse distinctions between deep and superficial layers. Here, we demonstrate that high-precision magnetoencephalography (hpMEG) can achieve laminar inference by localizing sources across all six cortical laminae. Using a multilayer source reconstruction approach, we systematically assess the limits of hpMEGs depth resolution, and show that laminar precision is achievable under optimal signal-to-noise ratios and co-registration accuracy. Our simulations reveal that accurate source reconstruction depends critically on aligning dipole orientations with the underlying cortical columnar structure, and that regional variations in cortical anatomy influence reconstruction fidelity. These findings position hpMEG as a powerful tool for investigating laminar-specific neural dynamics in cognition and behavior, and offer new opportunities to bridge invasive electrophysiology and human neuroimaging.

">Cancer-associated metabolic alterations facilitated by astrocyte glycogenolysis mediate neuropathic pain chronicity</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic signal in astrocytes has been implicated in a range of neurophysiological disorders. Likewise, pain chronification, defined by the transition from an acute to a persistent pain state in response to repeated or intense nociceptive stimuli, involves crucial contributions from astrocytes. Although lactate transport by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) astrocytes has been shown to influence pain chronification, the specific metabolic pathways and upstream signaling events remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify glycogenolysis in ACC astrocytes as a central signaling mechanism controlling pain chronification. Inhibition of glycogenolysis suppressed pain-related behaviors and normalized neuronal hyperactivity. To further extend the glycogenolysis effects to the broader metabolic dynamics, we conducted integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses as chronic pain progressed. Interestingly, these analyses revealed that chronic pain was accompanied by a shift toward cancer-associated metabolic programs in the ACC, which was driven by astrocytic glycogenolysis. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that pain chronification was mediated by astrocytic glycogenolysis, which induced cancer-associated metabolic pathway. This suggests that alterations in astrocytic glycogen metabolism could be key signals to cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming and these findings offer novel insights into astrocyte-driven oncogenic metabolic regulation in the neuropathic pathology.

                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management are not given much emphasis. Methods This conceptual paper employs a systematic literature review to understand the factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examined coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they lack methodological rigor. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to reduce the overall damage caused by floods.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics short-read RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Emerging long-read RNA sequencing technologies are discussed as a complement to short-read methods, promising reduced deconvolution needs and further innovation.

                Background Human males and females show differences in the incidence of neutrophil-associated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, and differences in neutrophil physiological responses such as responses to infection, tissue damage, and chemotactic factors. However, little is known about the basis of sex-based differences in human neutrophils. Methods Starting with human neutrophils from healthy donors, we used RNA-seq to examine total RNA profiles, RNAs not associated with ribosomes and thus not being translated, RNAs in monosomes, and RNAs in polysomes and thus heavily translated. Results There were sex-based differences in the levels of RNAs across free RNA, monosome, and polysome fractions. Male neutrophils had increased levels of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins in the free RNA fractions, indicating low levels of translation. The polysomes of male neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell activation. The polysomes of female neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs associated the regulation of metabolic processes, cytokine responses, and mitochondrial proteins. Conclusions These data indicate that male and female neutrophils have different expression patterns and different translation efficiency of some mRNAs. This may contribute to the observed sex-based differences in neutrophil behavior and neutrophil-associated disease incidence and severity.

                <p>Lactate plays an important role in brain energy metabolism. It contributes to normal brain development and to neuroprotection in diabetic hypoglycemia, but its role in neonatal hypoglycemia is unclear. Moreover, lactate can work as a signaling substance via the lactate receptor HCAR1 (Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1). Recent studies indicate that HCAR1 is protective in mouse models of neonatal hypoxic ischemia and has a role in metabolic regulation in glial cells during hypoglycemia. Here we have studied potential impacts of HCAR1 on axonal and myelin development in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of young (P21) wild-type (WT) mice and HCAR1 KO mice and in cortical organotypic brain slice cultures. The HCAR1 KO mice showed lower axonal area relative to WT in both cortex and corpus callosum. However, the myelin area was unaffected by HCAR1 KO. Using particle and colocalization analysis, we show that HCAR1 KO predominantly reduces axonal size in unmyelinated axons. Using an organotypic brain slice model of neonatal hypoglycemia, we find that lactate protects both axonal and myelin development in hypoglycemia, partially via HCAR1. Lastly, live imaging with a pH-sensitive dye on acute cortical brain slices indicates that cellular lactate uptake is influenced by HCAR1. In conclusion, our findings support a role of HCAR1 in axonal development and in lactate&rsquo;s protective effects in hypoglycemia.</p>

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a common congenital heart defect characterized by aortic narrowing. Prenatally, it has mild hemodynamic effects as right ventricular disproportion and ductus arteriosus (DA) dilation occur as adaptive mechanisms, but their impact on CoA hemodynamics remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we built a closed 0D computational model of fetal circulation and simulated different CoA cardiovascular remodeling patterns, including aortic isthmus (AoI) narrowing, ventricular disproportion, and DA dilation. Our results showed mild AoI narrowing (80% of reference diameter) required up to 1.7 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 115% DA dilation to maintain physiological pressures, wall shear stresses, and organ perfusion. In contrast, severe narrowing (20% of reference AoI diameter) required up to 5 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 125% DA dilation, highlighting the necessity of co-occurrence of prenatal ventricular disproportion and DA dilation to compensate for AoI narrowing. These physiological regions were validated with ultrasonographic measurements from 7 controls and 9 CoA patients. We compared blood pressures, velocities, and volumetric flow rates across different fetoplacental anatomical sites. AoI velocity showed a delayed retrograde flow peak and increased antegrade diastolic velocity with greater AoI narrowing, which may aid in diagnosing CoA. Minimal differences were observed in other velocities and pressures. Volumetric flow rates across varying degrees of AoI narrowing decreased in the AoI and mitral and aortic valves, remained stable in the middle cerebral and umbilical arteries, and increased in the DA and tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Therefore, we corroborated that in fetal CoA a redistribution of blood flow occurs to ensure perfusion of the brain and placenta, without a significant alteration in fetal hemodynamics (blood pressure and velocities) except for increased diastolic velocities in the AoI.

Repertoire sequencing allows us to investigate the antibody-mediated immune response. The clustering of sequences is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, aiding in the identification of functionally related antibodies. The conventional clustering approach of clonotyping relies on sequence information, particularly CDRH3 sequence identity and V/J gene usage, to group sequences into clonotypes. It has been suggested that the limitations of sequence-based approaches to identify sequence-dissimilar but functionally converged antibodies can be overcome by using structure information to group antibodies. Recent advances have made structure-based methods feasible on a repertoire level. However, so far, their performance has only been evaluated on single-antigen sets of antibodies. A comprehensive comparison of the benefits and limitations of structure-based tools on realistic and diverse repertoire data is missing. Here, we aim to explore the promise of structure-based clustering algorithms to replace or augment the standard sequence-based approach, specifically by identifying low-sequence identity groups. Two methods, SAAB+ and SPACE2, are evaluated against clonotyping. We curated a dataset of well-annotated pairs of antibodies that show high overlap in epitope residues and thus bind the same region within their respective antigen. This set of antibodies was introduced into a simulated repertoire to compare the performance of clustering approaches on a diverse antibody set. Our analysis reveals that structure-based methods do group more antibodies together compared to clonotyping. However, it also highlights the limitations associated with the need for same-length CDR regions by SPACE2. This work thoroughly compares the utility of different clustering methods and provides insights into what further steps are required to effectively use antibody structural information to group immune repertoire data.

Bacteria encode a wide range of antiphage systems and a subset of these proteins are homologous to components of the human innate immune system. Mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs) and bacterial NLR-related proteins use a central NACHT domain to link detection of infection with initiation of an antimicrobial response. Bacterial NACHT proteins provide defense against both DNA and RNA phages. Here we investigate the mechanism of phage detection by the bacterial NLR-related protein bNACHT25 in <i>E. coli</i>. bNACHT25 was specifically activated by <i>Emesvirus</i> ssRNA phages and analysis of MS2 phage escaper mutants that evaded detection revealed a critical role for Coat Protein (CP). A genetic assay showed CP was sufficient to activate bNACHT25 but the two proteins did not directly interact. Instead, we found bNACHT25 requires the host chaperone DnaJ to detect CP and protect against phage. Our data support a model in which bNACHT25 detects a wide range of phages using an indirect mechanism that may involve guarding a host cell process rather than binding a specific phage-derived molecule.

Malaria parasites survive in human erythrocytes by importing and digesting hemoglobin within a specialized organelle, the digestive vacuole (DV). Although chloroquine and other antimalarials act within the DV, the routes used by drugs, ions, and amino acids to cross the DV membrane remain poorly understood. Here, we used single DV patch-clamp to identify a novel large conductance anion channel as the primary conductive pathway on this organelle in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the most virulent human pathogen. This Big Vacuolar Anion Channel (BVAC) is primarily open at the DV resting membrane potential and undergoes complex voltage-dependent gating. Ion substitution experiments implicate promiscuous anion flux with Cl<sup>−</sup> being the primary charged substrate under physiological conditions. Conductance and gating are unaffected by antimalarials targeting essential DV activities and are conserved on parasites with divergent drug susceptibility profiles, implicating an unexploited antimalarial target. A conditional knockdown strategy excluded links to PfCRT and PfMDR1, two drug-resistance transporters with poorly defined transport activities. We propose that BVAC functions to maintain electroneutrality during H<sup>+</sup> uptake, allowing DV acidification and efficient hemoglobin digestion. The channel also facilitates amino acid salvage, providing essential building blocks for parasite growth. Direct transport measurements at the DV membrane provide foundational insights into vacuolar physiology, should help clarify antimalarial action and drug resistance, and will guide therapy development against the parasite’s metabolic powerhouse.

                Background The management of organic waste generated in municipal marketplaces has gained increasing prominence over the last two decades due to its critical impact on urban sustainability, public health, and the environment. This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research trends in this area, based on 260 publications indexed in Scopus between 2000 and 2023. Methods This study employed a comprehensive bibliometric method using both quantitative and network analysis approaches. Publications were retrieved from Scopus database using a structured search equation incorporating keywords related to organic waste, municipal marketplaces, and waste management strategies. The final dataset included 260 publications spanning from 2000 to 2023, including original research articles, systematic reviews, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Data were processed using Bibliometrix R-package for productivity metrics (annual scientific output, author productivity, journal impact) and VOSviewer for visualization of bibliographic networks. Co-authorship patterns were analyzed at both author and country levels to find collaboration structures. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was conducted to map thematic clusters and research trends. Additionally, a strategic diagram was constructed to categorize research themes based on relevance to the field and degree of development. Results The findings show a notable surge in publications since 2016, driven by circular economic policies, climate change mitigation efforts, and the demand for sustainable urban solutions. Key authors include Zurbrügg, Tilley, Mpanang’ombe, and Zhang, with significant contributions to composting technologies, waste valorization, and bioenergy solutions. Leading journals such as Journal of Cleaner Production (Q1, IF 2023: 9.7), Sustainability (Switzerland) (Q2, IF 2023: 3.3), and Biocycle (Q4, IF 2023: 0.02) have been pivotal in disseminating interdisciplinary research. Conclusions This analysis reveals a global collaborative effort to optimize organic waste management but identifies persistent challenges, including limited integration in developing regions and fragmented co-authorship networks. The study highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches and fair knowledge transfer to develop scalable, context-specific solutions that enhance urban sustainability.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-539/v1?src=rss">Study of the coverage and the impact of the chemoprevention of seasonal malaria in Niger from 2013 to 2022: systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose Malaria remains a public health problem in Niger, especially among children under the age of five. To combat this scourge, since 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), a strategy based on the administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ) during the period of high transmission. This systematic review assesses the coverage, efficacy, and challenges of SMC in Niger between 2013 and 2022, analyzing its impact on malaria morbidity and mortality. Materials and methods The PRISMA guidelines were used to ensure a rigorous and comprehensive recording of the systematic review process. Through searches in five different databases, articles were imported into Zotero software, then transferred to the Covidence application, where data processing was carried out. The selected articles were independently evaluated by two reviewers. These included studies that assessed coverage, malaria incidence, and the impact of SMC. Studies published in French and English were included. Data extraction from the included studies was performed, and a quality assessment was conducted, including an evaluation of the risk of bias. Results Among the six studies, three assessed SMC coverage in all eight regions of Niger while also evaluating side effects. They showed high overall coverage but low coverage in some areas. Another study examined the impact in terms of the incidence of complicated malaria, malaria-related hospitalization, and mortality. Another publication revealed that antibody responses against the blood and pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum were higher in the area where SMC was implemented. Conclusions This study demonstrates that SMC has a significant impact on reducing malaria incidence. Although there is high overall coverage, variations exist, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. Few adverse events were reported. However, very few studies are available, highlighting the need for additional research in Niger to better understand this strategy.

                Background The significance of household transmission of hepatitis B virus infection has been identified in different studies. Higher disease related knowledge among Hepatitis B patients improves the practice of transmission prevention and screening of household contacts. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of household transmission prevention among people with chronic hepatitis B attending a liver clinic at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Ethiopia. Methods A single center cross-sectional study among 229 hepatitis B patients visiting liver clinic for follow up service was undertaken in 2021. Data were collected using a structured interviewer guided questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods in SPSS 26. Results Mean age of respondents was 40 years, 68% were male, 65% of respondents scored ≥75 (defined as a high knowledge). In adjusted linear regression, age <40 years, presence of additional infected household members and disease duration >3 years were associated with higher knowledge score (R2= 0.106, F=8.936, P<0.001). Only 38.6% of participants scoring ≥6 (defined as good prevention practice). In Adjusted logistic regression, factors associated with poor practice were; low level of education (OR: 5.218; 95%CI: 1.34-20.23; p=0.017), being on anti HBV treatment (OR: 3.582; 95%CI: 1.04-12.33; p=0.043) and duration of follow up at TASH <2 years (OR: 2.93; 95%CI: 1.14-7.55; p=0.025). Conclusion In contrast to overall good knowledge, largely poor implementation of prevention practices and misunderstandings about transmission through air, kissing, and eating utensils were seen in a significant proportion of participants. Based on the results, any educational programs planned for this population should give special attention to the implementation of recommended prevention practices than simple awareness creation, with priority given to those with low education, <2 years on follow-up, and those on anti-hepatitis B treatment.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In sleep apnea, repeated hypovolemic ventilation or apnea in sleep leads to intermittent hypoxia (IH) of the brain. Thus, the impacts of sleep apnea on the brain need to be investigated. In this study, a mouse model with sleep-associated chronic IH and behavior tests was used to evaluate how IH impacts brain function and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and locus coeruleus. In an open-field test, mice subjected to chronic IH (5%–21% oxygen) for 10 and 20 days exhibited a significant decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity compared to the room air (RA, 21% oxygen) control mice. In the Y-maze test, the ability to recognize novel and familiar arms was similar between groups. In immunostaining of the brains of IH mice, TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus were significantly reduced compared to RA mice. Furthermore, in the brains of mice with decreased TH-positive neurons induced by IH, the expression of hippocampal neurons has not been affected. In the analysis of glial cells, in IH group mice, a significant increase of microglia was found in the substantia nigra, VTA, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus compared to the RA mice. These findings suggest that there is a loss of TH-containing neurons and neuronal inflammation in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus under chronic IH. Our findings provide precise evidence for the loss of TH-containing neurons in the setting of chronic IH mouse models, which can provide relevant empirical observations for clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a machine learning model of voxel level [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data could predict progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology, as well as outperform currently available biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred and thirty-seven autopsied patients with PSP (n = 42) and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 95) who underwent antemortem [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose PET and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed. A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate. The secondary models found the combination of thalamus and dentate to have the highest accuracy (0.89) and F-score (0.81). The optimized secondary model showed the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-scores (0.86) in the test dataset and outperformed the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (0.81 and 0.70, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results suggest that glucose hypometabolism in the thalamus and cerebellar dentate have the highest potential for predicting PSP pathology. Our optimized machine learning model outperformed the best currently available biomarker to predict PSP pathology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neurobiology of human stress-related disorders remains poorly understood, necessitating novel models and new model organisms to advance translational research in this field. Complementing rodent studies, the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is a useful model species for stress-related disorders. Here, we develop two novel experimental models of stress-related brain disorders, based on repeated prolonged exposure to predators or on chronic unpredictable stress in adult zebrafish. The ability of both models to recapitulate human stress in these fish was assessed behaviorally, in the novel tank and the plus maze (anxiety, locomotor, and cognitive tests), as well as by analyzing the baseline levels of cortisol, a common neuroendocrine biomarker of stress. Overall, anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test was seen in both stressed groups, whereas poor learning and higher anxiety were observed in the plus maze test in predator-exposed fish, paralleling clinical cognitive and affective symptoms. Elevated cortisol in both stressed zebrafish further resembled neuroendocrine deficits seen in stress-related disorders clinically. Finally, the evoked behavioral and endocrine stress symptoms were rescued by treatment with two popular, clinically active antidepressant drugs, fluoxetine and paroxetine. Collectively, these models successfully recapitulated in zebrafish several key aspects of clinical stress-related disorders, further supporting the utility of these fish for translational stress research and anti-stress drug development.</p>

                Hirani et al. show how androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-induced crosstalk between oncogenic cell signaling pathways, driven by BCL2, contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This finding underscores the potential of BCL2-targeted combination therapeutics to block or delay the transition from castration-sensitive prostate cancer to CRPC induced by ADT.

                Loss-of-function MDA5 variants increase the risk of chronic inflammation but protect against autoimmune disease. Singh et al. show that autoimmune-protective variants impair MDA5 signaling via different mechanisms, including loss of RNA binding and increased ATPase activity. By tuning MDA5 signaling, variants offer a trade-off between antiviral activity and autoimmune disease protection.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 30 May 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01983-6">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-01983-6</a></p>In mouse models of epilepsy and human brain samples, hyperactive inhibitory signaling from neurons and complement signaling from astrocytes coordinate to drive microglia-mediated selective elimination of inhibitory synapses. This positive feedback mechanism disrupts the excitatory–inhibitory neurotransmission balance, which exacerbates neuronal hyperexcitability and contributes to the pathophysiology of epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93621">Inhibition of mitochondrial protein import and proteostasis by a pro-apoptotic lipid</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria-mediated cell death is critically regulated by bioactive lipids derived from sphingolipid metabolism. The lipid aldehyde trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex) induces mitochondrial dysfunction from yeast to humans. Here, we apply unbiased transcriptomic, functional genomics, and chemoproteomic approaches in the yeast model to uncover the principal mechanisms and biological targets underlying this lipid-induced mitochondrial inhibition. We find that loss of Hfd1 fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase function efficiently sensitizes cells for t-2-hex inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Excess of t-2-hex causes a profound transcriptomic response with characteristic hallmarks of impaired mitochondrial protein import, like activation of mitochondrial and cytosolic chaperones or proteasomal function and severe repression of translation. We confirm that t-2-hex stress induces rapid accumulation of mitochondrial pre-proteins and protein aggregates and subsequent activation of Hsf1- and Rpn4-dependent gene expression. By saturated transposon mutagenesis, we find that t-2-hex tolerance requires an efficient heat shock response and specific mitochondrial and ER functions and that mutations in ribosome, protein, and amino acid biogenesis are beneficial upon t-2-hex stress. We further show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of protein translation causes t-2-hex resistance, indicating that loss of proteostasis is the predominant consequence of the pro-apoptotic lipid. Several TOM subunits, including the central Tom40 channel, are lipidated by t-2-hex in vitro and mutation of accessory subunits Tom20 or Tom70 confers t-2-hex tolerance. Moreover, the Hfd1 gene dose determines the strength of t-2-hex mediated inhibition of mitochondrial protein import, and Hfd1 co-purifies with Tom70. Our results indicate that the transport of mitochondrial precursor proteins through the outer mitochondrial membrane is sensitively inhibited by the pro-apoptotic lipid and thus represents a hotspot for pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101236">ACVR2A facilitates trophoblast cell invasion through TCF7/c-JUN pathway in pre-eclampsia progression</a></h4>

              
                Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious pregnancy disorder linked to genetic factors, particularly the ACVR2A gene, which encodes a receptor involved in the activin signaling pathway and plays a critical role in reproductive processes. Transcriptomic data analysis and experimental verification confirmed a downregulation of ACVR2A expression in placental tissues from PE patients. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was employed to investigate the effect of ACVR2A gene deletion on trophoblast cells using the HTR8/SVneo and JAR cell lines. Deletion of ACVR2A inhibits trophoblastic migration, proliferation, and invasion, underscoring its pivotal role in cellular function. RNA-seq data analysis unveiled an intricate regulatory network influenced by ACVR2A gene knockout, especially in the TCF7/c-JUN pathway. By employing RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, a potential association between ACVR2A and the TCF7/c-JUN pathway was hypothesized and confirmed. The complexity of PE onset and the significance of genetic factors were emphasized, particularly the role of the ACVR2A gene identified in genome-wide association study. This study established a robust foundation for delving deeper into the intricate mechanisms of PE, paving the way for focused early intervention, personalized treatment, and enhanced obstetric healthcare.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90638">A suite of selective pressures supports the maintenance of alleles of a Drosophila immune peptide</a></h4>

              
                The innate immune system provides hosts with a crucial first line of defense against pathogens. While immune genes are often among the fastest evolving genes in the genome, in <i>Drosophila</i>, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are notable exceptions. Instead, AMPs may be under balancing selection, such that over evolutionary timescales, multiple alleles are maintained in populations. In this study, we focus on the <i>Drosophila</i> AMP Diptericin A, which has a segregating amino acid polymorphism associated with differential survival after infection with the Gram-negative bacteria <i>Providencia rettgeri</i>. Diptericin A also helps control opportunistic gut infections by common <i>Drosophila</i> gut microbes, especially those of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>. In addition to genotypic effects on gut immunity, we also see strong sex-specific effects that are most prominent in flies without functional <i>diptericin A</i>. To further characterize differences in microbiomes between different <i>diptericin</i> genotypes, we used 16S metagenomics to look at the microbiome composition. We used both lab-reared and wild-caught flies for our sequencing and looked at overall composition as well as the differential abundance of individual bacterial families. Overall, we find flies that are homozygous for one allele of <i>diptericin A</i> are better equipped to survive a systemic infection from <i>P. rettgeri</i>, but in general have a shorter lifespans after being fed common gut commensals. Our results suggest a possible mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation of <i>diptericin A</i> through the complex interactions of sex, systemic immunity, and the maintenance of the gut microbiome.

">Reduced neuronal self-avoidance in mouse starburst amacrine cells with only one Pcdhg isoform</a></h4>

              
                he clustered protocadherins (cPcdhs) are a family of ~60 homophilic cell adhesion molecules expressed across three gene clusters (Pcdha, Pcdhb, and Pcdhg) with a variety of essential roles in the developing nervous system. Some of these roles rely on specific isoforms, while others are more consistent with a model of isoform redundancy or a requirement for diversity. The {gamma}-Pcdhs (expressed from the Pcdhg gene cluster) are particularly important for neuronal self-avoidance in starburst amacrine cells in the mouse retina. Here, we used mouse mutants to test two of the C-type isoforms - {gamma}C4 and {gamma}C5 - and found that neither was required for normal self-avoidance. Conversely, when we analyzed a mutant with only {gamma}C4 intact, we found significant failures in self-avoidance that could not be completely rescued by overexpression of this isoform from a transgene. We have recently found that this isoform is essential for normal neuronal survival during development, and our new findings here support the hypothesis that {gamma}C4 is specialized for the survival function at the expense of a significant role in self-avoidance.

">Long-lasting Avoidance Induced by Repeated Stimulation of the Rostromedial Tegmental Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive decision-making requires the ability to weigh the relative costs versus the benefits of our actions and to flexibly respond to changing environmental contingencies. While midbrain dopamine (DA) has been a major focus of study for its role in associative learning, motivation, and reward seeking, far less is known regarding the contribution of inhibitory dopamine inputs in promoting behavioral inhibition and avoidance learning. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) sends dense GABAergic projections to DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and mounting evidence suggests the RMTg to VTA circuit is required to suppress reward seeking under punishment, but it remains unclear whether stimulation of this pathway is sufficient to drive learning and promote shifts in cost-benefit decisions. To test this, we developed two separate tasks of passive and active avoidance in rats where lever pressing for food reward was associated with repeated contingent optogenetic stimulation of the RMTg to VTA pathway. In a one-lever fixed ratio 5 food-seeking task, we found that pairing RMTg to VTA stimulation with reward delivery caused a robust, yet transient suppression of reward seeking that quickly returned to baseline after contingent stimulation ceased. When given an alternative reward choice, however, RMTg to VTA stimulation caused a rapid and enduring shift in subjective choice leading to persistent and selective avoidance of the stimulation-paired reward. These findings support a multifaceted role for the RMTg to VTA pathway in learning and decision-making and provide key insights into the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral avoidance and maladaptive reward seeking.

">Towards model-based design of causal manipulations of brain circuits with high spatiotemporal precision</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in neurotechnology enable precise spatiotemporal patterns of microstimulations with single-cell resolution. The choice of perturbation sites must satisfy two key criteria: efficacy in evoking significant responses and selectivity for the desired target effects. This choice is currently based on laborious trial-and-error procedures, unfeasible for sequences of multi-site stimulations. Efficient methods to design complex perturbation patterns are urgently needed. Can we design a spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation to steer neural activity and behavior towards a desired target? We outline a method for achieving this goal in two steps. First, we identify the most effective perturbation sites, or hubs, only based on short observations of spontaneous neural activity. Second, we provide an efficient method to design multi-site stimulation patterns by combining approaches from nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory and data-driven methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using multi-site stimulation patterns in recurrent network models.

                Neuronal rhythms coordinate cognitive and physiological processes across multiple timescales, with slower frequencies potentially forming the basis for meaningful contextual transitions. However, investigating these slower aspects requires methodological innovation beyond standard EEG approaches. Using a minimalist virtual environment paradigm, we found that infra-slow EEG oscillations (ISOs) in the 0.016-0.2 Hz frequency range tracked meaningful contextual transitions during social interaction. Furthermore, participants who successfully engaged in a perceptual crossing task exhibited increased alignment in the spectral power of ISOs when measured in the temporal vicinity of the task response (before-after button press), compared to those who failed. This task-locked alignment was accompanied by similar dynamics in respiratory pressure and electrodermal activity, suggesting that ISOs reflect the integration of physiological, cognitive, and social processes, with their alignment facilitating shared understanding and joint action. These findings highlight the role of ISOs in mediating the temporal dynamics of social cognition and show that inter-participant alignment in ISOs can serve as a proxy for the complex interplay between body physiology, cognition, and social behavior.

">The Effects of Early Life Pain and Juvenile Fear Conditioning on CRF-Receptor Expression in the Amygdala and Hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Early life pain and stress have lasting consequences on nervous system development that can interact with later stress or trauma to create a susceptibility to fear, anxiety, depression and chronic pain among other psychological disorders. Recent work has identified changes in corticotropin releasing factor signaling in limbic system structures, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, as a key mechanism behind these changes - albeit in a sex-dependent manner. CRF has two major receptors, CRHR1 and CRHR2 which have also been shown to play key roles in fear and pain expression. The current work examines the effects of early life pain designed to mimic the neonatal medical trauma that occurs in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), paired with a juvenile trauma in the form of fear conditioning, on expression of crhr1 and crhr2 mRNA in the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala as well as the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamus. While prior work has demonstrated that early life pain significantly impacts expression of the CRF ligand, the current data demonstrate that early life pain and fear conditioning largely fail to affect CRH receptor expression in the amygdala. Modest changes in expression to crhr2 in a sex and region-specific manner were observed in the hypothalamus.

">Title: The RNA-binding protein TRIM71 is essential for hearing in humans and mice and regulates the timing of auditory sensory organ development</a></h4>

              
                The RNA-binding protein TRIM71 is essential for brain development, and recent genetic studies in humans have identified TRIM71 as a risk gene for congenital hydrocephaly (CH). Here, we show that mono-allelic missense mutations in TRIM71 are associated with hearing loss (HL) and inner ear aplasia in humans. Utilizing conditional Trim71 knockout mice carrying a CH and HL-associated mutation, we demonstrate that loss of TRIM71 function during early otic development (embryonic day 9-10) causes severe hearing loss. While inner ear morphogenesis occurs normally in Trim71 knockout mice, we find that early otic loss of TRIM71 function disrupts the highly stereotyped timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation within the inner ear auditory sensory organ (cochlea), resulting in the premature formation and innervation of mechano-sensory hair cells. Transcriptomic profiling of Trim71 deficient cochlear progenitor cells identifies Inhba and Tgfbr2 as targets of TRIM71 repression, and our analysis of InhbaTgfbr1 double knockout mice indicates that TRIM71 maintains hair cell progenitors in a proliferative and undifferentiated state by restricting TGF-{beta}-type signaling. Characterization of hair cells and their associated neurons in adult Trim71 knockout mice revealed abnormally short inner hair cell stereocilia, reduced pre-synaptic terminals, and neuronal degeneration in the outer hair cell region, providing a basis for the observed hearing deficits in Trim71 knockout mice.

">Modulation of temporal prediction by STN-DBS in Parkinson's disease: Links between behavior and cortical oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Background Accurate temporal prediction is essential for adaptive behavior and relies on coordinated neural activity within cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Parkinson's disease (PD) with the main hallmark of dopaminergic depletion and abnormal neural synchrony, impairs this ability. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a widely used treatment for reducing motor symptoms in PD, but its effects on temporal prediction remain not fully understood. Objective This study aimed to investigate how STN-DBS influences temporal prediction performance and its underlying oscillatory dynamics in PD patients, with a particular focus on beta band power and delta band inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC). Methods 13 PD patients (5 female, age: 64 {+/-} 5.7 years; disease duration: 11.8 {+/-} 1.8 years) with STN-DBS performed a temporal prediction task with (DBS ON) and without (DBS OFF) stimulation, while EEG (64 channels) was recorded. 20 age-matched healthy controls completed the same task. Behavioral performance was assessed using psychometric function slopes. Time-frequency analyses and source-level EEG measures examined beta power and delta ITPC. Results PD patients showed impaired temporal prediction performance compared to controls, reflected in shallower psychometric slopes. DBS significantly improved performance to a level comparable to those of controls. EEG revealed reduced beta suppression in PD patients during DBS OFF, while beta suppression in DBS ON was comparable to controls. Both DBS OFF and ON exhibited reduced delta ITPC compared to controls. In DBS ON, source-level delta ITPC was positively correlated with temporal prediction accuracy. Conclusion STN-DBS improves temporal prediction performance in PD, likely through modulation of beta and delta oscillatory activity. While beta power suppression is partially restored, deficits in delta phase alignment persist, suggesting frequency-specific DBS effects on temporal prediction processes.

">Neural Onset and Offset Responses in Core and Belt Auditory Cortex of Young and Aged Alert Macaque Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss is a ubiquitous malady in the geriatric population, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We compared onset and offset responses of single neurons in the primary (A1), rostral (R), and caudolateral (CL) areas of the auditory cortex using spectral, spatial, and temporal stimuli in a young macaque monkey with normal-hearing and an aged macaque monkey with high frequency hearing loss. In the young monkey, core areas exhibited a significantly higher proportion of neurons responsive to both the onset and the offset of stimuli compared to the belt area CL, indicating functional differentiation. However, this distinction diminished with age, with the proportion of neurons with both onset and offset responses becoming more uniform across cortical areas. Onset firing rates were generally higher in the aged monkey, but with a lower signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting increased neural excitability but reduced response fidelity. Notably, CL neurons in the aged monkey exhibited a significantly greater disparity between the best frequencies for onset and offset responses, suggesting reduced spectral precision. Additionally, spectral tuning bandwidths (BW) were broader in the CL neurons in the aged monkey, while in the young monkey, A1 neurons exhibited significantly narrower onset BWs compared to offset BWs, a distinction that was lost in the aged monkey. These findings highlight a fundamental asymmetry in auditory cortical processing and suggest that belt area CL is particularly susceptible to age-related changes. Understanding these neural mechanisms provides insights into auditory aging and potential strategies for mitigating hearing deficits.

">Investigating milk derived extracellular vesicles as mediators of maternal stress and environmental intervention</a></h4>

              
                Parental communication signals are transmitted through nursing and critically shape neurodevelopmental trajectories. Mirroring some well characterized effects of gestational challenges in rodents, maternal immune activation (MIA) during the lactational period disrupts maternal physiology, decreases milk quality, and is associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. This occurs without MIA significantly affecting maternal care. While gestational MIA models are responsive to environmental interventions, which beneficially alter maternal milk composition and associated offspring outcomes, the milk-borne mediators underlying resilience remain poorly understood. Given their ability to transport and deposit biologically active cargos, we propose that milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) are vehicles that deliver environmental programming signals (e.g., miRNAs) from nursing mothers to their offspring. Using a rat model, we show that lactational MIA altered MEV miRNA cargo and expression of hippocampal miRNAs in offspring. Several miRNAs in MEVs were also found in the hippocampus of matching offspring. Remarkably, the miRNA dysregulation observed in MEVs and hippocampus was rescued when dams were raised in an enriched environment, suggesting environmental enrichment protected from the effects of MIA, as also observed in the behavioral phenotype. RNA-seq of adult offspring hippocampus showed long-term transcriptional changes associated with the gene targets of early-life regulated miRNAs. Our results position MEV miRNA cargos as dynamic programming signals by which maternal experience is communicated to offspring, encoding both stress-induced and protective cues that influence development. This suggests that breastfeeding interventions can regulate the genetic cargo of the milk, programming the life of developing infants.

">Modulation of error sensitivity during motor learning across time, space and environment variability</a></h4>

              
                We never experience the exact same situation twice. In our dynamic and constantly changing environment, we continuously need to adapt our behavior, either due to external (e.g., a change of wind) or internal factors (e.g., muscle noise). Motor adaptation is the process of recalibration of movements in response to such perturbation. It activates when an agent needs to change their movement in response to a perceived error. It has been proposed that in order to perform motor adaptation, the brain continuously updates an error sensitivity signal that controls how much is learned from a past error. Such error sensitivity reflects the speed of learning, and understanding its dynamics is crucial to promoting efficient learning. In our experiment, healthy participants performed a visuomotor adaptation task requiring reaching multiple targets using a joystick. They experienced two periods of stable perturbations and two periods of random perturbations. In agreement with past research, we found that error sensitivity is lower in unstable environments. Moreover, error sensitivity is higher in a stable environment without perturbation than in a stable environment with perturbations. We observed a continuous increase of the error sensitivity within a stable perturbation environment. Finally, continuous spatial (across target locations) and temporal (across trials with same target) generalization of learning is present not only in stable but also in the random environment.

">Sequential formation of Drosophila circuit asymmetry via prolonged structural plasticity.</a></h4>

              
                Structural and functional differences between brain hemispheres are a common feature of animal nervous systems with reduced bilateral asymmetry often linked to impaired cognitive performance. How neuronal left-right asymmetry is initiated and integrated into a bilaterally symmetrical ground pattern is poorly understood. Here we show that directional asymmetry of a Drosophila central brain circuit originates from axonal interactions of two classes of bilateral pioneer neurons. Subsequent recruitment of neighboring neuron classes into the asymmetric neuropil precursor results in hemisphere-specific microcircuits. Circuit lateralization requires dynamic expression of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2 to maintain structural plasticity in axonal remodeling. Reduced circuit asymmetry following cell type-specific Fasciclin 2 manipulation affect adult brain function. These results reveal an unexpected degree of developmental plasticity of late-born Drosophila neurons in the formation of a new circuit node via the lateralized recruitment of symmetric circuit components.

">Manifold learning for olfactory habituation to strongly fluctuating backgrounds</a></h4>

              
                Animals rely on their sense of smell to survive, but important olfactory cues are mixed with confounding background odors that fluctuate due to atmospheric turbulence. It is unclear how the olfactory system habituates to such stochastic backgrounds to detect behaviorally important odors. Here, we explicitly consider the high-dimensional nature of odor coding, the natural statistics of odor fluctuations and the architecture of the early olfactory pathway. We show that their combination favors a manifold learning mechanism for olfactory habituation over alternatives based on predictive filtering. Manifold learning is implemented in our model by a biologically plausible network of inhibitory interneurons in the early olfactory pathway. We demonstrate that plasticity rules based on IBCM or online PCA are effective at implementing this mechanism in turbulent conditions and outperform previous models relying on mean background subtraction. Interneurons with an IBCM plasticity rule acquire selectivity to independently varying odors. This manifold learning mechanism offers a path towards distinguishing plasticity rules in experiments and could be leveraged by other biological circuits facing fluctuating environments.

">Advanced diffusion imaging in grey matter reflects individual differences in cognitive ability in older adults.</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion Weighted Imaging is a tool that can non-invasively provide insights into the microstructure of a given brain region. Various advanced techniques exist within the diffusion weighted imaging space that each provide valuable insights into different aspects of microstructure. In the following study, we sought to examine whether the combination of derived diffusion metrics (tensors, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI) in grey-matter regions could reliably predict cognitive performance in older adults, and whether these findings were replicable across datasets. First, we demonstrated that all combinations of diffusion metrics could reliably determine participant characteristics and were significant predictors of age. Second, we found that a combination of Tensor, NODDI, and MAP-MRI metrics within the hippocampus could predict RAVLT performance in older adults above and beyond any combination of two metrics alone. We also found these diffusion metrics were able to reliably predict RAVLT performance, but not Trails B or Digit Symbol Substitution Task performance. We also found that these same combinations of metrics could predict working memory performance, but not memory performance within a region associated with working memory (Brodmann Areas 9 and 46). Taken together, these findings indicate that these diffusion metrics provide valuable information on grey-matter microstructure independent of one another, and that the ability to obtain both NODDI and MAP-MRI based information from multi-shell diffusion scans more than justifies the added length.

">Your Brain Doesn't Look a Day Past 70! Cross-Sectional Associations with Brain-Predicted Age in the Cognitively-Intact Oldest-Old</a></h4>

              
                The cognitively-intact oldest-old (85+) may be the most-resilient members of their birth cohort; due to survivorship effects (e.g., depletion of susceptibles), risk factors associated with brain aging biomarkers in younger samples may not generalize to the oldest-old. We evaluated associations between established aging-related risk factors and brain-predicted age difference (brainPAD) in a cross-sectional cognitively-intact oldest-old sample. Additionally, we evaluated brainPAD-cognition associations to characterize brain maintenance vs. cognitive reserve in our sample. Oldest-old adults (N = 206; 85-99 years; MoCA > 22 or neurologist evaluation) underwent T1-weighted MRI; brainPAD was generated with brainageR, such that more-positive brainPAD reflected relatively advanced brain aging. Sex, educational attainment, alcohol and smoking history, exercise history, BMI, cardiovascular and metabolic disease history, and anticholinergic medication burden were self-reported. Global cognitive z-score and coefficient of variation were derived from the NACC UDS 3.0 cognitive battery; crystallized-fluid discrepancy was derived from the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery. Mean brainPAD was -7.99 (SD: 5.37; range: -24.50, 6.03). Women showed more-delayed brain aging than men (B = -2.35, 95% CI = -4.28, -0.41, p = 0.018). No other exposures were associated with brainPAD. BrainPAD was not associated with any cognitive variable. These findings suggest that cognitively-intact oldest-old adults may be atypically-resistant to risk factors associated with aging in younger samples, consistent with survivorship effects in aging. Furthermore, brainPAD may have limited explanatory value for cognitive performance in cognitively-intact oldest-old adults, potentially due to high cognitive reserve. Overall, our findings highlight the impact of survivorship effects on brain aging research.

                The VMH-SF1 neurons are known for encoding a predator-orientated internal state that drives innate defensive responses. Although neuroanatomical studies show that male mouse VMH-SF1 neurons are interconnected with structures in the social behavioral network, how VMH-SF1 neurons represent stimulus and behaviors under social context remain elusive. To address the question, we employed fiber photometry and miniscope calcium imaging on VMH-SF1 neurons and found that VMH-SF1 neurons are strongly responsive to social stimuli with a male-biased sex preference, which requires pheromonal signals and intact BNST-VMH pathway. During social interaction, VMH-SF1 neurons are highly tuned to investigative yet strongly silenced by consummatory or defensive social behaviors. Notably, VMH-SF1 neurons that encode predator-evoked defensive actions and those encoding social-investigation are two distinct subpopulations. Lastly, silencing VMH-SF1 neurons reduces the duration of social investigation. Altogether, our results suggest the existence of a novel, non-defense driving VMH-SF1 neurons subset that encodes conspecific social cues with sex-bias and prompts social investigation of male mouse.

Our prior work showed that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increases pathological pain sensitivity (allodynia) following peripheral sciatic nerve injury. While the immune mechanism(s) of PAE-induced immune dysfunction are poorly understood, prior studies implicated the involvement of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. Interestingly, emerging data suggest a surprising overlap of spinal glial proinflammatory activation via the TLR4-NLRP3-interleukin (IL)-1{beta} axis due to opioid treatment in nerve-injured non-PAE rodents. Considering this preclinical evidence, we explored whether PAE poses a risk factor in creating proinflammatory immune bias consequent to opioid (morphine) exposure. We hypothesized that under nerve injury conditions, PAE may interact with morphine, promoting peripheral and CNS proinflammatory factors in a NLRP3-dependent manner. Using a minor nerve injury model in adult mice, we demonstrate that PAE prolongs the chronicity of ongoing allodynia in both sexes, with a more pronounced effect observed in male mice. Our study shows that PAE amplifies proinflammatory responses at the injury site and the spinal cord, driving morphine-prolonged allodynia through NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a well-established pain-promoting TLR4 agonist, is elevated in allodynic PAE mice. NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, effectively reverses morphine-induced allodynia and reduces Caspase-1 activity, IL-1{beta}, and related proinflammatory factors. Although few sex-specific effects were observed, our data convincingly support that PAE and morphine interactions ultimately converge on NLRP3-driven mechanisms in both sexes. Together, this study suggests that PAE modulates later-life neuroimmune function and provides critical insights into immune regulators underlying PAE-induced biological vulnerability to pathological pain processing and adverse effects of opioids.

">ECgo: All-Optical Induction of Single Endothelial Cell Injury and Capillary Occlusion in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                The ability to induce endothelial cell (EC) damage in the mouse brain with high spatial precision is invaluable for mechanistic studies of brain capillary injury and repair. Here, we introduce an optical method, termed ECgo, that utilizes a new two-photon-excitable porphyrin-based photosensitizer (Ps2P) to selectively obliterate single ECs within the brain microvascular network. Using the developed approach, we were able to induce occlusions of single capillaries with high spatiotemporal control, while preserving the surrounding tissue. Combined with longitudinal two-photon imaging, ECgo enables studies of morphological and functional consequences of targeted single capillary EC injury in vivo under healthy and diseased conditions.

                Small G proteins coordinate the development of nerve terminals. The activity of G proteins is finely tuned by GTPase regulatory proteins. Previously, we observed that PXF-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans GTPase regulatory protein, is required for the function of cholinergic motor neurons. Here, we investigated how PXF-1 coordinates the development of presynaptic terminals at the molecular level. We observed that PXF-1 acts through RAP-1 to promote synapse development. Subsequently, we found that pxf-1 mutants display a reduction in RAC-2 activity, which is required for cholinergic synapse development. We observed that RAC-2 acts downstream of RAP-1. Finally, we identified a physical interaction between RAP-1 and TIAM-1, a Rac guanine exchange factor, which links PXF-1 function to the presynaptic actin cytoskeleton through RAC-2 activation. These findings highlight how small G protein signaling pathways interact to coordinate the development of presynaptic terminals.

">Lipidomic signatures in microglial extracellular vesicles during acute inflammation: a gateway to neurological biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane bound vesicles released from all cells throughout the body, including the central nervous system, and are known to carry both membrane-bound proteins and cargo reflective of their cell of origin. EVs show promise as neurological disease biomarkers due to their molecular makeup reflecting their parent-cell composition signature and due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. To-date, the vast majority of research in this field has explored the protein profiles of EVs; however, lipids play an important role not only in the formation of EVs, but also in mediating cellular function and the pathological progression of many neurodegenerative conditions. Herein, we take a critical first step in determining the potential utility of EV lipids as biomarkers in neurological disease. In vitro we exposed BV-2 microglia to either control media or media containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a known pro-inflammatory stimulus, for 24 hours then isolated both the cells and their EVs and performed LC-MS/MS. For the first time, we reveal distinct lipidomic changes can differentiate resting vs. pro-inflammatory microglia and their EVs, while distinct lipids are preserved between EVs and their parent cell. Moreover, we add to current literature by demonstrating acute pro-inflammatory activation of microglia results in the activation and suppression of distinct lipidomic pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that analysis of lipid-based relationships between parent cells and their EVs may be a useful tool to infer cellular function. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that lipidomic analysis can not only differentiate the functional state of cells in vitro but can also differentiate their EVs. We lay the first brick in a foundation to support future research into EV lipids as novel and exciting biomarker candidates in neurological disease.

">Converging pathways: shared brain circuitry engaged by monoaminergic antidepressants, ketamine and psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine has transformed depression treatment by providing therapeutic relief within a single day, unlike monoaminergic antidepressants, which require several weeks to take effect. Here, we conducted whole-brain screening in mice to compare drug-evoked c-fos expression, acting as a marker of brain activity leading to protein synthesis-dependent forms of plasticity, following treatment with monoaminergic antidepressants, ketamine and psilocybin. Our findings reveal a shared limbic brain circuit comprising subcortical and frontocortical regions, with a key distinction: c-fos-based activity in the prelimbic and infralimbic frontal cortex, areas strongly implicated in depression, was acutely induced by ketamine and high-dose psilocybin, but emerged only after chronic dosing with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine or microdose psilocybin. These results suggest the existence of a core limbic subcortico-cortical circuit underlying antidepressant efficacy, provide mechanistic insight into the delayed therapeutic effects of monoaminergic antidepressants, and reveal a close similarity in brain activity evoked by monoaminergic antidepressants and psilocybin microdosing.

                <p>The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific translating ribosome affinity purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 months) and old (21-24 months) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Intriguingly, genes involved in serotonergic synthesis were upregulated with age in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.</p>

                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a devastating disease, often pharmacoresistant and with a high prevalence of 1% worldwide. There are a few disease-modifying therapies; thus, prevention has become a health priority. The overarching goal of this research project is to highlight the system's dynamics at different stages before TLE onset to identify an early shift in network dynamics trajectory toward disease onset. Researchers often investigate collective brain activity by tracking dynamical interactions of the signal recorded at multiple sites. However, these interactions are usually only computed between pairs of brain regions, at the risk of missing simultaneous interactions of three or more areas, an aspect that is crucial in a networked disease such as TLE. We thus propose to track, on a rich dataset of electrophysiological brain signals recorded within the temporal lobe (TL) of adult male Wistar Han rats, the formation and dissolution of high-order informational multiplets in time during distinct natural behaviors in an animal model of TLE. We identified the informational content of the multiplets as synergistic or redundant. Results identified an early transition of synergistic and redundant multiplets ahead of TLE onset with the predominant involvement of four TL brain regions in generating theta (4&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) activity. This shift has been shown predominantly during exploration, a theta-dependent behavior, less during rest and sleep. This specific change suggests a shift in communication from an integrated to a segregated network toward TLE onset.</p>

                <p>Recording the spiking activity from subcellular compartments of neurons such as axons and dendrites during mouse behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging is increasingly common yet remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise, inaccurate region-of-interest (ROI) identification, movement artifacts, and difficulty in grouping ROIs from the same neuron. To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient preprocessing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply bandpass filtering methods (e.g., 0.05&ndash;0.12&nbsp;Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from <I>z</I>-plane movement, we apply principal component analysis on all calcium traces and use a bottom-up segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or <I>k</I>-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to "ground truth" data. Our approach provides a guideline for standardizing the extraction of physiological signals from subcellular compartments during rodent behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging.</p>

                Background Universal access to maternal, newborn, and child healthcare is essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, but the effectiveness of various incentive-based programs for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains uncertain. Objective of this systematic review was to determine if incentive-based interventions influenced maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Methods We conducted a search in various databases from inception. All incentive-based interventional studies conducted on pregnant women in LMICs were included. Evidence from the included trials was synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes between groups receiving incentives and not receiving incentives. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and reviewed the collected data to determine its suitability for meta-analysis. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021247681). Results Of the 3,897 records that were identified, 11 met eligibility criteria, all of which exhibited varying degrees of risk of bias, ranging from high to some concerns. Analysis of maternal outcomes across studies revealed no significant differences in the likelihood of delivering at a healthcare facility (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.47) and in frequency of prenatal care (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.12) between intervention and control groups. However, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were observed for both outcomes indicating variability among study results. Similarly, analysis of tetanus vaccine coverage showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.08), with moderate statistical heterogeneity observed. Conclusion The maternal and neonatal outcomes examined in this review did not have any significant differences in intervention group when compared to the control group. The interventions to address maternal health concerns need to follow a multifactorial approach. There is a need for extensive primary research studies in the future.

The new concept of home care services can save costs and equipment. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that influence patient satisfaction with home care services. Methods This study is a systematic review with PRISMA guidelines using three electronic databases ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. There were 228 articles with duplication reduction to 197 and narrowed down to 73 articles whose titles and abstracts were appropriate, but only 10 articles met the provisions in the full text. Literature search using the keywords Home Care Services AND Satisfaction, then the type of full-text article, in English and a publication period of 10 years. The data extraction process, irrelevant articles such as articles on patient satisfaction in nursing homes and out-of-home care were removed. PROSPERO approved the following research protocol number: CRD42023482315. Result Found factors that influence patient satisfaction with home care services. Conclusion There are fifteen aspects that affect patient satisfaction and two aspects that affect patient satisfaction in general in long-term home care. It is hoped that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospital home care managers to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the methods in the articles vary greatly, which is a deficiency in this systematic review.

                <p>by Anna Zhukova, Olivier Gascuel</p>

Phylodynamics bridges the gap between classical epidemiology and pathogen genome sequence data by estimating epidemiological parameters from time-scaled pathogen phylogenetic trees. The models used in phylodynamics typically assume that the sampling procedure is independent between infected individuals. However, this assumption does not hold for many epidemics, in particular for such sexually transmitted infections as HIV-1, for which contact tracing schemes are included in health policies of many countries. We extended phylodynamic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) models with contact tracing (CT), and developed a simulator to generate trees under MTBD and MTBD-CT models. We proposed a non-parametric test for detecting contact tracing in pathogen phylogenetic trees. Its application to simulated data showed that it is both highly specific and sensitive. For the simplest representative of the MTBD-CT family, the BD-CT(1) model, where only the last contact can be notified, we solved the differential equations and proposed a closed form solution for the likelihood function. We implemented a maximum-likelihood program, which estimates the BD-CT(1) model parameters and their confidence intervals from phylogenetic trees. It performed accurate parameter inference on BD and BD-CT(1) simulated data, and detected contact tracing in HIV-1 B epidemics in Zurich and the UK. Importantly, we showed that not accounting for contact tracing when it is present, leads to bias in parameter estimation with the BD model (overestimation of the becoming-non-infectious rate). This bias is also present, but greatly reduced, when the BD-CT(1) model is used on data where multiple contacts can be notified. Our CT test, MTBD-CT tree simulator and BD-CT(1) parameter estimator are freely available at GitHub (evolbioinfo/treesimulator and evolbioinfo/bdct).

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011859">Cellular morphodynamics as quantifiers for functional states of resident tissue macrophages in vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Miriam Schnitzerlein, Eric Greto, Anja Wegner, Anna Möller, Oliver Aust, Oumaima Ben Brahim, David B. Blumenthal, Vasily Zaburdaev, Stefan Uderhardt</p>

Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are essential for tissue homeostasis. Their diverse functions, from monitoring interstitial fluids to clearing cellular debris, are accompanied by characteristic morphological changes that reflect their functional status. While current knowledge of macrophage behaviour comes primarily from <i>in vitro</i> studies, their dynamic behavior <i>in vivo</i> is fundamentally different, necessitating a more physiologically relevant approach to their understanding. In this study, we employed intravital imaging to generate dynamic data from peritoneal RTMs in mice under various conditions and developed a comprehensive image processing pipeline to quantify RTM morphodynamics over time, defining human-interpretable cell size and shape features. These features allowed for the quantitative and qualitative differentiation of cell populations in various functional states, including pro- and anti-inflammatory activation and endosomal dysfunction. The study revealed that under steady-state conditions, RTMs exhibit a wide range of morphodynamical phenotypes, constituting a naïve morphospace of behavioral motifs. Upon challenge, morphodynamic patterns changed uniformly at the population level but predominantly within the constraints of this naïve morphospace. Notably, aged animals displayed a markedly shifted naïve morphospace, indicating drastically different behavioral patterns compared to their young counterparts. The developed method also proved valuable in optimizing explanted tissue setups, bringing RTM behavior closer to the physiological native state. Our versatile approach thus provides novel insights into the dynamic behavior of <i>bona fide</i> macrophages <i>in vivo</i>, enabling the distinction between physiological and pathological cell states and the assessment of functional tissue age on a population level.

                <p>by Andreas Bachler, Amanda Padovan, Craig J. Anderson, Yiyun Wei, Yidong Wu, Stephen Pearce, Sharon Downes, Bill James, Ashley E. Tessnow, Gregory A. Sword, Michelle Williams, Wee Tek Tay, Karl H. J. Gordon, Tom K. Walsh</p>

The global reliance on <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) proteins for controlling lepidopteran pests in cotton, corn, and soybean crops underscores the critical need to understand resistance mechanisms. Vip3Aa, one of the most widely deployed and currently effective Bt proteins in genetically modified crops, plays a pivotal role in pest management. This study investigates the molecular basis of Vip3Aa resistance in Australian <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> through genetic crosses, and integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses. We identified a previously uncharacterized gene, LOC110373801 (designated <i>HaVipR1</i>), as potentially important in Vip3Aa resistance in two field-derived resistant lines. Functional validation using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in susceptible lines confirmed the gene’s role in conferring high-level resistance to Vip3Aa. Despite extensive laboratory selection of Vip3Aa-resistant colonies in Lepidoptera, the biochemical mechanisms underlying resistance have remained elusive. Our research identifies HaVipR1 as a potential contributor to resistance, adding to our understanding of how insects may develop resistance to this important Bt protein. The identification of <i>HaVipR1</i> contributes to our understanding of potential resistance mechanisms and may inform future resistance management strategies. Future work should explore the biochemical pathways influenced by <i>HaVipR1</i> and assess its interactions with other resistance mechanisms. The approach utilized here underscores the value of field-derived resistant lines for understanding resistance in agricultural pests and highlights the need for targeted approaches to manage resistance sustainably.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to certain moral dilemmas. This study aims to investigate the dilemmas, occupational and psychological distresses and professional rewards experienced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards and explore their nature and how they are connected. Methods This qualitative descriptive utilized semi-structured interviews with nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results Twelve nurses (8 women, 4 men) with 4 to 21 years of experience participated. Six participants held managerial positions (three head nurses and three deputy head nurses), alongside six staff nurses. Analysis revealed that nurses experienced significant conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they reported substantial rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions Nurses in COVID-19 wards experienced considerable distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges. Leading to feeling of organizational mistrust. However this demanding environment also provided a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly from new interactions. These findings are highlight the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the inherent occupational distress with professional rewards.

                Lin et al. characterize a population of tau-vulnerable neurons in AD. Analysis of gene expression in these neurons reveals dysregulation in major coordinated programs including apoptosis, cell-component disassembly, and regulation of vesicle-mediated transport. These biological processes suggest avenues for therapeutic interventions preventing neuronal loss and degeneration in AD.
