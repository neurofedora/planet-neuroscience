                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) are known to contribute to both protective and pronociceptive processes. However, their contribution to neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) needs further investigation. In a recent study utilizing TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> mice, it was shown that systemic pharmacogenetic inhibition of TrkB signaling with 1NM-PP1 (1NMP) immediately after SCI delayed the onset of pain hypersensitivity, implicating maladaptive TrkB signaling in pain after SCI. To examine potential neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcome, patch-clamp recording was performed in small-diameter dissociated thoracic (T) dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to evaluate TrkB signaling in uninjured mice and after T10 contusion SCI. Bath-applied 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a selective TrkB agonist, induced a robust inward current in neurons from uninjured mice, which was attenuated by 1NMP treatment. SCI also decreased 7,8-DHF-induced current while increasing the latency to its peak amplitude. Western blot revealed a concomitant decrease in TrkB expression in DRGs adjacent to the spinal lesion. Analyses of cellular and membrane properties showed that SCI increased neuronal excitability, evident by an increase in resting membrane potential and the number of spiking neurons. However, SCI did not increase spontaneous firing in DRG neurons. These results suggest that SCI induced changes in TrkB activation in DRG neurons even though these alterations are likely not contributing to pain hypersensitivity by nociceptor hyperexcitability. Overall, this reveals complex interactions involving TrkB signaling and provides an opportunity to investigate other, presumably peripheral, mechanisms by which TrkB contributes to pain hypersensitivity after SCI.</p>

                <p>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a well-known antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke by inhibiting pyroptosis, a programmed cell death associated with inflammation. This study investigates the impact of HCQ on ischemic stroke pathology using both in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with HCQ. Neurological deficits, infarct volume, and the expression of pyroptosis markers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that HCQ significantly improved motor function and reduced infarct volume in the MCAO mouse model. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) were treated with HCQ. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that HCQ effectively suppressed the expression of pyroptosis markers GSDMD and NLRP3 in both in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that HCQ mitigates ischemic stroke damage by inhibiting pyroptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HCQ exerts its neuroprotective effects, offering a promising new avenue for developing safe, cost-effective, and widely applicable stroke treatments. The potential of HCQ to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways presents a significant advancement in ischemic stroke therapy, emphasizing the importance of targeting pyroptosis in stroke management and the broader implications for treating neuroinflammatory conditions.</p>

                This paper presents a study of congruence relations on autometrized algebras. We demonstrate that in a normal autometrized algebra, which satisfies certain conditions, the set of all congruence relations forms a complete sublattice within the set of all equivalence relations. Furthermore, we investigate the property that a congruence-permutable autometrized algebra is also congruence-modular. We also explore several fundamental properties related to congruence relations. Additionally, we introduce the kernel of a homomorphism and establish that it is a congruence relation. Lastly, we examine the homomorphism, isomorphism, and correspondence theorems of autometrized algebra using the concept of congruence.

                Background Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-21/v1?src=rss">Assessing psychogenic health risks through the days between death and birth in the individual annual cycle [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The "birthday effect" refers to increased mortality around birthdays, although evidence remains mixed, with some studies even indicating reduced mortality. While the effect has a minimal impact on overall mortality, lacks prevention potential, and faces methodological challenges, it offers seminal insights into psychogenic health effects. Methods Major causes of death were analyzed using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (1987-2022), excluding leap years and cases with imputed dates. The relationship between day of birth and death was assessed using a Poisson count model with overdispersion, and mortality rates (MRs) per 100,000 deaths per year were calculated for Â±182 days around birthdays. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) compared these periods to a reference period. Cluster analyses explored mortality rate patterns across age and diagnostic groups. Age was not adjusted for in the Poisson model to avoid zero inflation, with bias from age-related mortality changes assessed separately through sensitivity analyses. Results In the analysis of 1,702,865 deaths over 27 years, an eight percent increase in birthday mortality was observed, equivalent to 22 additional deaths per 100,000 deaths per year. There were 889 excess deaths in the 28 days after the birthday compared to 206 in the 28 days before. Excess birthday mortality was particularly pronounced in men, unmarried individuals, and those with religious affiliations. In individuals aged 85 and older, a pre-birthday dip followed by post-birthday mortality excess was noted. Cardiovascular causes, suicides, and accidents had the highest birthday-related mortality, while diabetes, respiratory diseases, and other conditions showed varied pre- and post-birthday patterns. Conclusions Administrative and age-related biases were ruled out, suggesting the birthday effect is psychogenic. While behavior-linked causes like suicides and accidents had clear birthday patterns, other main causes of death also showed birthday-period effects. Further research, including psychometric and biomarker studies, is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

                <p>by Magnus Pirovino, Christian Iseli, Joseph A. Curran, Bernard Conrad</p>

Catalysis and specifically autocatalysis are the quintessential building blocks of life. Yet, although autocatalytic networks are necessary, they are not sufficient for the emergence of life-like properties, such as replication and adaptation. The ultimate and potentially fatal threat faced by molecular replicators is parasitism; if the polymerase error rate exceeds a critical threshold, even the fittest molecular species will disappear. Here we have developed an autocatalytic RNA early life mathematical network model based on enzyme kinetics, specifically the steady-state approximation. We confirm previous models showing that these second-order autocatalytic cycles are sustainable, provided there is a sufficient nucleotide pool. However, molecular parasites become untenable unless they sequentially degenerate to hyperparasites (i.e. parasites of parasites). Parasite resistanceâa parasite-specific host response decreasing parasite fitnessâis acquired gradually, and eventually involves an increased binding affinity of hyperparasites for parasites. Our model is supported at three levels; firstly, ribozyme polymerases display Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics and comply with the steady-state approximation. Secondly, ribozyme polymerases are capable of sustainable auto-amplification and of surmounting the fatal error threshold. Thirdly, with growing sequence divergence of host and parasite catalysts, the probability of self-binding is expected to increase and the trend towards cross-reactivity to diminish. Our model predicts that primordial host-RNA populations evolved via an arms race towards a host-parasite-hyperparasite catalyst trio that conferred parasite resistance within an RNA replicator niche. While molecular parasites have traditionally been viewed as a nuisance, our model argues for their integration into the host habitat rather than their separation. It adds another mechanismâwith biochemical precisionâby which parasitism can be tamed and offers an attractive explanation for the universal coexistence of catalyst trios within prokaryotes and the virosphere, heralding the birth of a primitive molecular immunity.

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely TEMPO, Choline, and Betaine. TEMPO demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extracts has the potential to serve as an effective antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to confirm how the potential compounds in S. caseolaris leaf water extracts interact with the target protein Keap1. This research aims to utilize S. caseolaris as active components in food products, thereby enhancing antioxidant consumption among consumers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-47/v3?src=rss">Regulation of MAP2, GFAP, and calcium in the CA3 Region Following Kainic Acid Exposure toÂ  organotypic hippocampal slice culture [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Neurodegeneration due to neurotoxicity is one of the phenomena in temporal lobe epilepsy. Experimentally, hippocampal excitotoxicity process can occur due to kainic acid exposure, especially in the CA3 area. Neuronal death, astrocyte reactivity and increased calcium also occur in hippocampal excitotoxicity, but few studies have investigated immediate effect after kainic acid exposure. The organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) is a useful model for studying the neurodegeneration process, but there are still many protocol differences. In this study, minor modifications were made in the OHSC protocol. Methods OHSC was obtained from three healthy wild type Wistar rats aged P10. Healthy culture slices were obtained and lasted up to 10 days in vitro (DIV 10). Bath application of kainic acid for 48 hours in DIV 10 followed by observation of its initial effects on neurons, astrocytes, and calcium via the expression of MAP2, GFAP, and intracellular calcium imaging, subsequently. Results After 48 h of kainic acid administration, there was a significant increase in intracellular calcium intensity (p = 0.006 < Î±), accompanied by a significant decrease in MAP2 (p = 0.003 < Î±) and GFAP (p = 0.010 < Î±) expression. Conclusion These findings suggest early neuronal and astrocyte damage at the initial onset of hippocampal injury. This implies that astrocyte damage occurs early before an increase in GFAP that characterizes reactive astrogliosis found in other studies. Damage to neurons and astrocytes may be associated with increased intracellular calcium. It is necessary to develop further research regarding regulation of calcium, MAP2, and GFAP at a spatial time after exposure to kainic acid and strategies to reduce damage caused by excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-20/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Healthcare Capabilities: A Systematic Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the healthcare ecosystem, but further research is needed to understand how it can enhance healthcare capabilities. This study analyzes the literature on AI and healthcare capability using the PRISMA approach, applying specific search keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The findings indicate that AI benefits the healthcare ecosystem, significantly influences health outcomes, and transforms medical practices. However, there is limited literature and a lack of understanding regarding how AI enhances healthcare capabilities. Most studies date from 2019, suggesting that COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of AI systems in healthcare. This research contributes theoretically by developing a framework that clarifies AIâs role in enhancing healthcare capabilities, serving as a foundational model for future studies. It identifies critical gaps in the literature, especially in the Global South, and encourages exploration in under-researched areas where healthcare professionals can benefit from AI. Additionally, it bridges the gap between AI and healthcare, enriching interdisciplinary dialogue relevant to emerging economies facing financial constraints. Practically, the study provides actionable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers in the Global South on leveraging AI to improve service delivery. It sets the stage for empirical research, promoting the testing and refinement of the proposed framework in resource-limited contexts, while raising awareness among healthcare staff, managers, and technology developers about AIâs role in healthcare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-19/v1?src=rss">Through restful waters and deep commotion: A study on burnout and health impairment of Italian seafarers from the JD-R model perspective. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The work experience of seafarers differs significantly from other land-based occupations due to several factors, particularly remoteness and the restricted work environment. This study seeks to examine the impact of burnout and health impairment in the maritime industry, using the Job Demand-Resources theory as a framework. Methods To investigate these phenomena, an online questionnaire was sent to 239 Italian seafarers (94.6% men, Mage = 39.44, SD = 12.8). We tested a mediated Structural Equation Model (SEM) aimed at predicting negative health outcomes. Results The results show that burnout plays a mediating role between job demands (such as workload and cognitive strain) and resources (such as social support and transformational leadership), influencing variables related to health impairment (such as sleep quality and physical well-being). Furthermore, the findings highlight the direct influence of occupational resources on seafarersâ health. Conclusions The discussion highlights the urgent need for more research in the field of organisational psychology in the maritime industry and the discrepancies between these findings, which are consistent with the existing maritime literature, and other studies that do not include seafarers in their sample groups.

                Background and aim This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a mixture of 0.5% deltamethrin, 0.75% S-bio-allethrin, and 10% piperonyl butoxide (DAP) in eliminating Aedes mosquitoes in 10 areas of a high-risk district for dengue fever. Methods Susceptibility tests for Aedes against deltamethrin (1:1.000) Aedes) were conducted between October 2022 and December 2022. Data analysis using descriptive statistics was presented with frequency percentage, average, standard deviation, median, at 25 and 75 percentiles, and inferential statistics to compare mean differences within and between groups using independent t-test statistics. Results The results showed that these isolates were susceptible to deltamethrin. The mortality difference rate between DAP indoors was significantly more effective than 0.5% deltamethrin at 0.05 (p-value=0.04). The mortality difference rate between the mortality rate of DAP outdoors was statistically significantly greater than 0.5% deltamethrin at a level of 0.05 (p-value<0.001). The mortality difference means of Aedes caused by DAP indoors and outdoors were statistically different at 0.05 (p-value<0.001), and it was found that the effectiveness of 0.5% deltamethrin in eliminating indoors was greater than outdoors by 70.1 (95% CI = 63.78-76.41). Conclusion Combining DAP effectively eliminated Aedes mosquitoes in indoor and outdoor environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-16/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence in the Prediction of Stone-Free Status in Urinary Stone Disease Treated with Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases worldwide. One of the most common therapy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), has a high failure rate. The failure rate can be significantly reduced by identifying the candidates most likely to benefit from ESWL, for example, by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Decision tree analysis (DTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) represent a few of the machine learning approaches employed to forecast the stone-free outcome following ESWL. Methods 219 studies were searched through six electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Proquest, SCOPUS). We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). To evaluate the potential bias in all the studies, we utilized the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results 41,484 patients from 11 studies were included. The ML models highlight varying levels of diagnostic precision, with sensitivity spanning from 35-96%, and specificity ranging from 63-98.4%, and area under the curve falling between 0.49-0.96. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of RF and DTA in predicting stone-free status is superior than ANN. Conclusion ML is a comparable predictive method to statistical analysis in predicting stone-free status. Random forest method and DTA are superior MLs compared to ANN. Stone size, density, and 3D texture analysis are the most important variables to be considered in the ML models and should be included in the models to ensure accuracy of stone-free status prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-15/v1?src=rss">Concurrent stunting among under-five children inâ¯Egypt [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Stunting still represents a major public health problem in Egypt, impacting around one-third of children under five and leading to a 2-3% drop in Gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children aged 0-23 months, 24-59 months and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods The study used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion Addressing the causes of stunting in Egypt necessitates sectoral collaboration, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and social protection, with the implementation of targeted interventions focusing on children born to short mothers. Interventions must be accessible for families with low socioeconomic status, focusing on improved healthcare access, parent education, and infant and young child feeding practices. A systematic nutrition monitoring framework that enables routine data collection on nutritional outcomes to monitor and improve child health is recommended.

                Metabolic adaptations are key to cancer cell survival in nutrient-limited microenvironments, but strategies for coping with arginine scarcity are poorly understood. Dunlap etÂ al. use CRISPR screening and metabolomics to identify the plasma membrane transporter SLC7A5 as a citrulline transporter essential for cancer cell growth under arginine limitation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88287">Why the brown ghost chirps at night</a></h4>

              
                Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo, and Bullock, weakly electric fish have served as a valuable model for investigating spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon usually less accessible than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. These fish, through their electric organ, generate low-intensity electric fields to navigate and interact with conspecifics, even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is appealing as a study subject due to a rich electric âvocabularyâ, made by individually variable and sex-specific electric signals. These are mainly characterized by brief frequency modulations of the oscillating dipole moment continuously generated by their electric organ, and are known as chirps. Different types of chirps are believed to convey specific and behaviorally salient information, serving as behavioral readouts for different internal states during behavioral observations. Despite the success of this model in neuroethology over the past seven decades, the code to decipher their electric communication remains unknown. To this aim, in this study we re-evaluate the correlations between signals and behavior offering an alternative, and possibly complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By uncovering correlations among chirping, electric field geometry, and detectability in enriched environments, we present evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals, enhancing conspecific electrolocation during social encounters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95267">Nicotine enhances the stemness and tumorigenicity in intestinal stem cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway</a></h4>

              
                Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via Î±7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100455">The Drosophila hematopoietic niche assembles through collective cell migration controlled by neighbor tissues and Slit-Robo signaling</a></h4>

              
                Niches are often found in specific positions in tissues relative to the stem cells they support. Consistency of niche position suggests that placement is important for niche function. However, the complexity of most niches has precluded a thorough understanding of how their proper placement is established. To address this, we investigated the formation of a genetically tractable niche, the <i>Drosophila</i> Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), the assembly of which had not been previously explored. This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors. Our work characterizes a novel example of niche formation and identifies an extrinsic signaling relay that controls precise niche positioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91422">Diversity in Notch ligand-receptor signaling interactions</a></h4>

              
                The Notch signaling pathway uses families of ligands and receptors to transmit signals to nearby cells. These components are expressed in diverse combinations in different cell types, interact in a many-to-many fashion, both within the same cell (in cis) and between cells (in trans), and their interactions are modulated by Fringe glycosyltransferases. A fundamental question is how the strength of Notch signaling depends on which pathway components are expressed, at what levels, and in which cells. Here, we used a quantitative, bottom-up, cell-based approach to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation signaling efficiencies across a range of ligand and Fringe expression levels in Chinese hamster and mouse cell lines. Each ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and receptor variant (Notch1 and Notch2) analyzed here exhibited a unique profile of interactions, Fringe dependence, and signaling outcomes. All four ligands were able to bind receptors in cis and in trans, and all ligands trans-activated both receptors, although Jag1-Notch1 signaling was substantially weaker than other ligand-receptor combinations. Cis-interactions were predominantly inhibitory, with the exception of the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 pairs, which exhibited cis-activation stronger than trans-activation. Lfng strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors. Finally, cis-ligands showed diverse cis-inhibition strengths, which depended on the identity of the trans-ligand as well as the receptor. The map of receptor-ligand-Fringe interaction outcomes revealed here should help guide rational perturbation and control of the Notch pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101032">Capsular Polysaccharide Restrains Type VI Secretion in Acinetobacter baumannii</a></h4>

              
                The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a sophisticated, contact-dependent nanomachine involved in interbacterial competition. To function effectively, the T6SS must penetrate the membranes of both attacker and target bacteria. Structures associated with the cell envelope, like polysaccharides chains, can therefore introduce spatial separation and steric hindrance, potentially affecting the efficacy of the T6SS. In this study, we examined how the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> affects T6SS's antibacterial function. Our findings show that the CPS confers resistance against T6SS-mediated assaults from rival bacteria. Notably, under typical growth conditions, the presence of the surface-bound capsule also reduces the efficacy of the bacterium's own T6SS. This T6SS impairment is further enhanced when CPS is overproduced due to genetic modifications or antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bacterium adjusts the level of the T6SS inner tube protein Hcp according to its secretion capacity, by initiating a degradation process involving the ClpXP protease. Collectively, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between T6SS and CPS and how they respond swiftly to environmental challenges.

                Neural circuits throughout the visual system process features differently depending on where they appear in the visual field. While such location-specific processing exists in retina and in superior colliculus, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is thought to lack this specialization. Here, we show systematic visual field biases in dLGN's representation of spatial frequency, orientation, direction, and temporal frequency. Using axon-localized calcium indicators and widefield imaging, we discovered that dLGN boutons show systematic gradients in feature selectivity across the visual cortex (V1), while its retinal inputs lack such gradients for these features. Selective disruption of V1 feedback to dLGN perturbed gradient structure and magnitude. These results suggest that dLGN circuits transform uniformly distributed retinal feature inputs into spatially-biased representations along with cortical feedback. dLGN feature biases would allow a functional stream to detect ethologically salient visual inputs.

">GABAB receptor-mediated potentiation of ventral medial habenula glutamatergic transmission in GABAergic and glutamatergic interpeduncular nucleus neurons</a></h4>

              
                The medial habenula (MHb)-interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway plays an important role in information transferring between the forebrain and the midbrain. The MHb-IPN pathway has been implicated in the regulation of fear behavior and nicotine addiction. The synapses between the ventral MHb and the IPN show a unique property, i.e., an enhancement of synaptic transmission upon activation of GABAB receptors. This GABAB receptor-mediated potentiation of ventral MHb-IPN synaptic transmission has been implicated in regulating fear memory. Although IPN is known to contain parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) GABAergic neurons and vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3)-expressing neurons, it is unknown how GABAB receptor activation affects ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto these three subtypes of IPN neurons. Our studies show robust glutamatergic connectivity from ventral MHb to PV and SST neurons in the IPN, while the ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission in IPN VGLUT3 neurons is weak. Although activation of GABAB receptors produces a robust potentiation of ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission in PV neurons, we observed a modest effect in IPN SST neurons. Despite the diminished basal synaptic transmission between ventral MHb and IPN VGLUT3 neurons, activation of GABAB receptors causes transient conversion of non-responding ventral MHb synapses into active synapses in some IPN VGLUT3 neurons. Thus, our results show strong ventral MHb connectivity to GABAergic IPN neurons compared to VGLUT3-expressing IPN neurons. Furthermore, GABAB receptor activation produces a differential effect on ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto PV, SST, and VGLUT3 neurons in the IPN.

">Selective attention network in naturalistic auditory scenes is object and scene specific</a></h4>

              
                Everyday auditory scenes often contain overlapping sound objects, requiring selective attention to isolate relevant objects from irrelevant background objects. This study examined how selective attention shapes neural representations of naturalistic sound scenes in the auditory cortex (AC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded brain activity from participants (n = 20) as they attended to a designated object in scenes comprising three overlapping sounds. Scenes were constructed in two manners: one where each object belonged to a different category (speech, animal, instrument) and another where all objects were from the same category. Attending to speech consistently enhanced activations in lateral AC subfields, while attention to animal and instrument sounds preferentially modulated medial subfields, supporting models where attention modulates feature-selective neural gain in AC. Remarkably, however, spatial pattern analysis revealed that the attended object dominated the AC activation patterns of the entire scene in a manner depending on both object type and scene composition: When the objects of the scene belonged to different categories, attended objects dominated fields processing higher-level category-specific features. In contrast, when all scene objects shared the same category, dominance shifted to fields processing low-level acoustic features. Thus, attention seems to dynamically prioritize the features offering maximal contrast within a given context, emphasizing object-specific patterns in feature-similar scenes and category-level patterns in feature-diverse scenes. Our results support models where top-down signals not only modulate gain but also affect several steps of auditory scene decomposition and analysis - influencing stream segregation and gating of higher-level processing in a contextual manner, adapting to specific auditory environments.

">Discovery of Isobavachin, a natural flavonoid, as an Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) structure corrector for Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by extensive neurodegeneration and consequent severe memory loss. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, with its pathological effects linked to structural instability and altered interactions with lipids and other important disease proteins including amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau ({tau}). Therefore, correcting and stabilizing the ApoE4 structure has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating its detrimental effects. In this study, we investigated naturally occurring bioavailable flavonoids as ApoE4 stabilizers, focusing on their potential to modulate ApoE4 structure and function. Comprehensive investigation of a focused database using our integrated computational and experimental screening protocol led to the identification of Isobavachin as a potential corrector and stabilizer of ApoE4 structure. In addition, a few other bioavailable flavonoids with similar stabilizing properties were identified, albeit to a much lesser extent as compared to Isobavachin. The findings support the therapeutic potential of flavonoids as ApoE4 modulators and highlight Isobavachin as a lead candidate for further preclinical evaluation. These results provide new insights into the pharmacological targeting of ApoE4 and open avenues for the development of flavonoid-based, ApoE-directed therapies for AD.

">Facilitation of Cav3.2 channel gating in pain pathways reveals a novel mechanism of serum-induced hyperalgesia</a></h4>

              
                The CaV3.2 isoform of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels plays a crucial role in regulating the excitability of nociceptive neurons; the endogenous molecules that modulate its activity, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we used serum proteomics and patch-clamp physiology to discover a novel peptide albumin (1-26) that facilitates channel gating by chelating trace metals that tonically inhibit CaV3.2 via H191 residue. Importantly, serum also potently modulated T-currents in human and rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In vivo pain studies revealed that injections of serum and albumin (1-26) peptide resulted in robust mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. This hypersensitivity was abolished with a T-channel inhibitor, in CaV3.2 null mice and in CaV3.2 H191Q knock-in mice. The discovery of endogenous chelators of trace metals in the serum deepens our understanding of the role of CaV3.2 channels in neuronal hyperexcitability and may facilitate the design of novel analgesics with unique mechanisms of action.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The p48 MW HPC is a novel low-profile flow diverter covered by a hydrophilic polymer coating with antithrombogenic properties, which may reduce ischemic complications and enable a single antiplatelet therapy after insertion of the stent. In this single-center experience, we describe the efficacy of this device, focusing on the illustration of different therapeutic indications and the outcome in various clinical settings with regard to vessel anatomy, bleeding state, and aneurysm configuration. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our database for all patients being treated with a p48 MW HPC flow diverter between February 2019 and July 2021. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated according to the O&amp;amp;rsquo;Kelly&amp;amp;ndash;Marotta (OKM) scale in the last digital subtraction angiography (DSA) follow-up. Information on complications and medications were collected from our medical records. In addition, to illustrate different indications and clinical settings, we present six of these cases in closer detail. Results: 18 aneurysms in 14 patients were treated with the p48 MW HPC flow diverter and in one case with an additional Derivo device. Periprocedural events occurred in 28.6% of the treated patients, which were all successfully resolved within the same session. Follow-up examination information was available for 67% of patients, of which 75% showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and 83.3% showed a favorable occlusion result (OKM C-D). Two patients with ruptured aneurysms received a single antiplatelet therapy with ASA without thrombotic complications, at least in the short term. New braid deformation patterns were observed in 16.6% at the follow-up examination, but none with subsequent clinical significance. Conclusions: The p48 MW HPC is safe and effective in the treatment of a wide spectrum of differently configurated, ruptured, and unruptured aneurysms. Single antiplatelet therapy might be an option in selected cases.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor deficits and non-motor symptoms, such as depression, which are associated with dopaminergic loss and &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein aggregation in the brain. Objectives: This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of a hydroalcoholic extract of the purple fruit of Eugenia uniflora (PFEU) on motor ability and depressive-like behaviors in a PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in female Wistar rats. Methods: Rats received intranasal administration of MPTP or vehicle, followed by 14 days of oral administration of PFEU (300 or 2000 mg/kg, administered once daily) or vehicle. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using the splash and forced swimming tests, while motor ability was evaluated using the rotarod and open field tests. On day 15, hippocampal tissue was collected for immunoreactivity analysis. Results: MPTP treatment induced depressive-like behavior, which was significantly reversed by PFEU, as evidenced by increased grooming and decreased immobility. No motor coordination or locomotion deficits were observed. Furthermore, PFEU treatment prevented the MPTP-induced increase in hippocampal &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein, p-p53, and Bax while restoring Bcl-2 levels, suggesting neuroprotective effects through the modulation of apoptotic pathways and &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein. Conclusions: These findings support PFEU&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as a neuroprotective agent for MPTP-induced depressive-like behavior in female rats, highlighting its molecular mechanisms.</p>

                Stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING1) is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. To enhance our understanding of STING1-associated disease, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Higher education is experiencing an increase in students with disabilities, necessitating considering their interests and well-being when preparing educational services. Students with disabilities make up one of the most significant minority groups among students in terms of diversity. Aims This study explored the experiences of students with disabilities at a university in the United Arab Emirates. It also aimed to understand students with disabilitiesâ social and academic experiences and the factors affecting their university persistence. Methods We used a descriptive qualitative research approach to understand how students with disabilities experience the phenomenon under study. Twenty-five students participated, chosen via purposeful sampling. The data was collected using semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed using content analysis. Results We found four themes that emerged from this study: (1) perceptions about the university, (2) socialization and integration, (3) barriers to the university journey, and (4) support for the journey. Conclusion We found that students with disabilities indicated positive and negative perspectives and experiences. We recommend modifying the physical, social, and educational environments to support the education of students with disabilities. Future studies should employ a more varied sample and include academics and students to collect different perspectives while stressing the studentsâ experiences.

                This policy brief examines the key factors influencing entrepreneurial success in Lebanon, focusing on gender dynamics, socio-cultural barriers, and systemic challenges. Entrepreneurship plays a critical role in Lebanonâs economic growth, innovation, and job creation, yet local entrepreneurs face significant obstacles. These challenges, including high operational costs, political instability, and gender-based discrimination, are compounded by limited access to resources such as funding, networks, and mentorship, particularly for women. The brief draws on data from the MENA Entrepreneurship and Labour Market Survey (MELMS) to provide insights into Lebanonâs entrepreneurial landscape. Based on the findings, this brief highlights the urgent need for targeted policy interventions aimed at enhancing the entrepreneurial ecosystem and addressing gender inequities. The recommendations include increasing awareness of support services, improving access to financial resources, fostering innovation through tech hubs and R&D incentives, and promoting a more inclusive entrepreneurial culture. To address gender-specific barriers, the brief proposes expanding training and mentorship programs tailored for women, along with targeted outreach efforts to bridge the gap in access to information. Strengthening Lebanonâs entrepreneurial ecosystem through public-private partnerships, international collaborations, and leveraging the Lebanese diaspora is also critical for driving economic resilience. The proposed recommendations call for the establishment of a National Entrepreneurship Strategy that integrates public institutions, NGOs, and private sector initiatives to foster sustainable growth. By creating a more supportive environment for entrepreneurs, Lebanon can unlock its entrepreneurial potential, driving long-term innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness. This brief aims to inform policymakers, donors, and stakeholders of strategic interventions that can contribute to Lebanonâs economic revitalisation.

                Background This study examines the Arabic semi-prepositional contronym /warÄâa/ in the Holy Quran, which conveys the dual meanings of âbehindâ and âin front of.â By employing cognitive linguistic frameworksâPrototype Theory, Image Schema Theory, Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and Frame Semanticsâthe research investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying the termâs semantic versatility. Methods An in-depth cognitive linguistic analysis was conducted, supported by collocational analysis to explore how /warÄâa/ is interpreted in diverse contexts. The study analyzed both prototypical spatial meanings and their metaphorical extensions, focusing on semantic priming and contextual interpretation. Results The findings reveal that the prototypical spatial meaning of /warÄâa/ (âbehindâ) dynamically extends to metaphorical and temporal contexts, encompassing ideas of concealment, control, deliberate ignorance, future anticipation, and other nuanced interpretations. The research highlights the role of semantic priming in shaping contextual meanings and offers actionable insights for translation accuracy in religious texts. Conclusions This study fills gaps in existing research by providing a detailed exploration of /warÄâa/âs semantic complexity. It bridges theoretical insights and practical applications, offering innovative strategies for linguistics and translation studies. Future research directions include cross-linguistic studies of contronyms, psycholinguistic experiments on contradictory meanings, and culturally-informed cognitive-semantic translation strategies. This work contributes significantly to Arabic linguistics and cognitive translation studies.

                Background Anti-viral therapy is not routinely recommended for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in patients who have persistently elevated serum HBV DNA level (>2000 IU/mL), normal alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and without significant liver fibrosis, defining the indeterminate phase. The objective of the study is to identify the factors associated with the progression of liver fibrosis in chronic HBV infected patients in the indeterminate phase. Methods This is cross-sectional study, conducted in Infectious Disease and Hepato-gastroenterology departments of Farhat Hached university hospital, between January 2008 and January 2022. We have included the Ag HBs (+) patients initially not treated, presenting at the time of the initial evaluation: a viral load> 2,000 IU/L for at least six months, normal ALAT (<40UI) and a fibrosis score F0 and/or F1 (in liverbiopsy or FibroScan). Univariate and logisticreg ression analysis were performed to identify the factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results In total, 97 patients were included, with a median age of 32.9Â± 9.1 years, and a female predominance (sex ratio M/F=0.64). Progression of fibrosis was observed in 16 patients (16.5%) with a mean delay of 70.9Â±41.1 months. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with progression of fibrosis were the presence of comorbidities (p=0.001), the high initial viral load (p=0.004), the appearance of cytolysis (p=0.001) and the increase in viral load (p=0.002), during follow-up. The AUROC of the initial viral load was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.500-0.820). An intial viral load at 8090 UI/l was associated with the progression of fibrosis with a sensibility of 70.3% and specificity of 63%. Conclusion Factors associated with progression of fibrosis in the indeterminate phase of chronic HBV infection were the presence of comorbidities, and changes of ALAT during follow-up. This leads us to consider extending the therapeutic indications to this group of patients.

Results Of 77 AP receiving education, there was significant (p < 0.001) improvement in the perceptions/practices towards temperature regulation (44.55 Â± 23.94 vs. 25.94 Â± 21.36), glucose homeostasis (46.27 Â± 18.83 vs. 18.60 Â± 17.50), maintaining asepsis (67.05 Â± 17.53 vs. 39.35 Â± 16.85), supporting airway (47.73 Â± 25.39), circulation (85.26 Â± 23.27 vs. 48.45 Â± 25.10), along with ambulance equipment availability/usage postintervention. Of 53 neonates studied post intervention, there was a significant reduction in hypothermia (17% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (16.9% vs. 38.7%, p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (71.7% vs. 46.8%, p=0.042), improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (69.8% vs. 29%, p <0.001), a reduction in growth from umbilical swabs (15.1% vs. 42%, p=0.002) and duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001). Conclusions After educational intervention there was significant improvement in the perceptions and practices of â108â ambulance personnel towards transporting neonates and a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay with improvement in maintenance of circulation and asepsis in neonates.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58Â±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (HR:12; 95% CI: (5.81-18.18); p:0.041) but AKI didnât appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age > 53 years (p: 0.018), septic shock complicating hospital acquired infection (p: 0.003) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

                Objective To compare iodine density (ID) and contrast-enhanced attenuation value (CEAV) from dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLSCT) scans of lymphomatous, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA), and normal cervical lymph nodes. Methods Data including ID and CEAV were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent DLSCT of the neck between January 2020 and August 2023. Results from each group (lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal) were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic curve. Results 129 cervical lymph nodes were collected from patients who met the inclusion criteria (50, 41, and 38 nodes from the lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal group, respectively). The mean ID of lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal nodes was 1.01Â±0.27, 1.36Â±0.28, and 1.45Â±0.29 mg/mL, respectively. Comparing lymphomatous nodes with metastatic SCCA nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.002) and CEAV (p<0.001). Similarly, when comparing lymphomatous nodes with normal nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.001) and CEAV (p<0.001). The optimal ID cut-off value for distinguishing between lymphomatous and metastatic SCCA nodes was 1.175 mg/ml (specificity of 84.2%, sensitivity 77.8%, AUC 0.788, P = 0.003). The optimal CEAV cut-off value was 77.5 HU (specificity 88.9%, sensitivity 78.9%, AUC 0.851, P<0.001). Conclusions The ID and CEAV measurements from DLSCT were significantly different between lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal lymph nodes. These findings indicate that DLSCT can be used to distinguish between these conditions in the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Synthetic dataâs utility in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Building on Nearing et al.âs study (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental 16S rRNA datasets in a case-control design, we are generating synthetic datasets that mimic the experimental data to verify their findings. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines, demonstrating how established reporting frameworks can support robust, transparent, and unbiased study planning. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.âs (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on a non-redundant subset of 46 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, try to validate previous findings with the most recent versions of the DA methods and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCAâs efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

                <p>by Shoutik Mukherjee, Behtash Babadi, Shihab Shamma</p>

Characterizing neuronal responses to natural stimuli remains a central goal in sensory neuroscience. In auditory cortical neurons, the stimulus selectivity of elicited spiking activity is summarized by a spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) that relates neuronal responses to the stimulus spectrogram. Though effective in characterizing primary auditory cortical responses, STRFs of non-primary auditory neurons can be quite intricate, reflecting their mixed selectivity. The complexity of non-primary STRFs hence impedes understanding how acoustic stimulus representations are transformed along the auditory pathway. Here, we focus on the relationship between ferret primary auditory cortex (A1) and a secondary region, dorsal posterior ectosylvian gyrus (PEG). We propose estimating receptive fields in PEG with respect to a well-established high-dimensional computational model of primary-cortical stimulus representations. These âcortical receptive fieldsâ (CortRF) are estimated greedily to identify the salient primary-cortical features modulating spiking responses and in turn related to corresponding spectrotemporal features. Hence, they provide biologically plausible hierarchical decompositions of STRFs in PEG. Such CortRF analysis was applied to PEG neuronal responses to speech and temporally orthogonal ripple combination (TORC) stimuli and, for comparison, to A1 neuronal responses. CortRFs of PEG neurons captured their selectivity to more complex spectrotemporal features than A1 neurons; moreover, CortRF models were more predictive of PEG (but not A1) responses to speech. Our results thus suggest that secondary-cortical stimulus representations can be computed as sparse combinations of primary-cortical features that facilitate encoding natural stimuli. Thus, by adding the primary-cortical representation, we can account for PEG single-unit responses to natural sounds better than bypassing it and considering as input the auditory spectrogram. These results confirm with explicit details the presumed hierarchical organization of the auditory cortex.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) after a long latent period in a fraction of infected individuals. These HTLV-1-infected cells typically have phenotypes similar to that of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, but the cell status is not well understood. To extract the inherent information of HTLV-1-infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, we integratively analyzed the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data of the infected cells. Compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from healthy donors, we found anomalous chromatin accessibility in HTLV-1infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells derived from ATL cases in terms of location and sample-to-sample fluctuations in open chromatin regions. Further, by focusing on systematically selected genes near the open chromatin regions, we quantified the difference between the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in ATL cases and healthy CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in terms of the correlation between the chromatin structures and the gene expressions. Based on a further analysis of chromatin accessibility, we detected <i>TLL1</i> (Tolloid Like 1) as one of the key genes that exhibit unique gene expressions in ATL cases. A luciferase assay indicated that TLL1 has an isoform-dependent regulatory effect on TGF-<i>Î²</i>. Overall, this study provides results about the status of HTLV-1-infected cells, which are qualitatively consistent across the different scales of chromatin accessibility, transcription, and immunophenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1066/v2?src=rss">Role, function, and expectations of research funding committees: Perspectives from committee members [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee membersâ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Aim This quantitative study aimed to develop and evaluate instruments to measure responsible tourism behavior with high academic standards. Methods Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were employed to test the modelâs fit with the empirical data. The sample consists of 550 Generation Y tourists selected through multistage quota random sampling. The instruments were created by the researchers to consist of 45 items, each rated on a 6-point scale. Results The analysis results supported all three hypotheses, with the instruments showing an average reliability of .812. The EFA results indicated that 12 items met the criteria, derived from three main components: environmental (four items), social and cultural (four items), and economic (four items). These components explain 62.118% of the variance in responsible tourism behavior. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis results show that the model fits the empirical data well, with indices meeting the standard criteria: Ï2 = 52.790, df = 45, p-value = .198, RMSEA = .034, CFI = .979, TLI = .969, SRMA = .054. Conclusioin In conclusion, the researchers suggest using responsible tourism behavior measurement instruments experimentally to create social indices or to further study causal factors and effects.

                Background The search for efficient treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has highlighted the potential of plant-based therapeutic compounds and eco-friendly processes for producing selenium nanoparticles. This study investigates the antidiabetic potential of Moringa oleifera-mediated biogenic selenium nanoparticles (MO-SeNPs) in diabetic rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with diabetes via a high-fat diet for 2 weeks followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 45 mg/kg body weight (BW). The rats were divided into five groups: normal, diabetic control, metformin at 100 mg/kg/BW, and two groups treated with oral administration of MO-SeNPs at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight for 28 days. Food and water intake as well as fasting blood glucose and body weight were measured weekly. After the treatment period, rats were sacrificed, and blood and liver samples were harvested for further analysis. Results MO-SeNPs treatment significantly reduced blood glucose levels (p < 0.05) and restored insulin resistance, with lower dose demonstrating better glycaemic control than larger dose. MO-SeNPs also increased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activity, including GSH-Px, CAT, and T-SOD, which neutralise oxidative stress. MO-SeNPs also improves cardiovascular health by raising HDL and lowering LDL. MO-SeNPs showed hepatoprotective benefits by lowering inflammatory markers such TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², iNOS, and AGEs, and reduced lipid peroxidation. Diabetes raises inflammatory indicators, causing liver damage and other problems. The reduction in these indicators shows MO-SeNPs reduce liver inflammation and protect the liver. The normalisation of liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP) showed improved liver function. Conclusions The findings suggest that the green synthesis of SeNPs using Moringa oleifera offers a viable alternative for diabetes treatment, highlighting its potential to enhance glycemic control and improve overall metabolic health.

                One of the most common benign lesions is dentigerous cyst, which is commonly associated with unerupted tooth crowns. Dentigerous cysts in infants may manifest as swelling or a firm mass in the oral cavity. Such cysts arise from dental follicles, and their development can lead to dental complications such as tooth displacement, root resorption of the adjacent teeth, or infection if not treated carefully. Enucleation is the method of choice for the treatment of such lesions. In the current case report, a rare age presented with 1 a old patient was referred to oral and maxillofacial clinics. In the case of right facial swelling and pain for five days ago, intra- and extra-oral examinations were performed. Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a well-defined expansile lytic lesion, and parents consented and agreed to proceed with the surgery option. Enucleation was performed surgically, and the patient was followed up for up to 8 months. Significant improvement was noted, with no further complications or recorded complaints.

                Huntingtin encodes a 3144 amino acid protein, with a polyglutamine repeat tract at the N-terminus. Expansion of this repeat tract above a pathogenic threshold of 36 repeats is the causative mutation of Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. Here we have characterized twenty Huntingtin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The major component of patchouli oil, patchouli alcohol, is used as fixative and has antimicrobial activity. The function of other components, such as Î±-guaiene, remains unknown. Therefore, this study reports the antifungal activity of Î±-guaiene isolated from patchouli oil against for pathogenic fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans ATCC 7102, Microsporum gypseum ATCC 14683, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ATCC 16404. Methods The material from fraction (249Â°C-254Â°C) had the highest Î±-guaiene. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution technique to evaluate antifungal activity, with n-hexane and medium serving as negative controls, and ketoconazole and fluconazole serving as positive controls. Results The results showed that the MIC value was determined at 45%, 50% for C. albicans, 55%, 60% for A. niger, 50%, 60% for M. gypseum, and 95%, 100% for T. mentagrophytes, respectively. Positive and medium controls demonstrated no microbial growth, whereas negative and growth controls revealed the presence of microorganisms. Fungus resistance to Î±-guaiene T. mentagrophytes exhibited the highest MIC value. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that Î±-guaiene is a promising agent effective against the studied pathogenic fungi.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword âliquefactionâ emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concurrent illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs and classified based on the severity from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 Â± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Based on the severity, most pDDIs belong to the âmoderateâ category (40.07%). Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of âmoderateâ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in identifying and preventing DDIs early, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

<p>A general summary of the experimental design and results of the present experiments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence suggests that hippocampal (HPC) disruption following learning produces retrograde amnesia on a range of tasks. Many of these tasks do not require HPC function in the anterograde direction suggesting that, in the intact brain, the HPC is actively involved during all forms of learning. However, prior work has also demonstrated double dissociations of HPC and amygdala function, which is inconsistent with this view. Here, we aim to understand this discrepancy by assessing the effects of neurotoxic lesions of the HPC on anterograde and retrograde amnesia for conditioned place preference (CPP). This task is dependent on a network centered on the basolateral amygdala and not the HPC. The results show that extensive HPC damage had no impact on the acquisition or expression of CPP. One explanation for this result is that the task requires multiple, distributed training sessions for conditioning to emerge, and it has been proposed that this parameter may eliminate the need for HPC to support memory. To test this, we completed experiments to probe place learning in the Morris water task, which is thought to always require HPC function, but implemented an over-training procedure before HPC damage. We found that rats were severely impaired suggesting that this task parameter does not always allow non-HPC networks to support learning. Finally, an experiment was designed to test whether memories acquired by distinct memory networks on the same days, within hours of one another, would be linked in HPC. The results showed that they remained independent of one another.</p>

                LicÃ³n-MuÃ±oz etÂ al. built a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing-based microenvironment landscape of the tumor mass and the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) of 15 patients with GBM. They identify a mesenchymal signature and tumor-supportive microglia that establish cell-to-cell interactions with tumor cells in the SVZ through IL-1Î²/IL-1RAcP and Wnt-5a/Frizzled-3, representing potential targets for GBM treatment.

                CD4 TÂ cell priming by dendritic cells is defective in the tumor-draining lymph node. Bandola-Simon etÂ al. show that cDC2s in the tumor-draining lymph node retain large amounts of the CLIP âplaceholderâ peptide in the MHC-II peptide binding groove, thereby diminishing their ability to present antigens and impairing anti-tumor responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99798">Opposing roles for Bmp signalling during the development of electrosensory lateral line organs</a></h4>

              
                The lateral line system enables fishes and aquatic-stage amphibians to detect local water movement via mechanosensory hair cells in neuromasts, and many species to detect weak electric fields via electroreceptors (modified hair cells) in ampullary organs. Both neuromasts and ampullary organs develop from lateral line placodes, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning ampullary organ formation are understudied relative to neuromasts. This is because the ancestral lineages of zebrafish (teleosts) and <i>Xenopus</i> (frogs) independently lost electroreception. We identified <i>Bmp5</i> as a promising candidate via differential RNA-seq in an electroreceptive ray-finned fish, the Mississippi paddlefish (<i>Polyodon spathula</i>; Modrell et al., 2017, <i>eLife</i> 6: e24197). In an experimentally tractable relative, the sterlet sturgeon (<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>), we found that <i>Bmp5</i> and four other Bmp pathway genes are expressed in the developing lateral line, and that Bmp signalling is active. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis targeting <i>Bmp5</i> in G0-injected sterlet embryos resulted in fewer ampullary organs. Conversely, when Bmp signalling was inhibited by DMH1 treatment shortly before the formation of ampullary organ primordia, supernumerary ampullary organs developed. These data suggest that Bmp5 promotes ampullary organ development, whereas Bmp signalling via another ligand(s) prevents their overproduction. Taken together, this demonstrates opposing roles for Bmp signalling during ampullary organ formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96743">The co-receptor Tetraspanin12 directly captures Norrin to promote ligand-specific Î²-catenin signaling</a></h4>

              
                Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling directs animal development and tissue renewal in a tightly controlled, cell- and tissue-specific manner. In the mammalian central nervous system, the atypical ligand Norrin controls angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and blood-retina barrier through the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Like Wnt, Norrin activates signaling by binding and heterodimerizing the receptors Frizzled (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), leading to membrane recruitment of the intracellular transducer Dishevelled (Dvl) and ultimately stabilizing the transcriptional coactivator Î²-catenin. Unlike Wnt, the cystine knot ligand Norrin only signals through Fzd4 and additionally requires the co-receptor Tetraspanin12 (Tspan12); however, the mechanism underlying Tspan12-mediated signal enhancement is unclear. It has been proposed that Tspan12 integrates into the Norrin-Fzd4 complex to enhance Norrin-Fzd4 affinity or otherwise allosterically modulate Fzd4 signaling. Here, we measure direct, high-affinity binding between purified Norrin and Tspan12 in a lipid environment and use AlphaFold models to interrogate this interaction interface. We find that Tspan12 and Fzd4 can simultaneously bind Norrin and that a pre-formed Tspan12/Fzd4 heterodimer, as well as cells co-expressing Tspan12 and Fzd4, more efficiently capture low concentrations of Norrin than Fzd4 alone. We also show that Tspan12 competes with both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LRP6 for Norrin binding and that Tspan12 does not impact Fzd4-Dvl affinity in the presence or absence of Norrin. Our findings suggest that Tspan12 does not allosterically enhance Fzd4 binding to Norrin or Dvl, but instead functions to directly capture Norrin upstream of signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100427">Magnesium modulates phospholipid metabolism to promote bacterial phenotypic resistance to antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Non-inheritable antibiotic or phenotypic resistance ensures bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment. However, exogenous factors promoting phenotypic resistance are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> are recalcitrant to killing by a broad spectrum of antibiotics under high magnesium. Functional metabolomics demonstrated that magnesium modulates fatty acid biosynthesis by increasing saturated fatty acid biosynthesis while decreasing unsaturated fatty acid production. Exogenous supplementation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids increased and decreased bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, respectively, confirming the role of fatty acids in antibiotic resistance. Functional lipidomics revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism is the major metabolic pathway remodeled by magnesium, where phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is reduced and phosphatidylglycerol production is increased. This process alters membrane composition, increasing membrane polarization, and decreasing permeability and fluidity, thereby reducing antibiotic uptake by <i>V. alginolyticus</i>. These findings suggest the presence of a previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism by which bacteria escape antibiotic killing through the use of an environmental factor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97017">The nanoscale organization of the Nipah virus fusion protein informs new membrane fusion mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Paramyxovirus membrane fusion requires an attachment protein for receptor binding and a fusion protein for membrane fusion triggering. Nipah virus (NiV) attachment protein (G) binds to ephrinB2 or -B3 receptors, and fusion protein (F) mediates membrane fusion. NiV-F is a class I fusion protein and is activated by endosomal cleavage. The crystal structure of a soluble GCN4-decorated NiV-F shows a hexamer-of-trimer assembly. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify the NiV-F distribution and organization on cell and virus-like particle membranes at a nanometer precision. We found that NiV-F on biological membranes forms distinctive clusters that are independent of endosomal cleavage or expression levels. The sequestration of NiV-F into dense clusters favors membrane fusion triggering. The nano-distribution and organization of NiV-F are susceptible to mutations at the hexamer-of-trimer interface, and the putative oligomerization motif on the transmembrane domain. We also show that NiV-F nanoclusters are maintained by NiV-FâAP-2 interactions and the clathrin coat assembly. We propose that the organization of NiV-F into nanoclusters facilitates membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F molecules with varied degrees of cleavage and opportunities for interacting with the NiV-G/receptor complex. These observations provide insights into the in situ organization and activation mechanisms of the NiV fusion machinery.

">Independent regulation of memory and emotion by selective retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Selective retrieval of a target memory often triggers inhibitory control to reduce competition from related traces, a process that induces forgetting of the competing content. It is unknown, however, whether inhibition during selective retrieval specifically targets a competitor's episodic representation or instead extends to its affective components. Here we report evidence in humans that selective retrieval of a neutral memory not only diminishes access to the mnemonic content of unpleasant competing memories, but also alters their emotional character. Memory and emotion suppression effects were accompanied by reduced neural activation and weakened representational patterns unique to competing memories in the VTC and amygdala respectively, in an independent fashion. Selective retrieval engaged the left VLPFC, which decreased in activity over repeated retrievals of the same memory, as competition from the unpleasant scene was resolved. This left VLPFC region colocalizes with key prefrontal regions engaged during cognitive reappraisal, suggesting that selective retrieval's impact on affective responses may contribute to reappraisal's benefits. These findings indicate that inhibitory control during selective retrieval affects both mnemonic and affective representations, providing a novel mechanistic basis for a well-known emotion regulation practice.

">Declarative Memory Through the Lens of Single-Trial Peaks in High-Frequency Power</a></h4>

              
                Declarative memory depends on the coordination of local processing, indexed by high-frequency broadband (HFB) activity, with global network organization, indexed by theta oscillations. However, theta and HFB exhibit asynchronous timing, raising the question of how results of local processing are communicated throughout the network. Using intracranial EEG in patients performing a recognition memory task, we examined this coordination across the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). HFB peak activity was earlier in the MTL than PFC. Anchoring analyses of theta phase clustering and connectivity to HFB peaks revealed strong phase clustering locked to HFB peaks in the PFC, as well as connectivity between the PFC and MTL that predicted individual memory performance. Graph analysis revealed specific connections amidst sparse network connectivity during memory success. This study demonstrates that transient brain states linked to internal physiological events support memory and refines our understanding of local and network-level process interactions.

                Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) holds promise to treat neurological disorders, but its efficacy is limited by poor spatial focality and depth of penetration. Here, we examined the potential utility of Intersectional Short-Pulse (ISP) stimulation of deeper brain penetration. Using computational modeling and in vivo patch-clamp recordings in rats, we demonstrate that neurons integrate ISP-induced electric fields in a non-vectorial manner. This mechanism allows ISP to overcome some limits of conventional TES, achieving spatially limited stimulation across cortical and subcortical structures. In a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy, closed-loop ISP stimulation significantly outperformed conventional TES in reducing seizure duration and severity. ISP reduced hippocampal seizure duration by 49% and 41% compared to sham stimulation and conventional TES and significantly reduced motor seizure severity. Our findings demonstrate that ISP stimulation can rapidly terminate hippocampal seizures, offering a potential new approach for non-invasive neuromodulation with applications across diverse neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

">Real-time fMRI neurofeedback reduces default mode network and auditory cortex functional connectivity in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Auditory verbal hallucinations (AHs) are a cardinal symptom of schizophrenia that can cause distress but are not always responsive to antipsychotic medications. There is a critical need to develop novel interventions that target neural mechanisms underlying AHs. We developed a real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NFB) paradigm for AHs that aims at modulating default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders who were experiencing AHs (N = 25) attempted to decrease brain activation while listening to sentences recorded in another person's voice and increase brain activation while listening to sentences recorded in their own voice. Participants randomly assigned to the real group (n = 12) received neurofeedback based on signals from their auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and those assigned to the sham group (n = 13) received neurofeedback based on motor cortex signals. Analyzing resting state fMRI data collected pre- and post-NFB, we found that: (1) at baseline, stronger within-DMN connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex was associated with higher AHs severity; (2) after NFB, participants in the real group, compared to those in the sham group, showed greater reduction in functional connectivity between the MPFC and auditory cortices in the STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Notably, the reduction in MPFC-STG/MTG connectivity was found in all participants in the real group. These findings suggest that NFB can effectively and non-invasively modulate functional connectivity in regions associated with AHs in psychosis.

">Sex-specific Associations of Gene Expression with Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Ante-mortem Cognitive Performance</a></h4>

              
                The biological mechanisms underlying women's increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence remain undefined. Previous case/control studies have identified sex-biased molecular pathways, but sex-specific relationships between gene expression and AD endophenotypes, particularly sex chromosomes, are underexplored. With bulk transcriptomic data across 3 brain regions from 767 decedents, we investigated sex-specific associations between gene expression and post-mortem {beta}-amyloid and tau as well as antemortem longitudinal cognition. Of 23,118 significant gene associations, 10% were significant in one sex and not the other (sex-specific). Most sex-specific gene associations were identified in females (73%) and associated with tau tangles and longitudinal cognition (90%). Four X-linked genes, MCF2, HDAC8, FTX, and SLC10A3, demonstrated significant sex differences in their associations with AD endophenotypes (i.e., significant sex x gene interaction). Our results also uncovered sex-specific biological pathways, including a female-specific role of neuroinflammation and neuronal development, reinforcing the potential for sex-aware analyses to enhance precision medicine approaches in AD.

">State-dependent modulation of spiny projection neurons controls levodopa-induced dyskinesia in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                In the later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), patients often manifest levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), compromising their quality of life. The pathophysiology underlying LID is poorly understood, and treatment options are limited. To move toward filling this treatment gap, the intrinsic and synaptic changes in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) triggered by the sustained elevation of dopamine (DA) during dyskinesia were characterized using electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular and behavioral approaches. Our studies revealed that the intrinsic excitability and functional corticostriatal connectivity of SPNs in dyskinetic mice oscillate between the on- and off-states of LID in a cell- and state-specific manner. Although triggered by levodopa, these rapid oscillations in SPN properties depended on both dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling. In a mouse PD model, disrupting M1 muscarinic receptor signaling specifically in iSPNs or deleting its downstream signaling partner CalDAG-GEFI blunted the levodopa-induced oscillation in functional connectivity, enhanced the beneficial effects of levodopa and attenuated LID severity.

">Brief disruption of the microbiome has age-dependent effects on morphine reward and gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex of adolescent and adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period for the initiation of problematic drug use, which significantly increases the risk of developing substance use disorders later in life. This heightened vulnerability is partly attributed to the immaturity of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region both essential for decision-making and implicated in drug reward. During adolescence, peripheral systems, such as the gut microbiome, also undergo substantial changes. Emerging evidence suggests that disruptions to the gut microbiome can influence gene expression and drug reward behaviors in rodent models. In this study, we investigated the effects of microbiome disruption on morphine reward and prefrontal cortical gene expression in adolescent and adult mice. Using oral antibiotics to transiently disrupt the microbiome, we found that short-term antibiotic exposure reduced morphine place preference specifically in adolescent mice. In a separate cohort, we observed that antibiotic treatment altered the transcriptomic response to morphine in the medial prefrontal cortex across all age groups. Notably, the transcriptomic changes induced by antibiotics and morphine were age-specific, with distinct gene expression patterns observed in adolescents compared to adults. These findings establish a foundation for future research into the role of the gut microbiome in opioid reward and highlight potential gene pathways underlying age-dependent differences in opioid sensitivity.

">Brain-Guided Convolutional Neural Networks Reveal Task-Specific Representations in Scene Processing</a></h4>

              
                Scene categorization is the dominant proxy for visual understanding, yet humans can perform a large number of visual tasks within any scene. Consequently, we know little about how different tasks change how the scene is processed, represented, and its features ultimately used. Here, we developed a novel brain-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) where each convolutional layer was separately guided by neural responses taken at different time points while observers performed two different tasks on the same set of images. We then reconstructed each layer's activation maps via deconvolution to spatially assess how different features were used as a function of task. The brain-guided CNN made use of image features that human observers identified as being crucial to complete each task starting around 244 ms and persisted to 402 ms. Critically, because the same images were used across the two tasks, the CNN could only succeed if the neural data captured task-relevant differences. Our analyses of the activation maps across layers revealed that the brain's spatiotemporal representation of local image features evolves systematically over time. This underscores how distinct image features emerge at different stages of processing, shaped by the observer's goals and behavioral context.

">Enhanced CB1 receptor function in GABAergic neurons mediates hyperexcitability and impaired sensory-driven synchrony of cortical circuits in Fragile X Syndrome model mice</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO) display cortical hyperexcitability at rest, as well as deficits in sensory-driven cortical network synchrony. A form of circuit hyperexcitability is observed in ex vivo cortical slices of Fmr1 KO mice as prolonged persistent activity, or Up, states. It is unknown if the circuit mechanisms that cause prolonged Up states contribute to FXS-relevant EEG phenotypes. Here we examined the role of endocannabinoids (eCB) in prolonged Up states in slices and resting and sensory-driven EEG phenotypes in awake Fmr1 KO mice. Bidirectional changes in eCB function are reported in the Fmr1 KO that depend on synapse type (excitatory or inhibitory). We demonstrate that pharmacological or genetic reduction of Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1R) in GABAergic neurons rescues prolonged cortical Up states and deficits in sensory-driven cortical synchrony in Fmr1 KO mice. In support of these findings, recordings from Fmr1 KO cortical Layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons revealed enhanced CB1R-mediated suppression of inhibitory synaptic currents. In contrast, genetic reduction of Cnr1 in glutamatergic neurons did not affect Up state duration, but deletion of Fmr1 in the same neurons was sufficient to cause long Up states. These findings support a model where loss of Fmr1 in glutamatergic neurons leads to enhanced CB1R-mediated suppression of GABAergic synaptic transmission, prolonged cortical circuit activation and reduced sensory-driven circuit synchronization. Results suggest that antagonism of CB1Rs as a therapeutic strategy to correct sensory processing deficits in FXS.

">Decreased auditory cortical activations and altered long-range alpha-band connectivity characterize passive auditory spatial attention in ASD</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication and sensory processing. The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite some prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed decreased cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed increased alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals.

                Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

">Visual experience contributes to separation of face and language responses in the ventral stream</a></h4>

              
                Human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC) contains specialized regions that support visual recognition of behaviorally relevant categories, including faces, written language and places. An open question is how experience interacts with innate constraints to enable functional specialization. We investigate this question by comparing vOTC function across sighted and congenitally blind adults. In sighted adults, a region in lateral vOTC called the fusiform face area (FFA) responds preferentially to faces, whereas distinct left-lateralized portions of vOTC respond to written language. In blind people, lateral vOTC responds to face touching, braille and speech, but their functional co-localization has not been tested. The same group of congenitally blind adults (n=20) touched faces and spatial layouts (Experiment 1) and performed a reading (braille) and spoken language task (Experiment 2). Sighted adults performed analogous tasks in the visual modality (n=28). Using within subject analyses, we replicate the separation of faces and written language in sighted adults: written language responses are found only in left vOTC and within that hemisphere they are separate from faces. By contrast, left and right vOTC responds to language in people born blind and in the left hemisphere face and language responses overlap. These findings suggest that visual experience contributes to segregating responses to face and language in vOTC. Co-localization of face and language responses suggests an innate predisposition for communication-relevant processing in lateral vOTC.

                The nonlinear intramolecular dynamics of fluorescent indicators of neural activity can distort the accurate estimate of action potential (spike) times. In order to develop a more accurate spike inference algorithm we characterized the kinetic responses to different calcium concentrations of three popular calcium indicators (GCaMP6f, jGCaMP7f, and jGCaMP8f) using in vitro stopped-flow and brain slice recordings. jGCaMP8f showed a use-dependent slowing of fluorescence responses that caused existing inference methods to generate numerous false positives. From these data we developed multistate models of GcaMPs and used them to create a Bayesian Sequential Monte Carlo (BiophysSMC) and machine learning (BiophysML) inference methods that largely reduced false positives and improved the spike time accuracy from publicly available ground-truth data. The BiophysSMC method detected individual spikes with an average uncertainty of 6 milliseconds, a 6-fold improvement over previous methods. Our framework highlights the advantages of physical model-based approaches over model-free algorithms.

">The Drosophila EGF domain protein Uninflatable sets the switch between wrapping glia growth and axon wrapping instructed by Notch</a></h4>

              
                In the peripheral nervous system, sensory and motor axons are generally covered by wrapping glial cell processes. This neuron-glia interaction requires an intricate coordination of glial growth and differentiation. How this is controlled molecularly is largely unknown. At the example of Drosophila larval nerves, we show that glial growth is initially triggered by the FGF-receptor tyrosine kinase Heartless (Htl). In a screen for genes acting downstream of activated FGF-receptor, we identified the large membrane protein Uninflatable (Uif), which supports the formation of plasma membrane domains but not axon wrapping. Uif is also known to inhibit Notch. Surprisingly, we find that Notch signaling is required in postmitotic wrapping glia. While compromised Notch signaling results in a reduced wrapping efficiency, gain of Notch activity in wrapping glial cells leads to a hyperwrapping phenotype. Thus, Notch signaling is both necessary and sufficient for glial wrapping in Drosophila larvae. In addition, Notch suppresses both uif and htl function and thus stabilizes the switch between growth and differentiation. Given the general conservation of signaling mechanisms controlling glia development in mice and flies, similar mechanisms may act in the mammalian nervous system to control final glial differentiation.

">Using green space virtual reality to prevent stress-induced working memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to green space is associated with both physical and mental health benefits, including the potential to buffer acute stress responses, positioning it as a promising non-pharmacological approach to protect cognitive functions against stress. However, urban residents often face significant barriers in accessing green spaces, which are not equitably distributed. Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers a potential solution by simulating green space that could be made accessible to a broader demographic. Here, we explored whether VR-stimulated green space could dampen biological stress responses (i.e., heart rate and cortical response) and prevent stress-induced working memory (WM) impairment. Healthy young participants underwent acute stress induction followed by 15 minutes of VR-based green space (N=36) or control empty space (N=30) intervention. Although we observed the expected stress-induced increase in heart rates and elevated cortisol levels under stress, VR green space exposure failed to temper cortisol responses compared to the control VR space. Further, VR green space exposure did not bring benefits to protect working memory performance under stress across three WM tasks. Applying a Bayesian analysis approach throughout enabled us to find substantial evidence for the absence of an effect of VR-based green space exposure on biological markers of acute stress responses and working memory performance. Our findings suggest that VR-generated green space may not effectively replicate the stress-buffering effects of actual green space exposure. We discussed the implications of our findings regarding the potential and limitations of using VR or green space exposure to buffer stress responses.

">The mechanosensory DEG/ENaC channel DEGT-1 is a proprioceptor of C. elegans foregut movement</a></h4>

              
                The gastrointestinal tract is subjected to extensive mechanosensory stimulation during food ingestion. However, the identities of mechanosensory receptors in the enteric nervous system are largely unknown. The pharynx of C. elegans is a structurally and functionally homologous model of the vertebrate foregut, but is comprised of only 20 neurons that are embedded within the muscles and epithelial cells of the organ. Here we report that the DEG/ENaC family ion channel DEGT-1 is a proprioceptor of pharynx movement. DEGT-1 protein is expressed in 4 pharyngeal neurons (MI, M3, I4, and M5) and localized to their neuronal soma in direct contact with the collagenous pharyngeal basement membrane. degt-1 mutants display abnormally rapid feeding in the presence of food, causing global changes in lipid accumulation. degt-1 mutants also pump rapidly when pumping is induced by the presence of serotonin alone, suggesting that DEGT-1 is required for proprioception of pharyngeal pumping itself, rather than sensing ingested food. DEGT-1 is required in only two pharyngeal neurons (I4 and M5) to control pumping rate. Taken together, these results suggest that DEGT-1 modulates pharyngeal pumping rate by relaying proprioceptive feedback generated by the shear force of the pharynx against its own basement membrane. Thus, mechanosensors in enteric nervous systems modulate organ function not only by detecting forces from ingested contents, but also the movements of the organ itself.

">Perturbing whole-brain models of brain hierarchy: an application for depression following pharmacological treatment</a></h4>

              
                Neural representation can extend beyond localised activity to encompass global patterns, where information is distributed across brain networks in a hierarchical manner. Recent research suggests that the hierarchy of causal influences shaping these patterns can serve as a signature of distinct brain states, with implications for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we first delve into how whole-brain models, guided by the Thermodynamics of Mind framework, can estimate the brain hierarchy of specific brain states, and how perturbations of such models can study the in-silico transitions to other states represented by static functional connectivity. We then show an application for major depressive disorder, where different brain hierarchical reconfigurations have been found following psilocybin and escitalopram treatments. We build whole-brain models of depressed patients before and after psilocybin and escitalopram interventions, and we carry a dynamic sensitivity analysis to explore the susceptibility of brain states and their drivability to healthier states. We show that susceptibility is on average reduced by escitalopram and increased by psilocybin, and that both treatments succeed in promoting healthier transitions. These results align with the post-treatment window of plasticity opened by serotonergic psychedelics, as well as with the similar clinical efficacy of both drugs observed in clinical trials.

">Assessing the role of BNST GABA neurons in backward conditioned suppression</a></h4>

              
                Conditioned suppression is a useful paradigm for measuring learned avoidance. In most conditioned suppression studies, forward conditioning is used where a cue predicts an aversive stimulus. However, backward conditioning, in which an aversive stimulus predicts a cue, provides unique insights into learned avoidance due to its influence on both conditioned excitation and inhibition. We trained mice to consume sucrose in context A, associated an aversive stimulus in context B to few or many forward or backwards paired cues (CS+), and then tested for conditioned suppression in context A in response to the CS+. We found that few or many forward CS+ and few backward CS+ produced conditioned suppression, but many backwards cues did not. Administration of diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, prevented conditioned suppression to the backward CS+ but not to the forward CS+. Furthermore, freezing behavior was observed in response to the forward CS+ but not the backward CS+, and diazepam had no effect on freezing or locomotion. We next examined BNST GABA neurons for potential sensitivity to backwards cues and conditioned suppression. VGaT BNST signaling increased in response to sucrose licks during the backward CS+ but not to licks outside the CS+ and not to the backward CS+ onset or offset. Using designer receptors, we found that BNST VGaT neuron activation, but not its inhibition, prevented backward conditioned suppression expression. We conclude that backward conditioned suppression is dependent on both positive allosteric modulation of GABA on GABA-A receptors by diazepam and BNST GABA neurons.

">The role of STN beta oscillations on lower extremity muscle activity in Parkinsonian stepping</a></h4>

              
                Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) often resulting in disabling falls and loss of independence. It affects half of patients, yet current therapeutic strategies are insufficient, and the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigated beta oscillation dynamics in the STN during different locomotor states, while examining the effects of levodopa. In particular, it aimed to identify pathological activity by analysing the relationship between the STN and lower limb muscles during stepping. Local field potentials (LFP) in the STN and muscle activity (EMG) of the gastrocnemius and peroneus longus were recorded in 14 PD patients during standing and stepping, ON and OFF levodopa. Levodopa reduced stepping variability, implying improved stepping abilities. Distinct STN beta patterns were observed between stepping and standing, with lower high-beta and higher low-beta during stepping compared to standing, suggesting a distinct role of these frequency bands in motor control during postural and movement states. Levodopa reduced low-beta but increased high-beta activity, highlighting a potential physiological function of high-beta in the STN during standing and stepping. In addition, step-phase specific effects of levodopa included reduced broad-beta band activity in the STN and lower limb muscles during the late-stance and pushing-off phase of the contralateral leg when ON medication. Further analyses suggest that pathological STN activity amplifies muscle activation around movement initiation, potentially reducing the ability of the patient to move freely. These findings offer insight for developing phase-specific stimulation strategies targeting STN beta oscillations during gait.

">AA147 Alleviates Symptoms in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis by Reducing Oligodendrocyte Loss</a></h4>

              
                Inflammation induced oligodendrocyte death and CNS demyelination, are key features of multiple sclerosis (MS). Inflammation-triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress promote tissue damage in MS and in its preclinical animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Compound AA147 is a potent activator of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that can also induce antioxidant signaling through activation of the NRF2 pathway in neuronal cells. Previous work showed that AA147 protects multiple tissues against ischemia/reperfusion damage through ATF6 and/or NRF2 activation; however, its therapeutic potential in neuroinflammatory disorders remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that AA147 ameliorated the clinical symptoms of EAE and reduced ER stress, oligodendrocyte loss, and demyelination. Additionally, AA147 suppressed T cells in the CNS without altering the peripheral immune response. Importantly, AA147 significantly increased the expressions of Grp78, an ATF6 target gene, in oligodendrocytes, while enhancing levels of Grp78 as well as Ho-1, an NRF2 target gene, in microglia. In cultured oligodendrocytes, AA147 promoted nuclear translocation of ATF6, but not NRF2. Intriguingly, AA147 altered the microglia activation profile, possibly by triggering the NRF2 pathway. AA147 was not therapeutically beneficial during the acute EAE stage in mice lacking ATF6 in oligodendrocytes, indicating that protection primarily involves ATF6 activation in these cells. Overall, our results suggest AA147 as a potential therapeutic opportunity for MS by promoting oligodendrocyte survival and regulating microglia status through distinct mechanisms.

">Neural circuits between nodose ganglion and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells regulate lung inflammatory responses</a></h4>

              
                The lungs are organs exposed to the external environment, and the air we inhale contains various pathogens, such as endotoxins. The vagus nerve, which innervates the lungs, may play a role in detecting pathogens that invade the lungs. Through transcriptome analysis, tissue clearance imaging, electrical excitability recording, and gene- and cell-specific knockout experiments, we found that vagus nerve endings innervate pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs). These nerve endings sense bacterial endotoxins via pain receptors (TRPA1) rather than toll-like receptors (TLR4), eliciting electrical excitation and enhancing the production of neuropeptides (CGRP) in the nodose ganglia. In turn, CGRP released by sensory neurons from the nodose ganglia promotes both neuropeptide production and the proliferation of PNECs, thereby amplifying endotoxin-induced lung inflammatory responses. This reveals that the neural circuits between the nodose ganglion and PNECs play a critical role in regulating lung inflammatory responses.

                CLN5 disease, a form of juvenile dementia within the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), is associated with mutations in the CLN5 gene encoding the lysosomal bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) synthase, essential for BMP production and lysosomal function. Limited knowledge of cellular mechanisms and unclear drug targets hinder translating this to children's treatment, which remains symptomatic. We developed and characterized a new cln5 knock-out zebrafish model that replicates key features and molecular signatures of the human disease. Loss of Cln5 function in vivo altered axonal growth of retinal ON-bipolar cells revealing new disease features. Additionally, multi-omic analyzes at different developmental stages, revealed an impaired glucose metabolism as an original finding in NCL. This work demonstrates the profound metabolic impact of CLN5 dysfunction, offering a promising avenue toward targeted therapies for juvenile dementia.

                Bayesian models, in which priors are used to optimally compensate for sensory uncertainty, have had wide-ranging success in explaining behavior across sensorimotor contexts. We recently reported, however, that humans and monkeys use a combination of Bayesian and non-Bayesian strategies when making categorical judgments of visual stability across saccades. While they used priors to compensate for internal, movement-driven sensory uncertainty, consistent with Bayesian predictions, they decreased their use of priors when faced with external, visual image uncertainty, an "anti-Bayesian" adjustment consistent with the use of a simple classifier. Here, we tested for neural correlates of these Bayesian and classifier-based strategies in the frontal eye field (FEF), a prefrontal region shown to be important for the perception of visual stability across saccades. We recorded from single FEF neurons while two rhesus macaques performed the internal (motor) and external (image) noise tasks in each session, interleaved trial by trial. FEF activity correlated with and predicted the anti-Bayesian, but not the Bayesian, behavior. These results suggest that the two computational strategies for visual stability are implemented by distinct neural circuits and provide a first step toward an integrated understanding of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying visual perception across saccades.

">The Hypno-PC: Uncovering Sleep Dynamics through Principal Component Analysis and Hidden Markov Modeling of Electrophysiological Signals</a></h4>

              
                The conventional approach to sleep analysis relies on pre-defined, visually scored stages derived from electrophysiological signals. This manual method demands substantial effort and is influenced by subjective assessments, implicitly assuming that these categories accurately reflect underlying biological processes. Recent advancements indicate that low-dimensional representations of complex brain activity can provide objective means of identifying brain states. These approaches can potentially uncover inherent patterns within sleep, offering valuable insights into its organization. In this study, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to spectral features extracted from high-density EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG recorded overnight at both 30- and 4-second resolutions. Notably, the first principal component-the "Hypno-PC"-strongly aligns with the hypnogram at both time scales. Subsequently, we employed a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) to delineate discrete states in the PCA-transformed data and to quantify their temporal dynamics. Using minimal supervision (less than 0.5% of the data labeled) and a cross-subject approach, the model achieved alignment with standard sleep labels comparable to the typical inter-rater agreement. Finally, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to the PCA space, decomposing it into an independent set of components that potentially represent distinct physiological processes. The integrated use of PCA, GHMM, and ICA provides a reproducible and scalable methodology that aligns with traditional sleep staging, while offering a more flexible and comprehensive perspective on sleep states. Our findings indicate that these data-driven, unsupervised methods effectively uncover the intrinsic dynamics of sleep, advancing automated sleep analysis and enhancing our understanding of sleep organization.

">VGluT3 BNST neurons transmit GABA and restrict feeding without affecting rewarding or aversive processing</a></h4>

              
                The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is involved in feeding, reward, aversion, and anxiety-like behavior. We identify BNST neurons defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3, VGluT3. VGluT3 neurons were localized to anteromedial BNST, were molecularly distinct from accumbal VGluT3 neurons, and co-express vesicular GABA transporter (VGaT). Cell-type specific presynaptic processes were identified in arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), regions critical for feeding and homeostatic regulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, while these neurons co-express VGluT3 and VGaT, they functionally transmit GABA to both ARC and PVN, with rare glutamate co-transmission to ARC. Neuronal recordings of VGluT3 BNST neurons showed greater calcium-dependent signaling in response to sucrose consumption while sated compared with fasted. When fasted, optogenetic stimulation of BNST VGluT3 neurons decreased sucrose consumption using several stimulation conditions but not when stimulation occurred prior to sucrose access, suggesting that BNST VGluT3 activation concurrent with consumption in the fasted state reduces feeding. BNST VGluT3 activation during anxiety-like paradigms (novelty-suppressed feeding, open field, and elevated zero maze) and real-time place conditioning resulted in no changes in anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior. We interpret these data such that VGluT3 BNST neurons represent a unique cellular population within the BNST that provides inhibitory input to hypothalamic regions to decrease feeding without affecting anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior.

	<p>Background: The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characteristic of difficulties in social communication and interaction has been previously associated with elevated anxiety and the degree of mental effort required to understand and respond to social cues. These associations have implications for the mental health of autistic youth, but they are usually based on correlational statistics between measures of anxiety and social interaction demands that are collected in formal psychological testing settings. Another index of mental effort that has been found to correlate with anxious arousal is gamma wave activity, which is measured via EEG. Methods: To compare data from both of these indicators of mental effort and anxiety, a two-stage study was conducted using (1) standardized test data and (2) in vivo EEG data in a low-demand social setting. Results: As well as significant associations between social cognition and anxiety from standardized scales, there were also meaningful relationships between social cognition and gamma wave activity. Conclusions: Because gamma wave activity represents the highest level of cognitive complexity for brain activity, is an index of hypervigilance under threatening conditions, and has been associated with anxiety in autistic youth, these findings suggest that even low-level demand social interaction settings may initiate high-level anxiety-related behaviour in autistic youth.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies on executive functions in child sex offenders relate their findings to the presence of pedophilia, but they are not able to distinguish between paraphilia and abuse. It is therefore this lack of a distinction that leads us to complement the existing information. Thus, the purpose of this review is to find all available evidence on the neurocognitive and neuroanatomical differences in executive functions among pedophilic and non-pedophilic child sex offenders, and non-offender pedophiles. Methods: The present review, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, ran a systematic search of three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest). This search identified 5697 potential articles, but only 16 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe, using a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample. Results: The results showed alterations in frontal, temporal and parietal structures related to executive functions (e.g., response inhibition) in child sexual offenders, regardless of the presence of pedophilia. Conclusions: In summary, there are differences in brain structure underlying executive functions related to child sexual abuse, but not to pedophilia as such.</p>

                <p>Brain oscillations in the alpha-band (8&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) have been linked to specific processes in attention and perception. In particular, decreases in posterior alpha-amplitude are thought to reflect activation of perceptually relevant brain areas for target engagement, while alpha-amplitude increases have been associated with inhibition for distractor suppression. Traditionally, these alpha-changes have been viewed as two facets of the same process. However, recent evidence calls for revisiting this interpretation. Here, we recorded MEG/EEG in 32 participants (19 females) during covert visuospatial attention shifts (spatial cues) and two control conditions (neutral cue, no-attention cue), while tracking fixational eye movements. In disagreement with a single, perceptually relevant alpha-process, we found the typical alpha-modulations contra- and ipsilateral to the attention focus to be triple dissociated in their timing, topography, and spectral features: Ipsilateral alpha-increases occurred early, over occipital sensors, at a high alpha-frequency (10&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) and were expressed during spatial attention (alpha spatial cue &gt; neutral cue). In contrast, contralateral alpha-decreases occurred later, over parietal sensors, at a lower alpha-frequency (7&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) and were associated with attention deployment in general (alpha spatial and neutral cue &lt; no-attention cue). Additionally, the lateralized early alpha-increases but not alpha-decreases during spatial attention coincided in time with directionally biased microsaccades. Overall, this suggests that the attention-related early alpha-increases and late alpha-decreases reflect distinct, likely reflexive versus endogenously controlled attention mechanisms. We conclude that there is more than one perceptually relevant posterior alpha-oscillation, which need to be dissociated for a detailed account of their roles in perception and attention.</p>

                <p>Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions retain increased densities of microglia and macrophages. In acute SCI, macrophages induce growth cone collapse and facilitate axon retraction away from lesion boundaries. Little is known about the role of sustained inflammation in chronic SCI or whether chronic inflammation affects regeneration. We used the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor, PLX-5622, to deplete microglia and macrophages months after complete crush SCI in female mice. Transcriptional analyses revealed a significant inflammatory depletion within chronic SCI lesions after PLX-5622 treatment. Both transcriptional analyses and immunohistochemistry revealed that Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells repopulate to predepleted densities after treatment removal. Neuronal-enriched transcripts were significantly elevated in mice after inflammatory repopulation, but no significant effects were observed with inflammatory depletion alone. Axon densities also significantly increased within the lesion after PLX-5622 treatment and after repopulation. To better examine the effect of chronic inflammation on axon regeneration, we tested PLX-5622 treatment in neuronal-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) knock-out (PTEN-KO) mice. PTEN-KO was delivered using spinal injections of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg's). PTEN-KO did not further increase axon densities within the lesion beyond the effects induced by PLX-5622. Axons that grew within the lesion were histologically identified as 5-HT<sup>+</sup> and CGRP<sup>+</sup>, both of which are not robustly transduced by AAVrg's. Our work identified that increased macrophage/microglial densities in the chronic SCI environment may be actively retained by homeostatic mechanisms likely affiliated with a sustained elevated expression of CSF1 and other chemokines. Finally, we identify a novel role of sustained inflammation as a prospective barrier to axon regeneration in chronic SCI.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in motor function through the coordination of dopamine receptor (DRD) subtypes, such as DRD1 and DRD2, thus the functional imbalance of these receptors can lead to Parkinson's disease. However, due to the complexity of dopaminergic circuits in the brain, it is limited to investigating the individual functions of each DRD subtype in specific brain regions. Here, we developed a light-responsive chimeric DRD2, OptoDRD2, which can selectively activate DRD2-like signaling pathways with spatiotemporal resolution. OptoDRD2 was designed to include the light-sensitive component of rhodopsin and the intracellular signaling domain of DRD2. Upon illumination with blue light, OptoDRD2 triggered DRD2-like signaling pathways, such as G&alpha;i/o subtype recruitment, a decrease in cAMP levels, and ERK phosphorylation. To explore unknown roles of DRD2 in glutamatergic cell populations of basal ganglia circuitry, OptoDRD2 was genetically expressed in excitatory neurons in lateral globus pallidus (LGP) of the male mouse brain. The optogenetic stimulation of OptoDRD2 in the LGP region affected a wide range of locomotion-related parameters, such as increased frequency of movement and decreased immobility time, resulting in the facilitation of motor function of living male mice. Therefore, our findings indicate a potentially novel role for DRD2 in the excitatory neurons of the LGP region, suggesting that OptoDRD2 can be a valuable tool enabling the investigation of unknown roles of DRD2 at specific cell types or brain regions.</p>

                <p>The homeostatic regulation of pulmonary ventilation, and ultimately arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>, depends on interactions between respiratory chemoreflexes and arousal state. The ventilatory response to CO<SUB>2</SUB> is triggered by neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that function as sensors of central pH, which can be identified in adulthood by the expression of Phox2b and neuromedin B. Here, we examine the dynamic response of genetically defined RTN neurons to hypercapnia and arousal state in freely behaving adult male and female mice using the calcium indicator jGCaMP7 and fiber photometry. We found that hypercapnia vigorously activates RTN neurons with a low CO<SUB>2</SUB> recruitment threshold and with response kinetics that match respiratory activity whereas hypoxia had little effect. RTN activity increased transiently during wakefulness and respiratory-related arousals and rose persistently during rapid eye movement sleep, and their CO<SUB>2</SUB> response persisted under anesthesia. Complementary studies using inhibitory optogenetics show that RTN activity supports eupneic breathing under anesthesia as well as during states of high arousal, but their activity is redundant for voluntary breathing patterns. Collectively, this study demonstrates that CO<SUB>2</SUB>-activated RTN neurons are exquisitely sensitive to the arousal state, which determines their contribution to alveolar ventilation in relation to arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

In this study, we propose the use of a sparse dynamic causal model (sDCM) to decouple neuronal and vascular factors in the BOLD signal, with the aim of characterizing the whole-brain spatial pattern of hemodynamic sensitivity to healthy aging, as well as to test the role of hemodynamic features as independent predictors in an age-classification model. sDCM was applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a cohort of 126 healthy individuals in a wide age range (31 females), providing reliable estimates of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each subject and each region of interest. Then, some features characterizing each HRF curve were extracted and used to fit a multivariate logistic regression model predicting the age class of each individual. Ultimately, we tested the final predictive model on an independent dataset of 338 healthy subjects (173 females) selected from the Human Connectome Project in Aging and Development cohorts. Our results entail the spatial heterogeneity of the age effects on the hemodynamic component, since its impact resulted to be strongly region- and population-specific, discouraging any space-invariant&ndash;corrective procedures that attempt to correct for vascular factors when carrying out functional studies involving groups with different ages. Moreover, we demonstrated that a strong interaction exists between certain right-hemisphere hemodynamic features and age, further supporting the essential role of the hemodynamic factor as independent predictor of biological aging, rather than a simple confounding variable.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e2284232024?rss=1">Early Neural Development of Social Interaction Perception: Evidence from Voxel-Wise Encoding in Young Children and Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a young age, children have advanced social perceptual and reasoning abilities. However, the neural development of these abilities is still poorly understood. To address this gap, we used fMRI data collected while 122 3&ndash;12-year-old children (64 females) and 33 adults (20 females) watched an engaging and socially rich movie to investigate how the cortical basis of social processing changes throughout development. We labeled the movie with visual and social features, including motion energy, presence of a face and a social interaction, theory of mind (ToM) events, valence, and arousal. Using a voxel-wise encoding model trained on these features, we found that models based on visual (motion energy) and social (faces, social interaction, ToM, valence, and arousal) features can both predict brain activity in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old across the cortex, with particularly high predictivity in motion-selective middle temporal region and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, models based on individual social features showed that while there may be some development throughout childhood, social interaction information in the STS is present in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old and appears adult-like by age 7. The current study, for the first time, links neural activity in children to predefined social features in a narrative movie and suggests social interaction perception is supported by early developing neural responses in the STS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e0080242024?rss=1">Computational and Neural Evidence for Altered Fast and Slow Learning from Losses in Problem Gambling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning occurs across multiple timescales, with fast learning crucial for adapting to sudden environmental changes, and slow learning beneficial for extracting robust knowledge from multiple events. Here, we asked if miscalibrated fast vs slow learning can lead to maladaptive decision-making in individuals with problem gambling. We recruited participants with problem gambling (PG; N = 20; 9 female and 11 male) and a recreational gambling control group without any symptoms associated with PG (N = 20; 10 female and 10 male) from the community in Los Angeles, CA. Participants performed a decision-making task involving reward-learning and loss-avoidance while being scanned with fMRI. Using computational model fitting, we found that individuals in the PG group showed evidence for an excessive dependence on slow timescales and a reduced reliance on fast timescales during learning. fMRI data implicated the putamen, an area associated with habit, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in slow loss-value encoding, with significantly more robust encoding in medial PFC in the PG group compared to controls. The PG group also exhibited stronger loss prediction error encoding in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that individuals with PG have an impaired ability to adjust their predictions following losses, manifested by a stronger influence of slow value learning. This impairment could contribute to the behavioral inflexibility of problem gamblers, particularly the persistence in gambling behavior typically observed in those individuals after incurring loss outcomes.</p>

                <p>Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy has regenerative potentials to treat various pathological conditions including neurological diseases. MSCs isolated from various organs can differentiate into specific cell types to repair organ damages. However, their paracrine mechanisms are predicted to predominantly mediate their immunomodulatory, proangiogenic, and regenerative properties. While preclinical studies highlight the significant potential of MSC therapy in mitigating neurological damage from stroke and traumatic brain injury, the variability in clinical trial outcomes may stem from the inherent heterogeneity of somatic MSCs. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an ideal alternative resource for the unlimited expansion and biomanufacturing of MSCs. Thus, we investigated how iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) influence properties of iPSC-derived neurons. Our findings demonstrate that the secretome from iMSCs possesses neurotrophic effects, improving neuronal survival and promoting neuronal outgrowth and synaptic activity in vitro. Additionally, the iMSCs enhance metabolic activity via mitochondrial respiration in neurons, both in vitro and in mouse models. Glycolytic pathways also increased following the administration of iMSC secretome to iPSC-derived neurons. Consistently, in vivo experiments showed that intravenous administration of iMSCs compensated for the elevated energetic demand in male mice with irradiation-induced brain injury by restoring synaptic metabolic activity during acute brain damage. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging also detected an increase in brain glucose uptake following iMSC administration. Together, our results highlight the potential of iMSC-based therapy in treating neuronal damage in various neurological disorders, while paving the way for future research and potential clinical applications of iMSCs in regenerative medicine.</p>

                <p>Although the therapeutic potential of microRNA-mediated gene regulation has been investigated, its precise functional regulatory mechanism in neuropathic pain remains incompletely understood. In this study, we elucidate that miR-216a-3p serves as a critical noncoding RNA involved in the modulation of trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. By conducting RNA-seq and qPCR analysis, we observed a notable decrease of miR-216a-3p in the injured trigeminal ganglia (TG) of male rats. Intra-TG administration of miR-216a-3p agomir or lentiviral-mediated overexpression of miR-216a-3p specifically in sensory neurons of injured TGs alleviated established neuropathic pain behaviors, while downregulation of miR-216a-3p (pharmacologically or genetically) in naive rats induced pain behaviors. Moreover, nerve injury significantly elevated the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels in the ipsilateral TG, thereby suppressing the SRY-box TF 10 (SOX10) binding to the <I>miR-216a-3p</I> promoter and resulting in the reduction of miR-216a-3p. Inhibiting the enzymes responsible for catalyzing H3K27me3 restored the nerve injury-induced reduction in miR-216a-3p expression and markedly ameliorated neuropathic pain behaviors. Furthermore, miR-216a-3p targeted stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), and the decreased miR-216a-3p associated with neuropathic pain caused a significant upregulation in the protein abundance of STIM1. Conversely, overexpression of miR-216a-3p in the injured TG suppressed the upregulation of STIM1 expression and reversed the mechanical allodynia. Together, the mechanistic understanding of H3K27me3-dependent SOX10/miR-216a-3p/STIM1 signaling axial in sensory neurons may facilitate the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain management.</p>

                <p>The interplay between attention, alertness, and motor planning is crucial for our manual interactions. To investigate the neural bases of this interaction and challenge the views that attention cannot be disentangled from motor planning, we instructed human volunteers of both sexes to plan and execute reaching movements while attending to the target, while attending elsewhere, or without constraining attention. We recorded reaction times to reach initiation and pupil diameter and interfered with the functions of the medial posterior parietal cortex (mPPC) with online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the causal role of this cortical region in the interplay between spatial attention and reaching. We found that mPPC plays a key role in the spatial association of reach planning and covert attention. Moreover, we have found that alertness, measured by pupil size, is a good predictor of the promptness of reach initiation only if we plan a reach to attended targets, and mPPC is causally involved in this coupling. Different from previous understanding, we suggest that mPPC is neither involved in reach planning per se, nor in sustained covert attention in the absence of a reach plan, but it is specifically involved in attention functional to reaching.</p>

                <p>Intracranial potentials are used as functional biomarkers of neural networks. As potentials spread away from the source populations, they become mixed in the recordings. In humans, interindividual differences in the gyral architecture of the cortex pose an additional challenge, as functional areas vary in location and extent. We used source separation techniques to disentangle mixing potentials obtained by exploratory deep arrays implanted in epileptic patients of either sex to gain access to the number, location, relative contribution, and dynamics of coactive sources. The unique spatial profiles of separated generators made it possible to discern dozens of independent cortical areas for each patient, whose stability maintained even during seizure, enabling the follow up of activity for days and across states. Through matching these profiles to MRI, we associated each with limited portions of sulci and gyri and determined the local or remote origin of the corresponding sources. We also plotted source-specific 3D coverage across arrays. In average, individual recording sites are contributed to by 3&ndash;5 local and distant generators from areas up to several centimeters apart. During seizure, 13&ndash;85% of generators were involved, and a few appeared anew. Significant bias in location assignment using raw potentials is revealed, including numerous false positives when determining the site of origin of a seizure. This is not amended by bipolar montage, which introduce additional errors of its own. In this way, source disentangling reveals the multisource nature and far intracranial spread of potentials in humans, while efficiently addressing patient-specific anatomofunctional cortical divergence.</p>

                <p>Neonatal hypoxia (Hx) causes white matter (WM) injury, particularly in the cerebellum. We previously demonstrated that Hx-induced reduction of cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) activity results in locomotor deficits. Yet, the mechanism of Hx-induced cerebellar WM injury and associated locomotor abnormalities remains undetermined. Here, we show that the cerebellar WM injury and linked locomotor deficits are driven by PC activity and are reversed when PC activity is restored. Using optogenetics and multielectrode array recordings, we manipulated PC activity and captured the resulting cellular responses in WM oligodendrocyte precursor cells and GABAergic interneurons. To emulate the effects of Hx, we used light-activated halorhodopsin targeted specifically to the PC layer of normal mice. Suppression of PC firing activity at P13 and P21 phenocopied the locomotor deficits observed in Hx. Moreover, histopathologic analysis of the developing cerebellar WM following PC inhibition (P21) revealed a corresponding reduction in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, akin to our findings in Hx mice. Conversely, PC stimulation restored PC activity, promoted oligodendrocyte maturation, and enhanced myelination, resulting in reversed Hx-induced locomotor deficits. Our findings highlight the crucial role of PC activity in cerebellar WM development and locomotor performance following neonatal injury. </p>
