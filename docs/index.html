              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14060">Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection for Electroencephalogram: A Task-Independent Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive, low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications.

                arXiv:2508.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

                arXiv:2508.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and adapt to complex AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14143">Beyond Turing: Memory-Amortized Inference as a Foundation for Cognitive Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.14143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning: whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14520">Quantization Meets Spikes: Lossless Conversion in the First Timestep via Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100 and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture, establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, compared to the baseline method.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138">STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14232">Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic, time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.

                arXiv:2508.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic, distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness. MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e) approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality. Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553 requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency (0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101) auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00212">Reinitializing weights vs units for maintaining plasticity in neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually. An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units: (1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing units.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has usually been pursued within isolated, closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an open-environment system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), which provides permissionless computational substrates, enables the deployment of Large Language Model-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether open-environment ALife systems "in the wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

                <p>Cognitive, social behavior, speech, and motor skills are known challenges for people with trisomy 21/Down syndrome (DS), but the precise mechanisms that lead to these impactful changes have not yet been described. Data from human and mouse model fetal brains indicate that alterations in prenatal neurogenesis might account for the neurological phenotypes that manifest after birth. Here, we evaluated key features of cortical neurogenesis in the humanized mouse model of DS (TcMAC21 of undetermined sex) to test whether and how the presence of the human HSA21q transchromosome impacts cortical development. Brain growth measurements throughout the second half of gestation and at several periods of postnatal development show overall that the TcMAC21 brain phenotype is less severe than in other DS mouse models that have less genetic similarity to humans with DS. However, despite the lack of gross changes in brain growth, we uncovered a significant temporally limited neurogenesis defect at midgestation that correlates with long-lasting effects on neuronal dispersion and neuronal function in the neocortex. Using Cre/Lox-mediated genetic fate mapping, we discovered a transient reduction in neocortical basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) and that bIPC neuronal progeny are underrepresented in the superficial layers of the neocortex. This change in neuronal production is associated with cortical activity changes after birth. Altogether, our data isolate the cell types associated with a very specific temporal change in cortical formation that, due to the high levels of excitability of bIPC-derived neurons, creates lasting effects on network activity and circuit development in trisomic brains.</p>

                <p>Clinical trials, laboratory experiments, and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that pain is highly sensitive to expectations, whether based on the psychosocial context surrounding treatment (e.g., placebo analgesia) or transient cues that provide information about painful events (e.g., pain-predictive cues). We asked whether placebo analgesia and pain-predictive cues modulate pain through the same mechanisms or dissociable brain pathways. Forty healthy volunteers of both sexes rated pain in response to noxious heat during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We crossed pain-predictive cues, which induce expectations for high or low pain on a trial-by-trial basis, with administration of an inert placebo cream or a control cream. Behavioral analyses revealed a significant interaction, such that predictive cues had weaker effects on pain during placebo blocks than control blocks. This interaction was accompanied by interactions in the insula, pons, and other brain regions. We also observed distinct neural substrates when we compared pure cue effects with pure placebo effects, and only predictive cues modulated responses in nociceptive regions and the neurologic pain signature (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Wager et al., 2013</cross-ref>). The only regions that were influenced similarly by both types of expectations were the rostral anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cue-based expectations about stimulus intensity and placebo-based expectations about treatment outcomes are distinct and that pain researchers should differentiate between sources of expectations. Furthermore, cue-based expectations were associated with more consistent effects than treatment-based expectations, suggesting that clinicians should be particularly mindful of how they present information about impending pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0089252025?rss=1">Locally Induced Traveling Waves Generate Globally Observable Traveling Waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical traveling waves have been proposed as a fundamental mechanism for neural communication and computation. Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of noninvasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large-scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (<I>N</I> = 19, 10 female, 9 male) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, noninvasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.</p>

                <p>Visual resolution, contrast sensitivity, and form perception improve gradually with age. In nonhuman primates, the sensitivity and resolution of cells in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and primary visual cortex (V1) also improve, but not enough to account for the perceptual changes. So, what aspects of visual system development limit visual sensitivity in infants? Improvements in behavioral sensitivity might arise from maturation of regions downstream of V1 such as V2, V4, and IT, which are thought to support increasingly complex perceptual abilities. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in areas V1, V2, V4, and PIT to radial frequency patterns&mdash;a type of global form stimulus. Subjects were three young monkeys (two female, one male) between the ages of 19 and 54&nbsp;weeks and a single adult animal (male). We found that neurons and neural populations in V4 reliably encoded global form in radial frequency stimuli at the earliest ages we studied, while V1 neurons do not. V2 and PIT populations also showed some degree of selectivity for these patterns at early ages, especially at higher radial frequency values. We did not find significant, systematic changes in neural decoding performance that could account for the improvement in behavioral performance over the same age range in an overlapping group of animals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B68">Rodriguez Deliz et al., 2024</cross-ref>). Finally, consistent with our prior behavioral results, neural populations in V4 show highest sensitivity for the higher radial frequency values, which contain the highest concentration of curvature and orientation cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0381252025?rss=1">Increased Sleep Spindles in Regions Engaged during Motor Learning Predict Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep spindles play a critical role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Although spindles can occur widely across the cortex, they are often focal. Focal spindles may promote plasticity in distinct circuits to consolidate specific memory types. In this study, we simultaneously acquired EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 25 healthy adults (six females) during daytime naps to investigate whether learning the finger tapping motor sequence task (MST) preferentially increases spindle density (#/min) within cortical regions engaged during task performance and whether these task-related spindle increases predict performance improvement measured after the nap. We employed a novel algorithm to project EEG/MEG signals into source space using anatomical constraints from MRI and detected spindles in cortical regions. Compared with a baseline nap, MST training preferentially increased spindle density in regions engaged while learning, which in turn predicted postnap performance improvement. Learning during training and postnap improvement were not correlated, suggesting that they reflect discrete processes. They also had different neural correlates. Whereas learning during training correlated with spindle density increases in motor execution regions, postnap improvement correlated with increases in motor planning regions. We speculate that spindles in motor execution regions represent the memory, while those in planning regions enhance future performance. Our findings demonstrate that spindle expression is influenced by prior learning and support the theory that spindles in task-related regions promote the neural plasticity necessary for motor memory consolidation. We propose that spindles in task-related regions may be more sensitive biomarkers of learning and sleep-dependent memory consolidation than those occurring elsewhere.</p>

                <p>While transient changes in synaptic strength occurring during the repetitive firing of primary afferent inputs to the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH) are predicted to strongly influence the fidelity with which nociceptive signals are transmitted through the SDH network, little is known about whether the properties of short-term plasticity (STP) at sensory synapses depend on the identity of the postsynaptic target or whether STP is under the control of neuromodulators such as dopamine. Here we investigate these issues using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings from identified lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, inhibitory interneurons (VGAT+), and putative excitatory interneurons (VGAT&ndash;) in spinal cord slices from adult mice of both sexes. Repeated activation of A-fiber inputs to the SDH evoked short-term depression (STD) across all major subtypes of SDH neurons, although the magnitude of STD was greatest in projection neurons with high-frequency stimulation. Meanwhile, repetitive activation of C-fiber synapses onto GABAergic interneurons evoked more pronounced STD compared with excitatory neurons across a range of stimulation frequencies. Both A-fiber and C-fiber synapses recovered from STD at a similar rate across the different SDH cell types examined. Dopamine (20&nbsp;&micro;M) significantly depressed the overall glutamatergic drive, and reduced afferent-evoked firing, selectively in spinoparabrachial neurons and excitatory interneurons without changes in the properties of STP. Collectively, these findings reveal novel potential mechanisms by which the efficacy of the spinal inhibitory "gate," and thus the gain of ascending nociceptive transmission to the brain, may be rapidly altered during periods of strong sensory input to the SDH network.</p>

                <p>Mutations in <I>ARL13B</I> lead to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy with neurological and retinal abnormalities. In photoreceptors, ARL13B localizes to the connecting cilia and outer segments. However, the specific function and the need for ARL13B in photoreceptor cilia remain unclear. We used a knock-in mouse model with the <I>Arl13b</I> V358A mutation, which disrupts ciliary localization while preserving guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity, to investigate the role of ARL13B in the photoreceptor cilia. Using female and male littermates, we show by electroretinogram (ERG) that the exclusion of ARL13B from photoreceptor cilia leads to an early loss of cone-mediated vision followed by a decline in rod-mediated vision. This phenotype was unique to the cilia-excluded V358A model, as analysis using the GEF-impaired R79Q model did not show similar changes in photoreceptor function. Morphological analyses using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transmission electron microscopy revealed shortened cone axonemes and structural abnormalities in cone outer segments. IHC staining further demonstrated that loss of ciliary ARL13B disrupts the localization of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) in photoreceptors. In addition, the phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<SUB>2</SUB>) binding protein, Tubby-like protein 1 (TULP1), associated with inherited retinal diseases, was mislocalized to cone outer segments in the V358A model. These findings establish an essential role for ciliaryARL13B in maintaining cone photoreceptor axoneme length, outer segment organization, and proper protein localization. They also suggest that phosphoinositide gradients are critical for cone photoreceptor function and morphology. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating photoreceptor cilia and the pathogenesis of ciliopathies.</p>

                <p>Alternative mRNA splicing generates transcriptomic diversity to direct tissue-specific functions. There is a high level of alternative splicing in the brain during embryonic development, but the master regulators of this process are poorly understood. One key splicing event in neuronal differentiation is the inclusion of a microexon in the SH3 domain of the ubiquitous tyrosine kinase, C-SRC, to yield the constitutively active, neural-specific N1-SRC kinase. We previously demonstrated that specific inhibition of N1-SRC in developing <I>Xenopus</I> embryos inhibits neurogenesis, but the targets and mode of action of N1-SRC were unknown. In the current study, we screened for N1-SRC SH3 domain interactors, surprisingly finding no unique targets compared with the C-SRC SH3 domain, but rather a subset of binding partners, enriched in splicing regulators. Analysis of public phosphoproteomic data revealed that SRC-dependent phosphorylation of the splicing machinery is widespread and enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To investigate whether N1-SRC-dependent regulation of splicing underpins its role in neurogenesis, we undertook long- and short-read RNA-seq analysis of N1-SRC knockdown <I>Xenopus</I> embryos. We observed an upregulation of splicing factor expression and aberrant splicing of splicing regulators, principally HNRNPA1 and TRA2A. The affected splice junctions in both genes are in their glycine-rich C-termini, and junctions contain putative binding sites for SFPQ/NONO and FUS RBPs. Both SFPQ and FUS are SRC substrates, suggesting a mechanism by which N1-SRC knockdown leads to mis-splicing of HNRNPA1 and TRA2A. Thus, the neuronal splicing of C-SRC to generate N1-SRC regulates the alternative splicing landscape during neurogenesis.</p>

                <p>A central component of wayfinding is the ability to maintain a consistent representation of one's facing direction (FD) when moving about the world. In rodents, head direction cells are believed to support this "neural compass," but identifying a similar mechanism in humans during dynamic naturalistic navigation has been challenging. To address this issue, we acquired fMRI data from male and female human participants while they freely navigated through a virtual reality city. Encoding model analyses revealed voxel clusters in the posterior&ndash;medial cortex (the "retrosplenial complex") and superior parietal lobule that exhibited reliable tuning as a function of FD. Crucially, these directional tunings were consistent across perceptually different versions of the city, spatially separated locations within the city, and motivationally distinct phases of the behavioral task. Analysis of the model weights indicated that these regions represent a broad range of possible FDs and that they do so by representing heading relative to the principal axis of the environment. These findings reveal specific mechanisms in the human brain that allow us to maintain a sense of direction during naturalistic, dynamic navigation.</p>

                <p>Neurite initiation from newly born neurons is a critical step in neuronal differentiation and migration. Neuronal migration in the developing cortex is accompanied by dynamic extension and retraction of neurites as neurons progress through bipolar and multipolar states. However, there is a relative lack of understanding regarding how the dynamic extension and retraction of neurites is regulated during neuronal migration. In recent work, we have shown that Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4), a member of the F-BAR family of membrane-bending proteins, inhibits cortical neurite formation in culture, while family member formin binding protein 17 (FBP17) induces premature neurite outgrowth. These results beg the question of how CIP4 and FBP17 function in radial neuron migration and differentiation in vivo, including the timing and manner of neurite extension and retraction. Indeed, the regulation of neurite outgrowth is essential for the transitions between bipolar and multipolar states during radial migration. To examine the effects of modulating expression of CIP4 and FBP17 in vivo, we used in utero electroporation, in combination with our published Double UP technique, to compare knockdown or overexpression cells with control cells within the same mouse tissue of either sex. We show that either knockdown or overexpression of CIP4 and FBP17 results in the marked disruption of radial neuron migration by modulating neuronal morphology and neurite outgrowth, consistent with our findings in culture. Our results demonstrate that the F-BAR proteins CIP4 and FBP17 are essential for proper radial migration in the developing cortex and thus play a key role in cortical development.</p>

                <p>by Elliot M.R. Vincent, Edward M. Hill, Stephen Parnell</p>

Reducing reliance on pesticides is an important global challenge. With increasing constraints on their use, in recent years there has been a declining trend in pesticide use for arable crops in the UK. But with increasing disease pressures and global demand for food, there is a greater need for effective measures of pest and disease control. These circumstances highlight the need for widespread adoption of sustainable alternative control measures. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is one such solution, comprising a set of management strategies which focus on the long-term prevention, detection and control of pests, weeds and diseases. While many of these methods are acknowledged to offer effective control, their implementation has thus far been limited in practice. As a case study we considered Septoria tritici blotch (STB) (<i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i>), an economically important disease of wheat. We used epidemiological modelling techniques to investigate the potential of different IPM control strategies (crop residue burial, delayed sowing, variety mixtures and biocontrols). Combining existing data with a deterministic, compartmental infectious disease model of STB transmission, we simulated the implementation of an IPM regime into the STB disease system. We investigated the outcomes on disease prevalence and crop yield when comparing conventional and IPM control regimes. In a single field, for the individual implementation of IPM measures we found the starkest difference in potential yield outcomes between delayed sowing and biocontrols (greatest yields), and crop residue burial and variety mixtures (lowest yields). We also found that the collective use of IPM measures has the potential to offer individual growers comparable control to a standard fungicide regime. For a multi-field setting, representing a community of crop growers, a high proportion of growers using IPM can reduce the level of external infection incurred by the growers who maintain a fungicide regime.

                <p>by Philip Ruthig, David Edler v.d. Planitz, Maria Morozova, Katja Reimann, Carsten Jäger, Tilo Reinert, Siawoosh Mohammadi, Nikolaus Weiskopf, Evgeniya Kirilina, Markus Morawski</p>

The size and complexity of the human brain require optimally sized and myelinated fibers. White matter fibers facilitate fast communication between distant areas, but also connect adjacent cortical regions via short association fibers. The difference in length and packing density of long and short association fibers pose different requirements on their optimal size and degree of myelination. The fundamental questions of (i) how thick the short association fibers are and (ii) how strongly they are myelinated as compared to long fibers, however, remain unanswered. We present a comprehensive two-dimensional transmission electron microscopic analysis of ~400,000 fibers of human white matter regions with long (corpus callosum) and short fibers (superficial white matter). Using a deep learning approach, we demonstrate a substantially higher fiber diameter and higher myelination thickness (both approximately 25% higher) in corpus callosum than in superficial white matter. Surprisingly, we do not find a difference in the ratio between axon diameter and myelin thickness (g-ratio), which is close to the theoretically optimal value of ~0.6 in both areas (0.54). This work reveals a fundamental principle of brain organization that provides a key foundation for understanding the human brain.

                Nimkar and colleagues present a flatmount spatial transcriptomics platform for mapping the distribution of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. The analysis uncovers systematic topographic biases among RGC types and identifies perivascular RGC types surviving preferentially after experimental glaucoma. The results highlight neuroprotective roles of perivascular niche in the retina.

                Xu et al. identify the chromatin remodeler RSC1 as a key regulator of shaping open chromatin architecture in Magnaporthe oryzae. RSC1 restricts H3K27me3 spreading by positively modulating the abundance of a histone H3K27 demethylase JMJ1 and promotes transcriptional activation by recognizing acetylated histones and recruiting histone acetyltransferase GCN5b.

This approach makes it possible to rear honeybees without pollen.

In mice, we use in vivo optogenetics to show that the GPe exerts non-canonical effects on locomotion while the SNr has no gross motor impact through inhibition of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). We show that these structures mediate opposing effects on reward and that activation of <i>substantia nigra pars compacta</i> (SNc) dopaminergic axons in the PPN is rewarding. We use ex vivo whole-cell recording with optogenetics in mice to comprehensively dissect SNr and GPe synaptic connections to regionally- and molecularly-defined populations of PPN neurons. The SNr inhibits all PPN subtypes but most strongly inhibits caudal glutamatergic neurons. The GPe selectively inhibits caudal glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, avoiding both cholinergic and rostral cells. This circuit characterization reveals non-canonical basal ganglia pathways for locomotion and valence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96052">The full-length BEND2 protein is dispensable for spermatogenesis but required for setting the ovarian reserve in mice</a></h4>

              
                Infertility affects up to 12% of couples globally, with genetic factors contributing to nearly half of the cases. Advances in genomic technologies have led to the discovery of genes like <i>Bend2</i>, which play a crucial role in gametogenesis. In the testis, <i>Bend2</i> expresses two protein isoforms: full-length and a smaller one. Ablation of both proteins results in an arrested spermatogenesis. Because the <i>Bend2</i> locus is on the X chromosome, and the <i>Bend2<sup>-/y</sup></i> mutants are sterile, BEND2’s role in oogenesis remained elusive. In this study, we employed a novel <i>Bend2</i> mutation that blocks the expression of the full-length BEND2 protein but allows the expression of the smaller BEND2 isoform. Interestingly, this mutation does not confer male sterility and mildly affects spermatogenesis. Thus, it allowed us to study the role of BEND2 in oogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that full-length BEND2 is dispensable for male fertility, and its ablation leads to a reduced establishment of the ovarian reserve. These results reveal a critical role for full-length BEND2 in oogenesis and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment of the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, these findings hold relevance for the diagnostic landscape of human infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105892">Action mechanism of a novel agrichemical quinofumelin against Fusarium graminearum</a></h4>

              
                Modern fungicides have made significant contributions to crop disease management, but the development of resistant fungal strains has caused their failure in disease control. Therefore, developing fungicides with novel action mechanisms is the most effective measure to manage resistance. Quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, exhibits exceptional antifungal activity against phytopathogens. However, there is currently no available information on its mechanism of action. Here, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to observe a co-enrichment pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) within pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (PBP), identifying down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Exogenous uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine, or uracil (metabolites in PBP) successfully restored quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth in <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> and <i>Fusarium asiaticum</i>. Additionally, the deletion of <i>FgDHODHII</i> was determined to be lethal; however, mycelial growth of ΔFgDHODHII mutants could be restored by adding UMP, uridine, or uracil. These findings indicate that the deficiencies in <i>FgDHODHII</i> are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin. Finally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and microscale thermophoresis (MST) results strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of de novo uracil biosynthesis as a mechanism of action for quinofumelin while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101559">The promise and peril of comparing fluorescence lifetime in biology revealed by simulations</a></h4>

              
                Signaling dynamics are crucial in biological systems, and biosensor-based real-time imaging has revolutionized their analysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) excels over the widely used fluorescence intensity imaging by allowing the measurement of absolute signal levels independent of sensor concentration. This capability enables the comparison of signaling dynamics across different animals, body regions, and timeframes. However, FLIM’s advantage can be compromised by factors like autofluorescence in biological experiments. To address this, we introduce FLiSimBA, a flexible computational framework for realistic <span class="underline">F</span>luorescence <span class="underline">Li</span>fetime <span class="underline">Sim</span>ulation for <span class="underline">B</span>iological <span class="underline">A</span>pplications. Through simulations, we analyze the signal-to-noise ratios of fluorescence lifetime data, determining measurement uncertainty and providing necessary error bars for lifetime measurements. Furthermore, we challenge the belief that fluorescence lifetime is unaffected by sensor expression and establish quantitative limits to this insensitivity in biological applications. Additionally, we propose innovations, notably multiplexed dynamic imaging that combines fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurements. This innovation can transform the number of signals that can be simultaneously monitored, thereby enabling a systems approach in studying signaling dynamics. Thus, by incorporating different factors into our simulation framework, we uncover surprises, identify limitations, and propose advancements for fluorescence lifetime imaging in biology. This quantitative framework supports rigorous experimental design, facilitates accurate data interpretation, and paves the way for technological advancements in fluorescence lifetime imaging.

">Low-dimensional brain-symptom associations delineate depression phenotypes with distinct connectivity biomarkers and symptom profiles</a></h4>

              
                Depression is neurobiologically and clinically heterogeneous. New approaches using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) functional connectivity (FC) data have modeled the neural basis of depression heterogeneity and revealed unique neural phenotypes. Yet, no studies have identified depression phenotypes from electrophysiological magnetoencephalography (MEG) data although MEG measures human brain dynamics at millisecond precision. We demonstrate here unique depression phenotypes based on MEG-oscillation FC. We collected resting-state MEG, MRI, and clinical symptom data from 263 patients with unipolar depression and 75 healthy controls. We assessed MEG-FC with two oscillatory coupling-mode measures that are fundamental for information processing. To define normative phenotypes, we computed their latent-space low-dimensional brain-symptom associations, and used these components to identify phenotypes using unsupervised machine learning. We identified five stable depression phenotypes that were characterized by unique symptom profiles and distinct spectral patterns. Our results demonstrate new neural underpinnings of depression heterogeneity and reveal unique neural phenotypes with potential personalized diagnostic value.

">Lifespan Variation in Perceptual Style Along an Autism-Schizotypy Continuum Explains Individual Responses to External Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Individuals differ in how they weigh prior knowledge against sensory evidence. This cognitive-perceptual style has been proposed to vary along a continuum from autism-spectrum-like (ASD) to schizophrenia-spectrum-like (SSD) processing. In the present study, we first introduce a refined method for estimating individuals' positions on this continuum by re-combining subscales of established autism and schizotypy questionnaires with a newly validated five-factor model for the autism questionnaire (AQ). Second, using a large, age-diverse adult sample (N = 340, age 18-82), we show that cognitive-perceptual style shifts systematically across the lifespan, with older adults exhibiting more sensory-driven, ASD-like profiles. Third, a total of over 160,000 self-paced reading times reveal that individuals with more sensory-driven styles show heightened sensitivity to lexical predictability, particularly in older age. Fourth, individuals' intrinsic response dynamics, indexed by autocorrelations of reading times, did not covary with cognitive-perceptual style, suggesting a dissociation between linguistic prediction and non-linguistic temporal dynamics. Finally, in a separate experiment (N = 28, age 21-41), individuals with more ASD-like profiles showed reduced adaptation to latent-state volatility in a voice detection task, especially with increasing age. These findings demonstrate the ASD-SSD continuum to provide a dynamic, lifespan-sensitive framework for understanding individual differences in perceptual inference and predictive processing.

">A Comparison of Sleep-Based and Retrieval-Mediated Memory Consolidation Using Sigma-Band Activity</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and retrieval training both promote memory consolidation, likely via similar neural mechanisms, but they have not yet been directly compared in a counterbalanced design that accounts for potential masking of nap effects by prior retrieval training. The current study aimed to see if we could replicate sleep spindles enhancement of weakly encoded memories, across both sleep-based and retrieval-mediated memory consolidation, using EEG sigma power (~11-16 Hz) as a proxy for sleep spindles (i.e., sigma-band activity). Thirty subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) participated in four separate sessions where they learnt different sets of 104 object-word pairs. Subjects were then tested on their recognition accuracy of the pairs before and after one of four 120 min memory interventions where EEG was recorded: retrieval training (i.e., cued recall practice), restudy (i.e., pair re-exposure), a nap opportunity, or a wakeful rest. Our results did not replicate an enhancement of weakly encoded memories, moderated by either sleep spindles of sigma power. Contrary to expectations, sigma power demonstrated a negative impact on memory outcomes. We also detected a prioritisation to enhance memory outcomes for strongly encoded memories and greater memory outcomes following retrieval training and restudy compared to sleep and wake interventions. These results challenge the assumptions of encoding-strength-dependent enhancements across consolidation. Importantly, our study provides a methodological approach to comparing sleep-based and retrieval-mediated memory consolidation that should be explored across different memory paradigms in future studies.

">Symptomatic treatment by a BBB-permeable AAV engineered to restore TDP-43 function slows motor neuron disease and prevents paralysis</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43kDa (TDP-43) dysfunction is an early pathogenic mechanism that underlies amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that lacks disease modifying therapies. We previously developed a mouse model in which TDP-43 is selectively deleted from motor neurons (ChAT-Cre;Tardbpf/f) that mimics the early stages of ALS. Here, we demonstrate that intravenous delivery of a blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeable AAV capsid expressing our rationally designed splicing repressor CTR (AAV-PHP.eB-CTR) in symptomatic ChAT-Cre;Tardbpf/f mice markedly slowed disease progression and prevented paralysis. Systemic delivery of AAV-PHP.eB-CTR led to transduction of ~80% of spinal motor neurons, repression of TDP-43-associated cryptic exons within motor neurons expressing CTR, and attenuation of motor neuron loss. Notably, the addition of the TARDBP 3UTR autoregulatory element to CTR maintained its expression within a physiological range. In control littermates that received AAV-PHP.eB-CTR and were monitored for >20 months, grip strength and body weight remained normal, and no histopathological abnormalities were observed, underscoring a favorable safety profile for this gene therapy. These results provide preclinical proof-of-concept that BBB-crossing AAV delivery of CTR can rescue motor neuron disease through the restoration of TDP-43 function, offering a promising mechanism-based therapeutic strategy for ALS.

">Retrieval-mediated and sleep-based memory consolidation provoke different neural and behavioural markers of memory generalisation.</a></h4>

              
                Across sleep-based and retrieval-mediated consolidation, memories typically become generalised and less dependent on their episodic components for their recollection. However, memory transformations across sleep and retrieval training have not been directly compared. The current study aims to compare how sleep and retrieval training impact the endorsement of semantically similar and different lures, as well as their episodic recollection using the parietal old/new effect on the late positive component (LPC) in subjects' EEG. Thirty subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) attended four sessions where they learnt different sets of 104 object-word pairs and completed one of four 120-minute memory interventions: retrieval training (i.e., cued recall practice), restudy (i.e., pair re-exposure), a nap opportunity, or a wakeful rest. EEG was recorded while subjects were tested on their recognition accuracy in an old/new paradigm with similar- and different-object lures. Our results revealed that retrieval training, but not sleep, lead to greater accuracy for identifying old pairs, but worse similar-lure discrimination. Whilst the parietal old/new effect did not differ between conditions, retrieval had lower LPC amplitudes for similar- than different-object false alarms, whilst restudy demonstrated the opposite. Sleep and wake demonstrated no differences in LPC amplitudes between hits and different false alarm types. Together, our study demonstrates evidence for gist-abstraction across retrieval training, and a task-relevant selective maintenance of episodic details across sleep. These results challenge theories that retrieval training replicates sleep-based consolidation mechanisms, instead acting as a fast route to semanticization regardless of the context.

">White matter microstructure changes across the lifespan: a meta-analysis of longitudinal diffusion MRI studies</a></h4>

              
                White matter in the human brain is known to play a critical role in facilitating communication between different brain regions. White matter microstructure is often quantified using fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion-weighted MRI, and is often considered a key measure of neural efficiency that is positively associated with motor and cognitive functioning. While lifespan trajectories of FA have been well studied in cross-sectional designs, it remains less clear how FA changes longitudinally with age across the lifespan, and whether the rates of change are influenced by genetic variation. We systematically reviewed the evidence of white matter changes, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging longitudinally across the lifespan, and the genetic influences on this change. Searches were conducted in Medline, PsycInfo, and EMBASE up to August 2023 with terms related to DTI/FA and longitudinal/change. Following this, genetic-related search terms were applied to the results and the search was broadened to include other measures of white matter change. Our systematic search resulted in 29 studies that met our criteria. In addition, 14 studies investigated genetic influences on FA change rates across the lifespan. A meta-regression using a thin-plate spline model was conducted to examine annual whole-brain FA change as a function of age. Across childhood and adolescence, FA increased, and the rate of increase slowed into early adulthood. Between ages 20 and 35, changes in FA were not statistically significant. This was followed by a significant decline in FA between ages 36 and 50. The decreases plateaued between ages 51 and 61, and then continued at a slightly slower rate towards the upper end of the age range assessed (77 years). Average FA change per year relative to baseline assessment reached a maximum of +1.1% during development, and -0.6% per year, during ageing. Significant heritability was found for change in local but not global FA during development. During ageing, common variants in genes that have been related to increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders (APOE, HTT, MAPT) were associated in some studies with accelerated local FA decreases over time. In conclusion, there are changes in white matter microstructure within individuals across the lifespan, with increases during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, followed by a period of relative stability during early to mid-adulthood, and subsequent gradual declines from midlife onwards. Evidence is emerging for genetic influences on white matter changes over time, shaping individual trajectories.

">Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) with a consumer monitor: A proof-of-concept</a></h4>

              
                Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) enables neural frequency tagging at rates above the flicker fusion threshold, eliciting steady-state responses to flicker that is almost imperceptible. While RIFT has proven valuable for studying visuospatial attention, it has so far relied on costly projector systems, typically in combination with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The recent emergence of high-speed organic light-emitting diode (OLED) monitors for consumers suggests that RIFT may also be feasible with much more accessible hardware. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstrating successful RIFT using a consumer-grade 480 Hz OLED monitor in combination with electroencephalography (EEG). We also share practical recommendations for achieving precise stimulus timing at 480 Hz with minimal frame drops. In a central fixation task, participants viewed a tapered disc stimulus flickering either centrally or peripherally. Luminance was modulated sinusoidally at 60 Hz or 64 Hz, frequencies at which the flicker was barely visible. Photodiode recordings confirmed that the monitor delivered accurate frame timing with few dropped frames. Cross-coherence analysis between occipital EEG channels and a photodiode revealed robust, frequency-specific neural tagging responses for central stimuli at both frequencies. In comparison, weaker coherence was observed for 60 Hz peripheral flicker. Our findings demonstrate that RIFT can be reliably implemented using affordable stimulation hardware, a low-density EEG montage, and a minimal processing pipeline. We hope that this lowers barriers to entry, facilitating broader use of RIFT in basic research and in applied settings where cost and portability matter.

">Interpretable EEG Biomarkers for Neurological Disease Models in Mice Using Bag-of-Waves Classifiers</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are time-series records of the electrical potential from collective neural activity in the brain. EEG waveform patterns--rhythmic and irregular oscillations and transient patterns of sharp waves or spikes--are potential phenotypical biomarkers, reflecting genotype-specific neural activity. This is especially relevant to diagnosing epilepsy without direct seizure observations, which is common in clinical settings, as well as in animal models, which often have subtle neurological phenotypes without overt epilepsy. Herein, we investigate genotypic prediction from long-term EEG signals of freely behaving mice belonging to six groups defined by the presence or absence of a neurological disease-genotype (TSC1 gene knockout) in three different inbred strains with distinct genetic backgrounds. The potential complexity of genotype-related EEG patterns motivates a machine learning approach to automatically extract time-series descriptors, such as waveforms or spectral content, as biomarkers. We propose a machine learning approach to predict the genotypes of individual mice from the occurrence counts of waveforms that approximate short windows of the EEG. That is, a dictionary of waveforms is optimized to approximate windows from each genotype, and the vectors of waveform occurrence counts are the features for predicting genotypes via logistic regression models. Across two-fold cross-validation of the waveform dictionary learning, and leave-one-individual-out genotype prediction, we find that waveform counts pooled over multiple hour segments enable reliable prediction of mouse strain with an accuracy of 70% (chance rate of 38%), and for two of the three strains, DBA2 and C57B6, strain-specific classifiers reliably determined the epilepsy-genotype (TSC1 gene knockout) at a 67% sensitivity with a 100% specificity for DBA2 and 67% specificity for C57B6. None of the mice of these strains had evidence of overt seizures or EEG-based seizure detection. The methodologies and results show the potential of EEG waveform as phenotypes and bag-of-waves as a feature representation for identifying epilepsy genotypes.

">Cortical thickness changes precede high levels of amyloid by at least seven years</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now defined based on its underlying brain pathology, with the presence of amyloid (A{beta}) plaques at high enough levels sufficient to warrant a diagnosis in the absence of cognitive symptoms. High levels of PET-detectable A{beta} are widely thought to be the first imaging marker, with structural brain changes detectable on MRI scans thought to occur later. We combined 4570 longitudinal MRIs and 1684 A{beta} PET scans from three cognitively healthy cohorts to test the difference in cortical thickness and its change between those that subsequently converted to be A{beta}-positive or stayed A{beta}-negative, using MRIs acquired exclusively in the years before conversion. We found those that subsequently developed elevated A{beta} levels show both thicker cortex and less cortical thinning, even when the last MRI used to estimate their thickness trajectories was acquired at least seven years before conversion. Many effects remained when accounting for quantitative A{beta} levels, suggesting some cortical thickness effects may be partly independent of A{beta}. Differences in cortical thickness and its change between converters and A{beta}-negative individuals showed moderate alignment with patterns of A{beta} deposition, and the timing of thickness changes tracked the temporal progression of A{beta} accumulation. Thus, if amyloid is AD, we show that high levels of PET-detectable amyloid are not the first imaging marker of AD, as cortical thickness changes can be traced years before pathological amyloid. This has implications for understanding the sequence of events leading up to the earliest stages of AD.

">Phenotypic characterization of a mouse model of Rett syndrome reveals pubertal dysregulation and hypothalamic-gonadal dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mutations in the MECP2 gene, encoding the epigenetic reader Methyl-CpG binding protein 2, are the main cause of Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Besides severe symptoms such as profound intellectual disability, loss of speech and motor skills and epilepsy, loss of function of MECP2 has been associated with pubertal dysregulation, but the biological mechanisms leading to this remain unclear. Methods: We first carried out a patient survey to assess pubertal timing in a sample of Spanish patients with Rett syndrome. Second, using a mouse model of Rett, in which males are hemizygous and females heterozygous for Mecp2 loss of function mutation, we assessed the onset and progression of puberty, together with increase in body weight and onset of neurological symptoms in post-weaning mice until puberty. In brain samples of young adult mice, we analysed hypothalamic Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons by immunofluorescent labelling, and in plasma samples measured circulating GnRH and testosterone concentrations. Finally, we analysed testosterone dependent arginine-vasopressin circuits. Results: Our data in patients are in agreement with previous reports showing that a subset of female patients with Rett syndrome experience a delayed timing of menarche. Further, in our mouse model we found delayed puberty in Mecp2CD1-null males, associated with a reduced rate of weight gain, but with puberty onset occurring at a lower body weight than in wildtype controls. Despite later puberty onset, Mecp2CD1-null male mice were found to have an increased number of GnRH neurons, but displayed lower levels of circulating reproductive hormones. Consequently, Mecp2CD1-null males have deficient testosterone-dependent arginine-vasopressin innervation. In female Mecp2CD1-heterozygous mice, we found no overall significant differences in pubertal development or GnRH neurons, albeit in a subset of mice with early neurological symptoms, we found lower body weight, and a trend to delayed vaginal opening but precocious first oestrous, attributable to variable phenotypic penetrance. Conclusions: Our data supports that MECP2 is essential for typical pubertal development, with complete loss of Mecp2 in a male murine model resulting in abnormalities of pubertal timing with an observed increase in hypothalamic GnRH neurons.

">White Matter Tract Vulnerability to Amyloid Pathology on the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, due to the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques, followed by tau pathology, and a gradually spreading pattern of neuronal loss. Understanding how amyloid positivity affects the brain's neural pathways is critical for understanding how the brain changes with AD pathology. Tractometry offers a powerful approach for the in vivo, 3D quantitative assessment of white matter tracts, enabling the localization of microstructural abnormalities in diseased populations and those at risk. In this study, we applied BUAN (Bundle Analytics) tractometry to multi-cohort diffusion MRI data from a total of 1,908 participants: 606 participants in ADNI3 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 3) and 1,302 participants from the HABS-HD (Health and Aging Brain Study - Healthy Diversity). Using BUAN and along-tract statistical analysis, we assessed the localized effects of amyloid positivity, potentially mediated by tau, on white matter pathways, with amyloid positivity quantified via amyloid-sensitive positron emission tomography (PET). BUAN enables tract-specific quantification of white matter microstructure and supports statistical testing along the full length of fiber bundles to detect subtle, spatially localized associations. We present 3D visualizations of tract-wise amyloid associations, highlighting distinct patterns of white matter degeneration in AD.

">Discrete Subfields and Continuous Gradients Coexist: A Multi-Scale View of Hippocampal Organization</a></h4>

              
                The human hippocampus is studied via two competing frameworks: one dividing it into discrete anatomical subfields with distinct computational processes, and another describing it as a continuous, functional gradients along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes. How these organizational principles relate to one another, particularly regarding intrinsic neural timescales of the hippocampus, remains unknown. Here, we used high-resolution resting-state fMRI to investigate how single-voxel autocorrelation, a measure of intrinsic neural timescale, maps onto hippocampal subfields. We found evidence for a hybrid organization. First, consistent with our predictions, we observed significantly higher autocorrelation (longer timescales) in the subiculum compared to the other subfields. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that CA1, which is implicated in integration, had low autocorrelation whereas CA2/3 and CA4DG, which are linked to pattern separation, had intermediate autocorrelation. Second, we discovered that the overarching anterior-posterior and medial-lateral gradients of autocorrelation were recapitulated within each individual subfield. Finally, data-driven clusters of autocorrelation values aligned more strongly with the continuous gradients than with the discrete anatomical boundaries, particularly in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the discrete and continuous views of hippocampal organization are not mutually exclusive but coexist across different spatial scales. We therefore propose a new comprehensive model of hippocampal function that integrates both its modular, subfield-specific properties and its graded, large-scale organization.

">Functional organization of multisensory integration network in children and youth with neurodevelopmental disorders predicts clinical sensory issues</a></h4>

              
                Differences in sensory processing in neurodevelopmental conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), cascade into downstream clinical symptomatology. This includes differences in combining sensory information from multiple modalities into a unified percept, known as multisensory integration. Little is known about the functional organization of multisensory network (MSN) in these groups, its relation to clinical sensory issues, or its interaction with other higher-order cortical networks. We examined resting-state fMRI data from 417 participants in the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Network (ASD=174, ADHD=130, Typical Development=113; Mean age=11.96, SD = 4.10). Timeseries data were extracted from the MSN and seven additional resting-state cortical networks (RSNs). Undirected and directed functional connectivity (FC) metrics were computed within the MSN and between the MSN and other RSNs. FC was compared across diagnoses and related to clinical sensory characteristics. The thalamus emerged as a hub region in both undirected and directed FC within the MSN and between the MSN-RSNs. Some diagnosis-related differences were observed, with increased MSN-RSN FC particularly in ADHD; however, associations with sensory characteristics were stronger in both undirected and directed FC within the MSN and between the MSN-RSNs, regardless of diagnosis. Converging evidence was seen in data-driven clusters based on FC metrics, which did not align with diagnosis, but instead mapped on to the overall level of sensory issues reported. That the data-driven clusters sorted not by diagnosis but by sensory characteristics suggests that these sensory characteristics and their underlying neurobiology are transdiagnostic in nature as opposed to specific to ASD or ADHD.

">Distinct roles of hippocampus and neocortex in symbolic compositional generalization</a></h4>

              
                Humans can combine symbols to generate new meanings. Here, we studied the regional neural mechanisms that might make this possible. We asked participants to combine two discrete, symbolic features (a shape and a colour) to make a novel spatial inference. BOLD data suggested that the hippocampus encoded elementary visual attributes in a high-dimensional, parallel format that permitted flexible individuation. In ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and primary visual cortex (V1), neural patterns for novel stimuli (composites) could be predicted as a linear combination of signals for familiar stimuli (elements). In vmPFC, this composition occurred in a high-dimensional format, but in PPC and V1, it took place in a low-dimensional, spatial, response-consistent frame of reference. These data offer new insights into the neural circuit underlying compositional generalization.

One hundred seventy-eight individuals underwent 7 Tesla MRI before completing multisession training with online stimulation. A cognitive task battery assessed improvements in trained and untrained tasks pre- and post-training. Stimulating the left or right prefrontal cortex at 1 mA during multitasking training enhanced transfer to a visual search task. Critically, cortical morphology predicted stimulation efficacy for inducing transfer. Cortical thickness in regions beneath the stimulating anode was related to reaction time changes in the most difficult visual search condition but only for the left and right 1 mA multitasking training groups. Performance was not related to cortical thickness for the groups receiving sham stimulation, 2 mA stimulation, or 1 mA stimulation with a control training task. These results highlight the importance of individual anatomical differences in modulating tDCS efficacy and identifying specific neuroanatomical features that predict generalized performance gains from combining tDCS with cognitive training.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study employed a systematic meta-analysis to elucidate neural representation differences between empathy for physical and social pain. Addressing the critical unresolved question of neurofunctional similarities and distinctions between these two empathy types, we performed an activation likelihood estimation coordinate-based meta-analysis, quantitatively synthesizing 35 functional MRI studies. Key findings revealed the following: (i) Physical pain empathy demonstrated significant left-lateralized activation patterns involving core regions of the mirror neuron system—including emotional resonance (anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex), affective-cognitive integration (anterior insula), and action comprehension (inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule); (ii) social pain empathy selectively activated the mentalizing network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/medial prefrontal cortex); (iii) differential analyses identified the inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior frontal gyrus as core discriminative regions, with no shared activated brain areas detected. These findings provide large-scale evidence supporting functional segregation in neural substrates between empathy subtypes, offering critical neuroimaging evidence for multidimensional models of empathy.</span>

                <p>The development of motor control over sensory organs is a critical milestone, enabling active exploration and shaping of the sensory environment. Whether the onset of sensory organ motor control directly influences the development of corresponding sensory cortices remains unknown. Here, we confirm and exploit the late onset of whisking behavior in mice to address this question in the somatosensory system. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, we describe a transient increase in the intrinsic excitability of excitatory neurons in layer IV of the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, immediately following the onset of active whisking on postnatal days 13 and 14. This increase in neuronal gain is specific to layer IV, independent of changes in synaptic strength, and requires prior sensory experience. Further, these effects are not expressed in inhibitory interneurons in barrel cortex. The transient increase in excitability is not evident in layer II/III of barrel cortex or in the visual cortex upon eye opening, suggesting a unique interaction between the development of active sensing and the thalamocortical input layer in the somatosensory isocortex. Predictive modeling indicates that, immediately following the onset of active whisking, changes in active membrane conductances alone can reliably distinguish neurons in control but not whisker-deprived hemispheres. Our findings demonstrate an experience-dependent, lamina-specific refinement of neuronal excitability tightly linked to the emergence of active whisking. This transient increase in the gain of the thalamic input layer coincides with a critical period for synaptic plasticity in downstream layers, suggesting a role in cortical maturation and sensory processing.</p>

                <p>by Mohamed Fawzy, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are central to diverse cellular processes but present unique challenges for interpreting genetic variants implicated in human disease. Unlike structured protein domains, IDRs lack stable three-dimensional conformations and are often involved in regulation through transient interactions and post-translational modifications. These features can affect both the distribution of pathogenic variants and the performance of computational tools used to predict their effects. Here, we systematically assessed the distribution of pathogenic <i>vs</i> benign missense variants across disordered, intermediate, and structured protein regions in the human proteome. Pathogenic variants were notably depleted in IDRs yet were associated with distinct molecular mechanisms, particularly dominant gain- and loss-of-function effects. We evaluated 33 variant effect predictors (VEPs), revealing widespread reductions in sensitivity for pathogenic variants in IDRs, despite high AUROC scores driven by accurate benign variant predictions. We also observed substantial discordance among VEP classifications in disordered regions, underscoring the need for region-aware thresholds and disorder-informed prediction strategies. Incorporating features reflective of IDR biology, such as transient interaction motifs and modification sites, may enhance the accuracy and interpretability of future tools.

Mathematical models tend to oversimplify the biological details of vaccine or infection-derived immunity effectiveness. [0pc][-1pc]Please check and confirm the corresponding authors have been correctly identified amend if necessary.Yet, epidemiological outcomes may diverge when assuming polarised immunity—individuals are either fully susceptible or completely immune—compared to leaky immunity—where all individuals are partially protected. We explore the differences between the two by taking advantage of a non-Markovian framework, which allows us to explicitly record the ‘age’ of the immunity and vary its effectiveness accordingly. A basic scenario reveals that leaky immunity leads to a shorter time between reinfections. A more data-driven scenario based on SARS-CoV-2 data finds that leaky immunity yields substantially more reinfections than polarised immunity and a higher number of infected individuals, yet with a lower probability of hospitalisation. Our findings emphasize the critical role of immune memory modelling assumptions, especially for long-term epidemiological dynamics and public health policies.

The computational modeling of chromatin structure is highly complex due to the hierarchical organization of chromatin, which reflects its diverse biophysical principles, as well as inherent dynamism, which underlies its complexity. Chromatin structure modeling can be based on diverse approaches and assumptions, making it essential to determine how different methods influence the modeling outcomes. We conducted a project at the NIH-funded 4D Nucleome Hackathon on March 18–21, 2024, at The University of Washington in Seattle, USA. The hackathon provided an amazing opportunity to gather an international, multi-institutional and unbiased group of experts to discuss, understand and undertake the challenges of chromatin model comparison and validation. Here we give an overview of the current state of the 3D chromatin field and discuss our efforts to run and validate the models. We used distance matrices to represent chromatin models and we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients to estimate differences between models, as well as between models and experimental data. In addition, we discuss challenges in chromatin structure modeling that include: 1) different aspects of chromatin biophysics and scales complicate model comparisons, 2) large diversity of experimental data (e.g., population-based, single-cell, protein-specific) that differ in mathematical properties, heatmap smoothness, noise and resolutions complicates model validation, 3) expertise in biology, bioinformatics, and physics is necessary to conduct comprehensive research on chromatin structure, 4) bioinformatic software, which is often developed in academic settings, is characterized by insufficient support and documentation. We also emphasize the importance of establishing guidelines for software development and standardization.

                <p>by Yuki Kubota, Taiki Fukiage</p>

Human depth perception from 2D images is systematically distorted, yet the nature of these distortions is not fully understood. By examining error patterns in depth estimation for both humans and deep neural networks (DNNs), which have shown remarkable abilities in monocular depth estimation, we can gain insights into constructing functional models of this human 3D vision and designing artificial models with improved interpretability. Here, we propose a comprehensive human-DNN comparison framework for a monocular depth judgment task. Using a novel human-annotated dataset of natural indoor scenes and a systematic analysis of absolute depth judgments, we investigate error patterns in both humans and DNNs. Employing exponential-affine fitting, we decompose depth estimation errors into depth compression, per-image affine transformations (including scaling, shearing, and translation), and residual errors. Our analysis reveals that human depth judgments exhibit systematic and consistent biases, including depth compression, a vertical bias (perceiving objects in the lower visual field as closer), and consistent per-image affine distortions across participants. Intriguingly, we find that DNNs with higher accuracy partially recapitulate these human biases, demonstrating greater similarity in affine parameters and residual error patterns. This suggests that these seemingly suboptimal human biases may reflect efficient, ecologically adapted strategies for depth inference from inherently ambiguous monocular images. However, while DNNs capture metric-level residual error patterns similar to humans, they fail to reproduce human-level accuracy in ordinal depth perception within the affine-invariant space. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating error patterns beyond raw accuracy, providing new insights into how humans and computational models resolve depth ambiguity. Our dataset and methodology provide a framework for evaluating the alignment between computational models and human perceptual biases, thereby advancing our understanding of visual space representation and guiding the development of models that more faithfully capture human depth perception.

                <p>by Malte Kobelt, Gerd T. Waldhauser, Marie-Christin Fellner, Nikolai Axmacher</p>

Involuntary memory retrieval is a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder and a frequent phenomenon in everyday autobiographical memory. However, the neural mechanisms that drive involuntary retrieval remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate how involuntary retrieval spontaneously initiates memory reactivation and how the reactivated neural representations differ in their content, distinctiveness and temporal compression from voluntary retrieval. Combining a visual half-field paradigm with electroencephalography recordings (EEG) in humans, we tracked reactivation of item-specific neural representations and sensory feature representations measured as representational similarity between different items sharing the same sensory feature – the visual field at encoding. We show that involuntary retrieval reactivated sensory feature-dependent yet item-unspecific representations via temporally extended memory replay, accompanied by rapid mid-frontal theta-power increases, indicating memory interference. This neural process differed from voluntary retrieval which recruited goal-directed memory search processes in prefrontal-medial temporal lobe theta-bands to reactivate temporally compressed item-specific representations devoid of visual field specific sensory feature representations at encoding. Our findings demonstrate that involuntary memories rely on distinct neural processes that access different representational formats compared to voluntary retrieval offering a nuanced understanding of episodic memory functioning relevant to psychological well-being.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our goal was to investigate the impact of polygenic susceptibility to hypertension on systolic blood pressure (BP), uncontrolled hypertension, and stroke among hypertensive patients with BP treatment prescription.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This genetic association study used data from the All of Us Research Program (2017–2023) and replicated findings using the United Kingdom Biobank (2006–2010). Participants prescribed BP medication ≥4 years, with diagnosed hypertension or ≥2 systolic BP measurements &gt;130mmHg, and without a previous stroke were categorized as having low, intermediate, or high polygenic susceptibility to hypertension using percentiles (&lt;20, 20–80, &gt;80) of a polygenic risk score for systolic BP. Primary outcomes were systolic BP, and uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP &gt; 140mmHg). The secondary outcome was incident stroke during 4-years follow-up. Multivariable linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regressions assessed the influence of polygenic susceptibility to hypertension on each outcome.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 51,006 participants (mean age = 56, 55% female) were included. Intermediate and high genetic risk were associated with higher systolic BP (intermediate: beta = 2.55, standard error [SE] = 0.16, high: beta = 4.81, SE= 0.20, all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and with 36% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28–1.44) and 80% (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.69–1.93) higher odds of uncontrolled hypertension, respectively. Furthermore, high genetic risk was associated with 23% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03–1.46) increased stroke hazard. These results were replicated in 84,259 participants (mean age = 61, female sex = 46%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Among hypertensive adults who were prescribed BP medication, polygenic susceptibility to hypertension correlates with higher systolic BP and higher rates of uncontrolled hypertension and stroke. Our findings support further research on personalized interventions targeting high-risk individuals. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Gu et al. showed that in rats fed a high-salt diet, reactive microglia accumulate around vasopressin-secreting neurons, phagocytosing astrocytic elements and pruning astrocytes. This causes glutamate spillover, increased neuronal activity, and excessive vasopressin release, contributing to salt-induced hypertension. The study reveals a novel mechanism by which microglia regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity through structural remodeling of astrocytes in the adult brain.

                <p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 19 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00962-x">doi:10.1038/s41583-025-00962-x</a></p>In this Journal Club, Benjamin Cowley discusses a 2009 tour-de-force that provided a recipe for constructing closed-loop algorithms by letting predictive models speak for themselves.

                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 19 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02999-2">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-02999-2</a></p>Coherent control of magnon excitations is crucial for their potential device application. The integration of the exceptional point in a magnon-photon hybrid system is shown to offer fast, coherent and topologically robust control of magnon-polariton states.

                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 19 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02998-3">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-02998-3</a></p>Deterministic control of the gain–loss balance in non-Hermitian systems remains challenging. A magnonic hybrid platform is now shown to enable this and, hence, coherently control excitations by leveraging an exceptional point.
