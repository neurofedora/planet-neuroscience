              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27306?af=R">Clinical and Molecular Genetic Characterization of Landau Kleffner Syndrome: An Observational Cohort and Experimental Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS), is a rare, poorly-understood epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep associated with mutations in <i>GRIN2A</i>, encoding the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2A subunit. Physicians rely on empirical treatments, with scarce information on treatment efficacy and outcomes. This study aims to improve the understanding and clinical management of LKS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-two patients with LKS were recruited via one quaternary referral center. Case-notes review delineated clinical features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the longitudinal association among electroencephalogram abnormalities, steroid therapy, and neuropsychological findings. After genetic screening, the impact of identified <i>GRIN2A</i> missense variants on NMDAR function was assessed using homology modeling, cell-surface trafficking assays, and electrophysiology in artificial synapses. Whole exome/genome sequencing was performed on <i>GRIN2A</i>-negative patients to identify novel gene associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LKS is complex with significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Besides speech and language impairment, many patients had other co-morbidities and almost half have long-term disability. Early age at disease onset was associated with worse outcomes. There was no reliable correlation between electroencephalogram findings and developmental scores. Steroid therapy improved language outcomes independently of electroencephalogram findings. <i>GRIN2A</i> mutations were identified in 15.5% of the cohort. Likely pathogenic variants in <i>GABBR2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>TRPC1</i>, <i>ERRFI1</i>, <i>CTXN3</i>, <i>IRX6</i>, and <i>IQCA1</i> were identified in 7 <i>GRIN2A-</i>negative individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For LKS, early intervention is important for long-term outcomes. Furthermore, management should not be based solely on electroencephalogram findings. Genetic and functional investigations offer insights into disease pathophysiology and facilitate development of future targeted therapies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78031?af=R">Identification of New KCNT1‐Epilepsy Drugs by In Silico, Cell, and Drosophila Modeling</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hyperactive KCNT1 potassium channels, caused by gain-of-function mutations, are associated with a range of epilepsy disorders. Patients typically experience drug-resistant seizures and, in cases with infantile onset, developmental regression can follow. KCNT1-related disorders include epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. There are currently no effective treatments for KCNT1 epilepsies, but suppressing overactive channels poses a potential strategy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the KCNT1 channel structure we in silico screened a library of known drugs for those predicted to block the channel pore to inhibit channel activity. Cellular KCNT1 channel inhibition was analyzed using electrophysiology and <i>Drosophila</i> bang-sensitive assays were used to analyze seizure suppression. Brain penetration of one drug was analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a mouse.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eight known drugs were investigated in vitro for their effects on patient-specific mutant KCNT1 channels, with 4 drugs showing significant reduction of K<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes. The action of the 4 drugs was then analyzed in vivo and 2 were found to reduce the seizure phenotype in humanized <i>Drosophila</i> KCNT1 epilepsy models. One drug, antrafenine, was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a known drug, antrafenine, that reduces KCNT1 channel activity, reduces seizure activity in <i>Drosophila</i>, and crosses the blood–brain barrier in the mouse, suggesting its potential applicability as a new treatment for KCNT1 epilepsy. The sequential in silico, in vitro, and in vivo mechanism-based drug selection strategy used here may have broader application for other human disorders where a disease mechanism has been identified.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78032?af=R">Behavior Decoding Delineates Seizure Microfeatures and Associated Sudden Death Risks in Mouse Models of Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Behavior and motor manifestations are distinctive yet often overlooked features of epileptic seizures. Seizures can result in transient disruptions in motor control, often organized into specific behavioral sequences that can inform seizure types, onset zones, and outcomes. However, refined analysis of behaviors in epilepsy remains challenging. Current manual video inspection approaches are subjective, time-consuming, and often overlook the intricate behavioral dynamics and action kinematics. This study investigates whether artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools can unravel complex behavior repertoire that can delineate seizure outcomes in a data-driven manner.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized two AI-aided tools, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Behavioral Segmentation of Open Field in DLC (B-SOiD), to decode underexplored behavior and action domains of induced seizures in a population of 32 inbred mouse strains that mimic human genetic diversity and a mouse model of Angelman syndrome.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our automated behavior classification tool identified 63 interpretable behavior groups. Analysis of these behavior groups demonstrates significant differential behavior usage and complexity that can delineate distinct seizure states, unravel intrinsic seizure progression over time, and inform mouse sex, strain backgrounds, and specific pathogenic mutations. We also identified seizure behavior transition dynamics and action/subaction kinematics, like hindlimb motions, that can determine the risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These behavior microfeatures can facilitate preclinical mechanistic studies and antiseizure medication screening at scales. These findings also underscore the translational potential of video-based seizure behavior decoding in both inpatient and outpatient settings, including analyzing videos captured by home surveillance devices and ubiquitous smartphones.

">Beyond Locomotion: How Specialized Motor Rhythms Enable Vertebrate Escape from Capture</a></h4>

              
                Escape behaviors following capture are crucial for survival, yet their underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated how Xenopus laevis tadpoles use struggling movements to escape head restraint. High-speed video tracking revealed a stereotyped sequence of body flexions with distinct kinematics during capture and release. We further recorded motoneuron and motor nerve activity along the body axis during fictive struggling to reconstruct biologically realistic struggling commands, to drive the movement of a biomechanically detailed tadpole model. Simulations showed that struggling - characterized by long-duration, low-frequency, caudorostral muscle activation -was optimized to generate escape forces. Notably, hydrodynamic thrust alone proved insufficient for release. However, direct mechanical interactions between the tadpole body and the restraining object generated additional reactive forces that facilitated escape. These findings demonstrate how animals use coordinated motor outputs and body mechanics to interact with environment to generate maximal freeing forces as the fundamental escape strategy.

">Lysosomal multi-omics reveals altered sphingolipid catabolism as driver of lysosomal dysfunction in the aging brain.</a></h4>

              
                Recent data indicate that lipid composition has profound influence on the brain function and that changes in lipid homeostasis affect brain aging and predisposition to neurodegenerative diseases. Lipids dynamically reside in multiple intracellular locations and their organellar distribution is important for specific interactions and biological function. During brain aging lipid changes have been specifically noted in lysosomes, but the identity of the accumulated lipids, their interactions with other biomolecules such as proteins, and their functional relevance have not been characterized. We used mass spectrometry (MS) to assess longitudinal changes in the lipidome and proteome of lysosomes isolated from the mouse cortex, from the age of 3- to 24-months. Our statistical and machine learning analyses identified two factors demonstrating predictive power for age and differences in both lipids and proteins. Of these, factor 1 was the best predictor of sample age. Factor 1 lipids with the highest feature importance included multiple species of hexosylceramides (HexCer) and their sulfonated derivatives, sulfatides (SHexCer), all of which increased with age. Increased factor 1 proteins included myelin proteins, select sphingolipid catabolism enzymes and proteins associated with lysosomal storage diseases. Our analyses suggested that mechanisms underlying factor 1 encompass the combination of an age-dependent increase in lysosomal delivery of myelin components and alterations in lysosomal sphingolipid catabolism favoring degradation of sphingomyelin over HexCer. The overall age-related lysosomal changes resembled those observed in lysosomal storage diseases, particularly Gaucher disease, where accumulation of HexCer species is associated with lysosomal dysfunction. To corroborate factor 1 predictions, we employed a combination of biochemical, imaging and flow cytometry approaches, which confirmed alterations in sphingolipid catabolism and lysosomal accumulation of myelin components. These changes were associated with age-related alteration in lysosomal morphology, lysosomal dysfunction and inhibition of autophagy in both neurons and microglia. Our findings indicate that factors contributing to lysosomal aging resemble those observed in lysosomal storage diseases and underscore the significance of organelle-specific analyses for dissecting mechanisms contributing to brain aging.

">Dual role of GABAB receptor in oligodendrocyte function and immune modulation in experimental multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                GABAB receptors (GABABR) mediate the actions of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the central nervous system, regulating key processes such as synaptic activity, interneuron communication and excitation-inhibition balance in the brain. Recent studies using the GABABR agonist baclofen have revealed a critical role for these receptors in promoting oligodendroglial differentiation in both health and disease, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we identify a dual role for oligodendroglial GABABR in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Conditional deletion of the GABAB1 subunit in NG2+ cells ameliorates acute disease symptoms while inducing an immune-like phenotype in oligodendrocytes. This immunomodulatory role is further supported by pharmacological activation of GABABR in oligodendrocytes, which reduces the expression of MHC class II in these cells. Notably, baclofen treatment after EAE symptom onset attenuates the course of the disease while enhancing oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and suppressing T cell infiltration into demyelinating lesions. Moreover, prophylactic baclofen administration delays disease onset and further decreases immune cell recruitment into the spinal cord, underscoring its potent immunomodulatory effect. These data demonstrate that GABABR signaling exerts context-dependent effects on both oligodendrocyte lineage progression and neuroinflammatory responses. Importantly, these compelling findings validate baclofen, a drug already approved for MS-associated spasticity, as a promising candidate for therapies targeting both inflammation and remyelination, advancing our understanding of glial-immune interactions in demyelinating diseases and supporting the translational potential of GABABR modulation in MS.

">In vivo single-cell gene editing using RNA electroporation reveals sequential adaptation of cortical neurons to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance</a></h4>

              
                The balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission is fundamental for normal brain function, yet the adaptation of individual neurons to disrupted excitatory-inhibitory balance is not well understood. We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.

">Interpreting convolutional neural networks to study wide-field amacrine cell inhibition in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Wide-field amacrine cells (ACs) play a unique role in retinal processing by integrating visual information across a large spatial area. Their inhibitory influence has been implicated in multiple retinal functions such as differential motion detection and the suppression of retinal activity during eye movements. However, a coherent understanding of their general function is lacking due to difficulties in directly recording from these cells and identifying effective visual stimuli to activate them. In this study, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to investigate wide-field inhibition mediated by wide-field ACs in the marmoset retina. We trained CNNs to mimic the function of the retina by predicting retinal ganglion cell (RGC) population responses to naturalistic movie stimuli and optimising the most exciting inputs (MEIs) to visualise RGCs' receptive field (RF) structures. We then optimized suppressive surrounds beyond classical RGC RF boundaries, intended to capture the inhibitory effect of wide-field ACs on RGC activity. These optimized surrounds reduced MEI-elicited activity by 10% to 30%, demonstrating that CNNs not only mimic retinal responses but can also reveal hidden computational aspects of wide-field inhibition. However, suppression strength and generalization varied across architectures and datasets, indicating potential model-specific effects, highlighting the importance of cautious interpretation. Overall, our approach illustrates how interpretability methods applied to artificial neural networks can offer new hypotheses regarding biological retinal computation, paving the way for targeted experimental validation.

">Neural responses to binocular in-phase and anti-phase stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Binocular vision fuses similar inputs from the two eyes into a single percept, whereas incompatible inputs can produce rivalry, lustre, or diplopia. We measured neural responses to binocular stimuli with different phase relationships to test predictions from contemporary binocular combination models. Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from 15 observers in response to monocular and binocular stimulation at 3 Hz, using either On/Off or counterphase flicker with varied spatial and temporal phase relationships. On/Off and counterphase flicker elicited responses at the expected fundamental frequency (3 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively) and their harmonics. Manipulating phase relationships modulated these response patterns, including a reduction in the fundamental amplitude for On/Off flicker. The data were modeled with a series of binocular combination algorithms, ranging in complexity from a simple linear sum to a two-stage binocular gain-control model with parallel monocular and binocular phase-selective channels. The model required parallel monocular channels to account for our data, whereas phase selectivity was not essential. Overall, the two-stage contrast gain-control model remains a powerful and flexible framework for describing binocular combinations across various experimental conditions and modalities.

">Altered Use of Prior Expectations and Modified Neural Dynamics in a Mouse Model of Autism</a></h4>

              
                In dynamic environments, updating beliefs based on past experiences (priors) is essential for optimal decision-making. Prior utilization is often impaired in psychiatric disorders, affecting perception and behavior. We investigate how Neurexin1 (Nrxn1) loss-of-function disrupts this process, providing insight into circuit deficits underlying sensorimotor dysfunction. While the synaptic role of Nrxn1 role is well studied, its impact on network dynamics and decision-making behavior remain unclear. Using widefield calcium imaging, we assess cortex-wide activity in mice performing a two-choice task to probe how priors influence visually-guided decisions. This task requires the mouse to combine sensory evidence with the prior probability over the stimulus side. We find Nrxn1 KO mice underutilized priors and were slower to update choices based on feedback. During decision-making, cortex-wide cortical activity is both elevated and increasingly correlated in Nrxn1 KO mice, independent of task period. Moreover, a larger fraction of cortical variance was explained by movement variables, consistent with stronger coupling of cortical activity to motor signals and a bias toward movement-related dynamics. These findings suggest that core computations underlying decision-making, such as integrating past experience with current evidence, depend on intact synaptic mechanisms shaped by genes like Nrxn1.

                An exciting aspect of neuroscience research is developing and testing hypotheses via experimentation. However, due to logistical and financial hurdles, this compelling part of neuroscience research is generally lacking in classroom education. To address this issue, here we introduce RetINaBox: a low-cost open-source electronic retina simulator that provides users with a hands-on system to discover how the visual system builds feature detectors. RetINaBox features an LED array for generating visual stimuli and a photodiode array that acts as a mosaic of model photoreceptors.

">How the characteristics of a virtual environment affects the perception of travel distance through it</a></h4>

              
                Although simulated self-motion through virtual environments has been widely used to investigate perceptual odometry, the characteristics of the virtual environments used, and the reported results have varied greatly. Here, we systematically vary the characteristics of the environment through which observers are moved in order to explore the effect of (1) the structure of an environment including the presence and texture of a ground surface, (2) the naturalism and scale of an environment, (3) colour, and (4) the density of a starfield and how it might affect perceived travel distance. In all four experiments, participants were visually moved forwards through a virtual environment and perceived travel distance was estimated by either (1) stopping at the location of a previously seen target (the Move-To-Target Task) or (2) adjusting the position of a target to indicate a previously travelled distance (the Adjust-Target Task). Data were analyzed in terms of gain (perceived travel distance/actual travel distance). Results show no significant differences that depended on the structure of an environment or on the presence or absence of a ground surface (Experiment 1), or on the naturalism of the environment (Experiment 2), or on whether the environment was in colour or in black and white (Experiment 3). However, there was a small effect of the texture of the ground surface and of the scale of the environment. In Experiment 4, we show that there may be a very low ceiling effect in the density of a starfield needed to accurately estimate travel distance. Together these experiments have implications for the design of real and virtual environments where perceived motion is important and will enable us to further predict our perception of moving through an environment.

">The nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum pathway regulates social play behavior via sex-specific mechanisms in juvenile rats</a></h4>

              
                Social play behavior is a rewarding behavior predominantly displayed by juveniles of various mammalian species, including humans and rats. Although the mesolimbic reward system is involved in the regulation of social play, how brain regions in this system interact to regulate social play behavior is unknown. Here, we determined the involvement of the ventral pallidum (VP) as well as inputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to the VP in the regulation of social play in male and female juvenile rats. We show that acute pharmacological inactivation of the VP, via microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, decreased social play behaviors in both sexes. Next, using Gad1-iCre rats, we show that chemogenetic stimulation of NAcGABA terminals in the VP decreased VP neuronal activation and decreased social play behaviors in both sexes. These findings together indicate that reduced inhibitory NAc input to the VP permits activation of the VP which facilitates the expression of social play behaviors. Lastly, we show that the equal expression of social play behavior in males and females is associated with a female-specific increase in NAc shell activation and a male-specific decrease in activation of the NAc shell neurons projecting to the VP. These sex-specific changes in NAc activity following social play exposure eliminated baseline sex differences in NAc activity. In conclusion, these findings support a model in which the sex-specific modulation of NAc inhibitory input to the VP facilitates activation of the VP that is necessary for the typical and equal expression of social play behavior in male and female juvenile rats.

">Subacute effects of ketamine on neural correlates of reward processing</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Ketamine's prohedonic properties have been linked to enhanced reward-related brain activation during the early post-infusion phase. Its effects during the subacute period (~2-24 h post-infusion), when psychotomimetic symptoms fade and neuroplastic adaptations emerge, are less well characterised. This study assessed ketamine's subacute effects on reward processing using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 28 healthy participants received 0.5 mg/kg racemic ketamine or placebo via 40-minute intravenous infusion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired ~5 h post-infusion. Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were obtained for individual area under the curve (AUC) estimation. Analyses focused on the contrast between expected and actual trial outcomes. Results: At five hours post-infusion, ketamine did not significantly modulate MID task-related brain activation, despite pronounced subjective drug effects. Pharmacokinetic modelling confirmed expected ketamine and norketamine profiles, but neither drug exposure (AUC) nor subjective measures correlated with neural activation. Conclusions: Prohedonic effects of ketamine may not sufficiently manifest in MID task-related activation in healthy individuals ~5 hours after infusion. The lack of significant effects provides valuable extension of the existing literature, as ketamine's effects might be confined to a more acute time window or differ in clinical populations.

">Neural Encoding of Immediate and Instrumental Value During Planning</a></h4>

              
                Planning is a key executive function enabling humans to anticipate future outcomes by mentally simulating action sequences, balancing immediate gains against long-term goals. However, prior research on planning often conflated it with either spatial navigation or reward-based learning, and little is known about the relative encoding of the immediate and instrumental value of the same action. We used a novel fMRI task in which participants repeatedly chose between two options, each with an immediate monetary value and a known future-oriented instrumental value. Our results show that striatal activity is positively correlated with instrumental value, whereas activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and bilateral insula is negatively correlated with the instantaneous point value. These dissociable patterns support specialization in valuation neural circuits during planning.

">Redefining Parkinson's Disease by Dysregulated Genetic Networks in Distinct Cell Types</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is classically linked to dopaminergic neuron loss, but emerging evidence suggests broader cellular involvement. Here we show that PD risk variants converge on distinct molecular networks across specific brain cell types, enabling stratification of patients into six subgroups: dopaminergic, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (O), excitatory (E), dopaminergic/excitatory, dopaminergic/oligodendrocyte and other. While all subgroups exhibit motor symptoms, the E-group individuals also display more severe non-motor symptoms, including dementia, hyposmia, and REM sleep behavior disorder. The O-group individuals exhibit reduced myelin integrity, as demonstrated by diffusion tensor imaging, implicating NRG6 (formerly C1orf56), a previously uncharacterized high-risk PD gene. We show that NRG6 encodes a conserved epidermal growth factor-like domain structurally and functionally analogous to neuregulin-1, which is critical for oligodendrocyte development and myelination. These findings redefine the cellular architecture of PD vulnerability and identify neuregulin-like signaling in oligodendrocytes as a potential contributor to non-motor symptoms.

">Consistency in phonetic categorization predicts successful speech-in-noise perception</a></h4>

              
                Listeners bin continuous changes in the speech signal into phonetic categories. But they vary in how consistently/discretely they assign speech sounds to categories, which may relate to speech-in-noise (SIN) perception. Yet, it is unclear if and how perceptual gradience, consistency, and other cognitive factors (e.g., working memory) collectively predict SIN performance. Here, we estimated perceptual gradiency and response consistency during vowel labeling and assessed working memory and SIN performance. We found perceptual consistency and working memory were the best predictors of listeners' composite SIN scores. Our findings emphasize the importance of perceptual consistency over categoricity for noise-degraded speech perception.

">Erythropoietin alleviates intellectual disability and autism-like behavior of mice caused by Zbtb20 haploinsufficiency, a construct-valid model of Primrose syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Among the known genetic causes of syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are transcription factor deficiencies. In this regard, haploinsufficiency of the Zinc finger and broad complex, tramtrack, bric and brac domain-containing protein 20 (ZBTB20) leads to a prototypical clinical picture, referred to as Primrose syndrome, comprising severe ASD symptoms together with intellectual disability. Here, we present a comprehensive behavioral and phenotypical characterization of Zbtb20+/-mice, a construct valid model of this thus far untreatable human condition. Zbtb20+/- mice exhibit diminished sociability, reduced vocalization, distinct repetitive behaviors, impaired cognitive flexibility, hyperactivity and hypoalgesia. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals increased volumes of hippocampus, cerebellum, brain matter, and whole brain, confirmed by postmortem brain weight measurements. Due to our previous observation of enhanced ZBTB20 expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons upon recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) injections, we anticipated a mitigating effect of rhEPO treatment for Primrose syndrome. Indeed, after just three weeks of alternate-day rhEPO injections, a remarkable improvement in the behavioral phenotype was observed. Our results higlight rhEPO as a first promising treatment for Primrose syndrome.

">Sequential sampling from memory underlies perceptual decisions unyoked from actions</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decision-making refers to the class of decisions in which sensory evidence is used to categorize percepts and guide actions. Conventionally, categorical decisions are thought to precede motor actions. However, recent studies in nonhuman primates challenge this assumption -- when perceptual decisions were uncoupled from the actions they bear upon, animals postponed the decisions until relevant response options were revealed. To determine whether this postponement stems from cognitive limitations unique to nonhuman primates, we conducted a similar experiment with human subjects. Naive subjects viewed a random-dot motion (RDM) stimulus that was difficult to categorize. After a delay period following the RDM, two choice targets were presented and subjects decided which target lay closer to the perceived motion direction. Decision accuracy varied across subjects, reflecting individual differences in ability to integrate motion evidence. Notably, subjects with higher decision accuracy showed prolonged deliberation after choice-target presentation. Furthermore, the time they took to report their decisions depended on the strength of the motion evidence. This pattern of accuracy and decision reporting time could be accounted for by a bounded diffusion model in which subjects sequentially sample stored sensory information from memory during the target selection phase. When the RDM was challenging to categorize, the subsequent appearance of the targets provided a framework to interrogate stored evidence and render a decision. Our results reveal a strategic feature of working memory of retaining information based on its future utility. This observation opens new avenues for investigating how memory and decision-making interact.

">Frequency-dependent coupling in responses to oscillatory inputs in networks of electrically coupled nodes: Gap junction networks and spatially extended neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal filters describe the neuronal information processing building blocks where specific frequency components of the output are enhanced over others. The result of the interaction of neuronal filters across nodes in a network is captured by the frequency-dependent amplitude and phase-difference coupling coefficients (CCs), respectively, which extend the notion of the steady-state CC to include frequency-dependent processes. These metrics are shaped by the interplay of the participating ionic and synaptic currents and the external inputs. The underlying biophysical and dynamic mechanisms are largely unknown beyond electrically coupled passive cells. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of interaction of cellular neuronal filters in electrically coupled networks. We use biophysically plausible (conductance-based) mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, analytical calculations and dynamical systems tools. We focus on a family of models that include gap junction connected cells and compartmental models of spatially extended neurons. We consider a network of two electrically connected nodes receiving oscillatory inputs. This is the minimal network architecture that allows for a systematic study of the biophysical and dynamic mechanisms that shape the CC profiles. The participating neurons are either passive cells (low-pass filters) or resonators (band-pass filter) and exhibit lagging or mixed leading-lagging phase-shift responses as the input frequency increases. First, we use linear models to understand how the participating building blocks (e.g., conductances, negative and positive feedback effects) operating at the single node level give rise to the amplitude and phase CC profiles with band-pass filtering properties. Then, we extend our investigation and use linearized models of nonlinear of neurons with biophysically realistic ionic currents to investigate (to the linear level of approximation) how the presence of cellular ionic currents and cellular resonance/phasonance contribute to shaping the corresponding (amplitude and phase) CC profiles and determine their preferred coupling frequencies. Motivated by experimental results on subthreshold resonance in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, we use three ionic currents: persistent sodium (amplifying), mixed sodium-potassium h- (resonant and hyperpolarization-activated) and M-type slow potassium (resonant and depolarization-activated). Finally, we extend our investigation to include the model nonlinearities to understand how the CC profiles are shaped by the interaction between the pre-J and post-J cells, and not just the post-J cells as it is the case for linear models. For gap junction connected networks, the connectivity is typically symmetric, while for compartmental models is asymmetric as the result of the different geometries of the participating compartments. We investigate the effects of asymmetric connectivity to understand how the compartmental geometry interacts with the neuronal biophysical properties to shape the CC profiles and determine the preferred coupling frequencies. The formalism and tools we develop and use in this paper can be extended to larger networks with an arbitrary number of nodes, to spatially extended multicompartment neuronal models, and to neurons having other types of ionic currents such as the T-type calcium current. The principles that emerge from our study are directly applicable to these scenarios. Our results make experimentally testable predictions and have implications for the understanding of spike transmission, synchronic firing and coincidence detection in electrically coupled networks in the presence of oscillatory inputs.

">Transcriptional dynamics of the oligodendrocyte lineageand its regulation by the brain erythropoietin system</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes differentiate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) in early postnatal development, but some oligodendrogenesis is maintained throughout adulthood, where oligodendrocyte lineage dynamics may contribute to neuroplasticity, adaptive myelination, and myelin repair. Here, we studied the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) on oligodendrocyte lineage dynamics employing murine hippocampus and its myelinated fibers as model region. Using multiple stage-specific markers and single-nuclei-RNA-seq data, we find that EPO stimulates all oligodendroglial lineage cells directly, driving differentiation/maturation. Differential gene expression analysis reveals multiple EPO-regulated mRNAs, including downregulated transcripts for GABA-A receptors, fitting the known inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation by GABA. Importantly, analogous oligodendrocyte responses are seen when endogenous EPO expression in brain is stimulated by hypoxia. Mice lacking EPOR from mature oligodendrocytes show subtle deficiencies of adult myelination in hippocampal fimbria and mild working memory deficits. These gain- and loss-of-function experiments may further suggest EPO as clinically safe treatment for remyelination therapies.

">A phenotypic brain organoid atlas for neurodevelopmental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Thousands of genes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), yet mechanisms and targeted treatments remain elusive. To fill these gaps, we present a CIRM-initiated NDD biobank of 352 publicly-available genetically-diverse patient-derived iPSCs, along with clinical details, brain imaging and genomic data, representing four major categories of disease: microcephaly (MIC), polymicrogyria (PMG), epilepsy (EPI), and intellectual disability (ID). From 35 representative patients, we studied over 6000 brain organoids for histology and single cell transcriptomics. Compared with an organoid library from ten neurotypicals, patients showed distinct cellular defects linked to underlying clinical disease categories. MIC showed defects in cell survival and excessive TTR+ cells, PMG showed intermediate progenitor cell junction defects, EPI showed excessive astrogliosis, and ID showed excessive generation of TTR+ cells. Our organoid atlas demonstrates both conserved and divergent NDD category-specific phenotypes, bridging genotype and phenotype. This NDD iPSC biobank can support future disease modeling and therapeutic approaches.

">Distinct Implicit Contributions to Action Selection and Action Execution in Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system is continuously adjusted to minimize error. Current theories assume that this adaptation process entails the operation of multiple learning systems, with a key division between implicit and explicit components. Recent studies have revealed several inconsistencies regarding the characteristics and constraints of the implicit system, suggesting that the current framework is incomplete. Here, we propose that these conflicting findings can be understood by recognizing that there are multiple implicit subcomponents, distinguished by their distinct computational goals. One well-studied component is implicit recalibration, a process critical for action execution which uses sensory-prediction errors to automatically refine the sensorimotor map. Here we describe a second, novel component, implicit aiming, a process which contributes to action selection to achieve the specific goals. Through a series of studies, we find compelling evidence that those two implicit processes show a clear separation in their temporal stabilities and contextual modulations. These distinct properties correspond to different computational frameworks attributing learning dynamics to either contextual inference or cancellation of competing neural populations, respectively. Together, these findings suggest an alternative framework for sensorimotor adaptation based on the computational goals of the system rather than phenomenology.

">CCL5/CCR5 signaling modulates depression-relevant behavior, neuronal oscillations, and long-term depression of synaptic activity.</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder, often associated with perseverative thinking and anxiety. Localized reductions in pyramidal cell activity may contribute to associated symptoms, and effective antidepressant treatments typically enhance overall neuronal excitation. CCL5 is a chemokine that has been shown to reduce excitatory-neuronal activity, and is also increased with MDD and conditions that increase MDD risk. Here, we investigate the CCL5/CCR5 axis for its ability to modulate depression-relevant endpoints that are diminished in MDD, including neuronal oscillations, as well as biochemical and behavioral correlates of the disorder. In comparison to wildtype mice, CCR5 knockouts had increased gamma and theta power, and stronger theta/high-gamma phase amplitude coupling during dark-cycle EEG recordings. Compared to strain-matched wildtype mice, CCR5 knockouts also demonstrated reduced anxiety, increased sucrose preference, and improved associative memory. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus showed that CCR5 knockouts had reduced levels of the GABA receptor alpha-4 subunit, which mediates tonic inhibition and restricts pyramidal cell plasticity. In complementary primary neuronal culture studies, CCL5 diminished GSK-beta activity and impaired NMDA-dependent long-term depression (LTD), a form of plasticity that promotes cognitive flexibility. In addition,CCL5 signaling reduced parvalbumin expression in GABAergic neurons through a CCR5-dependent manner. In combination with the ability of CCR5 to restrain gamma oscillation power and LTD, our data raise the possibility that CCL5/CCR5 signaling inhibits neuronal excitation through increased PV+ interneuron activity. Moreover, data are consistent with the possibility that CCR5 antagonists might share the ability of established antidepressants to both increase PC excitation and reduce PC inhibition.

">High-density extracellular recordings from the interior of intact brain organoids enable automated high-throughput functional assay</a></h4>

              
                Bridging the gap between preclinical screening and clinical outcomes remains a major challenge in drug development for neurological disorders. Brain organoids, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, offer a scalable and physiologically relevant platform to model human neural circuits. We develop a fully automated system to record neural activity from the interior of intact human cortical organoids using a high-density microfabricated probe. The robotic system completes insertion within minutes while preserving organoid integrity and enables immediate recording of spontaneous spikes. We extract physiologically grounded and deterministic spike features, and train a long short-term memory classifier to distinguish between organoids derived from healthy individuals and those harboring familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutations in the amyloid precursor protein. Despite intra-class variability, the classifier differentiates between organoid classes with 100% accuracy. The model classifies AD organoids treated with a drug candidate that reduces amyloid-{beta} levels as retaining an AD-like electrophysiological phenotype, demonstrating that functional readout can contradict molecular markers. The findings establish a high-throughput functional framework that may complement and extend existing drug screening assays.

">Commonality and Variability in Functional Networks In Young Children Under 5 Years Old</a></h4>

              
                Functional brain networks exhibit striking individual variability in adults, while less is known about the functional network variability in young children under 5 years. Conventional group-average approaches to obtain the group-level network may have obscured some fine developmental details. We combined data-driven template creation at a coarse parcel level and template-matching at a fine vertex level to map individualized functional networks from single fMRI scans in children aged 8-60 months in two datasets, revealing four key insights: (1) Individual-specific networks show moderate stability across longitudinal scans (Normalized Mutual Information ~ 0.52 with ~ 20 minutes of low-motion data) despite developmental changes; (2) Across the population, sensory cortices demonstrate higher consistency in network assignment than association cortices; (3) Network lateralization in the language network increases with age and correlates with age-normalized verbal developmental quotient (r ~ 0.17), suggesting a correspondence between the individual functional topography and the emergence of functional specialization; and (4) Our 23-network solution identifies finer subdivisions than previously reported using group-average approaches, with many networks resembling the subdivisions found in adult fMRI data. Our findings revealed neurodevelopmental variations in functional network topography that are reliable within individuals and behaviorally relevant, opening new avenues for investigating how person-specific network architecture supports emerging cognitive abilities.

">A comparison of movement-related neuronal activities in cerebellar- and basal ganglia-recipient regions of the macaque thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The ventral lateral (VL) nucleus of the thalamus relays signals from the cerebellum (Cb) and basal ganglia (BG) to primary motor cortex (M1). In primates, glutamatergic Cb efferents from the deep cerebellar nuclei and GABAergic BG efferents from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) terminate in distinct subregions of VL: the posterior (VLp) and anterior (VLa) divisions, respectively. This anatomical segregation suggests that Cb- and BG-thalamocortical circuits may play distinct roles in motor control, which could be revealed by comparing movement-related activity in VLp and VLa. Here, we recorded single-unit activity from VLp and VLa, identified via electrical stimulation of superior cerebellar peduncle and GPi, during a choice reaction time reaching task. We also recorded from M1, which maintains bidirectional connections with both VLp and VLa. VLa neurons exhibited a significantly higher proportion of decrease-type responses compared with VLp and M1, consistent with inhibitory GPi input. Time-resolved general linear model analysis showed dynamic encoding of task parameters, particularly movement direction, in all three regions. Direction encoding was strongest in M1, moderate in VLp, and weakest in VLa. Direction encoding in VLa also lagged behind that in M1 and VLp. Clustering analysis of direction encoding strength and timing revealed a subpopulation of VLp neurons that encoded direction particularly strongly during the reaction time period. These results highlight a limitation of traditional assumptions that activity characteristics are distributed homogeneously across neural populations and point to a novel functional organization within VLp neurons.

">netneurotools: a trainee-oriented approach to network neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Brain imaging is an increasingly inter-disciplinary field, encompassing multiple data types and multiple analytic traditions. Projects typically involve many moving parts, such as building customized preprocessing pipelines, transforming between data formats, preparing datasets for analysis, and ultimately displaying results. The field is conventionally built on highly specialized software packages that solve these individual challenges well, but are not necessarily designed to be interoperable. Trainees new to the field are therefore often left to come up with isolated heuristics and workarounds to complete a project. Here we present a way to navigate the increasingly complex informatics ecosystem of brain imaging. netneurotools is our lab's internal Python toolkit that has been continuously developed and maintained by the lab's trainees. The philosophy of the toolkit is that it should be the Swiss army knife of the lab: functions and routines that we often use but that are not part of any established pipeline or package. Since its inception, the toolkit has been open and welcomes contribution from neuroscientists across the globe. netneurotools presents a necessary counterweight to out-of-the-box software packages and highlights the importance of smaller, ad hoc functions for implementing projects. By opening a window into the inner workings of a lab, netneurotools also presents an opportunity to begin a new type of discourse among groups and establish tangible links within the community.

">Inside Out: Functional Flexibility in Assigning the Body's inside-outside</a></h4>

              
                Tactile surface perception is often assumed to reflect a fixed boundary between body and world, with the skin providing a stable oriented surface that separates inside from outside. We show that this assumption fails in functionally specific ways. Using moving tactile stimuli on the hand, participants perceived stimulus direction on the fingertips as reversed when hand posture changed - reporting motion as if it originated from the opposite side of the skin, while responses on the palm were less consistent and less sensitive to posture. Congenitally blind participants exhibited stable, individualized surface assignments on the fingertips, demonstrating that vision is not required to construct oriented tactile surfaces. However, visual experience modulated posture effects: sighted individuals showed posture-dependent skin-orientation assignments driven by motion direction, whereas congenitally blind individuals showed posture-invariant assignments determined by functional use. These findings indicate that tactile surface perception is not globally fixed but dynamically inferred according to functional demands; rather than enforcing a purely geometric body-world boundary, the brain flexibly assigns where the surface is and which side we occupy.

                <p>Depression and anxiety are often characterized by altered reward-seeking and avoidance, respectively. Yet less is known about the relationship between depressive symptoms and specific avoidance behaviors. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates and online workers completed an uninstructed go/no-go avoidance task (<I>N</I><SUB>Total</SUB> = 465) as a reverse translation of a rodent paradigm. Participants exhibited a wide range of symptom scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), ranging from low to severe. In Study 1, cues were used to signal the response type (go/active vs no-go/inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Higher depressive scores were associated with poorer acquisition of active avoidance in undergraduates. Overall participants showed lower accuracy for active than inhibitory avoidance. To examine whether the better no-go trial performance reflected a prepotent response to avoid aversive outcomes, in Study 2, undergraduates (<I>N</I><SUB>Total</SUB> = 330) completed a version of the task that included reward-seeking. Here all participants showed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance, consistent with a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. These findings suggest that in young adults, depressive symptoms are associated with difficulty in overriding prepotent responses to actively avoid aversive outcomes in the absence of reward. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that could guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) imposes a significant global health burden, yet effective treatments remain limited. There are no well-characterized, AUD-relevant, rodent biological sample repositories to support research in this area. To address this gap, we established the Alcohol Biobank, a comprehensive resource containing thousands of samples from over 700 (half males, half females) genetically diverse heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. Modeled after two successful cocaine and oxycodone biobanks, this repository uses the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) model, paired with oral self-administration, to characterize AUD-like behaviors, including ethanol consumption, preference, motivation, and withdrawal symptoms such as allodynia and anxiety-like behavior. Longitudinal samples (blood, urine, and feces) are collected before, during, and after ethanol exposure, while tissue samples (brain, heart, kidneys, liver, cecum, reproductive organs, adrenal glands, blood) are obtained at intoxication, acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence, or from naive controls. Samples are preserved via snap-freezing or paraformaldehyde fixation to support diverse applications, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and neuroanatomy. Samples are freely available to nonprofit organizations at <A HREF="www.alcoholbiobank.org">www.alcoholbiobank.org</A>. Genetic and behavioral data about these rats are deposited in public repositories. The Alcohol Biobank facilitates collaborative research to uncover biomarkers and develop novel therapies for AUD, addressing a critical need in addiction science.</p>

                <p>Aversion modulation is a key component of hedonic processing, and its dysfunction is evident in psychiatric illnesses. The infralimbic cortex (IL) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) pathway is essential in hedonic processing in rodents but operates differentially across sex, with beta (20&nbsp;Hz) oscillatory activity involved in learned aversion in male but not female rats. In this study, we used taste reactivity (TR) and electrophysiology to examine the role of high gamma (80&nbsp;Hz) activity in affect modulation, specifically innate (quinine) and learned (conditioned taste aversion, CTA) aversion, in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in males showed no changes in IL or NAcSh activity, or in IL-&gt;NAcSh functional connectivity, in the high gamma frequency band during innate or learned aversion. In contrast, in females, quinine elicited an increase in IL and NAcSh 80&nbsp;Hz LFP activity and IL-&gt;NAcSh functional connectivity. Interestingly, LFP directionality analyses in females indicated that top-down modulation from IL to NAcSh was associated with innate aversive behavior expression. To confirm a causal link of 80&nbsp;Hz activity in aversion processing in females, optogenetics was used. Here, optogenetic stimulation of the IL-&gt;NAcSh pathway did not affect learned (CTA) aversion but it selectively decreased innate (quinine) aversion. Collectively, these results highlight sex- and frequency-specific differences in aversion modulation by the IL-&gt;NAcSh pathway, with high gamma frequencies involved in modulating innate aversion, specifically in female rats.</p>

                Background Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. We report a case which had been misdiagnosed at three different healthcare centers before receiving the correct diagnosis and management. Methods The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Set (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Results Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test—initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. Conclusions This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.

                Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent bacterial infection among women of reproductive age. Inappropriate and irrational prescribing of antibiotics—such as the use of unapproved fixed-dose combinations or empirical broad-spectrum therapy—has contributed to growing antimicrobial resistance. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) further complicate treatment outcomes, yet remain underreported, especially in routine outpatient practice. Therefore, an assessment of current prescribing patterns is essential to promote rational drug use. Additionally, evaluation of adverse drug reactions remains important for patient safety and pharmacovigilance. Objectives • To describe the prescribing patterns of drugs used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) among women of reproductive age (15–44 years). • To evaluate the incidence, type, and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as documented in hospital records. • To assess the prescription of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) and combination antimicrobial therapy in relation to standard treatment guidelines (WHO, NLEM 2022). Methods This is a retrospective observational study based on outpatient department (OPD) prescriptions for women aged 15–44 years diagnosed with community-acquired, uncomplicated UTIs at a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Data from 139 prescription records will be retrieved from the medical record section and analyzed. Prescribing indicators, documented ADRs, and use of FDCs will be assessed against national guidelines using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis.

                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background A. catechu (Areca catechu Linn.; A. catechu) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Dendrathema grandiflora (chrysanthemum; D. grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared A. catechu and D. grandiflora polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (20% A. catechu:80% D. grandiflora), F2 (50% A. catechu:50% D. grandiflora), F3 (80% A. catechu:20% D. grandiflora), and normal group. Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenase assay, high concentration of A. catechu (F3) induced the abundant of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions The combination of A. catechu and D. grandiflora extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background Documentary digitization in municipalities has emerged as a critical strategy for enhancing efficiency in administrative processes and reducing operational costs, aligning with the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 8, which promotes sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth. In the context of Latin America, and particularly in Peru, municipalities face significant challenges related to bureaucracy, inefficient resource allocation, and limited technological adoption. Therefore, the implementation of document digitization represents not only a technological innovation but also a mechanism to strengthen transparency, accountability, and sustainable management practices within the public sector. Methodology This study employed a quantitative approach with a non-experimental, descriptive, and explanatory design. The research was conducted in a municipality located in the Amazonas region of Peru. The target population consisted of 125 administrative workers, from which a statistically representative sample of 95 was selected. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics and inferential techniques to assess the relationship between documentary digitization and cost reduction. Results The findings revealed that the adoption of document digitization significantly contributes to improving resource management, minimizing the duplication of tasks, and reducing operational costs associated with paper-based procedures. The study also identified secondary benefits, such as enhanced information security and improved knowledge management practices, which collectively strengthen institutional performance. Conclusion This research provides empirical evidence that document digitization exerts a significant influence on cost reduction and overall efficiency in municipal management. Beyond economic savings, the process enhances organizational sustainability by promoting secure information handling and fostering a culture of innovation within public administration. The study’s relevance lies in its demonstration of how digitization can optimize public sector performance, while its novelty is reflected in the practical application of these principles in a municipality in Amazonas, Peru.

                Background The conventional preanesthetic evaluation process can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Preanesthetic questionnaires have been proposed to alleviate the burden on clinical resources. This study aimed to assess the reliability and predictive accuracy of a pediatric preanesthetic screening questionnaire as a potential alternative to the standard preanesthetic consultation. Methods An evaluative, prospective, cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted from October 2022 to May 2023 in the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Anesthesiology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis. A 43-item bilingual (French/Arabic) paper-based questionnaire was completed for 300 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) scheduled for elective surgery. Responses were compared with standard preanesthetic evaluations by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) for agreement. Results All 300 patients completed the questionnaire (completion rate = 100%). Most were classified as ASA Physical Status I (78.3%). Agreement between questionnaire responses and physician assessments was excellent for 34 of 43 items (κ > 0.8; p < 0.001), with perfect agreement (κ = 1.000; p < 0.001) for item 10. Near-perfect agreement was observed for ASA classification (κ = 0.953; p < 0.001; concordance rate = 98.3%). Eight items had κ values between 0.397 and 0.798, and one item (myopathy) could not be analyzed due to uniformly negative responses. Conclusion The pediatric preanesthesia questionnaire demonstrated high reliability and strong agreement with physician assessments. It may serve as an effective triage tool to optimize outpatient workflows and reduce clinical workload, particularly for low-risk pediatric patients.

                Forest fires are becoming increasingly common worldwide, posing a threat to the environment, economy, and society. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires is important to understand their characteristics and causes and to inform decision-making. This type of analysis requires the availability of a number of factors that contribute to fire occurrence, such as land use, environment, climate, and human activities, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The South American Amazon rainforest covers a large area, and acquiring a useful dataset for analysis requires extensive effort and computer-intensive processing. This study investigates potential data sources, establishes a methodology, and prepares a dataset of attributes useful for spatiotemporal fire analysis. We provide a raster-based dataset that includes fires, land use, environment, and climate factors at a spatial resolution of 500 m and monthly resolution from 2001 to 2020, which facilitates the analysis of forest fires in the Amazon. Moreover, because data sources and implementation procedures are detailed, this work also encourages similar research in other parts of the world.

                Background Synthetic cells have emerged as promising tools for targeted, efficient, and sustainable environmental cleanup, and there is a growing need to understand not only their technical potential but also the biosafety, biosecurity, and governance implications of their deployment in natural ecosystems. Despite their innovative promise, there are currently no standardized global frameworks to assess and manage their risks, particularly those concerning ecological disruption, misuse, and public acceptance. Therefore, this study explored the dual nature of synthetic cells as a tool for ecological restoration. Method This study conducted stakeholder perception analysis through seven expert interviews and surveys involving 70 respondents, primarily from academia and the environmental policy sector. Thematic analysis was used to extract the key concerns. Results Stakeholders highlighted the strong support for the potential of technology in pollutant degradation and climate mitigation. However, major concerns have emerged regarding unintended gene transfer, containment failure, dual-use risks, and a lack of international regulation. The thematic analysis revealed the need for risk assessment strategies, containment measures, and regulatory oversight. Conclusion Recommendations include the development of standardized risk assessment protocols, lifecycle containment strategies, transparent public engagement, and international collaboration. Policymakers must act early to ensure that the environmental benefits of this emerging technology can be realized while mitigating the associated risks.

                This paper’s main purpose is to systematically review both theoretical and empirical literature about the relationship between corporate governance variables and the performance of microfinance institutions. The theoretical reviews were: agency theory, stakeholders’ theory, resource dependency theory, stewardship theory, and social contract theory, which deal with corporate governance mechanism and their effect on the firm’s performance. Empirical studies carried out in different countries at different times together with other findings, were reviewed to compare the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of microfinance institutions and to establish areas of gaps for further studies. Board characteristics, which include size, education, meeting frequency, board composition, and board independence, and their effect on the financial performance of microfinance institutions were discussed. The findings of the study reveal that sound corporate governance improves the performance of Microfinance Institutions. The findings of different scholars show a lack of consistency on the effect of corporate governance variables on the financial performance of Microfinance Institutions, so further investigation is required from potential scholars. Finally, theoretical, measurement, and methodological drawbacks of previous studies were identified, and significant recommendations were forwarded for future studies in this area.

                Gamification has become relevant in the field of higher education, facilitating the teaching and learning process. There are studies that show a positive relationship between gamification and academic performance. A systematic literature review was developed, applying the prism method and using three databases: Scopus, WOS and Scielo. The results indicate a notorious orientation of the studies towards quantitative research. Ninety-two percent of the selected documents have students as their population, while 6% are oriented to teachers and 2% to both. In the more in-depth results, it can be demonstrated that gamification is linked to the generation of critical thinking and the improvement of academic performance in the context of higher education. The analysis of theoretical structures reveals that the most relevant approaches for the study of gamification are self-determination and gamified learning. It is also evident that there is a positive relationship between gamification and motivation in learning processes, which allows encouraging the development of critical thinking and the improvement of academic performance.

                Background Latest technological developments make it possible to extract unstructured data from the online world, enabling researchers to uncover important correlations between cyberspace and real space in order to evaluate urban environments. Instagram, by its geotag and hashtag features, provides a formidable database of the sort, in which user activity can strongly impact the salience of material loci. The study aimed at determining and calculating the Tehran Book Garden urban space’s popularity by using the #bookgarden hashtag and geolocations of the active Instagram userbase. Techniques The data were gathered on Instagram via the Application Programming Interface (API) and then analyzed via spatial networking on geographical mappings. Key variables included the geo-coordinate positions of posts, concentration of user activity, and time-based trends. The interpolation method was then used in determining regions that have unusual patterns of networking based on the hashtag and determining the area of influence most actively engaged. Results and Conclusions The study showed that central and southeastern regions of Tehran exhibited highest levels of virtual activity concerning the Book Garden. Using a triangulation-based interpolation method, the study traced a specific zone of influence, acknowledging the spatial location of the Book Garden and neighboring culture districts as a “hidden layer” having a significant impact (Level 4) on the space’s popularness. The study showed that peak activity was at 4 PM, and access issues were correlated with lower popularness during evening hours. This work presents a novel and reliable methodology for determining the attractiveness of cityscapes through social media data, thus providing a reproducible template for later research in the context of urban geography.

                Background this study examines the modernization of Saudi’s Commercial Agency Law the 2022–2023 reforms, with a focus on legal, economic, and comparative dimensions. For decades, the previous framework faced criticism for its rigid nationality restrictions, procedural inefficiencies, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The reforms form part of the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy, aiming to diversify the economy, strengthen private sector competitiveness, and integrate more fully with global trade systems. This research also evaluates how the reforms align with Shariah principles, balancing commercial flexibility with religious compliance. Methods the study adopts a doctrinal legal methodology, systematically analyzing statutory amendments and implementing regulations considering Saudi case law and policy statements. A comparative approach is employed to benchmark the reforms against best practices in jurisdictions such as the UAE and the UK, with particular emphasis on contract termination rules, registration systems, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Sources include secondary data such as official gazettes, ministerial circulars, judicial precedents, and academic literature. Results key legislative changes include the relaxation of nationality requirements for commercial agents, enabling broader foreign participation; the digitalization of agency registration and renewal processes, reducing administrative burdens; clarified termination and compensation provisions, enhancing contractual certainty; and formal recognition of arbitration clauses, offering greater dispute resolution flexibility. These reforms have the potential to significantly improve market transparency, reduce litigation and attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Conclusions although the reforms represent a significant advancement, challenges remain, including judicial consistency in interpreting the new provisions, resistance among entrenched market players, and the need for enhanced regulatory guidance. The paper recommends targeted judicial and practitioner training, proactive awareness campaigns, and GCC-wide legal harmonization to amplify reform benefits. Implemented effectively, these measures could solidify Saudi Arabia’s role as a regional leader in commercial agency regulation, strengthen investor confidence, and advance the Kingdom’s long-term economic diversification goals.

                <p>by Giacomo Severini, David Muñoz</p>

Predictive simulations based on explicit, physiologically inspired, control policies, can be used to test theories on motor control and to evaluate the effect of interventions on the different components of control. Several control architectures have been proposed for simulating locomotor tasks, based on fully feedback, reflex-based, controllers, or on feedforward architectures mimicking the Central Pattern Generators. Hybrid architectures integrating both feedback and feedforward components represent a viable alternative to fully feedback or feedforward controllers. Current literature on controller-based simulations almost exclusively presents task-specific controllers that do not generalize across different tasks. The task-specificity of current controllers limits the generalizability of the neurophysiological principles behind such controllers. Here we propose a hybrid controller for predictive simulations of cycling where the feedforward component is based on a well-known theoretical model, the Unit Burst Generation model, and the feedback component includes a limited set of reflex pathways, expected to be active during steady cycling. We show that this controller can simulate physiological stationary cycling patterns at different desired speeds and seat heights. We also show that the controller can generalize to walking behaviors by just adding an additional control component for accounting balance needs. The controller here proposed, although simple in design, represent an instance of physiologically inspired generalizable controller for cyclical lower limb tasks.

Despite the importance of memories in everyday life and the progress made in understanding how they are encoded and retrieved, the neural processes by which declarative memories are maintained or forgotten remain elusive. Part of the problem is that it is empirically difficult to measure the rate at which memories fade, even between repeated presentations of the source of the memory. Without such a ground-truth measure, it is hard to identify the corresponding neural correlates. This study addresses this problem by comparing individual patterns of functional connectivity against behavioral differences in forgetting speed derived from computational phenotyping. Specifically, the individual-specific values of the speed of forgetting in long-term memory (LTM) were estimated for 33 participants using a formal model fit to accuracy and response time data from an adaptive paired-associate learning task. Individual speeds of forgetting were then used to examine participant-specific patterns of resting-state fMRI connectivity, using machine learning techniques to identify the most predictive and generalizable features. Our results show that individual speeds of forgetting are associated with resting-state connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and cortical sensory areas. Cross-validation showed that individual speeds of forgetting were predicted with high accuracy (<i>r</i> = .78) from these connectivity patterns alone. These results support the view that DMN activity and the associated sensory regions are actively involved in maintaining memories and preventing their decline, a view that can be seen as evidence for the hypothesis that forgetting is a result of storage degradation, rather than of retrieval failure.

During encoding, stimuli are embedded into memory traces that allow for their later retrieval. However, we cannot remember every aspect of our experiences. Here, we show that memory traces consist of multidimensional representational spaces whose formats are flexibly strengthened or weakened during encoding and consolidation. In a series of behavioral experiments, participants compared pairs of natural images on either two conceptual or two perceptual dimensions, leading them to incorporate the images into representational ‘spaces’. We found that representations from deep neural networks relate to both behavioral similarity and memory confidence judgements. Furthermore, we found that distances in task-relevant but not irrelevant spaces affected memory strengths. Interestingly, conceptual encoding did not impair subsequent rejection of similar lures, suggesting that task-irrelevant perceptual information remained in the memory trace. However, targeted memory reactivation following conceptual encoding deteriorated perceptual discrimination, indicating that it weakened the accessibility of perceptual formats. Our results demonstrate that representational formats are flexibly incorporated into memory, and more generally show how the organization of information in cognitive representational spaces shapes behavior.

                <p>by Giulia Mazzi, Ambra Ferrari, Maria Laura Mencaroni, Chiara Valzolgher, Mirko Tommasini, Francesco Pavani, Stefania Benetti</p>

Face-to-face communication relies on the seamless integration of multisensory signals, including voice, gaze, and head movements, to convey meaning effectively. This poses a fundamental computational challenge: optimally binding signals sharing the same communicative intention (e.g., looking at the addressee while speaking) and segregating unrelated signals (e.g., looking away while coughing), all within the rapid turn-taking dynamics of conversation. Critically, the computational mechanisms underlying this extraordinary feat remain largely unknown. Here, we cast face-to-face communication as a Bayesian Causal Inference problem to formally test whether prior expectations arbitrate between the integration and segregation of vocal and bodily signals. Specifically, we asked whether there is a stronger prior tendency to integrate audiovisual signals that convey the same communicative intention, thus establishing a crossmodal pragmatic correspondence. Additionally, we evaluated whether observers solve causal inference by adopting optimal Bayesian decision strategies or non-optimal approximate heuristics. In a spatial localization task, participants watched audiovisual clips of a speaker where the audio (voice) and the video (bodily cues) were sampled either from congruent positions or at increasing spatial disparities. Crucially, we manipulated the pragmatic correspondence of the signals: in a communicative condition, the speaker addressed the participant with their head, gaze and speech; in a non-communicative condition, the speaker kept the head down and produced a meaningless vocalization. We measured audiovisual integration through the ventriloquist effect, which quantifies how much the perceived audio position is misplaced towards the video position. Combining psychophysics with computational modelling, we show that observers solved audiovisual causal inference using non-optimal heuristics that nevertheless approximate optimal Bayesian inference with high accuracy. Remarkably, participants showed a stronger tendency to integrate vocal and bodily information when signals conveyed congruent communicative intent, suggesting that pragmatic correspondences enhance multisensory integration. Collectively, our findings provide novel and compelling evidence that face-to-face communication is shaped by deeply ingrained expectations about how multisensory signals should be structured and interpreted.

                <p>by William L. Tong, Venkatesh N. Murthy, Gautam Reddy</p>

Dogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks (‘shaping’). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a teacher-student framework for shaping behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its student’s task based on the student’s transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using algorithms for Monte Carlo planning under uncertainty, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms achieve a careful balance between reinforcement and extinction. Near-optimal algorithms track learning rate to adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on a sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping behavior that applies to both animals and artificial agents.

                <p>by Joseph James Tharayil, Ciro Zinno, Filippo Agnesi, Bryn Lloyd, Silvia Farcito, Antonino Cassara, Niels Kuster, Michael Reimann, Silvestro Micera, Esra Neufeld</p>

We developed an extended reciprocity theorem approach to model neuron signals which handles heterogeneous dielectric environments and arbitrary electrode shapes, and use it to study analytically the single fiber action potential. We then established a semi-analytic model that also uses hybrid electromagnetic-electrophysiological simulations to model evoked compound action potential (eCAP) signals from multi-fascicular nerves populated with heterogeneous fiber populations. For validation, model predictions were compared with cuff electrode recordings of activity induced by vagus nerve stimulation in <i>in vivo</i> porcine experiments. The semi-analytic model produces signals that approximate the shape and amplitude of <i>in vivo</i> measurements. It can account for the important variation in the recorded eCAP due to changes in the shape and placement of the stimulus and recording electrodes. We find that partially activated fascicles contribute particularly to the signal, as eCAP contributions from smoothly varying fiber calibers in fully activated ones partially cancel. As a result, eCAP magnitude does not depend monotonically on the stimulation current and recruitment level. Our method can be used to rapidly assess new stimulation and recording setups involving complex nerves and neurovascular bundles, e.g., to maximize signal information content, for closed-loop control in bioelectronic medicine applications, and potentially to non-destructively reconstruct structural and functional nerve topologies through inverse problem solving. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that parameter optimization can recover the ground-truth distribution of fiber diameters in a simplifed variant of our model.

Reinforcement-learning (RL) models have been pivotal to our understanding of how agents perform learning-based adaptions in dynamically changing environments. However, the exact nature of the relationship (e.g., linear, logarithmic etc.) between key components of RL models such as prediction errors (PEs; the difference between the agent’s expectation and the actual outcome) and learning rates (a coefficient used by agents to update their beliefs about the environment) has not been studied in detail. Here, across (i) simulations, (ii) reanalyses of readily available datasets and (iii) a novel experiment, we demonstrate that the relationship between PEs and learning rates is (i) nonlinear over the PE/ learning rates space, and (ii) it can be accounted for by an exponential-logarithmic function that can transform the magnitude of PEs instantaneously to learning rates in a novel RL model. In line with the temporal predictions of this model, we show that physiological correlates of learning rates accumulate while learners observe the outcome of their choices and update their beliefs about the environment.

Protein Language Models (PLMs) use transformer architectures to capture patterns within protein primary sequences, providing a powerful computational representation of the amino acid sequence. Through large-scale training on protein primary sequences, PLMs generate vector representations that encapsulate the biochemical and structural properties of proteins. At the core of PLMs is the attention mechanism, which facilitates the capture of long-range dependencies by computing pairwise importance scores across residues, thereby highlighting regions of biological interaction within the sequence. The attention matrices offer an untapped opportunity to uncover specific biological properties of proteins, particularly their functions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, using the Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM) , for identifying High Attention (HA) sites within protein primary sequences, corresponding to key residues that define protein families. By examining attention patterns across multiple layers, we pinpoint residues that contribute most to family classification and function prediction. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a method for identifying HA sites at critical residues from the middle layers of the PLM; (2) we demonstrate that these HA sites provide interpretable links to biological functions; and (3) we show that HA sites improve active site predictions for functions of unannotated proteins. We make available the HA sites for the human proteome. This work offers a broadly applicable approach to protein classification and functional annotation and provides a biological interpretation of the PLM’s representation.

                <p>by Ghislain St-Yves, Kendrick Kay, Thomas Naselaris</p>

Brain activity patterns in high-level visual cortex support accurate linear classification of visual concepts (e.g., objects or scenes). It has long been appreciated that the accuracy of linear classification in any brain area depends on the geometry of its concept manifolds—sets of brain activity patterns that encode images of a concept. However, it is unclear how the geometry of concept manifolds differs between regions of visual cortex that support accurate classification and those that don’t, or how it differs between visual cortex and deep neural networks (DNNs). We estimated geometric properties of concept manifolds that, per a recent theory, directly determine the accuracy of simple “few-shot” linear classifiers. Using a large fMRI dataset, we show that variation in classification accuracy across human visual cortex is driven by a variation in a single geometric property: the distance between manifold centers (“geometric Signal”). In contrast, variation in classification accuracy across early and mid DNN layers is driven by an increase in the effective number of manifold dimensions (“Dimensionality"). Despite this difference in the geometric properties that affect few-shot classification performance in the brain and DNNs, we find that Signal and Dimensionality are strongly, negatively correlated: when Signal increases across brain regions or DNN layers, Dimensionality decreases, and vice versa. We conclude that early visual cortical areas and DNN layers deploy different geometric strategies for accurate linear classification of concepts, even though both are subject to the same constraint.

Neural activity sequences are ubiquitous in the brain and play pivotal roles in functions such as long-term memory formation and motor control. While conditions for storing and reactivating individual sequences have been thoroughly characterized, it remains unclear how multiple sequences may interact when activated simultaneously in recurrent neural networks. This question is especially relevant for weak sequences, comprised of fewer neurons, competing against strong sequences. Using a non-linear rate -based and a spiking model with discrete, pre-configured assemblies, we demonstrate that weak sequences can compensate for their competitive disadvantage either by increasing excitatory connections between subsequent assemblies or by cooperating with other co-active sequences. Further, our models suggest that such cooperation can negatively affect sequence speed unless subsequently active assemblies are paired. Our analysis characterizes the conditions for successful sequence progression in isolated, competing, and cooperating assembly sequences, and identifies the distinct contributions of recurrent and feed-forward projections. This proof-of-principle study shows how even disadvantaged sequences can be prioritized for reactivation, a process which has recently been implicated in hippocampal memory processing.

Adaptive immunity is a targeted immune response that enables the body to identify and eliminate foreign pathogens, playing a critical role in the anti-tumor immune response. Tumor cell expression of antigens forms the foundation for inducing this adaptive response. However, the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-restricted recognition of antigens by T-cell receptors (TCR) limits their ability to detect all neoantigens, with only a small subset capable of activating T-cells. Accurately predicting neoantigen binding to TCR is, therefore, crucial for assessing their immunogenic potential in clinical settings. We present THLANet, a deep learning model designed to predict the binding specificity of TCR to neoantigens presented by class I HLAs. THLANet employs evolutionary scale modeling-2 (ESM-2), replacing the traditional embedding methods to enhance sequence feature representation. Using scTCR-seq data, we obtained the TCR immune repertoire and constructed a TCR-pHLA binding database to validate THLANet’s clinical potential. The model’s performance was further evaluated using clinical cancer data across various cancer types. Additionally, by analyzing divided complementarity-determining region (CDR3) sequences and simulating alanine scanning of antigen sequences, we provided new insights into the 3D binding interactions of TCRs and antigens. Predicting TCR-neoantigen pairing remains a significant challenge in immunology, THLANet provides accurate predictions using only the TCR sequence (CDR3<i>β</i>), antigen sequence, and class I HLA, offering novel insights into TCR-antigen interactions.

                <p>by Asma Nouira, Chloé-Agathe Azencott</p>

A critical hurdle in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) involves population stratification, wherein differences in allele frequencies among subpopulations within samples are influenced by distinct ancestry. This stratification implies that risk variants may be distinct across populations with different allele frequencies. This study introduces Sparse Multitask Group Lasso (SMuGLasso) to tackle this challenge. SMuGLasso is based on MuGLasso, which formulates this problem using a multitask group lasso framework in which tasks are subpopulations, and groups are population-specific Linkage-Disequilibrium (LD)-groups of strongly correlated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The novelty in SMuGLasso is the incorporation of an additional ℓ1-norm regularization for the selection of population-specific genetic variants. As MuGLasso, SMuGLasso uses a stability selection procedure to improve robustness and gap-safe screening rules for computational efficiency. We evaluate MuGLasso and SMuGLasso on simulated data sets as well as on a case-control breast cancer data set and a quantitative GWAS in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We show that SMuGLasso is well suited to addressing linkage disequilibrium and population stratification in GWAS data, and show the superiority of SMuGLasso over MuGLasso in identifying population-specific SNPs. On real data, we confirm the relevance of the identified loci through pathway and network analysis, and observe that the findings of SMuGLasso are more consistent with the literature than those of MuGLasso. All in all, SMuGLasso is a promising tool for analyzing GWAS data and furthering our understanding of population-specific biological mechanisms.

                <p>by Md. Faruk Hossain, Sydney Popsuj, Burcu Vitrinel, Nicole A. Kaplan, Alberto Stolfi, Lionel Christiaen, Matteo Ruggiu</p>

In mammals, neuromuscular synapses rely on clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle plasma membrane, ensuring optimal stimulation by motor neuron-released acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This clustering depends on a complex pathway based on alternative splicing of <i>Agrin</i> pre-mRNAs by the RNA-binding proteins Nova1/2. Neuron-specific expression of Nova1/2 ensures the inclusion of small “Z” exons in <i>Agrin</i>, resulting in a neural-specific form of this extracellular proteoglycan carrying a short peptide motif that is required for binding to Lrp4 receptors on the muscle side, which in turn stimulate AChR clustering. Here we show that this intricate pathway is remarkably conserved in <i>Ciona robusta,</i> a non-vertebrate chordate in the tunicate subphylum. We use in vivo tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and heterologous “minigene” alternative splicing assays in cultured mammalian cells to show that <i>Ciona</i> Nova is also necessary and sufficient for <i>Agrin</i> Z exon inclusion and downstream Lrp4-mediated AChR clustering. We present evidence that, although the overall pathway is well conserved, there are unexpected differences in Nova structure-function between <i>Ciona</i> and mammals. We further show that, in <i>Ciona</i> motor neurons, the transcription factor Ebf is a key activator of <i>Nova</i> expression, thus ultimately linking this RNA switch to a conserved, motor neuron-specific transcriptional regulatory network.

<i>Drosophila melanogaster Down Syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1</i> (<i>Dscam1</i>) gene encodes 38,016 diverse cell surface receptor proteins via alternative splicing, which have both nervous and immune functions. However, it remains elusive why organisms have evolved such an astonishing diversity of isoforms. Here, we show that fitness and immunity properties have driven the modern evolution of <i>Dscam1</i> isoform diversity. We assess multiple aspects of fly fitness in deletion mutants harboring exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters, respectively, reducing ectodomain isoform diversity stepwise from 18,612 to 396. All fitness-related traits generally improved as the potential number of isoforms increased; however, the magnitude of the changes varied remarkably in a variable cluster-specific manner. Correlation analysis revealed that fitness-related traits were much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity compared to canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. We conclude that the role of Dscam1 isoforms in canonical neuronal self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is mediated by a small fraction of all isoforms (<1/10), whereas a separate role essential for other developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires almost full isoform diversity. Thus, fitness and immunity properties, rather than canonical neuronal functions, are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform. Our findings suggest that Dscam1 diversity is closely linked to adaptation and species diversification in arthropods.

The importance of chromatin-mediated processes in neurodevelopmental and intellectual disability disorders is well recognized. However, how chromatin dysregulation in glial cells impacts cognitive abilities is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that targeted loss of the ATRX chromatin remodeler targeted to microglia leads to altered cell morphology, increased chromatin accessibility profiles, and de-repression of endogenous retroelements, triggering viral mimicry. In mice that lack ATRX in microglia, CA1 hippocampal neuron morphology and electrophysiological properties are affected, and the mice display specific behavioral deficits. These findings demonstrate that ATRX is required in microglia to preserve chromatin structure and maintain microglial homeostasis. Disruption of these functions elicits neuroinflammation and may contribute to the pathology of human neurological disorders caused by <i>ATRX</i> mutations.

                Background Over the years, the dynamics of workplace design have changed in varying ways, with the pandemic being a notable change. Awareness surrounding the built environment’s impact on occupants’ well-being has increased after the pandemic. As a result, a substantial increase in the demand for a design that prioritizes humans, such as Biophilic Design, has been observed. Biophilic Design can enhance the quality of interior workspaces, where employees can work, collaborate, socialize, and restore. Methods This paper explores the implementation of biophilic design strategies in workplace interiors and presents the findings in a proposed matrix to record the presence of biophilic patterns. The matrix is designed according to Browning’s list of fifteen biophilic design patterns under the categories of “Nature in Space”, “Natural Analogues,” and “Nature of Space”. The workplace zones of two international examples and two local case studies were examined through photographic methodology. Results The matrix results illustrated the presence of biophilic patterns across the 52 studied zones. The total percentages of biophilic patterns availability recorded in the analysed workplaces were 71%, 66%, 63%, and 58%, respectively. The patterns under the “Natural Analogues” category recorded the highest average presence by 75%, followed by the “Nature in Space” category, achieving 69%, and the “Nature of Space” category recording 52%. The patterns records ranged from 2 to 13 for each zone, emphasizing the various biophilic design implementations within the four studied examples. The patterns that tend to be integrated the most in the analysed workplaces were dynamic and diffused light, connection to natural systems, complexity and order, and prospect patterns. Conclusions In the end, several design strategies were recommended for enhancing biophilic design integration in the local case studies. The paper encourages designers and architects to create biophilic workplaces with the purpose of positively affecting employees’ well-being and performance.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious inflammatory disease that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disease that has been associated with increased severity of periodontal disease. This study aimed to assess the clinical and immunological characteristics of PD in individuals with and without RA and to compare these characteristics with a healthy control group. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers, including human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Our findings showed that salivary HLA-DR4 levels were significantly lower in patient groups compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000), whereas salivary MMP-8 and ACPA levels were significantly elevated in patients (P = 0.034) and (P = 0.001) respectively, with no significant differences between the patient groups(P > 0.05). On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls (P = 0.001), with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

                Huo et al. report that opioid-withdrawn mice prefer socializing with opioid-experienced peers, driven by heightened social motivation and mediated by a specific brain circuit, APIRCRH-BMA, activated by peer odor. This social homophily promotes relapse by strengthening addiction-related memories. Social support from non-addicted peers or blocking this pathway aids recovery.

Similar traits appear in some human melanomas, helping us understand how cancer evades immune detection and the histocompatibility barrier.

                Zakovic et al. show that the immune regulator REL2 maintains Anopheles gambiae midgut homeostasis by activating antimicrobial peptide genes after blood feeding. REL2 loss causes Serratia-driven dysbiosis and mosquito mortality. Serratia overgrowth in REL2-deficient mosquitoes inhibits Plasmodium falciparum colonization, highlighting a microbiota-mediated barrier to malaria transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93589">The spatial frequency representation predicts category coding in the inferior temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural representation of spatial frequency (SF) in the primate cortex is vital for unraveling visual processing in object recognition. While many studies focus on SF in the primary visual cortex, the characteristics and interaction of SF with category representation remain unclear. To explore SF representation in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaques, we conducted extracellular recordings with complex stimuli systematically filtered by SF. Our findings reveal explicit SF coding at both single-neuron and population levels. Temporal dynamics analysis of SF representation reveals that low SF (LSF) is decoded faster than high SF (HSF), and the SF preference dynamically shifts from LSF to HSF over time. Additionally, the SF representation for each neuron forms a profile that predicts category selectivity at the population level. IT neurons cluster into four groups based on SF preference, each with distinct category coding behaviors. Notably, HSF-preferring neurons show the highest category decoding for faces. Despite the existing connection between SF and category coding, we have identified uncorrelated representations of SF and category. Unlike category coding, SF is more sparsely represented and depends more on individual neurons. These findings dissociate SF and category representations, underscoring SF’s pivotal role in object recognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105065">The general version of Hamilton’s rule</a></h4>

              
                The generality of Hamilton’s rule is much debated. In this paper, I show that this debate can be resolved by constructing a general version of Hamilton’s rule, which allows for a large variety of ways in which the fitness of an individual can depend on the social behavior of oneself and of others. For this, I first derive the Generalized Price equation, which reconnects the Price equation with the statistics it borrows its terminology from. The Generalized Price equation, moreover, shows that there is not just one Price equation, but there is a Price-like equation for every possible true model. This implies that there are also multiple, nested rules to describe selection. The simplest rule is the rule for selection of non-social traits with linear fitness effects. This rule is nested in the classical version of Hamilton’s rule, for which there is consensus that it works for social traits with linear, independent fitness effects. The classical version of Hamilton’s rule, in turn, is nested in more general rules that, for instance, allow for nonlinear and/or interdependent fitness effects, like Queller’s rule. The general version of Hamilton’s rule, therefore, is a constructive solution that allows us to accurately describe when costly cooperation evolves in a wide variety of circumstances. As a byproduct, we also find a hierarchy of nested rules for selection of non-social traits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107148">Spatial and longitudinal tracking of enhancer-AAV vectors that target transgene expression to injured mouse myocardium</a></h4>

              
                Tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) direct expression of target genes in injured and regenerating tissues. Additionally, TREEs of zebrafish origin were shown to direct expression of transgenes in border zone regions after cardiac injury when packaged into recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors and introduced into mice. Future implementation of TREEs into AAV-based vectors as research tools and potential gene therapy modalities requires a deeper understanding of expression dynamics and potential off-target effects. Here, we applied in vivo bioluminescent imaging to mice systemically injected with AAV vectors containing different combinations of capsids, enhancers, and timing of delivery. Longitudinal tracking of expression directed by different TREEs revealed distinct amplitudes and durations of reporter gene expression in the injured heart. The liver-de-targeted AAV capsid, AAV.cc84, could deliver TREEs either pre- or post-cardiac injury to negate off-target expression in the liver while maintaining transduction in the heart. By screening AAV9-based capsid libraries dosed systemically in mice post-cardiac injury, we discovered a new capsid variant, AAV.IR41, with enhanced transduction in cardiac injuries and with elevated transduction of TREE-driven transgenes versus conventional AAV9 vectors. In vivo bioluminescence imaging offers insights into how enhancers and engineered capsids can be implemented to modulate spatiotemporal transgene expression for targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102475">Sequence action representations contextualize during early skill learning</a></h4>

              
                Activities of daily living rely on our ability to acquire new motor skills composed of precise action sequences. Here, we asked in humans if the millisecond-level neural representation of an action performed at different contextual sequence locations within a skill differentiates or remains stable during early motor learning. We first optimized machine learning decoders predictive of sequence-embedded finger movements from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity. Using this approach, we found that the neural representation of the same action performed in different contextual sequence locations progressively differentiated—primarily during rest intervals of early learning (offline)—correlating with skill gains. In contrast, representational differentiation during practice (online) did not reflect learning. The regions contributing to this representational differentiation evolved with learning, shifting from the contralateral pre- and post-central cortex during early learning (trials 1–11) to increased involvement of the superior and middle frontal cortex once skill performance plateaued (trials 12–36). Thus, the neural substrates supporting finger movements and their representational differentiation during early skill learning differ from those supporting stable performance during the subsequent skill plateau period. Representational contextualization extended to Day 2, exhibiting specificity for the practiced skill sequence. Altogether, our findings indicate that sequence action representations in the human brain contextually differentiate during early skill learning, an issue relevant to brain-computer interface applications in neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102228">Policy shaping based on the learned preferences of others accounts for risky decision-making under social observation</a></h4>

              
                Observing others’ choices influences individuals’ decisions, often leading them to follow others. However, it is repeatedly reported that being observed by others tends to make people act more riskily. We hypothesized that this discrepancy arises from individuals’ belief that others prefer riskier choices than they do. To examine this hypothesis, we used a gambling task where on some trials, individuals were informed that their choices would be observed by a risk-averse or seeking partner. Most important, individuals were given chances to learn each partner’s preference beforehand. As expected, individuals initially believed that partners would make relatively riskier choices than they would. Against two alternative explanations, we found that individuals simulated partners’ choices and weighed these simulated choices in making their own choices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that decision probabilities adjusted with the simulated partners’ choices were represented in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Moreover, individual differences in the functional connectivity between the TPJ and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) were explained by the interaction between model-estimated social reliance and sensitivity to social cues in the dmPFC. These findings provide a neuromechanistic account of how being observed by others affects individuals’ decision-making, highlighting the roles of the dmPFC and TPJ in simulating social contexts based on individuals’ beliefs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102441">Tuberculosis susceptibility in genetically diverse mice reveals functional diversity of neutrophils</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis is a heterogeneous disease in humans with individuals exhibiting a wide range of susceptibility. This heterogeneity is not captured by standard laboratory mouse lines. We used a new collection of 19 wild-derived inbred mouse lines collected from diverse geographic sites to identify novel phenotypes during <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) infection. Wild-derived mice have heterogeneous immune responses to infection that result in differential ability to control disease at early time points. Correlation analysis with multiple parameters including sex, weight, and cellular immune responses in the lungs revealed that enhanced control of infection is associated with increased numbers of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells. Surprisingly, we did not observe strong correlations between IFN-γ production and control of infection. Although in most lines high neutrophils were associated with susceptibility, we identified a mouse line that harbors high neutrophil numbers yet controls infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a novel neutrophil signature associated with failure to control infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103547">Ancient trans-species polymorphism at the Major Histocompatibility Complex in primates</a></h4>

              
                Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity—thousands of alleles per gene in humans. Moreover, some allelic lineages appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. In particular, we do not know to what extent genes and allelic lineages are retained across speciation events. To start addressing this gap, we explore variation <i>across</i> genes and species in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025), and here we explore variation <i>within</i> individual genes. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at 17 MHC genes, including classical and non-classical Class I and Class II genes. We find strong support for ancient TSP in 7 of 10 classical genes, including—remarkably—between humans and old-world monkeys in MHC-DQB1. In addition to the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at nucleotides encoding the proteins’ peptide-binding domains. The most rapidly-evolving amino acid positions are extremely enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces—arising from differential peptide binding—that drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 31 million years in some cases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105867">Gene regulatory mechanisms guiding bifurcation of inhibitory and excitatory neuron lineages in the mouse anterior brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Selector transcription factors (TFs) control choices of alternative cellular fates during development. The ventral rhombomere 1 of the embryonic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) brainstem produces neuronal precursors that can differentiate into either inhibitory GABAergic or excitatory glutamatergic neurons important for the control of behaviour. TFs <i>Tal1</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, and <i>Gata3</i> are required for adopting the GABAergic neuronal identity and inhibiting the glutamatergic identity. Here, we asked how these selector TFs are activated and how they control the identity of the developing brainstem neurons. We addressed these questions by analysing chromatin accessibility at putative gene regulatory elements active during GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron lineage bifurcation, combined with studies of TF expression and DNA binding. Our results show that the <i>Tal1</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, and <i>Gata3</i> genes are activated by highly similar mechanisms, with connections to regional patterning, neurogenic cell cycle exit and general course of neuronal differentiation. After activation, <i>Tal1</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, and <i>Gata3</i> are linked by auto- and cross-regulation as well as regulatory interactions with TFs of the glutamatergic branch. Predicted targets of these selector TFs include genes expressed in GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, or both. Unlike genes specific to the glutamatergic branch, the genes expressed in GABAergic neurons appear to be under combinatorial control of <i>Tal1</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, and <i>Gata3</i>. Understanding gene regulatory interactions affecting the anterior brainstem GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron differentiation may give genetic and mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental traits and disorders.

">Targeted degradation of pathologic tau aggregates via AUTOTAC ameliorates tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                The pathogenesis of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) involves the misfolding and aggregation of tau. Here, we employed AUTOTAC to induce the lysosomal degradation of intraneuronal tau aggregates. ATB2005A is a 734-Da chimera that simultaneously binds {beta}-sheet-rich tau aggregates and the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1, leading to autophagosomal sequestration and lysosomal co-degradation. In mouse models of tauopathies, orally administered ATB2005A lowered intraneuronal tau aggregates and exerted the therapeutic efficacy in neuroinflammation as well as cognition, behavior, and muscle movements. A Phase 2 clinical trial (U34401-4/2023/14) with companion dogs carrying canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) demonstrated the efficacy of ATB2005A, as a veterinary medicine, to reverse the disease progression. ATB2005A is under Phase 1 clinical trial with human participants in Korea (202300697). These results validate AUTOTAC as a versatile platform for developing therapeutics to eradicate toxic protein aggregates in a wide range of proteinopathies.

">Extreme Value Theory for Modeling Category Decision Boundaries in Visual Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Several possibilities exist for modeling decision boundaries in category learning, with varying degrees of human fidelity. This paper finds evidence for preferentially focusing representational resources on the extremes of the distribution of visual inputs in a generative model as an alternative to the central tendency models that are commonly used for prototypes and exemplars. The notion of treating extrema near a decision boundary as features in visual recognition is not new, but a comprehensive statistical framework of recognition based on extrema has yet to emerge for category learning. Here we suggest that the statistical Extreme Value Theory provides such a framework. In Experiment 1, line segment stimuli that vary in a single dimension of length are used to assess how human subjects and statistical models assign category membership to a gap region between two categories shown as reference stimuli. A Weibull fit better predicts an observed human shift when moving from uniform to enriched or long tails as reference stimuli. In Experiment 2, more complex 2D rendered face sequences drawn from morphspaces are used as stimuli. Again, the Weibull fit better predicts an observed human shift when reference stimuli are sampled differently. An extrema-based model lends new insight into how discriminative information may be encoded in the brain with implications for the understanding of how decision making works in category learning.

">Pheromone circuits and transcriptional cascades modulating transcriptional and chromatin states in the Drosophila central brain with social experience</a></h4>

              
                Social experience significantly influences the behavioral and physiological responses of animals, including humans. In many animals, social isolation increases aggression, courtship, locomotion, and feeding while disrupting sleep. This occurs when peripheral neurons detect social signals, such as pheromones, which activate decision-making circuits in the brain. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms of how chronic social isolation or enrichment alter gene expression and affect neuronal function and behavior remain unclear. In this study, we examined how transcription patterns and chromatin marks in male Drosophila brains change in response to social experience, and the impact of pheromone circuits and transcription factors involved in social circuit function. We focused on pheromone receptors Or47b and Or67d, as well as transcription factors FruM and DsxM. Our findings suggest that social experience impacts multiple genes in the central brain. Disrupting Or47b, Or67d, FruM, and DsxM function normalized the transcriptional responses through antagonistic interactions. Specifically, Or47b circuits predominantly mediated transcriptional responses to social isolation through DsxM function, while Or67d and FruM regulated responses to group housing. Notably, mutants of fruM and dsxM exhibited more extensive transcriptional changes in the brain than Or mutants, especially for FruM/DsxM target genes. While social experience did not lead to detectable alterations in the overall chromatin profile in the whole brain, mutants of the four genes resulted in significant changes in the enrichment of H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) compared to wild type. Furthermore, mutants in fruM and dsxM generally eliminated social experience-dependent changes in sleep and locomotion behaviors, whereas Or mutants exhibited more modest disruptions. Overall, our results uncover the pheromone circuits and transcriptional cascades in regulating molecular and behavioral responses to social experience.

">The effect of hunger and state preferences on the neural processing of food images</a></h4>

              
                Visual information plays a key role in guiding food-related decisions. While previous studies have shown that features such as calories and naturalness are encoded by the visual brain, it remains unclear how this encoding is shaped by the observer's current state. In this study, we explore the effect of 1) hunger state, 2) current individual preference, and 3) task relevance on the processing of visual food information. Participants underwent two EEG sessions: one after fasting overnight and the another after eating normally. We used multivariate decoding methods to assess the impact of hunger on the decoding of edibility and food identity, and Representational Similarity Analysis to determine the time-course of information related to food flavour, personal appeal, and arousal, both when participants attended to the stimuli and when their attention was distracted away. Results showed that the visual brain quickly encodes information about edibility and food identity, and this was not influenced by whether the participants were in a fasted or sated state. Information about the flavour profile was found to be represented regardless of attentive state. Personal appeal and arousal information emerged later and were only observed when the food was task relevant. Using RSA, we found that food appeal and arousal encoding was more closely aligned with behavioural ratings within rather than between sessions, suggesting the nature of the encoding was driven by current state. In conclusion, the study provides insights into how personal preferences and physiological states influence the representation of food information in the brain.

                Background Neuroblastoma is a malignant childhood cancer with significant inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity arising from the abnormal differentiation of neural crest cells into sympathetic neurons. The lack of actionable mutations limits therapeutic options, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive this differentiation. Although RNA velocity has provided some insights, modeling regulatory relationships is limited. Methods To address this, we applied our integrated gene regulatory network (GRNs) inference (CARDAMOM) and simulation (HARISSA) tools using a published single-cell RNAseq dataset from human sympathoadrenal differentiation. Results Our analysis identified a 97-gene GRN that drives the transition from Schwann cell precursors to chromaffin cells and sympathoblasts, highlighting dynamic interactions such as self-reinforcing loops and toggle switches. The simulation of that GRN was able to reproduce very satisfactorily the experimentally observed gene expression distributions. Conclusions Altogether, these findings demonstrate the utility of our GRN model framework for inferring GRN structure, even in the absence of a time-resolved dataset.

                Background Malnutrition impairs immune function and vaccine responses, particularly in low-income settings. This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific. Objective This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions—especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation—on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Narrative reviews and retracted articles (e.g., Chandra RK) were excluded. Results From 3,245 records, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines (rotavirus and OPV) by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Evidence for iron supplementation and inactivated vaccines remained inconsistent. Conclusion Nutritional interventions can improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Vaccination should not be delayed in malnourished children; instead, integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.

                <p>by Bangyi Zhang, Yun Zuo, Jun Wan, Jiayue Liu, Xiangrong Liu, Xiangxiang Zeng, Zhaohong Deng</p>

Cancer remains a major contributor to global mortality, constituting a significant and escalating threat to human health. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their specific mechanisms of action, pronounced tumor-targeting capability, and low toxicity. Nevertheless, traditional approaches for ACP identification are constrained by their reliance on shallow, hand-crafted sequence features, which fail to capture deeper semantic and structural characteristics. Moreover, such models exhibit limited robustness and interpretability when confronted with practical challenges such as severe class imbalance. To address these limitations, this study proposes HyperACP, an innovative framework for ACP recognition that integrates deep representation learning, adaptive sampling, and mechanistic interpretability. The framework leverages the ESMC protein language model to extract comprehensive sequence features and employs a novel adaptive algorithm, ANBS, to mitigate class imbalance at the decision boundary. For enhanced model transparency, SHAP-Res is incorporated to elucidate the contributions of individual residues to the final predictions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HyperACP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and validation protocols—including 10-fold cross-validation and independent test sets—according to metrics such as Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (SN), Specificity (SP), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Furthermore, the model yields biologically interpretable results, pinpointing key residues (K, L, F, G) known to play pivotal roles in anticancer activity. These findings provide not only a robust predictive tool (available at www.hyperacp.com) but also novel insights into the structure-function relationships underlying ACPs.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013473">A curriculum learning approach to training antibody language models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah M. Burbach, Bryan Briney</p>

There is growing interest in pre-training antibody language models (AbLMs) with a mixture of unpaired and natively paired sequences, seeking to combine the proven benefits of training with natively paired sequences with the massive scale of unpaired antibody sequence datasets. However, given the novelty of this strategy, the field lacks a systematic evaluation of data processing methods and training strategies that maximize the benefits of mixed training data while accommodating the significant imbalance in the size of existing paired and unpaired datasets. Here, we introduce a method of curriculum learning for AbLMs, which facilitates a gradual transition from unpaired to paired sequences during training. We optimize this method and compare it to other data sampling strategies for AbLMs, including a constant mix and a fine-tuning approach. We observe that the curriculum and constant approaches show improved performance compared to the fine-tuning approach in large-scale models, likely due to their ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting and slow overfitting. Finally, we show that a 650M-parameter curriculum model, CurrAb, outperforms existing mixed AbLMs in downstream residue prediction and classification tasks.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing can determine both the taxonomic and functional content of microbiomes. However, functional classification for metagenomic reads remains highly challenging as protein mapping tools require substantial computational resources and yield ambiguous classifications when short reads map to homologous proteins originating from different bacteria. Here we introduce <i>k</i>Mermaid for the purpose of uniquely mapping bacterial short reads to taxa-agnostic clusters of homologous proteins, which can then be used for downstream analysis tasks such as read quantification and pathway or global functional analysis. Using a nested hash map containing amino acid <i>k</i>-mer profiles as a model for protein assignment, <i>k</i>Mermaid achieves the sensitivity of popular existing protein mapping tools while remaining highly resource efficient. We evaluate <i>k</i>Mermaid on simulated data and data from human fecal samples as well as demonstrate the utility of <i>k</i>Mermaid for classifying reads originating from new, unseen proteins. <i>k</i>Mermaid allows for highly accurate, unambiguous and ultrafast metagenomic read assignment into protein clusters, with a fixed memory usage, and can easily be employed on a typical computer.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013001">Human visual grouping based on within- and cross-area temporal correlations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yen-Ju Chen, Zitang Sun, Shin’ya Nishida</p>

Perceptual organization in the human visual system involves neural mechanisms that spatially group and segment image areas based on local feature similarities, such as the temporal correlation of luminance changes. Successful segmentation models in computer vision, including graph-based algorithms and vision transformer, leverage similarity computations across all elements in an image, suggest that effective similarity-based grouping should rely on a global computational process. However, whether human vision employs a similarly global computation remains unclear due to the absence of appropriate methods for manipulating similarity matrices across multiple elements within a stimulus. To investigate how “temporal similarity structures” influence human visual segmentation, we developed a stimulus generation algorithm based on Vision Transformer. This algorithm independently controls within-area and cross-area similarities by adjusting the temporal correlation of luminance, color, and spatial phase attributes. To assess human segmentation performance with these generated texture stimuli, participants completed a temporal two-alternative forced-choice task, identifying which of two intervals contained a segmentable texture. The results showed that segmentation performance is significantly influenced by the configuration of both within- and cross-correlation across the elements, regardless of attribute type. Furthermore, human performance is closely aligned with predictions from a graph-based computational model, suggesting that human texture segmentation can be approximated by a global computational process that optimally integrates pairwise similarities across multiple elements.

                <p>by Franco Pradelli, Giovanni Minervini, Pradeep Venkatesh, Shorya Azad, Hector Gomez, Silvio C. E. Tosatto</p>

Retinal Hemangioblastoma (RH) is the most frequent manifestation of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), a rare disease associated with the germline mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). An emblematic feature of RH is the high vascularity, which is explained by the overexpression of angiogenic factors (AFs) arising from the pVHL impairment. The introduction of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) allowed observing this feature with exceptional detail. Here, we combine OCTA images and a mechanistic model to investigate tumor growth and vascular development in a patient-specific way. We derived our model from the agreed pathology for RH and focused on the earliest stages of tumor-induced angiogenesis. Our simulations closely resemble the medical images, supporting the capability of our model to simulate vascular patterning in actual patients. Our results also suggest that angiogenesis in RH occurs upon reaching a critical dimension (around 200 μm), followed by the rapid formation of stable vascular networks. These findings open a new perspective on the crucial role of time in antiangiogenic therapy in RH, which has resulted in ineffective control. Indeed, it might be that when RH is diagnosed, angiogenesis is already too advanced to be effectively targeted with any effective means. Moreover, our simulations suggest that vascularization in RH is not a continuous process but an inconstant development with long, stable phases and rapid episodes of vascular sprouting.

Sphingolipid and ganglioside metabolic pathways are crucial components of cell signaling, having established roles in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. However, regulatory mechanisms controlling sphingolipid and ganglioside biosynthesis in mammalian cells are less known. Here, we show that RICTOR, the regulatory subunit of mTORC2, regulates the synthesis of sphingolipids and gangliosides in human luminal breast cancer-specific MCF-7 and BT-474 cells through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. We observe that RICTOR regulates glucosylceramide levels by modulating the expression of UDP-Glucose Ceramide Glucosyl transferase (UGCG). We identify Zinc Finger protein X-linked (ZFX) as a RICTOR-responsive transcription factor whose recruitment to the <i>UGCG</i> promoter is regulated by DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone demethylase (KDM5A), which are known AKT substrates. We further demonstrate that RICTOR regulates the synthesis of GD3 gangliosides through ZFX and UGCG, and triggers the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, thereby promoting tumor growth. In line with our findings in human cell culture and mouse models, we observe an elevated expression of RICTOR, ZFX, and UGCG in Indian luminal breast cancer tissues and in TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Together, we establish a key regulatory circuit, RICTOR-AKT-ZFX-UGCG-Ganglioside-EGFR-AKT, and elucidate its contribution to breast cancer progression.

                Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant weaknesses in health security systems, even in high-income countries (HICs), underscoring the necessity for a more nuanced understanding of their distinct strengths and vulnerabilities. Existing research often offers broad evaluations and fails to capture the complex internal dynamics of health-security performance. This study seeks to fill this gap by identifying the latent factors that define health security capacities in HICs and clustering countries based on these factors. Methods A multistage analytical framework was employed based on the 2017–2021 Global Health Security Index (GHSI) dataset. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was applied to the 37 GHSI indicators to reduce dimensionality and reveal latent structures within the data. This process identified nine principal components for the subsequent analysis. Subsequently, K-means clustering was utilized under three methodological scenarios: using countries’ average scores across the nine extracted components, based on 13 high-loading indicators from the first principal component, and using aggregated scores across the six original GHSI categories. This design facilitated a comprehensive comparison of the clustering outcomes across different data representations. Results Analysis found nine components that together explained 74.50% of the total differences, with the first component—"Foundational Capacity, Regulations, Resilience, and Prevention-Detection Systems"—making up 37.62% of that total. Together, the first three components explained 51.81% of the total variance. Clustering across all three scenarios categorized high-income countries into four levels, revealing significant disparities. Nauru, the Cook Islands, and Palau consistently ranked lowest, highlighting critical gaps in foundational capacities and systemic readiness despite their high-income status. This study shows that wealth alone does not ensure preparedness, revealing distinct performance patterns and weaknesses across countries. Conclusion The findings underscore the need for tailored policies, multi-method evaluations, and sustained global cooperation to enhance resilience and guide investments in national and global health security.

                Background Malaria continues to impose a significant mortality and morbidity burden, particularly among young African children. Children under two years of age account for one-third of the estimated 597,000 annual global malaria deaths. Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) is a strategy recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce malaria in this high-risk age group. However, uptake remains low in many endemic countries. Given the limited resources available for health and the stagnation of malaria budgets over the last decade, it is important for policymakers to understand the costs and cost-effectiveness of PMC to support future decision making. Methods We describe the design of an economic evaluation of PMC in Benin, Cameroon, and Côte d’Ivoire, where it is being implemented at scale by the ministries of health through the Essential Programme of Immunization (EPI) with support from Population Services International. We will take a disaggregated societal perspective, collecting data on resources provided for PMC by 45 health facilities across 12 districts in these three countries, higher levels of the health services, donor-supported activities, and households. This study will assess the financial and economic costs per dose of PMC and calculate the incremental cost per malaria case averted and per disability-adjusted life-year averted by PMC compared to the usual standard of care. We will model the costs and effects of scaling up PMC to other regions in the three countries where PMC is deemed suitable. Discussion This economic evaluation aims to provide robust evidence from three countries, each implementing different PMC delivery models, regarding whether, where, and under what circumstances investing in PMC may represent an efficient and equitable use of scarce resources. We expect these findings to be valuable for the governments of Benin, Cameroon, and Côte d’Ivoire and other countries and international donors in designing the optimal mix of malaria control interventions.

                Background The functions of pavement-markings are to safely and smoothly guide drivers and vehicles along a road-lane, alert drivers not to leave the lane, and provide traffic information. These functions are directly related to the safety and economy of passengers and vehicles on roads. The visibility of pavement-markings is linked to surface damage during the daytime and is significantly affected by luminance at night. Therefore, damage and luminance should be considered key-factors for maintenance and should be measured in detail. In Seoul, mobile equipment such as image-scanners and damage-detectors has been used to measure damage conditions, and a luminance measurement vehicle has been introduced to observe reflected light intensity from road-markings. The mobile measurement methods are respectively utilized due to their objective difference of the measurement. However, measurement discrepancies in temporal, locational, and environmental conditions can lead to considerable errors. Moreover, a standardized maintenance index is currently lacking for planning repair work in Seoul. In that regards, one objective of this research was to develop a retroreflectivity prediction model using a vehicle that detects pavement and marking damage. Method The model enables the prediction of retroreflectivity without additional measurement equipment. Another objective was to develop degradation models based on the age of pavement-markings and to evaluate their performance for maintenance and budget planning. Results As a result, a regression model was determined to be the optimal predictive model for retroreflectivity. A logarithmic model was selected to predict retroreflectivity degradation. Additionally, the Seoul-Road-Marking-Index was developed. Conclusion The developed models are expected to assist in establishing maintenance plans, formulating budgets, and determining repair work, as well as developing relevant regulations and standards in Seoul.

                Introduction Understanding the fundamental basics of cardiology remains a persistent challenge for students. Traditional methods often fail to present these concepts clearly. To address this educational gap, we developed CardioLearn, an interactive application designed to facilitate active learning in cardiology. The tool integrates anatomical visualisation, temporal simulations, and clinically oriented problem-solving exercises, offering a learner-centred approach to support conceptual understanding and application. Methods CardioLearn is an open-source, web-based application developed in R utilising the Shiny framework, along with the shinythemes and other packages. The platform comprises four interactive modules: a Cardiac Cycle Explorer, featuring an annotated Wiggers diagram to visualise pressure-volume relationships; a Quiz Module for self-assessment of the fundamentals of cardiology; a 3D Heart Model that highlights left atrial dynamics in response to user-controlled left ventricular function parameters; and a Clinical Cases module presenting scenario-based exercises to support diagnostic reasoning skills. Results CardioLearn features a user-friendly interface, guiding users through four distinct modules. The Cardiac Cycle module enables phase-by-phase exploration of the cardiac cycle, with each phase visually highlighted on a Wiggers diagram accompanied by descriptive annotations. The Quiz Module reinforces active recall through multiple-choice questions, providing feedback to support knowledge retention. The 3D Heart Model displays a visualisation of the left atrium in which users can manipulate left ventricular function parameters and left atrial phase to conceptualise changes in atrial size, blood flow, and valve dynamics. The Clinical Cases module presents structured scenarios that integrate key diagnostic elements, encouraging the application of cardiology principles to real-world clinical scenarios. Conclusion CardioLearn is an accessible, interactive educational tool designed to supplement the traditional medical student curriculum. It converges visual, conceptual and applied learning modalities, improving understanding and engagement among medical students. CardioLearn addresses a pertinent educational gap in the knowledge of core cardiology concepts using an active, learner-centred approach.

                Background Changes in the structural and physicochemical properties of pea starch could be significantly affected by germination treatment, which can provide a theoretical basis for promoting the use of this starch in the food industry. Methods This work aims to evaluate the effect of germination time on the structural, thermal, rheological and functional properties of pea starches to determine their potential in the production of fermented beverages. The physicochemical changes during the germination process of peas and native and germinated starch granules were evaluated. Results For germination critical time was 0.985 days, with 95% of germinated grains. The starch grains did not undergo any morphological change during the germination process as seen in the scanning electron microscopy images, indicating the absence of the α and ß - amylases responsible for the starch splitting. The X-ray patterns revealed that the crystalline structures of pea starch with and without germination were unchanged and contained by hexagonal and orthorhombic glucopyranose crystals. The viscosity profiles of the starches do not show significant changes; the most representative change is the increase in the gelatinization onset temperature of the paste from germinated starches compared to native starch. The functional properties of starches showed generally low values, with statistically significant differences between water absorption index, water solubility index, and starch swelling power and germination time. Conclusions In general terms, it can be concluded that pea starch does not undergo significant changes in its physicochemical and functional integrity with respect to the grain germination process.

                Agentic Artificial Intelligence systems, characterized by autonomous reasoning, memory augmentation, and adaptive planning, are rapidly reshaping technological landscapes. Unlike traditional AI or large language models, agentic AI integrates decision-making with persistent execution, enabling complex interactions across dynamic environments. However, this evolution introduces novel security risks, governance challenges, and ethical considerations that current frameworks inadequately address. This survey provides a cross-layer review of agentic AI, encompassing architectural paradigms, threat taxonomies, and governance strategies. It consolidates findings from adjacent domains such as cybersecurity, AI safety, multi-agent coordination, and ethics, offering a holistic understanding of vulnerabilities and mitigation approaches. We integrate insights from recent advances in defense architectures and governance innovations, highlighting the limitations of static policies in addressing dynamically evolving threats. Real-world deployments from industrial automation to military and policy applications reveal both successful integrations and notable failures, underscoring the urgency of resilient oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps in benchmarking, memory integrity, adversarial defense, and normative embedding, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop adaptive, accountable, and transparent systems. This review serves as a narrative synthesis rather than a systematic literature review, aiming to bridge technical, governance, and ethical perspectives. By integrating cross-disciplinary findings, it lays the foundation for future research on securing, aligning, and governing agentic AI in real-world contexts. Ultimately, this work calls for cooperative innovation to ensure that agentic AI evolves as a trustworthy, accountable, and beneficial technology.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-904/v1?src=rss">A practical project to develop teaching materials for Japanese primary school home economics lessons in collaboration with local businesses to boost risk reduction and resilience education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of this paper is to report on a practical project to develop teaching materials for use in primary school home economics education, undertaken jointly by the authors and two local companies in Fukui Prefecture, Japan (Plus Jack Inc. and Technowarp Co., Ltd.). This report highlights international trends and demands in Risk Reduction and Resilience Education (from the UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction 2015-2030 and the Global Alliance for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience in the Education Sector, specifically the Comprehensive School Safety Framework 2022-2030), and how these dovetail neatly with trends and demands in Japan (from government laws and documents, including the Course of Study for home economics). These frameworks constitute the theory on which the practical project was premised and then enacted, especially in terms of (1) fostering social capital that leads to enhanced resilience, and (2) passing on the lessons learnt from previous disasters, all through close collaboration with local companies. Thus, the value of developing home economics teaching materials in collaboration with local businesses is elucidated. This paper details the process and progress of this collaborative project to create the teaching materials, including piloting them in experiments, first with university students and then with primary school students themselves. As a result of the project, the ‘yoji-yoji’ retroreflective straps and the disaster prevention whistle ‘Infinity’ were developed as teaching materials for primary school home economics lessons. Beyond that, though, both teaching materials are intended to be used on a daily basis as disaster prevention tools/resources to protect children even after the end of the study. Future research will aim to develop further primary school home economics lessons using these and other teaching materials and evaluate the effectiveness of such teaching materials through thorough ongoing practical classroom research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-903/v1?src=rss">Morphometric Comparison of the C1 Vertebra Based on Age and Sex in the Indonesian Population: A CT-Based Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The C1 vertebra (atlas) plays a crucial role in craniovertebral biomechanical function and spinal stabilization. Although morphometric studies of the C1 vertebra have been conducted in several countries, data regarding the Indonesian population remains limited. Morphometric variations related to age and sex have important implications for surgical strategy design, particularly in the placement of lateral mass screws used for stabilizing the atlantoaxial region. Methods This study utilized data from 337 cervical CT scans obtained from patients without structural abnormalities of the C1 vertebra in Indonesia between 2019 and 2024. Morphometric analysis was performed using RadiAnt, HOROS, and U-lite software, focusing on measurements of length, diameter, and angles of the C1 vertebra in the axial and sagittal planes. The study subjects were divided based on age and sex groups to compare morphometric differences. Results Significant differences were found in C1 vertebra morphometry based on age and sex. In the male population, the optimal lateral mass screw length ranged from 25.83 mm to 31.95 mm, while in the female population, it ranged from 24.64 mm to 30.11 mm. The safe zone trajectory angle in males ranged from 47.89° in the axial plane and 46.51° in females, with sagittal angles of 45.78° in males and 43.73° in females. The maximum diameter in males ranged from 5.09 mm and 4.89 mm in females. Conclusion This study reveals significant morphometric variations of the C1 vertebra in the Indonesian population based on age and sex. These findings have clinical implications for adjusting surgical techniques, particularly in selecting the size and angle of lateral mass screws for spinal stabilization. This study makes an important contribution to filling the gap in C1 morphometric data for the Indonesian population and can serve as a guide for developing safer and more effective surgical protocols.
