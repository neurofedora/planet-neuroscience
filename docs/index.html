              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14655">Core-Periphery Principle Guided State Space Model for Functional Connectome Classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the organization of human brain networks has become a central focus in neuroscience, particularly in the study of functional connectivity, which plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques have significantly improved brain network analysis. However, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex relationships between brain regions, while deep learning methods, particularly Transformer-based models, face computational challenges due to their quadratic complexity in long-sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Core-Periphery State-Space Model (CP-SSM), an innovative framework for functional connectome classification. Specifically, we introduce Mamba, a selective state-space model with linear complexity, to effectively capture long-range dependencies in functional brain networks. Furthermore, inspired by the core-periphery (CP) organization, a fundamental characteristic of brain networks that enhances efficient information transmission, we design CP-MoE, a CP-guided Mixture-of-Experts that improves the representation learning of brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate CP-SSM on two benchmark fMRI datasets: ABIDE and ADNI. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-SSM surpasses Transformer-based models in classification performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-SSM in modeling brain functional connectivity, offering a promising direction for neuroimaging-based neurological disease diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14700">From Density to Void: Why Brain Networks Fail to Reveal Complex Higher-Order Structures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brain network analysis using resting-state fMRI, there is growing interest in modeling higher-order interactions beyond simple pairwise connectivity via persistent homology. Despite the promise of these advanced topological tools, robust and consistently observed higher-order interactions over time remain elusive. In this study, we investigate why conventional analyses often fail to reveal complex higher-order structures - such as interactions involving four or more nodes - and explore whether such interactions truly exist in functional brain networks. We utilize a simplicial complex framework often used in persistent homology to address this question.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15130">A Foundational Theory for Decentralized Sensory Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, popular functional frameworks and neural network formulations operate by making use of extrinsic error measurements and global learning algorithms. Through a set of conjectures based on evolutionary insights on the origin of cellular adaptive mechanisms, we reinterpret the core meaning of sensory signals to allow the brain to be interpreted as a negative feedback control system, and show how this could lead to local learning algorithms without the need for global error correction metrics. Thereby, a sufficiently good minima in sensory activity can be the complete reward signal of the network, as well as being both necessary and sufficient for biological learning to arise. We show that this method of learning was likely already present in the earliest unicellular life forms on earth. We show evidence that the same principle holds and scales to multicellular organisms where it in addition can lead to division of labour between cells. Available evidence shows that the evolution of the nervous system likely was an adaptation to more effectively communicate intercellular signals to support such division of labour. We therefore propose that the same learning principle that evolved already in the earliest unicellular life forms, i.e. negative feedback control of externally and internally generated sensor signals, has simply been scaled up to become a fundament of the learning we see in biological brains today. We illustrate diverse biological settings, from the earliest unicellular organisms to humans, where this operational principle appears to be a plausible interpretation of the meaning of sensor signals in biology, and how this relates to current neuroscientific theories and findings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15218">Functional Correspondences in the Human and Marmoset Visual Cortex During Movie Watching: Insights from Correlation, Redundancy, and Synergy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world of beauty is deeply connected to the visual cortex, as perception often begins with vision in both humans and marmosets. Quantifying functional correspondences in the visual cortex across species can help us understand how information is processed in the primate visual cortex, while also providing deeper insights into human visual cortex functions through the study of marmosets. In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14637">Reinforcement learning-based motion imitation for physiologically plausible musculoskeletal motor control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do humans move? The quest to understand human motion has broad applications in numerous fields, ranging from computer animation and motion synthesis to neuroscience, human prosthetics and rehabilitation. Although advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have produced impressive results in capturing human motion using simplified humanoids, controlling physiologically accurate models of the body remains an open challenge. In this work, we present a model-free motion imitation framework (KINESIS) to advance the understanding of muscle-based motor control. Using a musculoskeletal model of the lower body with 80 muscle actuators and 20 DoF, we demonstrate that KINESIS achieves strong imitation performance on 1.9 hours of motion capture data, is controllable by natural language through pre-trained text-to-motion generative models, and can be fine-tuned to carry out high-level tasks such as target goal reaching. Importantly, KINESIS generates muscle activity patterns that correlate well with human EMG activity. The physiological plausibility makes KINESIS a promising model for tackling challenging problems in human motor control theory, which we highlight by investigating Bernstein's redundancy problem in the context of locomotion. Code, videos and benchmarks will be available at https://github.com/amathislab/Kinesis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487">Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscience to study how the joint activity of large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed for imaging deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is in computational imaging: the co-development of optics and algorithms where the optics are designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, and the algorithms compensate by inverting the optical image coding process to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopic video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the information loss by extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to integrate the fluorescence of neighboring lines into a single set of measurements. By imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame, NORA diversifies the information collected across frames and enables video-level reconstruction. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame using image-level recovery, NORA recovers full video sequences through a nuclear-norm minimization (i.e., matrix completion) on the pixels-by-time matrix. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulation suite. Using these simulations we demonstrate that NORA imaging can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15402">Towards efficient keyword spotting using spike-based time difference encoders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keyword spotting in edge devices is becoming increasingly important as voice-activated assistants are widely used. However, its deployment is often limited by the extreme low-power constraints of the target embedded systems. Here, we explore the Temporal Difference Encoder (TDE) performance in keyword spotting. This recent neuron model encodes the time difference in instantaneous frequency and spike count to perform efficient keyword spotting with neuromorphic processors. We use the TIdigits dataset of spoken digits with a formant decomposition and rate-based encoding into spikes. We compare three Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) architectures to learn and classify spatio-temporal signals. The proposed SNN architectures are made of three layers with variation in its hidden layer composed of either (1) feedforward TDE, (2) feedforward Current-Based Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CuBa-LIF), or (3) recurrent CuBa-LIF neurons. We first show that the spike trains of the frequency-converted spoken digits have a large amount of information in the temporal domain, reinforcing the importance of better exploiting temporal encoding for such a task. We then train the three SNNs with the same number of synaptic weights to quantify and compare their performance based on the accuracy and synaptic operations. The resulting accuracy of the feedforward TDE network (89%) is higher than the feedforward CuBa-LIF network (71%) and close to the recurrent CuBa-LIF network (91%). However, the feedforward TDE-based network performs 92% fewer synaptic operations than the recurrent CuBa-LIF network with the same amount of synapses. In addition, the results of the TDE network are highly interpretable and correlated with the frequency and timescale features of the spoken keywords in the dataset. Our findings suggest that the TDE is a promising neuron model for scalable event-driven processing of spatio-temporal patterns.

                arXiv:2407.21632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several new lexicase-based selection variants have emerged due to the success of standard lexicase selection in various application domains. For symbolic regression problems, variants that use an epsilon-threshold or batches of training cases, among others, have led to performance improvements. Lately, especially variants that combine lexicase selection and down-sampling strategies have received a lot of attention. This paper evaluates the most relevant lexicase-based selection methods as well as traditional selection methods in combination with different down-sampling strategies on a wide range of symbolic regression problems. In contrast to most work, we not only compare the methods over a given evaluation budget, but also over a given time budget as time is usually limited in practice. We find that for a given evaluation budget, epsilon-lexicase selection in combination with a down-sampling strategy outperforms all other methods. If the given running time is very short, lexicase variants using batches of training cases perform best. Further, we find that the combination of tournament selection with informed down-sampling performs well in all studied settings.

                arXiv:2412.15021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's capabilities for energy efficient and parallel information processing, promising a solution to the increasing demand for faster and more efficient computational systems. Efficient training of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware requires the development of training algorithms that retain the sparsity of spike-based communication during training. Here, we report on the first implementation of event-based backpropagation on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic hardware platform. We use EventProp, an algorithm for event-based backpropagation in spiking neural networks (SNNs), to compute exact gradients using sparse communication of error signals between neurons. Our implementation computes multi-layer networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons using discretized versions of the differential equations and their adjoints, and uses event packets to transmit spikes and error signals between network layers. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of batch-parallelized, on-chip training of SNNs using the Yin Yang dataset, and provide an off-chip implementation for efficient prototyping, hyper-parameter search, and hybrid training methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00713">Spiking World Model with Multi-Compartment Neurons for Model-based Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant research attention in algorithm design and perception applications. However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-compartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a Spiking World Model (Spiking-WM), to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network (ANN)-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including SHD, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multi-compartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic information integration in shaping neuronal function, emphasizing the importance of cooperative dendritic processing in enhancing neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06756">Frequency and Generalisation of Periodic Activation Functions in Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic activation functions, often referred to as learned Fourier features have been widely demonstrated to improve sample efficiency and stability in a variety of deep RL algorithms. Potentially incompatible hypotheses have been made about the source of these improvements. One is that periodic activations learn low frequency representations and as a result avoid overfitting to bootstrapped targets. Another is that periodic activations learn high frequency representations that are more expressive, allowing networks to quickly fit complex value functions. We analyse these claims empirically, finding that periodic representations consistently converge to high frequencies regardless of their initialisation frequency. We also find that while periodic activation functions improve sample efficiency, they exhibit worse generalization on states with added observation noise -- especially when compared to otherwise equivalent networks with ReLU activation functions. Finally, we show that weight decay regularization is able to partially offset the overfitting of periodic activation functions, delivering value functions that learn quickly while also generalizing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09990">SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.09990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.

                <p>Early psychosis (EP) is a critical period for psychotic disorders during which the brain undergoes rapid and significant functional and structural changes (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Shinn et al., 2017</cross-ref>). The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a global effort to map the human brain's connectivity in health and disease. Here we focus on HCP-EP subjects (i.e., those within 5&nbsp;years of the initial psychotic episode) to determine macro- and microstructural alterations in EP (HCP-EP sample, <I>n</I> = 179: EP, <I>n</I> = 123, controls, <I>n</I> = 56) and their association with clinical outcomes (i.e., symptoms severity) in HCP-EP. We carried out analyses of deformation-based morphometry (DBM), scalar indices from the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Lastly, we conducted correlation analyses focused on the midbrain (DBM and DTI) to examine associations between its structure and clinical symptoms. Our results show that the midbrain displays robust alteration in its structure (DBM and DTI) in the voxel-based analysis. Complimentary alterations were also observed for the hippocampus and putamen. A seed-based analysis centered around the midbrain confirms the voxel-based analysis of DBM and DTI. TBSS displays structural differences within the midbrain and complementary alterations in the corticospinal tract and cingulum. Correlations between the midbrain structures and behavior showed that the quantified features correlate with cognition and clinical scores. Our findings contribute to understanding the midbrain-focused circuitry involvement in EP and provide a path for future investigations to inform specific brain-based biomarkers of EP.</p>

                <p>We aimed to better understand the dynamics of cortical neurons during nonREM sleep&mdash;a state in which neuronal populations are silenced for ~100&nbsp;ms of every second due to delta wave fluctuations. This alternation between periods of population spiking ("UP states") and silence ("DOWN states") generally synchronizes populations at the 1&nbsp;s timescale, although some prior work has shown that anticorrelations in nonREM can occur in pairs of neurons that are anticorrelated in wake. We used 24&nbsp;h recordings of frontal cortical neurons in rats to measure cross-correlation between pairs of neurons in wake, nonREM, and REM. Surprisingly, while most pairs of neurons were synchronized, we found a minority of pairs that showed significant nonREM-induced desynchronization, as indicated by negative cross-correlations in nonREM without equivalent anticorrelation in wake or REM. Interestingly, the degree of anticorrelation within NREM epochs was positively modulated by oscillations in the low-frequency (i.e., "delta" or 1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) range, meaning anticorrelation between some pairs increases when correlation increases between other pairs. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by firing during the nonsilent UP state phase of the delta cycle, indicating it is not due to neurons active in the DOWN state. Finally, high-variance spike timing between pairs of neurons and burst spiking during UP states are shown to specifically contribute to the anticorrelation. This state-specific desynchronization during the "synchronized" state represents a new phenomenon that can lead to new understanding of network dynamics during sleep.</p>

                The past decade has been marked by increased discussions on sustainability; some of the prominent accelerators being, mounting natural disasters, vocal climate activism, and the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interest has crossed over from deliberations in global summits to grassroots-level communication. Additionally, the literature points to the increasing usage of social media in communicating sustainability with an increase of interest in this area among Asian researchers. This paper aims to understand the direction of sustainability communication and the usage of social media in the communication of sustainability, in the last decade (2013-2023), from an Asian perspective – researchers and respondents from Asia. A comprehensive search of the literature by Asian researchers on sustainability communication on social media in the past decade was conducted using the Scopus database. The studies were clustered around common directions and terminologies, basis an in-depth content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study presents the current direction of research in sustainability communication on social media in the areas of brand-generated sustainability communication, cause-generated content and user-generated content. Few prominent themes that emerged were of green marketing, greenwashing, social media as a platform for active engagement and environment related discussions. The studies analyzed in the scoping review affirm that sustainability communication on social media in Asia has substantial potential to improve the environmental awareness of the public and promote actual pro-environmental behavior in the broad areas of green purchase and conservation behavior. The review provides a holistic view of the recent trends and possible future directions for sustainability communication on social media.

                Background Recently, health professional education uses visual art observation to promote various observation-related technical skills. This article maps the studies on such interventions, scrutinizes what they measured as observational skills, and discusses their effectiveness. Methods Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, a scoping review was conducted. Publications from 2001 on were identified by searching four databases and by hand searching. The author screened each publication using the pre-designed eligibility criteria: participants were novice healthcare learners enrolled in visual art observation training; the study aimed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on technical skills related to observation; the skills were objectively measured. The author extracted relevant information from the included papers without additional inquiry into the study authors. The extracted information was illustrated in both a tabular and descriptive format. Results 3,157 publications were identified, of which 18 articles were included. Few studies had valid and reliable experiments. The relatively valid evidence is that the participants listed more elements or signs for artistic or medical images. Conclusions Sound evidence is lacking for all the technical skills intended to be fostered. Observation skills for artistic images have not been demonstrated to transfer to technical skills. Nor do the studies show that they promoted accurate diagnoses and reduced misdiagnoses. Additionally, the evidence on verbalizing skills is not isolated from the impact of discussions and is unclear regarding its transfer to actual communication. For the others, there are not enough valid studies on technical skills. This is true for studies that directly examine promoting accurate diagnosis or reducing misdiagnosis. Moreover, there may be promising alternatives to visual art observations for cultivating such technical skills, but no comparative studies were conducted.

                Background The most prevalent, widely recognized, and challenging side effect experienced by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy is mucositis, which results in considerable morbidity and has the potential to impede the treatment regimen and augment therapeutic costs. Therefore, a comparison between the two experimental interventions in the present study was performed to represent the effectiveness of different treatments or preventative measures. Aim To evaluate the efficacy of oral cryotherapy compared to normal saline mouthwash in reducing alkylating drug-induced mucositis among cancer patients. Methods A Randomized controlled clinical trial-parallel group design was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in the oncology ward of Bhubaneswar, with a total number of 74 participants (of which 37 were administered cryotherapy and 37 were administered normal saline mouthwash) using the WHO mucositis assessment scale. Results Association of mucositis assessment grading with groups was performed on day 1st, 7th day, 14th day and 21st day followed by intervention. The review on 21st day revealed that 70.3% of the cryotherapy group had grade 0 mucositis, which is a big jump from 48.6% on day 14. In contrast, in the normal saline group, the corresponding increase was only 18.9% to 27.0% only. Conclusion There is clear evidence that on day 21, the improvement in mucositis grade was much higher in the cryotherapy group than in the normal saline group, as there was a significant association between mucositis grade and group (p<0.001) on day 21.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-683/v2?src=rss">A cross-sectional study of Malaysian low-income drug addict wives: Relationship between family impact, coping and mental wellbeing [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The involvement of the husbands in the issue of drug addiction has impacted the wives’ livelihoods. Due to drug addiction amongst husbands, the wives experience stress and strain. The Stress Strain Coping Support Model (SSCS) was established to better comprehend how coping influences stress and strain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the stress which refers to family impact experienced by the wives of drug addicts, in terms of economic difficulties and marital conflict, and mental wellbeing. Furthermore, this study examines the role of coping as a mediating factor between family impact and mental wellbeing. Methods This study involved 132 wives of low-income drug addicts in Malaysia, who were selected using a purposive sampling method. Economic Strain Scale (ESS) and Braiker-Kelly Marital Conflict Scale (BKMCS) were used to measure family impact. Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale Short Form (CAPS-SF) and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) were used to measure coping and mental wellbeing of the respective respondents. Results Path analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.3.7 showed that there is a direct association between family impact and coping, and between coping and mental wellbeing. The results also showed that family impact was associated indirectly with mental wellbeing through coping. Conclusions The findings benefited drug addict wives and practitioners related to this field in terms of enhancing the use of coping mechanisms in managing family impact and improving mental wellbeing, specifically amongst low-income drug addict wives.

                Background As lung cancer treatment has progressed, there has been an increase in awareness of the short- and long-term adverse effects of targeted cancer therapies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly cardiovascular toxicities. Methods The current study assessed the potential drug interactions using interaction drug-interaction checkers (IBM Micromedex and Drugs.com). Molecular docking was employed to further investigate the involvement of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) proteins to elucidate their potential interactions and underlying mechanisms. Result A total of 74 pharmacokinetic and 105 pharmacodynamic interactions were detected between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs, along with a report on the severity and level of documentation. A considerable fraction of molecular modelling outcomes concurred with information of drug-drug interaction checkers. The binding energies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hERG and PXR were high, indicating significant interactions. The cardiovascular drug class encompasses calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medicines, and statins, which exhibit synergistic interactions. The identification of these potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4, P-gp, and hERG proteins can be utilized in therapy optimization in clinical settings. Conclusion This study will aid clinicians in designing safe dosage regimens for patients with lung cancer. In cases where patients have multiple comorbidities, it is essential to study the clinical aspects to design efficient chemotherapy and manage adverse effects and toxicities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-308/v1?src=rss">Osteopetrosis and fracture: planning and management [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Osteopetrosis (OP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density. Monitoring is the only alternative in these patients because of bone fragility, which is a source of frequent complications. This study aimed to describe the fracture profile, possible complications, and management in this group of patients. Material and methods We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study including 21 fractures in 8 OP patients managed in our department between 1996 and 2022, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Patient data included age, sex, history of surgery, fractures, intraoperative difficulties encountered, and complications. Results All of our patients were young adults with a mean age of 28.4 years and an M/F ratio of 3:1. A total of 21 fractures (8 patients with OP) were managed in our department. The femur was the most frequent fracture site. The management of these fractures is surgical. Plate osteosynthesis is the most common indication. Three fractures were treated by orthopaedics. There were high rates of intraoperative and post-operative complications. Discussion Fractures in patients with OP often involve the long bones. As this is a rare disease, there are few studies on the appropriate management of fractures in this population. Most studies are case series with a small number of cases. Osteosynthesis is the recommended treatment for these fractures despite the risk of failure. Therefore, effective preoperative planning is essential. Great care must be taken when synthesizing these fractures to avoid intraoperative complications. Conclusion Fractures in patients with osteopetrosis present a challenge to orthopaedic surgeons. Planned surgery enables the appropriate synthesis of fractures. Long-term follow-up is essential for these patients to detect complications at an early stage.

Drugs that impair microtubule dynamics alter microtubule-kinetochore attachment and invoke the mitotic checkpoint which arrests cells in mitosis. The arrest can last for hours, but it is leaky: cells adapt (i.e., slip out of it) and exit from mitosis. Here, we investigate the mechanism that allows cells to escape, and whether it is possible to prevent it. Based on a model of the mitotic checkpoint which includes the presence of a positive feedback loop, the escape from the arrest is described as a stochastic transition driven by fluctuations of molecular components from a checkpoint ON to a checkpoint OFF state. According to the model, drug removal further facilitates adaptation, a prediction we confirmed in budding yeast. The model suggests two ways to avoid adaptation: inhibition of APC/C and strengthening the mitotic checkpoint. We confirmed experimentally that both alterations decrease the chance of cells slipping out of mitosis, during a prolonged arrest and after washing out the drug. Our results may be relevant for increasing the efficiency of microtubule depolymerizing drugs.

                Sonoda et al. show that selective visual experience can alter the distribution of feature selectivity in the primary visual thalamus. This plasticity is independent of changes in cortical feedback and requires proper retinogeniculate refinement. While plasticity is present in both developing and mature thalamus, changes during development are longer lasting.

They demonstrate that these effects are driven by restoration of synaptic efficacy at two monosynaptic inputs to the NAc—medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus—which control different components of hedonic behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101965">Integration of sensory and fear memories in the rat medial temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Wong et al., 2019 used a sensory preconditioning protocol to examine how sensory and fear memories are integrated in the rat medial temporal lobe. In this protocol, rats integrate a sound-light (sensory) memory that forms in stage 1 with a light-shock (fear) memory that forms in stage 2 to generate fear responses (freezing) across test presentations of the sound in stage 3. Here, we advance this research by showing that (1) how/when rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories (online in stage 2 or at test in stage 3) changes with the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1; and (2) regardless of how/when it occurs, the integration requires communication between two regions of the medial temporal lobe: the perirhinal cortex and basolateral amygdala complex. Thus, ‘event familiarity’ determines how/when sensory and fear memories are integrated but not the circuitry by which the integration occurs: this remains the same.

                The <i>rete ovarii</i> (RO) is an appendage of the ovary that has been given little attention. Although the RO appears in drawings of the ovary in early versions of Gray’s Anatomy, it disappeared from recent textbooks, and is often dismissed as a functionless vestige in the adult ovary. Using PAX8 immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we characterized the fetal development of the RO in the context of the mouse ovary. The RO consists of three distinct regions that persist in adult life, the intraovarian rete (IOR), the extraovarian rete (EOR), and the connecting rete (CR). While the cells of the IOR appear to form solid cords within the ovary, the EOR rapidly develops into a convoluted tubular epithelium ending in a distal dilated tip. Cells of the EOR are ciliated and exhibit cellular trafficking capabilities. The CR, connecting the EOR to the IOR, gradually acquires tubular epithelial characteristics by birth. Using microinjections into the distal dilated tip of the EOR, we found that luminal contents flow toward the ovary. Mass spectrometry revealed that the EOR lumen contains secreted proteins potentially important for ovarian function. We show that the cells of the EOR are closely associated with vasculature and macrophages, and are contacted by neuronal projections, consistent with a role as a sensory appendage of the ovary. The direct proximity of the RO to the ovary and its integration with the extraovarian landscape suggest that it plays an important role in ovary development and homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93076">The genomic legacy of aurochs hybridisation in ancient and modern Iberian cattle</a></h4>

              
                Cattle (<i>Bos taurus</i>) play an important role in the life of humans in the Iberian Peninsula not just as a food source but also in cultural events. When domestic cattle were first introduced to Iberia, wild aurochs (<i>Bos primigenius</i>) were still present, leaving ample opportunity for mating (whether intended by farmers or not). Using a temporal bioarchaeological dataset covering eight millennia, we trace gene flow between the two groups. Our results show frequent hybridisation during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic, likely reflecting a mix of hunting and herding or relatively unmanaged herds, with mostly male aurochs and female domestic cattle involved. This is supported by isotopic evidence consistent with ecological niche sharing, with only a few domestic cattle possibly being managed. The proportion of aurochs ancestry in domestic cattle remains relatively constant from about 4000 years ago, probably due to herd management and selection against first generation hybrids, coinciding with other cultural transitions. The constant level of wild ancestry (~20%) continues into modern Western European breeds including Iberian cattle selected for aggressiveness and fighting ability. This study illuminates the genomic impact of human actions and wild introgression in the establishment of cattle as one of the most important domestic species today.

">Structural Determinants of Signal Speed: A Multimodal Investigation of Face Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Face perception is fundamental to social cognition and often disrupted in autism. However, the neurological basis for this disrupted face perception and the mechanisms underlying altered electrophysiological signaling in autism, such as increased latency of the N170-an electrophysiological marker of face processing, remain unknown. Here, we leverage multimodal neuroimaging in autistic adolescents to establish a link between MRI-measured axonal microstructure within the face processing network and EEG-measured N170 latency. We demonstrate that a novel metric of axonal signal transit time derived from axonal diameter, myelination, and length-estimated axonal latency (EAL)-predicts N170 latency during face processing. Moreover, we demonstrate that individuals with and without autism rely upon different pathways, providing a structural account for autism-related face processing differences. By establishing this relationship between EEG-based electrical function and MRI-based axonal microstructure, we provide a non-invasive, spatially-detailed estimate of neuronal processing speed that can inform understanding of brain function, development, and disorder.

">The cognitive and neural bases of creative thought: a cross-domain meta-analysis of transcranial direct current stimulation studies</a></h4>

              
                Creative thought enables humans to flexibly generate, evaluate and select novel and adaptive ideas according to different contexts. Decades of creativity research indicates that it involves at least two aspects: retrieval of previously acquired knowledge and manipulation of that knowledge. However, the cognitive processes underpinning these two aspects of creative thought remain underspecified. The broader clinical-cognitive neuroscience literature suggests that retrieval and manipulation of knowledge is underpinned by general purpose cognitive mechanisms supporting semantic cognition, controlled episodic memory retrieval, and executive mechanisms. To identify commonalities from converging evidence that points towards a unifying theory for the neurocognitive bases of creative thought, we reviewed and meta-analysed 152 studies from creativity and the relevant parallel cognitive neuroscience literature using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The results revealed three things: 1) current tDCS studies are heavily biased towards the frontal cortex (459/591 effect sizes; 77.7%); 2) only anodal tDCS over the left lateral frontal cortex promotes creativity (p <.01); and 3) anodal tDCS stimulation over the same region also promotes improvement in many other cognitive processes. The latter includes more efficient processing of semantic knowledge (p <.05), more accurate episodic memory retrieval (p <.05), better and more efficient manipulation of buffered knowledge (all p <.001), and more efficient response selection amongst competing options (i.e., task-setting; p <.01). By merging these previously separate literatures, tDCS studies support the notion that creative thought arises from general purpose cognitive mechanisms including controlled retrieval and temporary storage of semantic and episodic information, as well as executive mechanisms.

">Structural Connectivity Correlates of Response to Electroconvulsive Therapy in Treatment-Resistant Depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective option for treatment resistant depression (TRD). In this study, we sought to explore if structural connectivity of limbic networks has an association with response to ECT. Methods: We studied 23 patients with TRD who underwent a course of bifrontal ECT, employing probabilistic tractography at baseline to assess structural connectivity between the thalamus (THA), posterior (PCC), subgenual cingulate cortices, anterior insula (aINS), amygdala and orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, hypothesizing that these hubs participate in the formation and refractoriness of depression symptoms. We also include 21 healthy subject as controls group (HC). Results: Connectivity between left THA and left PCC was related to both baseline depression severity (R=0.504; p= 0.017) and clinical response (R=0.452; p=0.004). Right aINS-prefrontal connectivity was associated with less clinical response. Structural connectivity was globally higher in patients than in HC (F=2.488; p=0.007). Conclusions: The association of ECT response with stronger structural connectivity between hubs supporting self-referential bodily experience as well as autobiographical memory encoding and retrieval deserves exploration as a predictor in persons with TRD. In turn, the right aINS is a major hub for the salience network and is involved in repetitive negative mentation. Stronger structural connectivity of this region may be a heuristically valid biomarker for refractory TRD. We discuss the potential of the present findings for the design of anatomically precise neuromodulation interventions that would be useful to treat TRD while circumventing cognitive side effects of ECT.

">Pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of neuronal inhibition assessed through biochemically detailed modelling of GABAB receptor signalling</a></h4>

              
                GABAB receptors (GABABRs) are an important building block in neural activity. Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABABRs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. To ensure the generality of our modelling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABABRs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signalling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABABR system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABABR activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.

">Preferred spatial frequency covaries with cortical magnification in human primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                A comprehensive description of the organizational principles of human primary visual cortex (V1) requires an understanding of how V1 neural properties covary across the cortical map. We used fMRI to quantify V1 preferred spatial frequency and cortical magnification as a function of both eccentricity and polar angle, and across individual observers (n=40). We found that the two measurements: (1) declined proportionally with eccentricity; (2) covaried systematically with polar angle, but with variation in cortical magnification double that of preferred spatial frequency; and (3) covaried across individuals. These data reveal a link between V1 preferred spatial frequency and cortical magnification within observers -as a function of visual field location- and between observers -when summed over visual field location. These results suggest that to a large degree, these two measurements of cortex develop in a coordinated manner, consistent with the hypothesis of a canonical cortical circuit.

">Functional Connectivity Alterations in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10: Insights from Gray Matter Atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare, inherited neurological disorder caused by an expansion of the non-coding ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in the ATAXIN 10 gene. It is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. Previous research has demonstrated extensive white and gray matter degeneration, particularly in the cerebellum. However, the impact of the SCA10 mutation on functional connectivity (FC) remains unexplored. This study aimed to characterize intrinsic FC changes in SCA10 patients and their relationship to clinical manifestations. Structural and resting-state MRIs were obtained from 26 SCA10 patients and 26 control subjects. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and seed-ROI and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) were performed to identify cerebral atrophy and FC changes respectively. Additionally, correlation analyses were conducted between FC changes and scores from the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In SCA10 patients, VBM analysis revealed extensive gray matter loss in motor cortices and the cerebellum. FC analysis identified significant FC changes originating from seed-ROIs in the right cerebellar VI and left precentral gyrus. Furthermore, group comparison using ICA components showed that SCA10 patients exhibited higher FC in the sensorimotor and cerebellar functional networks. Moreover, the average BOLD signal within the cerebellar network negatively correlated with MoCA scores. In summary, SCA10 patients exhibited enhanced FC in brain regions that displayed gray matter atrophy, underscoring the impact of SCA10 degeneration on resting state networks and induction of potential maladaptive FC compensatory mechanisms.

                The creation and curation of synaptic-level neuronal networks, or connectomes, enables the study of the relationship between structure and function of these networks. Topological characteristics of neuronal networks have been studied extensively. Separately there have been considerable efforts to classify the morphology, cell types, and lineages of neurons. Here we introduce a network metric that combines topological analysis with node metadata. This entropic quantity measures the diversity of incoming or outgoing connections to a node in terms of the metadata distribution. We find that in emph{C. elegans}, the top-scoring neurons in terms of this metric have known functions that integrate and disseminate multimodal information involved in sensorimotor functions. In the nerve cord of emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, we find that the top-scoring neurons are located in the abdominal neuropil, where sensorimotor coordination is required for complex innate behaviour such as mating.

">Serotonergic signaling governs C. elegans sensory response to conflicting olfactory stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits that consolidate sensory cues are essential for neurological functioning. Neural circuits that perform sensory integration can vary greatly because the sensory processing regions of the brain employ various neural motifs. Here, we investigate a neural circuit that mediates the response to conflicting olfactory stimuli in C. elegans. We concurrently expose animals to an aversive dispersal pheromone, osas#9, and an attractive bacterial extract. While worms usually avoid osas#9 alone, they suppress this avoidance behavior in the presence of a bacterial extract. Loss-of-function mutants and cell-specific rescues reveal that serotonergic signaling from the ADF neuron is essential for bacterial extract-induced osas#9 avoidance attenuation. The inhibitory serotonin receptor, MOD-1, which is widely expressed on interneurons and motor neurons, is required for this sensory integration, suggesting that serotonin acts in an inhibitory manner. By performing calcium imaging on the ADF neurons in synaptic signaling (unc-13) and peptidergic (unc-31) signaling mutant backgrounds, we show that the ADF neurons require input from other neurons, likely the ASK neurons, to respond to food extracts. We reveal a cue integration neural circuit in which serotonergic signaling at the sensory neuron level silences an aversive neural signal.

In the current study, we examined several features of tactile orientation perception and their interactions, aiming to better understand the underlying mechanisms. We found that active exploration exhibits better orientation acuity compared to passive exploration. We also observed an exploration-independent and paradigm-independent robust anisotropy (i.e., tactile oblique effect) in tactile orientation acuity where the proximal-distal axis demonstrates superior orientation acuity compared to oblique and medial-lateral orientations. Finally, we demonstrated that, similar to its visual counterpart, tactile orientation perception showed a systematic attractive serial dependence effect, in which current orientation perception is biased towards the previous trial. However, this attractive effect is driven by post-perceptual processing/response rather than the stimulus per se.

">Meditation induces shifts in neural oscillations, braincomplexity and critical dynamics: Novel insights fromMEG</a></h4>

              
                While the beneficial impacts of meditation are increasingly acknowledged, its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We examined the electrophysiological brain signals of expert Buddhist monks during two established meditation methods known as Samatha and Vipassana, which employ focused at- tention and open monitoring technique. By combining source-space magnetoencephalography (MEG) with advanced signal processing and machine learning tools, we provide an unprecedented assessment of the role of brain oscillations, complexity and criticality in meditation. In addition to power spectral density (PSD), we computed long-range temporal correlations (LRTC), deviation from criticality coefficient (DCC), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), 1/f slope, Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), and spectral entropy. Our findings indicate increased levels of neural signal complexity during both meditation practices compared to the resting state, alongside widespread reductions in gamma-band LRTC and 1/f slope. Importantly, the DCC analysis revealed a separation between Samatha and Vipassana, suggesting that their distinct phenomenological properties are mediated by specific computational characteristics of their dynamic states. Furthermore, in contrast to most previous reports, we observed a decrease in oscillatory gamma power during meditation, a divergence we attribute to the correction of the power spectrum by the 1/f slope. We discuss how these results advance our comprehension of the neural processes associated with focused attention and open monitoring meditation practices.

                ippocampal ripples, critical for sleep-related memory consolidation, are heterogeneous events with various sources and functions. Here we applied principal component analysis to identify ripple sub-types and relate them to hippocampal-cortical interactions as well as their role in consolidating simple and complex semantic-like memories in rats. Three main ripple types were discovered: baseline, large-input, and small-input ripples. Small-input ripples, were associated with increased prefrontal cortex to hippocampus connectivity, followed hippocampal delta waves, and were sufficient for simple learning. In contrast, large-input ripples exhibited increased hippocampus to prefrontal cortex connectivity, occurred during hippocampal spindles together as a doublet with a small-input ripple, and were critical for complex memory consolidation. Finally, learning induced heightened coupling between hippocampal delta and spindle oscillations and their cortical counterparts, consequently leading to an increased synchronization of ripples with cortical oscillations.

">Persistent Anhedonia After Intermittent Long-Access Nicotine Self-Administration in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Tobacco use disorder is a chronic condition characterized by compulsive nicotine use and withdrawal symptoms after smoking cessation. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Smoking cessation leads to anhedonia, which is an inability to experience pleasure from previously enjoyed activities and is caused by dysregulation of the brain's reward and stress systems. It is also a key withdrawal symptom that contributes to relapse to smoking after a period of abstinence. To better understand the development of anhedonia, we investigated its onset and time course in rats that self-administered nicotine. Rats were implanted with intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrodes to assess reward function and intravenous catheters for nicotine self-administration. Elevations in ICSS brain reward thresholds reflect decreased sensitivity to rewarding electrical stimuli, indicating anhedonia. The rats self-administered 0.06 mg/kg of nicotine intermittently, three days per week, for seven weeks. Brain reward thresholds were determined once a week 24 h after nicotine self-administration during weeks 1 to 3, and at 12, 24, and 48 h during weeks 4, 5, and 7. Elevations in brain reward thresholds were not observed during the first four weeks of nicotine self-administration. However, the brain reward thresholds were elevated in both weeks 5 and 7 at least 12 h after nicotine self-administration, indicating that anhedonia emerges gradually and then persists. As withdrawal severity gradually increases, smoking cessation may become more challenging. Therefore, behavioral or pharmacological interventions soon after smoking initiation are critical to prevent the development of a tobacco use disorder.

">Beyond the Resection: Surgical White Matter Disruption alters Non-Resected Brain Anatomy</a></h4>

              
                Resective neurosurgery is a cornerstone treatment for many neurological conditions. Although traditionally viewed as localised procedure, increasing evidence from advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows that also non-resected anatomy can degenerate following surgery. The relationship between local tissue removal and these postoperative changes remains thus far speculative. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that degenerative changes to surgically preserved grey and white matter are mediated by transneuronal degeneration, a deterioration of intact neuronal populations due to lost axonal input. Using a robust structural and diffusion MRI framework, we first identify widespread postoperative atrophy: pronounced cortical thickness decreases near the resection, and extensive white matter impairments across the ipsilateral hemisphere. Importantly, we then link these alterations to surgical white matter disruption, revealing a sequential network atrophy following neurosurgery. Beyond degenerative effects, we also demonstrate often reported structural network reorganisations as an artefact of image processing, indicating limited capacity for macroscale plasticity post-resection.

">Differential modulation of movement speed with state-dependent deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) provides unprecedented spatiotemporal precision for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), allowing for direct real-time state-specific adjustments. Inspired by findings from optogenetic stimulation in mice, we hypothesized that STN-DBS effects on movement speed depend on ongoing movement kinematics that patients exhibit during stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a motor state-dependent closed-loop neurostimulation algorithm, adapting DBS burst delivery to ongoing movement speed in 24 PD patients. We found a stronger anti-bradykinetic effect, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls, when STN-DBS was applied during fast but not slow movements, while only stimulating 5% of overall movement time. To study underlying brain circuits and neurophysiological mechanisms, we investigated the behavioral effects with MRI connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Finally, we demonstrate that machine learning-based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms. Our findings provide novel insights into the state-dependency of invasive neuromodulation, which could inspire advanced state-dependent neurostimulation algorithms for brain disorders.

">Differential retinal ganglion cell resilience to optic nerve injury across vertebrate species</a></h4>

              
                Optic neuropathies comprise a diverse group of disorders that ultimately lead to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. Despite varying etiologies, these conditions share a conserved pathological progression: axonal damage in the optic nerve triggers progressive RGC degeneration. Understanding species-specific differences in neuronal resilience is critical for identifying key survival mechanisms and potential neuroprotective targets. In this study, we compare RGC densities and survival rates following optic nerve crush (ONC) in three vertebrate models-mice, zebrafish, and killifish-under standardized experimental conditions. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that, similar to RBPMS in mice, Rbpms2 serves as a pan-RGC marker in zebrafish and killifish. Using these markers, we reveal significant species-specific differences in RGC density, with fish species exhibiting over a five-fold higher density than mice at equivalent life stage. Killifish also show an age-dependent decline in RGC density. Furthermore, we identify distinct injury responses across species: mice undergo rapid degeneration, losing ~80% of their RGCs by day 14 after ONC; zebrafish maintain full RGC retention for two weeks before experiencing a loss of ~12%; and killifish display a biphasic response to ONC, with young adults retaining two-thirds of their RGCs by day 21, while older fish exhibit a more pronounced second wave of RGC loss, ultimately preserving just over half of their RGCs by 21 days after injury. These findings highlight fundamental differences in neuroprotective capacity among species, providing a comparative framework to uncover molecular mechanisms governing RGC survival and to identify therapeutic strategies for treating optic neuropathies and neurodegeneration across diverse pathologies.

                Astrocyte cilia are largely understudied due to the lack of available tools. Astrocyte research advanced with the establishment of Aldh1l1-CreERT2, an inducible Cre line that specifically targets the astrocyte lineage. Here, we develop and compare genetic models that label astrocyte cilia in the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC) using Aldh1l1-CreERT2 and Cre-dependent cilia reporters. We evaluate these models by testing different tamoxifen-induction protocols and quantifying the percentage of astrocytes labeled with the cilia reporters. We show that tamoxifen dosage impacts the expression of cilia reporters in astrocytes. We validate the maximum cilia-labeling efficiency of tamoxifen using constitutively-expressed cilia reporters. The data reveal that only a subset of SOX9- positive astrocytes in the PFC possess cilia throughout development. Our work highlights the utility of Cre-Lox systems to target specific cell types and the importance of carefully validating genetic models.

">Predicting the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion: A Time-Window-of-Integration Approach</a></h4>

              
                {The sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI) refers to the observation that pairing a single flash with 2 auditory beeps leads to the illusory perception of 2 visual stimuli (fission illusion). Susceptibility to the illusion depends on many factors like exact physical stimulus parameters, participants` expectations, attention, age, and clinical/non-clinical population membership. While there exist many experimental studies, very few models have been proposed to account for the phenomenon. Here we suggest a formal model (SIFI-TWIN) based on the notion of a temporal binding window that predicts the occurrence of illusory flashes as a function of the temporal and physical stimulus arrangement. The model`s performance is illustrated on a study investigating differences in SIFI performance between elderly hearing aid users and those with the same degree of mild hearing loss who were not using hearing aids. The results suggests that the higher incidence of reporting an illusory flash for hearing-aid users is due to both a larger temporal window of integration and a larger bias to report the illusion. The SIFI-TWIN model will help to better understand the diverse results from clinical and non-clinical studies as well as the cognitive foundations of the SIFI.

">Gamma oscillations in basal ganglia stem from the interplay between local inhibition and beta synchronization</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia activity fluctuations have primarily been studied in the context of beta (12-30 Hz) oscillations, a well-established neural marker for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent studies have also identified gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations within the basal ganglia, suggesting it could serve as an alternative marker, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, through a spiking network model of the basal ganglia, we identified two distinct gamma oscillations: a high-frequency gamma rhythm within the globus pallidus (GPe-TI) and a slower gamma rhythm within D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs), both stemming from self-inhibition. When we simulated dopamine depletion to mimic the effects of PD, the intensity of gamma oscillations in the GPe-TI was not affected, but their peak frequency increased due to phase-amplitude coupling with pathological beta oscillations. This suggests that the GPe-TI loop, while robust to dopamine depletion, becomes more synchronized with beta activity in the context of PD, leading to faster gamma rhythms. In contrast, gamma oscillations in D2 MSNs were not present in simulated healthy condition and only emerged under dopamine-depleted pathological conditions. Moreover, both their intensity and peak frequency were strongly modulated by pathological beta activity. Together, these findings highlight the complementary roles of self-inhibition and beta oscillations in shaping gamma activity within basal ganglia circuits. The GPe-TI loop primarily sustains high-frequency gamma rhythms, while low frequency gamma rhythms in D2 MSNs are strongly dependent on dopamine-depletion-related beta modulation. These results underscore the importance of network-wide interactions in PD, where pathological beta oscillations influence gamma activity. This study offers insights into the mechanisms of gamma oscillations in PD and highlights the potential of gamma activity, in both the prototypical and striatal loops, as a marker for disease progression and monitoring pathological dysfunction in PD.

">Hair cell population integrity necessary to preserve vestibular function</a></h4>

              
                Regeneration of hair cells is a primary target of gene therapy aimed at restoring vestibular and cochlear functions. Indeed, vestibular dysfunction constitutes a major medical concern, as one of its manifestation, dizziness, affects 15-35% of the general population, with a prevalence rate of 85% for those over 80 of age. Age-related alterations of both vestibular function and the integrity of vestibular hair cells has been reported in humans. However, direct comparisons between structural pathology and vestibular dysfunctions quantifications are lacking in humans and rather limited in animal models, representing a significant gap in current knowledge. Thus far, therapeutic trials in animal models targeting vestibular loss associated with genetic diseases have yielded varied and partial results, and the functional identity and quantity of hair cells sufficient to restore minimal or normal vestibular function remain undefined. Here, we further develop an innovative methodology to bridge the gap between hair cells integrity and functional vestibular loss in individuals. Gradual vestibular deficits were induced through a dose-dependent ototoxic compound, quantified with canal or utricular-specific vestibulo-ocular reflex tests, and were then correlated in all individuals with the loss of type I and type II hair cells in different regions of ampulla and macula. Our findings reveal that the structure-function relationship is nonlinear, with lower bound of approximately 50% of hair cells necessary to retain minimal vestibular function, and threshold exceeding 80% to preserve normal function, thus shedding light on population-coding mechanisms for vestibular response. Our data further support the decisive role of type I, rather than type II, HC in the tested VOR functions.

">Parameter optimisation for mitigating somatosensory confounds during transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) redefines what is possible with non-invasive neuromodulation by offering unparalleled spatial precision and flexible targeting capabilities. However, peripheral confounds pose a significant challenge to reliably implementing this technology. While auditory confounds during TUS have been studied extensively, the somatosensory confound has been overlooked thus far. It will become increasingly vital to quantify and manage this confound as the field shifts towards higher doses, more compact stimulation devices, and more frequent stimulation through the temple where co-stimulation is more pronounced. Here, we provide a systematic characterisation of somatosensory co-stimulation during TUS. We also identify the conditions under which this confound can be mitigated most effectively by mapping the confound-parameter space. Specifically, we investigate dose-response effects, pulse shaping characteristics, and transducer-specific parameters. We demonstrate that somatosensory confounds can be mitigated by avoiding near-field intensity peaks in the scalp, spreading energy across a greater area of the scalp, ramping the pulse envelope, and delivering equivalent doses via longer, lower-intensity pulses rather than shorter, higher-intensity pulses. Additionally, higher pulse repetition frequencies and fundamental frequencies reduce somatosensory effects. Through our systematic mapping of the parameter space, we also find preliminary evidence that particle displacement (strain) may be a primary biophysical driving force behind peripheral somatosensory co-stimulation. This study provides actionable strategies to minimise somatosensory confounds, which will support the thorough experimental control required to unlock the full potential of TUS for scientific research and clinical interventions.

">Heterogeneous distribution of glial cell marker proteins and of cell nucleus marker in the myelinated region of the normal rat optic nerve</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells are critically important for maintenance of neuronal activity in the optic nerve. The present study documents the distribution of glial structure proteins (GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; MBP: myelin basic protein), a glial functional protein (GS: glutamine synthetase), and of a cell nucleus marker (bisBenzimide) in the various myelinated regions of the normal rat optic nerve. Fourteen optic nerves from 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats were employed. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the distribution of GFAP, MBP, GS, and of bisBenzimide along the longitudinal plane of the myelinated region. GFAP-immunoreactivity and GS-immunoreactivity were strong in the distal (anterior)-most part, but weak in the proximal (posterior) part with a significant decrease in strength along the longitudinal plane of the myelinated region. bisBenzimide labeling was also strong in the distal-most part, but weak in the proximal part with a significant difference in strength in the myelinated region. MBP-immunoreactive particles and cell nuclei were densely distributed in the distal-most part, however they were sparsely dispersed in the proximal part with a significant difference. The heterogeneous distribution of GFAP, GS, bisBenzimide, cell nuclei, and MBP-immunoreactive particles along the longitudinal plane may be an important functional adaptation that reflects the not uniform nature of the physiological and structural environment of the myelinated region. Notably, the concentrations of GFAP, GS, and of MBP-immunoreactive particles in the distal-most part of the myelinated region suggest that this part is under a mildly pathological condition in the normal rat optic nerve.

">scFv intrabody targeting wildtype TDP-43 presents protective effects in a cellular model of TDP-43 proteinopathy</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 proteinopathies are a set of neurological disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation and mislocalization of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm, leading to the disruption of the normal function of the protein. In most of the cases, it is the wildtype (wt) form of the protein that is involved. An untargeted high-throughput screen of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library was performed using phage display against human full-length wt TDP-43. Two scFvs (B1 and D7) were retained following cellular expression (then termed intrabodies) and colocalization with cytoplasmic TDP-43 in vitro. We generated a 3D structure of full length wt TDP-43 in silico, and used it for epitope mapping. In a cellular model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, D7 enhanced the proteasomal degradation of the insoluble 35-kDa C-terminal fragment TDP-43 and reversed some TDP-43-induced metabolomic alterations, particularly relating to the lipid metabolism. Our findings offer a new scFv intrabody that bind to human wtTDP-43 and modify cellular pathways associated with TDP-43 proteinopathies.

">A human electrophysiological biomarker of Fragile X Syndrome is shared in V1 of Fmr1 KO mice and caused by loss of FMRP in cortical excitatory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Predicting clinical therapeutic outcomes from preclinical animal studies remains an obstacle to developing treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological biomarkers analyzed consistently across species could bridge this divide. In humans, alpha oscillations in the resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) are altered in many disorders, but these disruptions have not yet been characterized in animal models. Here, we employ a uniform analytical method to show in males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) that the slowed alpha oscillations observed in adults are also present in children and in visual cortex of adult and juvenile Fmr1 -/y mice. We find that alpha-like oscillations in mice reflect the differential activity of two classes of inhibitory interneurons, but the phenotype is caused by deletion of Fmr1 specifically in cortical excitatory neurons. These results provide a framework for studying alpha oscillation disruptions across species, advance understanding of a critical rsEEG signature in the human brain and inform the cellular basis for a putative biomarker of FXS.

">Expression of Tacr1 and Gpr83 by spinal projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                Anterolateral system (ALS) projection neurons underlie perception of pain, itch and skin temperature. These cells are heterogeneous, and there have therefore been many attempts to define functional populations. A recent study identified two classes of ALS neuron in mouse superficial dorsal horn (SDH) based on expression of the G protein-coupled receptors Tacr1 or Gpr83. It was reported that cells expressing these receptors formed largely non-overlapping populations, and that ~60% of ALS cells in SDH expressed Tacr1. An additional finding was that while Tacr1- and Gpr83-expressing ALS cells projected to several brain nuclei, their axons did not reach the ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamic nucleus, which is reciprocally connected to the primary somatosensory cortex. These results were surprising, because we had reported that ~90% of SDH ALS neurons in the mouse possess the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1r), which is encoded by Tacr1, and in addition the VPL is thought to receive input from lamina I ALS cells. Here we use retrograde and anterograde labelling in Tacr1CreERT2 and Gpr83CreERT2 mice to reinvestigate the expression of the receptors by ALS neurons and to reassess their projection patterns. We find that ~90% of ALS neurons in SDH express Tacr1, with 40-50% expressing Gpr83. We also show that axons of both Tacr1- and Gpr83-expressing ALS neurons reach the VPL. These results suggest that ALS neurons in the SDH that express these GPCRs show considerable overlap, and that they are likely to contribute to the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain through their projections to VPL.

">Concentration of myelin debris-like myelin basic protein-immunoreactive particles in the distal (anterior)-most part of the myelinated region in the normal rat optic nerve</a></h4>

              
                In the myelinated region of the normal rat optic nerve, neuronal fibers are encircled by myelin sheaths except at nodes of Ranvier. In addition to these myelinated fibers, concentration of small particles was observed in the distal (anterior)-most part of the myelinated region. These particles were visualized by fluorescent immunohistochemistry using mouse monoclonal anti-human myelin basic protein (MBPh) antibody (clone SMI-99). Fluorescent double immunohistochemistry by using both the rat monoclonal anti-cow myelin basic protein (MBPc) antibody (clone 12) and the anti-MBPh antibody demonstrated that myelin basic protein immunoreactive-particles detected by the anti-MBPc antibody were almost completely overlapped with those immunostained by the anti-MBPh antibody. Since these antibodies have different target sites, these particles contained the real myelin basic protein. We hypothesized that the MBPh-immunoreactive particles were myelin debris-like structures in the normal rat optic nerve. Quantitative morphological analyses indicated that only 2 out of 6 differences in sizes and shape descriptors between the particles and myelin debris observed in the damaged-optic nerve were statistically significant. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactivity and glutamine synthetase-immunoreactivity were seen in the particles. Majority of the particles were isolated from ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1-labeled microglia. These results demonstrate that the myelin debris-like MBPh-immunoreactive particles are concentrated on the distal-most part of the myelinated region. This evidence suggests that the distal-most part is under mildly pathological condition. Furthermore, the evidence may provide clues as to the pathophysiological background that induces localized vulnerability of the myelin sheaths.

">Uncoupling overeating and fat storage by modulation of different serotonergic receptors</a></h4>

              
                Psychotropic drugs such as antipsychotics improve symptoms of psychiatric disorders. However, they are associated with severe metabolic side effects that remodel energy balance, resulting in weight gain and increased food intake (hyperphagia). Here, we compare how antipsychotics and exogenous serotonin induce hyperphagia by remodeling energy balance. We find that the ability of serotonin and antipsychotics to remodel energy balance strictly depends on the serotonergic receptors SER-7 and SER-5, respectively. While both molecules induce hyperphagia, serotonin does so by increasing energy expenditure and reducing fat stores. In contrast, antipsychotics block the inhibitory effect of fat storage on feeding, thereby inducing hyperphagia and increasing fat stores. Thus, it is possible to manipulate energy balance to induce hyperphagia while either increasing or decreasing fat storage. Inactivation of the germline remodels energy balance similar to antipsychotic treatment, promoting hyperphagia while increasing fat storage. Consistent with overlapping mechanisms, antipsychotics are no longer able to remodel energy balance in both C. elegans and mice lacking an intact germline. Thus, our results uncouple overeating from fat storage and show that overeating can be induced by mechanisms that reduce or increase fat stores.

">Non-invasive in vivo bidirectional magnetogenetic modulation of pain circuits.</a></h4>

              
                Primary nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) receive sensory information from discrete parts of the body and are responsible for initiating signaling events that in supraspinal regions will be interpreted as physiological or pathological pain. Genetic, pharmacologic and electric neuromodulation of nociceptor activity in freely moving non-transgenic animals has been shown to be challenging due to many factors including the immunogenicity of non-mammalian proteins, procedure invasiveness and poor temporal precision. Here, we introduce a magnetogenetic strategy that enables remote bidirectional regulation of nociceptor activity. Magnetogenetics utilizes a source of direct magnetic field (DMF) to control neuronal activity in cells that express an anti-ferritin nanobody-TRPV1 receptor fusion protein (Nb-Ft-TRPV1). In our study, RetroAAV2-mediated delivery of an excitatory Nb-Ft-TRPV1 construct into the sciatic nerve of wild-type mice resulted in stable long-term transgene expression accompanied by significant reduction of mechanical withdrawal thresholds during DMF exposure, place aversion of the DMF zone and activity changes in the anterior cingulate (ACC) nucleus. Conversely, delivery of an inhibitory variant of the Nb-Ft-TRPV1 construct, engineered to gate chloride ions in response to DMF, led to reversed behavioral manifestations of mechanical allodynia and showed place preference for the DMF zone, suggestive of functional pain relief. Changes in DRG activity were confirmed by post-mortem levels, immediately following DMF exposure, of the activity-induced gene cfos, which increased with the excitatory construct in normal mice and decreased with the inhibitory construct in pain models Our study demonstrates that magnetogenetic channels can achieve long-term expression in the periphery without losing functionality, providing a stable gene therapy system for non-invasive, magnetic field regulation of pain-related neurons for research and potential clinical applications.

">Flexibility and Neural Correlates of Action-Sound Predictions</a></h4>

              
                Abstract To interact efficiently with our environment, our brain predicts the sensory effects of our actions and compares them with the actual outcomes. This allows us to adapt our actions when predictions and sensory outcomes mismatch. While this process is generally well understood for action-sound predictions, it is an open question how flexibly these predictions can adapt in frequently changing environments, as they occur in real life. To investigate the flexibility of top-down predictions, we asked participants (N = 41) to press one of two buttons, a left-hand and a right-hand button, and switch hands autonomously. One button frequently produced a sound (80%) and rarely no sound. The other button frequently generated no sound (80%) and rarely produced a sound. In a third, separate condition, each button produced a sound in 50% of the trials. Unexpected sounds and unexpected sound omissions elicited a series of error-related brain responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG) at different levels of auditory processing, including a mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P3 complex for unexpected sounds, and the oN1, oN2, and oP3 complex for unexpected omissions. Moreover, unexpected sounds elicited an equivalent MMN-regardless of whether silence was expected (80%) or no reliable expectation was possible (50%), while later P3 components showed different amplitudes. Our results demonstrate flexible action-sound predictions at sensory and higher cortical levels. Furthermore, they indicate that predicted silence does not have an explicit sensory representation at lower levels but emerges at later stages, when higher-level information has been integrated.

">Cross-Frequency Coupling as a Neural Substrate for Prediction Error Evaluation: A Laminar Neural Mass Modeling Approach</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding frameworks suggest that neural computations rely on hierarchical error minimization, where sensory signals are evaluated against internal model predictions. However, the neural implementation of this inference process remains unclear. We propose that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) furnishes a fundamental mechanism for this form of inference. We first demonstrate that our previously described laminar neural mass model (LaNMM) supports two key forms of CFC: (i) Signal-Envelope Coupling (SEC), where low-frequency rhythms modulate the amplitude envelope of higher-frequency oscillations, and (ii) Envelope-Envelope Coupling (EEC), where the envelopes of slower oscillations modulate the envelopes of higher-frequency rhythms. Then, we propose that - by encoding information in signals and their envelopes - these processes instantiate a hierarchical ``Comparator'' mechanism at the columnar level. Specifically, SEC generates fast prediction-error signals by subtracting top-down predictions from bottom-up oscillatory envelopes, while EEC operates at slower timescales to instantiate gating - a critical computational mechanism for precision-weighting and selective information routing. To establish the face validity - and clinical implications of - this proposal, we model perturbations of these CFC mechanisms to investigate their roles in pathophysiological and altered neuronal function. We illustrate how, in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, disruptions in gamma oscillations following dysfunction in fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons impact Comparator function with an aberrant amplification of prediction errors in the early stages and a drastic attenuation in late phases of the disease. In contrast, by increasing excitatory gain, serotonergic psychedelics diminish the modulatory effect of predictions, resulting in a failure to attenuate prediction error signals (c.f., a failure of sensory attenuation). Together, these results establish cross-frequency coupling - across temporal scales - as candidate computational processes underlying hierarchical predictive coding in health and disease.

">The Role of Syllabic Rhythm in Speech Perception Across Languages</a></h4>

              
                The insertion of silences at regular intervals restores the intelligibility of English utterances that have been accelerated beyond comprehension, as long as the duration of the resulting speech-silence chunks falls within the theta rhythm of natural speech, i.e. the temporal modulation associated to the syllabic rate. We test whether such a rhythmic strategy works in languages rhythmically different from English, an stress-timed language. Thus, we assess whether comprehension of time-compressed Semantically Unpredictable Sentences (SUS) is restored in the syllable-timed language French and the mora-timed language Japanese, when silences re-establishing theta rhythm are inserted. Restoring the theta rhythm also improved intelligibility in French, but not in Japanese, in which best performance was instead achieved at faster rhythms, which suggests that modulation at the rate of a language's basic rhythmic unit plays a key role in understanding speech. In a second experiment, French speakers listened to SUS with speech-silence chunks adapted to the range of the temporal modulations of the delta, gamma, and high gamma rhythms, which correspond to the rate of prosodic phrases, phonemes, and subsegmental features, respectively. Unlike the theta rhythm, we found no restorative effects, providing further evidence for the special status of the theta rhythm in speech comprehension.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals with high sensory processing sensitivity often experience sensory overload and have difficulty sustaining attention, which can particularly resemble attention deficit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, due to the lack of understanding about the potential neural pathways involved in those processes, a comprehensive view of how sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit are related is generally limited. Here, we quantified the sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit using the Highly Sensitive Person Scale and the Adult Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale, respectively, to investigate the association between sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit and further identify the corresponding neural substrates via the use of resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analyses. On the behavioral level, the results indicated a significantly positive correlation between sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit traits, while on the neural level, the sensory processing sensitivity score was positively correlated with functional connectivity between the rostral hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule, which is the core regions of the attention network. Mediation analysis revealed that hippocampus–Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL) connectivity can further influence attention deficit through a mediating role of sensory processing sensitivity. Overall, these findings suggest that enhanced functional coupling between the hippocampus and attention network regions may heighten sensitivity to environmental stimuli, leading to increased distractibility and potentially contributing to attention deficit.</span>

However, its trajectory during healthy aging remains incompletely understood. This study employed an ultra-high-field 5.0 T MRI to acquire high-resolution anatomical and multishell diffusion imaging data from 376 healthy adults aged 18 to 85. The aim was to correlate fornix characteristics with cognitive performance across multiple domains and map its lifespan trajectories. Using these data, we quantified fornix volume and tractography. Lifespan trajectories were identified by computing age-specific average patterns, which revealed distinct changes. Notably, nonlinear declines in fornix volume were observed, contrasting with fiber tract peaks between ages 18 to 40, which subsequently influenced volume-connectivity interactions. Additionally, a shift from predominant left-side to right-side fornix dominance was noted with aging. Regression analyses indicated that variations in fornix structure significantly moderated, rather than mediated, age-related differences in cognitive performance. These high-resolution imaging results provide novel insights into the role of the fornix’s morphology and structural connectivity in individual cognitive differences and aging.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous studies have found inhibitory control differences between obese individuals and those of normal weight. However, some normal-weight individuals with high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale show restrictive eating behaviors and attentional bias toward high-calorie food, potentially influencing these differences. We collected behavioral and electroencephalography data using a novel inhibitory control task. Results showed that individuals with high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale exhibited significantly greater restraint eating behavior compared to controls. Both theta and beta power differed between groups, with higher theta power in the high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale group than in the obese group and more negative beta power in the high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale group compared to both other groups. Theta power was greater in no-go than go conditions, while beta power was more negative in response to high-calorie versus low-calorie food stimuli. Importantly, theta power successfully decoded go/no-go conditions across all groups using multivariate pattern analysis, while beta power distinguished these conditions only in the negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale and control groups. These findings suggest that theta and beta power, along with multivariate pattern analysis, can reliably distinguish inhibitory control ability among the three groups, highlighting the importance of considering negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale when assessing inhibitory control differences between normal-weight and obese individuals.</span>

                Abstract Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

                Background Although modern phacoemulsification is considered a highly safe surgery, cystoid macular edema (CME) is the common factor contributing to poor visual results following successful surgery. Bromfenac drops may be effective in treating both acute and chronic pseudophakic CME. Objectives Evaluate the effects of the non–steroidal anti-inflammatory drug bromfenac 0.09% ophthalmic solution on macular thickness after phacoemulsification surgery and report any side effects. Method This is a prospective study done in an ophthalmic center in Iraq involving adult patients with senile or iatrogenic cataracts prepared for cataract surgery by phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and were divided into two groups: • Group one: who received 0.09% bromfenac ophthalmic solution twice daily in addition to Moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic drops every 6hrs and Dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% ophthalmic drops every 4-6hrs post-operatively. • Group two: who received only Moxifloxacin 0.5% every 6 hours and Dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% ophthalmic drop every 4-6 hours without administering bromfenac 0.09% ophthalmic drops post-operatively. Results Eighty-seven eyes of 87 patients were enrolled in the study. The preoperative mean of central retinal thickness in groups one and two was 248.53±35.6μm and 262.40±20.7μm, respectively, with a p-value of 0.029. The postoperative mean of central retinal thickness in groups one and two was 255.78±36.6 μm and 278.18±29.06 μm, respectively, with a p-value of 0.004, which is clinically significant. The only side effect reported was punctate epithelial corneal erosion in five patients in group one. Conclusion This study demonstrated that bromfenac has shown significant efficacy in preventing cystoid macular edema (CME) following cataract surgery as compared to corticosteroids alone but might cause punctate epithelium corneal erosion in some patients. Clinical trial Trial number: NCT06785090 registration date: 2025-01-15 registration URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06785090?cond=Cataract&rank=8 The registration was completed after the study commenced due to administrative and institutional requirements. As this trial was conducted as part of a master’s thesis, priority was given to obtaining ethical approval and ensuring compliance with institutional protocols, which led to an unintentional delay in registration. Once the importance of early registration for transparency and compliance was recognized, the process was promptly completed.

                Background/Purpose There are approximately 18.94 million visually impaired children worldwide, with 90% of them living in low-middle income countries. Research shows that visual impairment (VI) has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of those affected. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how VI affects the daily activities of these children to develop management strategies that can help minimize its impact on their QoL. Therefore, qualitative research design was utilized to explore the perceived impact of VI on the daily activities of children living with VI. Methods Using a qualitative approach, purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants to partake in focus group discussions (FGDs) and address the aim of the study adequately. Identified data sources were divided into two groups: one with ‘experts’ who worked with children regularly, and another with school-age children aged 6-17 years, from three rural schools in Sekhukhune district, South Africa. The FGDs were guided by semi-structured interview questions. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, cleaned, coded, and analysed under ten domains, identified from the literature. Results A total of 477 statements and comments related to children’s vision were generated through the nine FGDs. Participants were nine experts working with children, and 49 children living with or without VI. Of the total number of statements, 60% (n = 287) were generated from FGDs with children, 63% (n = 299) were negative statements, and the remaining 19% (n = 92), and 18% (n = 86) were neutral and positive statements respectively. The most generated statements fell under the domains ‘Hobbies, Leisure and Sport’ 21% (n = 101), ‘Education’ 21% (n = 100), and ‘Psychological and Emotional’ 12.8% (n = 61). Conclusion This study offered comprehensive insights into the impact of VI on the daily activities of rural school-aged children and young people.

                Background The management of diabetes mellitus (DM) extends beyond clinical care, with self-care being equally important to achieve optimal treatment outcomes and prevent complications. Self-care in diabetes includes appropriate diet, regular exercise, blood glucose monitoring, medication adherence and foot care. The purpose of the study was to assess the obstacles faced by diabetes patients for self-care practices and to determine the factors associated with these obstacles. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 107 type 2 DM patients aged >18 years using the Diabetes Obstacles Questionnaire-30. Patients scoring a mean score >3 were considered to have an obstacle. We included age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), duration of DM and blood glucose levels as factors for regression analysis and a p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results A large majority (64.5%, n = 69) of our participants were aged above 55 years and belonged to lower socioeconomic status (65.4%, n = 70). Family history of DM was present in 41% (n=44) of the participants. The median duration of DM among the participants was 10 (4 – 7) years. In our study, the participants faced obstacles for two items in the domains: Support from friends & family (mean score: 3.73) and knowledge of the disease (mean score: 3.58). A multinominal regression analysis revealed SES was a predictive factor for participants who could not understand information from literature with a p-value of 0.002 (OR: 3.65, CI: 1.60-8.338). Conclusion The two major obstacles to diabetes self-management practices were in the domains of support from friends and family, and knowledge of the disease. Socioeconomic status was identified as a predictive factor associated with the participants who could not understand information from the literature.

                The Raman effect originates from spontaneous inelastic scattering of photons by matter. These photons provide a characteristic fingerprint of this matter, and are extensively utilized for chemical and biological sensing. The inherently lower generation of these Raman scattered photons, do not hold potential for their direct use in sensing applications. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) overcomes the low sensitivity associated with Raman spectroscopy and assists the sensing of diverse analytes, including ions, small molecules, inorganics, organics, radionucleotides, and cells. Plasmonic nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and when they are closely spaced, they create hotspots where the electromagnetic field is significantly enhanced. This amplifies the Raman signal and may offer up to a 1014-fold SERS signal enhancement. The development of SERS active substrates requires further consideration and optimization of several critical features such as surface periodicity, hotspot density, mitigation of sample or surface autofluorescence, tuning of surface hydrophilicities, use of specific (bio) recognition elements with suitable linkers and bioconjugation chemistries, and use of appropriate optics to obtain relevant sensing outcomes in terms of sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, limit of detection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stability, shelf-life, and disposability. This article comprehensively reviews the recent advancements on the use of disposable materials such as commercial grades of paper, textiles, glasses, polymers, and some specific substrates such as blue-ray digital versatile discs (DVDs) for use as SERS-active substrates for point-of-use (POU) sensing applications. The advancements in these technologies have been reviewed and critiqued for analyte detection in resource-limited settings, highlighting the prospects of applications ranging from single-molecule to single-cell detection. We conclude by highlighting the prospects and possible avenues for developing viable field deployable sensors holding immense potential in environmental monitoring, food safety and biomedical diagnostics.

Insect vector microbiomes are essential for insect function, making them promising targets for controlling vector-borne diseases. Microbial isolate collections aid in identifying microbial targets, but expanding these collections must rely on coordinated efforts that are ethical and ensure equitable benefit sharing.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003052">The end of the genetic paradigm of cancer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sui Huang, Ana M. Soto, Carlos Sonnenschein</p>

Genome sequencing of cancer and normal tissues, alongside single-cell transcriptomics, continues to produce findings that challenge the idea that cancer is a ‘genetic disease’, as posited by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). In this prevailing paradigm, tumorigenesis is caused by cancer-driving somatic mutations and clonal expansion. However, results from tumor sequencing, motivated by the genetic paradigm itself, create apparent ‘paradoxes’ that are not conducive to a pure SMT. But beyond genetic causation, the new results lend credence to old ideas from organismal biology. To resolve inconsistencies between the genetic paradigm of cancer and biological reality, we must complement deep sequencing with deep thinking: embrace formal theory and historicity of biological entities, and (re)consider non-genetic plasticity of cells and tissues. In this Essay, we discuss the concepts of cell state dynamics and tissue fields that emerge from the collective action of genes and of cells in their morphogenetic context, respectively, and how they help explain inconsistencies in the data in the context of SMT.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003051">Past conservation efforts reveal which actions lead to positive outcomes for species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ashley T. Simkins, William J. Sutherland, Lynn V. Dicks, Craig Hilton-Taylor, Molly K. Grace, Stuart H. M. Butchart, Rebecca A. Senior, Silviu O. Petrovan</p>

Understanding the consequences of past conservation efforts is essential to inform the means of maintaining and restoring species. Data from the IUCN Red List for 67,217 animal species were reviewed and analyzed to determine (i) which conservation actions have been implemented for different species, (ii) which types of species have improved in status and (iii) which actions are likely to have driven the improvements. At least 51.8% (34,847) of assessed species have actions reported, mostly comprising protected areas (82.7%). Proportionately more actions were reported for tetrapods and warm-water reef-building corals, and fewer for fish, dragonflies and damselflies and crustaceans. Species at greater risk of extinction have a wider range of species-targeted actions reported compared with less threatened species, reflecting differences in documentation and conservation efforts. Six times more species have deteriorated than improved in status, as reflected in their IUCN Red List category. Almost all species that improved have conservation actions in place, and typically were previously at high risk of extinction, have smaller ranges and were less likely to be documented as threatened by hunting and habitat loss or degradation. Improvements in status were driven by a wide range of actions, especially reintroductions; for amphibians and birds, area management was also important. While conservation interventions have reduced the extinction risk of some of the most threatened species, in very few cases has full recovery been achieved. Scaling up the extent and intensity of conservation interventions, particularly landscape-scale actions that benefit broadly distributed species, is urgently needed to assist the recovery of biodiversity.

                Background Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, demonstrates high aggressiveness, and has a relatively poor prognosis and clinical outcome. Objective To identify a novel drug target protein against TNBC and potential phytochemical lead molecules against the identified target. Methods In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Additionally, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area salvation was used to identify potential lead molecule. Result The upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were identified. Androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub target in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer target were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Thereby, the AR was found to be the target protein and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule for combating TNBC. Moreover, the AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex showed structural stability and higher binding affinity through molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA studies. Conclusion AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC requires further investigation both in vitro and in vivo.
