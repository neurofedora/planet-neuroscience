                <p>Despite its central role in the proper functioning of the motor system, sensation has been less studied than motor outputs in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This is likely due to the difficulty of measuring sensation non-invasively: while motor outputs have easily observable consequences, sensation is inherently an internal variable of the motor system. In this study, we investigated how well participants can sense relevant sensory stimuli that induce locomotor adaptation. We addressed this question with a split-belt treadmill, which moves the legs at different speeds. We used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm with multiple repetitions of various speed differences considering the probabilistic nature of perceptual responses. We found that the participants correctly identified a speed difference of 49.7 mm/s in 75% of the trials when walking at 1.05 m/s (i.e., 4.7% Weber Fraction). To gain insight into the perceptual process in walking, we applied a drift-diffusion model (DDM) relating the participants&rsquo; identification of speed difference (i.e., stimulus identification) and their response time during walking. The implemented DDM was able to predict participants&rsquo; stimulus identification for all speed differences by simply using the recorded reaction times (RTs) to fit a single set of model parameters. Taken together, our results indicate that individuals can accurately identify smaller speed differences than previously reported and that participants&rsquo; stimulus perception follows the evidence accumulation process outlined by drift diffusion models, conventionally used for short-latency, static sensory tasks, rather than long-latency, and motor tasks such as walking.</p>

                <p>by Neda Shahidi, Fernando Rozenblit, Mohammad H. Khani, Helene M. Schreyer, Matthias Mietsch, Dario A. Protti, Tim Gollisch</p>

The dichotomy of excitation and suppression is one of the canonical mechanisms explaining the complexity of neural activity. Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron’s spiking responses and shapes the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models for predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depends on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and perform best for different temporal regimes of these interactions.

                <p>by Di Wu, Qi Ouyang, Hongli Wang, Youdong Mao</p>

Despite high-resolution structural studies on the USP14-proteasome-substrate complexes, time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results on USP14-regulated allostery of the 26S proteasome are still very limited and a quantitative understanding of substrate degradation dynamics remains elusive. In this study, we propose a mean field model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for USP14 regulated substrate degradation in 26S proteasome. The kinetic model incorporates recent cryo-EM findings on the allostery of 26S proteasome and generates results in good agreement with time-resolved experimental observations. The model elucidates that USP14 typically reduces the substrate degradation rate and reveals the functional dependence of this rate on the concentrations of substrate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the substrate for different ATP concentrations is predicted. When multiple substrates are present, the model suggests that substrates that are easier to insert into the OB-ring and disengage from the proteasome, or less likely to undergo deubiquitination would be more favored to be degraded by the USP14-bound proteasome. The mean field model proposed here quantitatively considers the process of proteasomal substrate degradation from the perspective of chemical kinetics, and provides a quantitative framework to decode the dynamic interplay between USP14 and the proteasome.

                <p>by Romani Osbourne, Kelly M. Thayer</p>

The link between p53 tumor suppressive functions and organismal lifespan is multifaceted. Its DNA-repair mechanism is longevity-enhancing while its role in cellular senescence pathways induces pro-aging phenotypes. To understand how p53 may regulate organismal lifespan, cross-species genotype-phenotype (GP) studies of the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) have been used to assess the correlation of amino acid changes to lifespan. Amino acid changes in non-DNA-binding regions such as the transactivation (TAD), proline-rich (PRD), regulatory (REG), and tetramerization (TET) are largely unexplored. In addition, existing GP correlation tools such as SigniSite do not account for phylogenetic relationships between aligned sequences in correlating genotypic differences to phenotypes such as lifespan. To identify phylogenetically significant, longevity-correlated residues in full-length p53 alignments, we developed a Python- and R-based workflow, Relative Evolutionary Scoring (RES). While RES-predicted longevity-associated residues (RPLARs) are concentrated primarily in the DBD, the PRD, TET, and REG domains also house RPLARs. While yeast functional assay enrichment reveals that RPLARs may be dispensable for p53-mediated transactivation, PEPPI and Rosetta-based protein-protein interaction prediction suggests a role for RPLARs in p53 stability and interaction interfaces of tumor suppressive protein-protein complexes. With experimental validation of the RPLARs’ roles in p53 stability, transactivity, and involvement in senescence-regulatory pathways, we can gain crucial insights into mechanisms underlying dysregulated tumor suppression and accelerated aging.

The growing interest in the role of the gut virome in human health and disease, has led to several recent large-scale viral catalogue projects mining human gut metagenomes each using varied computational tools and quality control criteria. Importantly, there has been to date no consistent comparison of these catalogues’ quality, diversity, and overlap. In this project, we therefore systematically surveyed nine previously published human gut viral catalogues. While these catalogues collectively screened >40,000 human fecal metagenomes, 82% of the recovered 345,613 viral sequences were unique to one catalogue, highlighting limited redundancy between the ressources and suggesting the need for an aggregated resource bringing these viral sequences together. We further expanded these viral catalogues by mining 7,867 infant gut metagenomes from 12 large-scale infant studies collected in 9 different countries. From these datasets, we constructed the Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue (AVrC), a unified modular resource containing 1,018,941 dereplicated viral sequences (449,859 species-level vOTUs). Using computational inference tools, annotations were obtained for each vOTU representative sequence quality, viral taxonomy, predicted viral lifestyle, and putative host. This project aims to facilitate the reuse of previously published viral catalogues by the research community and follows a modular framework to enable future expansions as novel data becomes available.

Sensory thresholds enable animals to regulate their behavioral responses to environmental threats. Despite the importance of sensory thresholds for animal behavior and human health, we do not yet have a full appreciation of the underlying molecular-genetic and circuit mechanisms. The larval zebrafish acoustic startle response provides a powerful system to identify molecular mechanisms underlying establishment of sensory thresholds and plasticity of thresholds through mechanisms like habituation. Using this system, we identify Cadherin-16 as a previously undescribed regulator of sensory gating. We demonstrate that Cadherin-16 regulates sensory thresholds via an endocrine organ, the corpuscle of Stannius (CS), which is essential in zebrafish for regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. We further show that Cadherin-16 regulates whole-body calcium and ultimately behavior through the hormone Stanniocalcin 1l (Stc1l), and the IGF-regulatory metalloprotease, Papp-aa. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the CS through ablation experiments that reveal its role in promoting normal acoustic sensory gating. Together, our results uncover a previously undescribed brain non-autonomous pathway for the regulation of behavior and underscore Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as a critical process underlying sensory gating <i>in vivo.</i>

Agricultural diseases are a major threat to sustainable food production. Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus <i>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</i> (Bgt). We sampled Bgt across two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions. We identified a single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, <i>AvrPm17</i>, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple <i>AvrPm17</i> haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade <i>Pm17</i> resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>T</i>ubulin <i>P</i>olymerization <i>P</i>romoting <i>P</i>roteins (TPPPs) are highly conserved across species but remain poorly understood. There are three <i>TPPP</i> genes in humans, with only one homologous <i>TPPP</i> gene in invertebrates, such as <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. The human TPPP (TPPP1/p25/p25α) is enriched in the brain and shares sequence similarities with the invertebrate TPPPs. TPPP/p25 associates with microtubules and plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics, bundling, and polymerization, thereby stabilizing the microtubular network. This is essential for cytoskeletal organization and proper functioning of neurons and glial cells, including axonal growth, regeneration, migration, trafficking, synapse formation, and myelination of axons. However, studies have also uncovered that besides its cytoplasmic/microtubular localization, TPPP/p25 is present in other subcellular compartments, including the mitochondria and nucleus, underscoring the presence of additional novel functions. At the molecular level, TPPP/p25 is predicted to exist as an intrinsically disordered protein and is implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and related disorders and Multiple Sclerosis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of TPPP/p25, highlighting its evolutionary conservation, cellular and subcellular localization, established and emerging functions in the nervous system, interacting partners, potential clinical relevance to human neurological disorders, and conclude with unresolved questions and future areas of study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1089/v3?src=rss">Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly, several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy, notably, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as vorinostat and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as zebularine. However, a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity, i.e., the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable, thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance, treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene, leading to unintended adverse effect. Methods Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample, we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning. Results We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at eight doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1µM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available, our model distinguished the post-treatment up versus downregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore, a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model. Conclusions Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting.

                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysms represent 23-40% of cerebral aneurysms and 12-15% of unruptured aneurysms, with a higher risk of rupture compared to other cerebral aneurysms. This case report presents a 56-year-old female admitted to a private hospital with acute headache and nausea, subsequently diagnosed with an ACOM aneurysm. The patient had no significant medical history, belonged to an intergenerational family, and maintained good mental health. Physical examination revealed a woman of thin frame (152 cm, 51 kg) with normal vital signs. Laboratory findings indicated low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dl), elevated sodium (19.1 mcg/dl), high creatinine (5.4 mcg), and elevated calcium (11.5 mcg/dl). Treatment included ondansetron, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium citrate, and alpha-blockers. The case highlights the importance of prompt intervention for ACOM aneurysms regardless of size, along with the necessity of comprehensive postoperative monitoring to detect complications such as bleeding and neurological impairments. Postoperative imaging is crucial to assess clipping effectiveness and monitor for potential complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1378/v2?src=rss">Decoding Investor Sentiments in the Indian Stock Market: A Structural Equation Modelling Approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This research examines how psychological and social biases affect individual investors’ investing decisions. Investor sentiment significantly influences financial markets, frequently causing stock prices to deviate from their intrinsic values. In rising economies such as India, where retail investors are significantly affected by psychological factors, comprehending these attitudes is crucial. Methods This study analyses data from a comprehensive questionnaire that was conducted throughout the nation and included 552 retail investors. The investigation employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the elements that influence the decision-making of individuals who invest in the Indian stock market. Findings The research offers insight on the influence that investor attitude has on investment decision-making as well as the factors that precede it. The study demonstrates that investors make financial decisions based on sentiment. In addition to assessing the efficacy of the Indian financial market, this study sought to ascertain the rationality of investors’ choices by exploring the factors that influence their decision-making process. Conclusion The outcome of the study shows that information seeking, anchoring, herding, representativeness, and overconfidence all have a big impact on investors. Moreover, the study has proven investors’ irrationality and stock market inefficiency. The findings may be employed to further examine the trading practices of international investors and encourage further study in the field of behavioural finance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-473/v1?src=rss">Overcoming Data Barriers: Digital Inclusion and Equitable Public Services for People with Disabilities in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ensuring equitable access to public services for people with disabilities remains a persistent challenge in digital governance. Despite advancements in data governance frameworks, disparities in accessibility continue to exclude marginalized populations. While government-led digital initiatives f ocus on efficiency and compliance, their impact on vulnerable groups remains underexplored. This study examines the causal factors influencing audit data governance in Thailand’s public sector, with a particular focus on the contrasting perspectives between government officials, who are responsible for delivering public services, and people with disabilities, who rely on these services. Methods This research employs Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling (MG-SEM) to analyze survey responses from 711 participants, including policymakers, policy implementers, auditors, and people with disabilities (specifically individuals with visual and physical impairments). The study utilizes a quantitative approach, ensuring that all analyses are based on structured survey data. Key constructs examined include public service delivery for people with disabilities (measured by perception of public service, enablers for access to data, citizen-oriented policy, and fair & efficient administrative procedures), data-driven culture, which ultimately influence audit data governance. Results The findings reveal significant disparities in how data governance is perceived. Government officials emphasize efficiency, compliance, and regulatory adherence, whereas people with disabilities prioritize accessibility, usability, and inclusivity in digital public services. These contrasting perspectives highlight systemic barriers that hinder the equitable implementation of digital governance frameworks, exacerbating the digital divide in public service accessibility. Conclusions To address these challenges, the study proposes targeted policy interventions, including the integration of AI-driven auditing mechanisms, the establishment of universal digital accessibility standards, and the implementation of participatory governance strategies. These recommendations provide valuable insights for policymakers, auditors, and public administrators aiming to foster transparency, trust, and inclusivity in digital public services.

                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.70041?af=R">A Novel H2S Donor Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Seizures by Inhibiting the C3‐C3aR Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Both astrocytes and microglia are activated in the epileptic brain. There is an interaction between them through the complement 3 (C3)-C3a receptor (C3aR) pathway, which plays a detrimental role in seizures. Our self-developed novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor has been found to have anti-seizure effects. However, its mechanism remains to be explored. In the present study, we showed that the novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor can inhibit the activation of astrocytes and microglia and their interaction through C3-C3aR signaling, which contributed to alleviating microglial neuroinflammation and seizures. In LPS-treated astrocytes and pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor reduced C3 production in astrocytes and regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-10 in microglia. The H<sub>2</sub>S donor also reduced the EEG amplitude of hippocampal epileptic waves and relieved seizures in epileptic mice. These effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor can be reversed by intranasal C3 treatment and mimicked by a C3aR antagonist. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the anti-seizure effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor. Therefore, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor has the potential to be used as a candidate for antiepileptic drugs.</p>

                The appropriate and rapid encoding of stimuli bearing a negative valence enables behaviors that are essential for survival. Recent advances in neuroscience using rodents as a model system highlight the relevance of cell type-specific neuronal activities in diverse brain networks for the encoding of aversion, as well as their importance for subsequent behavioral strategies. Within these networks, neuromodulators influence cell excitability, adjust fast synaptic neurotransmission, and affect plasticity, ultimately modulating behaviors. In this review we first discuss contemporary findings leveraging the use of cutting-edge neurotechnologies to define aversion-related neural circuits. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the release of neuromodulators and neuropeptides upon exposure to aversive stimuli are described within defined brain circuits. Together, these mechanistic insights update the present neural framework through which aversion drives motivated behaviors.

                Eubanks et al. found that gene expression networks that are specific for brain regions that develop high degrees of alpha-synuclein pathology carry an increased frequency of rare risk variants in patients with Parkinson’s disease. This dysregulates alpha-synuclein homeostasis, in particular its liquid-liquid phase separation and association with lipids in inclusions.

                Feeding is a fundamental requirement for the survival of host and gut microbiota. Here, Pan et al. discovered how gut microbiota influences feeding behavior through KYNA. During fasting, increased KYNA levels stimulate food intake by inhibiting vagal afferent nerves and activating AgRP neurons, demonstrating a mechanism of microbiota-mediated appetite regulation.

                Aguilar-Gómez et al. find evidence of evolutionary adaptation with potential relevance to breath-hold diving in the Haenyeo divers of Korea. Genetic variants under selection in this population may help mitigate the physiological strain of repeated diving during pregnancy. Additionally, long-term training appears to enhance the diving response through pronounced bradycardia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101420">Aberration correction in long GRIN lens-based microendoscopes for extended field-of-view two-photon imaging in deep brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon (2P) fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of 2P microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length &lt;4.1 mm (Antonini et al., 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length &gt;6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 µm). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high-precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-fixed mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100918">Temporal dynamics analysis reveals that concurrent working memory load eliminates the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping</a></h4>

              
                Concurrent verbal working memory task can eliminate the color-word Stroop effect. Previous research, based on specific and limited resources, suggested that the disappearance of the conflict effect was due to the memory information preempting the resources for distractors. However, it remains unclear which particular stage of Stroop conflict processing is influenced by working memory loads. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with event-related potential (ERP) analyses, time-frequency analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPAs), and representational similarity analyses (RSAs) were applied to provide an in-depth investigation of the aforementioned issue. Subjects were required to complete the single task (the classical manual color-word Stroop task) and the dual task (the Sternberg working memory task combined with the Stroop task), respectively. Behaviorally, the results indicated that the Stroop effect was eliminated in the dual-task condition. The EEG results showed that the concurrent working memory task did not modulate the P1, N450, and alpha bands. However, it modulated the sustained potential (SP), late theta (740–820 ms), and beta (920–1040 ms) power, showing no difference between congruent and incongruent trials in the dual-task condition but significant difference in the single-task condition. Importantly, the RSA results revealed that the neural activation pattern of the late theta was similar to the response interaction pattern. Together, these findings implied that the concurrent working memory task eliminated the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98033">Semantical and geometrical protein encoding toward enhanced bioactivity and thermostability</a></h4>

              
                Protein engineering is a pivotal aspect of synthetic biology, involving the modification of amino acids within existing protein sequences to achieve novel or enhanced functionalities and physical properties. Accurate prediction of protein variant effects requires a thorough understanding of protein sequence, structure, and function. Deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in guiding protein modification for improved functionality. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on protein sequences, which face challenges in efficiently encoding the geometric aspects of amino acids’ local environment and often fall short in capturing crucial details related to protein folding stability, internal molecular interactions, and bio-functions. Furthermore, there lacks a fundamental evaluation for developed methods in predicting protein thermostability, although it is a key physical property that is frequently investigated in practice. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel pre-training framework that integrates sequential and geometric encoders for protein primary and tertiary structures. This framework guides mutation directions toward desired traits by simulating natural selection on wild-type proteins and evaluates variant effects based on their fitness to perform specific functions. We assess the proposed approach using three benchmarks comprising over 300 deep mutational scanning assays. The prediction results showcase exceptional performance across extensive experiments compared to other zero-shot learning methods, all while maintaining a minimal cost in terms of trainable parameters. This study not only proposes an effective framework for more accurate and comprehensive predictions to facilitate efficient protein engineering, but also enhances the in silico assessment system for future deep learning models to better align with empirical requirements. The PyTorch implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/ai4protein/ProtSSN">https://github.com/ai4protein/ProtSSN</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100870">The neuropeptide sulfakinin is a peripheral regulator of insect behavioral switch between mating and foraging</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral strategies for foraging and reproduction in the oriental fruit fly (<i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>) are alternative options for resource allocation and are controlled by neuropeptides. Here, we show that the behavioral switch between foraging and reproduction is associated with changes in antennal sensitivity. Starved flies became more sensitive to food odors while suppressing their response to opposite-sex pheromones. The gene encoding sulfakinin receptor 1 (<i>SkR1</i>) was significantly upregulated in the antennae of starved flies, so we tested the behavioral phenotypes of null mutants for the genes encoding the receptor (<i>skr1</i><sup>–/–</sup>) and its ligand sulfakinin (<i>sk</i><sup>–/–</sup>). In both knockout lines, the antennal responses shifted to mating mode even when flies were starved. This suggests that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1 promotes foraging while suppressing mating. Further analysis of the mutant flies revealed that sets of odorant receptor (OR) genes were differentially expressed. Functional characterization of the differentially expressed ORs suggested that sulfakinin directly suppresses the expression of ORs that respond to opposite-sex hormones while enhancing the expression of ORs that detect food volatiles. We conclude that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1, modulating OR expressions and leading to altered antenna sensitivities, is an important component in starvation-dependent behavioral change.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103413">Disruption of the novel nested gene Aff3ir mediates disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Disturbed shear stress-induced endothelial atherogenic responses are pivotal in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, contributing to the uneven distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. This study investigates the role of <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i>, a novel nested gene variant, in disturbed flow-induced endothelial cell activation and atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that disturbed shear stress significantly reduces <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> expression in athero-prone regions. Using three distinct mouse models with manipulated <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> expression, we demonstrate that <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. RNA sequencing revealed that interferon regulatory factor 5 (<i>Irf5</i>), a key regulator of inflammatory processes, mediates inflammatory responses associated with <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> deficiency. <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> interacts with <i>Irf5</i>, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the <i>Irf5</i>-dependent inflammatory pathways. Notably, <i>Irf5</i> knockdown in <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> deficient mice almost completely rescues the aggravated atherosclerotic phenotype. Moreover, endothelial-specific <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> supplementation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly ameliorated endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. These findings elucidate a novel role for <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> in mitigating endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis by acting as an inhibitor of <i>Irf5</i>, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90309">Interdependence of plasma membrane nanoscale dynamics of a kinase and its cognate substrate underlies Arabidopsis response to viral infection</a></h4>

              
                Plant viruses represent a risk to agricultural production and as only a few treatments exist, it is urgent to identify resistance mechanisms and factors. In plant immunity, plasma membrane (PM)-localized proteins play an essential role in sensing the extracellular threat presented by bacteria, fungi, or herbivores. Viruses are intracellular pathogens and as such the role of the plant PM in detection and resistance against viruses is often overlooked. We investigated the role of the partially PM-bound Calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3) in viral infection and we discovered that it displayed a specific ability to hamper viral propagation over CPK isoforms that are involved in immune response to extracellular pathogens. More and more evidence supports that the lateral organization of PM proteins and lipids underlies signal transduction in plants. We showed here that CPK3 diffusion in the PM is reduced upon activation as well as upon viral infection and that such immobilization depended on its substrate, Remorin (REM1.2), a scaffold protein. Furthermore, we discovered that the viral infection induced a CPK3-dependent increase of REM1.2 PM diffusion. Such interdependence was also observable regarding viral propagation. This study unveils a complex relationship between a kinase and its substrate that contrasts with the commonly described co-stabilisation upon activation while it proposes a PM-based mechanism involved in decreased sensitivity to viral infection in plants.

">Complex three-dimensional rearing environments amplify compensatory plasticity following early blindness</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex has a remarkable capacity to alter its functional organization and connectivity in response to sensory loss, particularly if this loss occurs early in life. A key question is whether this cross-modal reorganization is driven by sensory deprivation itself or through enhanced use of the spared senses. We investigated how different rearing environments shape neural responses in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica), following elimination of visual inputs through bilateral enucleation in early development. Early blind and sighted littermates were reared in enriched environments to promote active tactile exploration in three-dimensional (3D) space, or in highly restricted standard laboratory cages. In adulthood, both enriched groups showed adaptive changes in exploration patterns and gap crossing behaviors relative to standard-reared counterparts. Thus, early blind animals showed behavioral compensation for vision loss, when challenged by complex environments. Enriched rearing increased selectivity of S1 neural responses to whisker touch and powerfully altered receptive field shapes such that they were less horizontally anisotropic. This shift was strongest in enriched early blind animals, enhancing tuning along the horizontal axis more than standard-reared early blind animals. Thus, alterations in S1 receptive fields following early blindness were amplified by environmental complexity. Sighted opossums reared with enrichment also showed similar whisker receptive field plasticity, though to a slightly lower degree. Together, these results demonstrate the strong influence of the rearing environment on reorganization of cortex that processes inputs from the spared senses, underscoring the role of experience in directing compensatory plasticity following early sensory loss.

">When Meaning Matters Most: Rethinking Cloze Probability in N400 Research</a></h4>

              
                The N400 component of ERPs is modulated by how predictable a word is, but predictability is usually quantified with lexical cloze---the probability that readers supply that exact word in offline sentence completion tasks. This form-based metric is at odds with decades of evidence that the N400 is primarily sensitive to meaning. Here, we asked whether a measure of semantic feature predictability can better account for N400 amplitude modulation. We reanalysed two independent EEG datasets (N = 26 and N = 334), computing lexical and semantic cloze for each critical word. Across the two datasets, semantic cloze explained significantly more N400 variance than lexical cloze. Using the same materials, we then compared semantic and lexical cloze with probabilities from four large language models (GPT-2, GPT-2.7b, RoBERTa, ALBERT). None of the LLM-derived predictors outperformed semantic cloze. Our findings support the view that the N400 primarily reflects semantic---not exact-word---processing. Methodologically, we argue that replacing lexical cloze with semantic cloze can substantially increase the explanatory power of N400 studies, and caution against substituting human norms with raw LLM probabilities.

">Sperrfy the brain: A data-driven realization of Sperry's Chemoaffinity theory in the neural connectome</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how brain-wide neural circuits are genetically wired remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. While Sperry's chemoaffinity theory posits that molecular gradients provide positional cues for axonal projections, its application has been largely limited to localized sensory systems. Here, we present SPERRFY (Spatial Positional Encoding for Reconstructing Rules of axonal Fiber connectivitY), a data-driven framework that operationalizes Sperry's theory at the whole-brain scale. By integrating connectomic data with spatial transcriptomic profiles from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, SPERRFY deciphers latent positional gradients that underlie axonal wiring. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we extract top gradient pairs that align with observed neural connectivity patterns, capturing both global (inter-regional) and local (intra-regional) organizational principles. Connectivity reconstruction based on these gradients achieves high predictive performance (AUC = 0.90), and permutation-based null models confirm the biological relevance of the inferred structures. Furthermore, SPERRFY identifies candidate genes that may contribute to positional wiring information, providing molecular insight into the developmental logic of brain-wide circuitry. Our results extend Sperry's foundational theory beyond the sensory domain, offering a unified, data-driven framework for understanding genetically encoded connectivity across the entire brain.

">High-Throughput Assessment of Vocal Modulation Following Chemogenetic Inhibition in Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Chemogenetic tools that enable temporary and repeatable manipulation of neuronal activity have become essential for studying the precise neural underpinning of animal behavior. However, their application has so far been limited to songbirds, which are widely used to study behaviors related to vocal communication. In this study, we applied and evaluated designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)-mediated neural suppression in songbird's brains, focusing on its impacts on vocalizations. We found that neuronal activity in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) can be effectively suppressed both in vitro and in vivo using the inhibitory DREADD by its ligand deschloroclozapine (DCZ). By establishing a high-throughput system for recording and analyzing their vocalizations, we systematically assessed the effects of DREADD-mediated suppression on song behavior. Inhibiting HVC in zebra finches led to a reduction in song production number for approximately 90 min and altered phonological features over a longer time course. Notably, the concentration of DCZ required to induce robust effects on song behaviors was higher than doses typically used in mice. Furthermore, suppression of HVC or Area X in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) produced a distinct effect on song features, suggesting species-specific responses to chemogenetic intervention. These findings refine the use of chemogenetic tools in songbirds and provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying vocal communication.

">Frontal Vulnerability vs. Temporal Resilience: Neuro-compensatory mechanisms underline differential language aging trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Age-related decline underlies cognitive functions such as sensorimotor control, executive functioning, memory, and language production (LP), whereas language comprehension (LC) tends to remain intact or improve across healthy adult lifespan. Preservation of LC can have structural and functional origins identifiable from key brain regions of the language network (LAN). To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the relationships among resting-state brain functional connectivity (rsFC) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, structural connectivity (SC) derived from diffusion MRI metrices, and behaviour (LC and LP) using a cross-sectional cohort of healthy adults (N = 652; aged 18-88). Six cognitive tasks assessing LC and LP were employed, with neuroimaging measures focused on region-specific connections within the LAN. Using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), complex brain-behaviour interactions were identified. Behavioral analyses revealed established age-related dichotomy, LC abilities in vocabulary and proverb comprehension improved and in syntactic and semantic comprehension remained stable, whereas LP tasks, e.g., verbal fluency, picture priming, and tip of tongue exhibited significant decline across the lifespan. SC exhibited decline in both intra- and inter-hemispheric fronto-temporal and frontal lobe connections, contrasted by preserved or enhanced temporal lobe connectivity, supporting a pattern of frontal vulnerability concomitant with temporal resilience. Age-related FC patterns demonstrated overall preservation, reflecting compensatory mechanisms to sustain functional integrity despite structural degradation. GAMM analyses revealed complex relationships between brain connectivity and language performance across age. Thus, integrating knowledge of brain structure, function, and language abilities, we identified the brain network mechanisms associated with dichotomous language behavior along lifespan.

">Non-visually-derived mental objects tax "visual" pointers</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, we can construct mental objects from various modalities: we can create a cat in the mind from visual experience, or from what someone says or signs linguistically. Do mental objects derived from different input sources share the same set of "slots" (or pointers, indexicals)? Employing a novel imagine-one-then-more paradigm in a large EEG sample (N = 52) across two recording sites, we found that increasing the number of imagined objects derived from a non-visual source -- auditory speech during eye closure -- led to greater suppression of left posterior alpha power. This observation closely mirrors effects previously observed for visually-derived representations. Our results support the existence of a domain-general pointer system that functions as a modality-independent object register in moment-to-moment cognition.

">Persistently increased expression of PKMzeta and unbiased gene expression profiles identify hippocampal molecular traces of a long-term active place avoidance memory and 'shadow' proteins</a></h4>

              
                Long-term memory formation transiently activates Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and atypical protein kinase C isoform iota/lambda (PKC/{lambda}), whereas persistent activation of the other atypical PKC, protein kinase M zeta (PKM{zeta}), together with its interacting partner, the scaffolding-protein KIBRA, is necessary for maintaining potentiated synapses and memory. Here, we use immediate early gene (IEG) Arc activation during active place avoidance memory expression to tag memory-activated neurons with EYFP, followed by PKM{zeta} immunohistochemistry to learn which hippocampal synaptic pathways are persistently altered. For at least 1 month, PKM{zeta} and EYFP-PKM{zeta} colocalization persistently increase in the hippocampal tri-synaptic pathway (dentate gyrus (DG)[-&gt;]CA3[-&gt;]CA1). We thus use DG, CA3, and CA1 transcriptional profiling to identify mRNAs for PKM{zeta} and other molecules that might contribute to maintaining the memory. We find that memory persistence correlates with the upregulation of IEGs Arc, Fos, and NPas4 in DG. In contrast, expression of CaMKII, PKM{zeta}, PKC/{lambda}, KIBRA, and most other LTP-associated proteins do not covary with memory. This result rules out strong memory-related transcriptional regulation, but not regulation of mRNA translation or stability of these 'shadow proteins' that, despite being crucial for memory maintenance, evade detection by unbiased transcriptome profiling. We further examine whether covarying gene expression defines molecular ensembles that predict memory and Prkcz expression. Community detection, applied to both linear and non-linear pairwise gene co-expression relationships, reveals gene co-expression networks predictive of memory, memory-related IEGs, and Prkcz expression. These findings trace: i) a PKM{zeta} engram in the hippocampus; and highlight: ii) sustained IEGs upregulation in >24-h memory maintenance; iii) the utility of investigating both linear and non-linear gene expression covariance patterns; iv) limits of transcriptional profiling for identifying long-term memory molecules, most of which appear to be in 'shadow' ; and demonstrates v) that weak pair-wise gene-gene correlations can identify strong gene co-expression networks related to behavioral and shadow molecular estimates of long-term memory.

                Methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) is enriched on active promoters and enhancers and correlates with gene activation. Disruption of H3K4 methylation is associated with numerous neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs) that display intellectual disability and abnormal body growth. Here, we perturb H3K4 methylation in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and the hypothalamus, two brain regions associated with these disease phenotypes. These mutant mice have fewer forebrain interneurons, deficient network rhythmogenesis, and increased spontaneous seizures and seizure susceptibility. Mutant mice are significantly smaller than control littermates, but they eventually became obese due to striking changes in the genetic and cellular hypothalamus environment in these mice. Perturbation of H3K4 methylation in these cells produces deficits in numerous NDD-associated behaviors, with a bias for more severe phenotypes in female mice. Single cell sequencing reveals transcriptional changes in the embryonic and adult brain that underlie many of these phenotypes. In sum, our findings highlight the critical role of H3K4 methylation in regulating survival and cell-specific gene regulatory mechanisms in forebrain GABAergic and hypothalamic cells during neurodevelopment to control network excitability and body size homoeostasis.

">Action intentions result in the task-specific integration of object features</a></h4>

              
                Theories of object-based attention suggest that attending to an object binds its features together. Yet, there is a growing body of work to suggest that the intention to grasp an object can alter the representation of features such that they are separately represented during different stages of motor planning and execution, whereas some object features such as shape and size might form integrated representations when afforded by motor control. However, it remains untested whether these features were integrated as an outcome of the requirements of grasping motor control, or due to attention towards the object in general. Therefore, here we investigated how task-relevancy modulates the integration of grasp-relevant object features. To this end, we recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in their orientation and size. Using multivariate analyses, we found a superadditive integration of object orientation and size during action planning for grasping but not reaching. These integrated representations likely facilitated the calculation of stable grasp points as further evidenced by the representations of grasp-specific visual size and grip size emerging at similar times. Our results provide novel insights into the vital role of action intention on cognitive representations in the human brain.

">Calpain cleaves the carboxyl terminus of TRPV1 and modulates receptor tachyphylaxis</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) plays a critical role in noxious heat sensation and pain hypersensitivity in chronic pain. Sustained or repeated exposure to capsaicin, a classic TRPV1 agonist, induces TRPV1 desensitization. This partially accounts for the analgesic effect of capsaicin. However, the regulatory mechanisms of TRPV1 desensitization remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that capsaicin acts on TRPV1 to induce the activation of calpain, a Ca2+-sensitive cysteine protease, in a manner unrelated to cellular injury. Calpain cleaves rTRPV1 at the carboxyl terminus of G819/S820. Lack of the distal carboxyl terminus leads to reduced TRPV1 localization on the plasma membrane, potentially due to increased receptor internalization and impaired subunit assembly. This finding was corroborated by whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Additionally, the {Delta}820-838 mutant of rTRPV1 shows resistance to tachyphylaxis as induced by repetitive capsaicin stimulation. This study reveals a pivotal role for calpain in TRPV1 desensitization where its activation constrains TRPV1 channel function while simultaneously increasing its resistance to tachyphylaxis, thereby acting to maintain TRPV1 activity within an appropriate range.

">MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY IMPAIRS EPISODIC MEMORY IN RATS</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. Symptoms following mTBI fall into physical, emotional, sleep, and cognitive categories, with memory deficits being a commonly documented sequelae. Whereas many animal models of mTBI exist, relatively few studies have examined the cognitive deficits of mTBI with human-like cognitive tasks. The Wayne State University Closed Head Weight Drop Model recapitulates critical physical elements of sport-related concussions and trauma-based mTBI. However, until now, this model has not previously been evaluated using a human-like memory task. Rats were trained in an odor-based item-in-context task that dissociates episodic and non-episodic memory (Panoz-Brown et al., Current Biology, 2016). The animals then underwent either a weight drop or a sham procedure. After the manipulation, animals were assessed in the item-in-context task. Episodic memory was significantly impaired in the injured rats by over 10% but not in the sham rats. Non-episodic memory was not impaired in either group. Additionally, a time-course immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus was performed to examine possible time-dependent changes in ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (iba1), a marker of activated microglia/macrophages and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes. Concussion injury was associated with time-dependent morphological changes in astrocytes and microglia in injured rats compared to sham rats. This study is the first to document episodic memory impairment in an animal model of mTBI.

">Instrumental Punishment Learning Enhances the Intrinsic Excitability of Basolateral Amygdala Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a structure that is critical for forming Pavlovian and instrumental emotional associations. Previous studies have established that Pavlovian fear conditioning increases the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons. Learning-associated increases in excitability are hypothesised to facilitate the induction of synaptic plasticity and integration of neurons into functional learning circuits. Here, we examined whether instrumental learning produces similar changes in intrinsic excitability. Male and Female Long Evans rats were trained to lever press for a food reward and subsequently split into 3 behavioural groups; punished, yoked, and reward. Punished rats received response-contingent footshocks, yoked rats received response-independent footshocks, and reward rats received no shock. Intrinsic excitability was measured as the number of action potentials (APs) evoked by a series of depolarising current injections during whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Reward learning increased the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons compared to naive controls. Punishment training maintained excitability and excitability was correlated with performance on the punishment task. Response-independent footshocks arrested reward-associated increases in excitability, reverting the BLA neurons to a naive state. Group differences were observed in AP half-width and the current underlying the post-burst AHP. Together, these findings show that instrumental reward learning enhances the intrinsic excitability of BLA projection neurons, potentially supporting action-outcome encoding by promoting synaptic plasticity and circuit integration. The results also suggest that different forms of learning engage distinct biophysical adaptations. A mechanistic understanding of the neurobiology underlying instrumental association learning may help inform the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in this process, such as major depressive disorder and conduct disorder.

">Theory of interaction between untuned modulatory inputs and tuned sensory inputs</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain integrate sensory inputs with non-feature-tuned signals, such as those arising from behavioral state changes or neuromodulation? Here, we show that the dynamics of disordered E/I networks with structured, feature-dependent connectivity can be well characterized by an effective model describing interactions between the responses of cells who prefer the current sensory stimulus ("matched" cells) and the responses of cells firing at the baseline. This effective network exhibits strong feedback from the baseline onto the matched responses but weak reverse projections. Thus, an untuned stimulus not only directly drives matched cells, but also indirectly drives them via modulation of the baseline. We demonstrate through a linear response analysis that the baseline effect on the matched response is suppressive if the network is strongly coupled and feedback-inhibition dominated. In particular, in this regime, feature-dependent networks produce "rate reshuffling", wherein untuned optogenetic excitation yields large changes in the individual responses of matched cells without significantly changing their overall firing rate distribution, as the optogenetically-induced baseline response suppresses the matched response. Finally, if multiple sensory stimuli are presented, yielding sublinear response summation ("normalization"), the influence of the baseline on the matched responses is weakened. Thus, an untuned (eg, optogenetic) stimulus is less suppressive to multiple stimuli than to a single stimulus, making normalization effectively weaker in the presence of an untuned stimulus. Our framework provides the first theory of the interaction of untuned modulatory and tuned sensory inputs, reconciles prior experiments, and provides testable predictions about tuned-untuned interactions in cortical processing.

">Brain Network Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment using High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography</a></h4>

              
                Dementia is associated with altered resting state connectivity, measures of which could aid in its early detection and monitoring. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is well-suited to detect these alterations at scale due to its numerous practical advantages, but it has not yet been applied to dementia. In this study, we investigated resting state functional connectivity across the prefrontal cortex in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 22), Alzheimer's Disease (AD, n = 21), and in healthy controls (n = 22). A graph theoretical approach was taken to characterise both global and local patterns of connectivity over a five-minute resting period. We found that individuals with AD and MCI exhibited denser and stronger networks, with shorter path lengths, as well as a loss of consistent key network hubs with worsening cognitive impairment. These results indicate that networks in dementia are more globally connected, albeit in a disorganised manner, perhaps reflecting the recruitment of additional connections for short-term stability which may be ultimately damaging in the long-term. Following the demonstration of HD-DOT's capacity to detect differences between healthy ageing and dementia, this work opens up new possibilities for the use of optical imaging in the study of this clinical population and HD-DOT's potential for scalable clinical use.

">Mitochondrial dysfunction in Machado Joseph disease: insights from a multi-model system</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3), also known as Machado Joseph disease, MJD) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease belonging to the polyglutamine repeat disease family, caused by inheritance of an abnormal form of the ATXN3 gene, carrying a longer than usual trinucleotide repeat sequence. Within this study we explored mitochondrial function in a range of diTerent experimental models of MJD, including transgenic zebrafish, mice and neuronal cells, to gain an understanding of mitochondrial function in the disease, and possible mechanisms of any dysfunction. Firstly, we examined the transgenic CMVMJD135 mouse model that develops impaired movement, neurodegeneration and decreased survival. We performed proteomic analysis on brain lysates extracted from a cohort of male and female WT and MJD mice, for analysis of diTerences in male and female mice separately. We identified that a major diTerence predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to be in both male and female MJD mice was related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We examined primary neuron cultures obtained from CMVMJD135 mice, validating the findings of the proteomic analysis, and finding changes to mitochondrial morphology, as well. We further examined a transgenic zebrafish model of MJD that expresses EGFP fused human ataxin-3 with short or long polyQ stretches (23 or 84Q, respectively) in neurons (expression driven under the elav/HuC promoter). The MJD zebrafish also exhibit altered mitochondrial electron transport chain complex protein levels, together with enhanced sensitivity to rotenone administration, which may be a valuable readout for treatment investigation studies in the future. Together, this study confirms, and extends on, the growing body of evidence suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in MJD, warranting investigation for therapeutic intervention.

">Molecular and Spatial Organization of the Primary Olfactory System and its Responses to Social Odors</a></h4>

              
                The detection of olfactory cues is essential to signal food, predators, and social encounters. To determine how the sensory detection of physiologically relevant odors is systematically mapped into the mouse primary olfactory system, we used Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) to construct a molecular atlas of odorant receptor (OR) expression in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and olfactory bulb (OB). We comprehensively quantified the expression of the mouse OR repertoire and uncovered stereotypical gradients of sensory neuron distribution in the MOE along two, central-to-peripheral and basal-to-apical, axes. Projections of sensory neurons mirror MOE gradients along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes of the OB, respectively. Integration with sequencing data revealed candidate signaling molecules underlying this spatial organization. Co-imaging OR and activity marker expression identified distinct spatial domains of sensory responses in the MOE and OB, providing a topographical basis for olfactory responses to ethologically relevant odors.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disease in the world. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction can occur decades before motor impairments and in up to 80% of individuals living with PD. We investigated peripheral relationships that may underlie mechanisms along the gut-blood axis that contribute to PD pathogenesis. Single-cell multiomic spatial molecular imaging (SMI) of colonic tissue localized inflammatory injury within epithelial cells that appear to be associated with iron mishandling in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and PD biosamples. We found that both the single-cell SMI of RNA and protein revealed parallel cross-modal dysregulation in the gut epithelium, in both IBD and PD biosamples. These data are accompanied by plasma (PD) and stool (IBD) protein depletion of CCL22. Our findings suggest iron mishandling along the gut barrier likely contributes to systemic inflammation, which may be the catalyst that primes circulating immune cells to body-first PD pathogenesis.

">Targeting Lysosomal Dysfunction to Alleviate Plaque Deposition in an Alzheimer Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by aberrant amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and lysosomal dysfunction. This study identifies two members of the lysosomal multi-enzyme complex (LMC), neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) and protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), as a critical regulators of APP metabolism. Neu1 deficiency in human AD brains and 5xFAD/Neu1-/- mice leads to sialic acid retention on APP and its secretases, enhancing amyloidogenic cleavage and A{beta}42 production. Additionally, Neu1 deficiency increases lysosomal exocytosis, contributing to extracellular A{beta} release and neuroinflammation. Conversely, overexpression of PPCA in neurons or co-expression of PPCA and NEU1 normalizes sialylation patterns, reduces secretase activity, and mitigates plaque burden. These findings reveal a novel bidirectional dependency between Neu1 and PPCA, underscoring their cooperative role in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis. Additionally, AAV-mediated co-expression of NEU1 and PPCA in 5XFAD brains demonstrates therapeutic potential by reducing amyloid pathology. These findings position lysosomal dysfunction and the Neu1-PPCA axis as promising targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.

">MRI-Derived Markers of Acute and Chronic Inflammatory Processes in the VTA Associated with Depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with inflammation increasingly recognized as a contributing factor. Inflammatory processes can disrupt the brain's reward circuitry, particularly the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is central to dopamine-mediated motivation and reward. This study investigates whether MRI-derived markers sensitive to neuroinflammation and microstructure in the VTA are associated with depression diagnosis and symptom severity. Methods: We analyzed diffusion weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping data from 32,495 UK Biobank participants, including 3,807 individuals with ICD-10 diagnosed depression. Metrics sensitive to neuroinflammation (free water [FW], isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF], magnetic susceptibility) and microstructure (intracellular volume fraction [ICVF], orientation dispersion index [ODI] volume) were extracted from the VTA. Group differences between the major depression group and BMI, sex, and age-matched healthy controls were assessed using ANOVAs and linear regression was used to predict acute symptom severity based on Recent Depressive Symptoms scores. Results: Participants with depression diagnosis had significantly higher FW ({rho} < 0.001) and ISOVF ({rho} = 0.001) compared to HCs, indicating increased extracellular processes such as inflammation in the VTA. Lower ISOVF ({beta} = -0.46, {rho} = 0.017) and higher ICVF ({beta} = 0.34, {rho} = 0.007) and ODI ({beta} = 0.49, {rho} = 0.004) were associated with higher depression severity, independent of depressive diagnosis history. Conclusions: Our findings reveal distinct patterns of VTA microstructural changes associated with depression history versus acute depressive symptom severity, suggesting different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Distinct patterns of neuroinflammation may differentiate acute from chronic depression, informing targeted interventions.

                KIF5A (Kinesin family member 5A) is a motor protein that functions as a key component of the axonal transport machinery. Variants in KIF5A are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, mainly spastic paraplegia type 10 (SPG10), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases share motor neuron involvement but vary significantly in clinical presentation, severity, and progression. KIF5A variants are mainly categorized into N-terminal variants associated with SPG10/CMT2 and C-terminal variants linked to ALS. This study utilized a novel multiplex NULISA targeted platform to analyze plasma proteome from KIF5A-linked SPG10, ALS patients and compared to healthy controls. Our results revealed distinct proteomic signatures, with significant alterations in proteins related to synaptic function, and inflammation. Notably, neurofilament light polypeptide, a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, was elevated in KIF5A ALS but not in SPG10 patients. Moreover, these findings can now be taken forward to gain mechanistic understanding of axonopathies linking to N- vs C-terminal KIF5A variants affecting both central and peripheral nervous systems.

">Self-Organizing Neural Networks in Organoids Reveal Principles of Forebrain Circuit Assembly</a></h4>

              
                The mouse cortex is a canonical model for studying how functional neural networks emerge, yet it remains unclear which topological features arise from intrinsic cellular organization versus external regional cues. Mouse forebrain organoids provide a powerful system to investigate these intrinsic mechanisms. We generated dorsal (DF) and ventral (VF) forebrain organoids from mouse pluripotent stem cells and tracked their development using longitudinal electrophysiology. DF organoids showed progressively stronger network-wide correlations, while VF organoids developed more refined activity patterns, enhanced small-world topology, and increased modular organization. These differences emerged without extrinsic inputs and may be driven by the increased generation of Pvalb+ interneurons in VF organoids. Our findings demonstrate how variations in cellular composition influence the self-organization of neural circuits, establishing mouse forebrain organoids as a tractable platform to study how neuronal populations shape cortical network architecture.

">Overexpression of Meis factors in late-stage retinal progenitors yields complex effects on temporal patterning and neurogenesis.</a></h4>

              
                The vertebrate retina serves as a model for studying neurogenesis and cell fate specification, with retinal progenitor cells following a tightly regulated temporal sequence to generate distinct cell types. Meis1 and Meis2 are transcription factors implicated in early retinal development, but their role in late-stage RPCs remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether Meis1 and Meis2 overexpression in postnatal mouse RPCs can alter temporal identity and induce early-born cell types. Using electroporation and single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that while these factors modestly upregulate early-stage gene regulatory network components, they do not repress late-stage transcription factors or induce early-born retinal cells. Meis1 overexpression reduces proliferation and inhibits neurogenesis, whereas Meis2 overexpression accelerates neurogenic progression without altering fate commitment. Our findings suggest that overexpression of Meis1 and Meis2 modulate largely non-overlapping aspects of temporal identity and neurogenic competence but are insufficient to fully reprogram late-stage progenitors. These results have implications for regenerative strategies aimed at reprogramming retinal cells for therapeutic purposes.

">Centroparietal signals track multiple rounds of evidence accumulation in an intermittent evidence task</a></h4>

              
                Making decisions often requires the integration of multiple pieces of information. An extensive body of research has investigated the neural mechanisms underpinning evidence accumulation in tasks where information is continuously present, but less is known about how this neural architecture supports evidence accumulation if the flow of information is paused for a variable amount of time. In two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments (N = 22, N = 21), participants made perceptual decisions about two pulses of motion evidence separated by gaps of varying duration. Our goal was to investigate 1) whether and how people integrate the two pulses across various delay durations, and 2) how a prominent EEG marker of evidence accumulation, the centroparietal positivity (CPP), reflects decisions in the context of our intermittent-pulses task. Our results are consistent with a bounded evidence accumulation process where the second pulse further informs the decision only if the bound is not reached by the first pulse. We show that whereas motor preparation signals reflected in motor beta lateralisation (MBL) maintain the cumulative evidence level reached from pulse 1 through the gap, the CPP does not sustain but rather exhibits transient deflections following each pulse, encoding momentary belief updates.

                Brain development during adolescence and early adulthood coincides with shifts in emotion regulation and sleep. Despite this, few existing datasets simultaneously characterize affective dynamics, sleep variation, and multimodal measures of brain development. Here, we describe the study protocol and initial release (n = 10) of an open data resource of neuroimaging paired with densely sampled behavioral measures nd in adolescents and young adults. All participants complete multi-echo functional MRI, compressed-sensing diffusion MRI, and advanced arterial spin-labeled MRI. Behavioral measures include ecological momentary assessment, actigraphy, extensive cognitive assessments, and detailed clinical phenotyping focused on emotion regulation. Raw and processed data are openly available without a data use agreement and will be regularly updated as accrual continues. Together, this resource will accelerate research on the links between mood, sleep, and brain development.

">Network Neuroscience of Human Multitasking: Local Features Matter</a></h4>

              
                The neural basis of multitasking costs is subject to continuing debate. Cognitive theories assume that overlap of task representations may lead to between-task crosstalk in concurrent task processing and thus requires cognitive control. Recent research suggests that modality-based crosstalk contributes to multitasking costs, involving central overlap of modality-specific representations. Consistently increased costs for specific modality pairings (visual-vocal and auditory-manual vs. visual-manual and auditory-vocal) were demonstrated (modality-compatibility effect), which were recently linked to representational overlap in the auditory cortex. However, it remains unclear whether modality-based crosstalk emerges from overlapping patterns of global brain connectivity and whether resolving it requires additional involvement of cognitive control as reflected in the fronto-parietal control network. This preregistered functional imaging study investigates these questions in 64 healthy, young human adults. Specifically, we focus on the modality-compatibility effect in multitasking by employing functional connectivity (FC) analysis. First, we tested the FC similarity between the single-task networks. Second, we compared the strength of the control network in whole-brain FC between dual tasks. We found no evidence for different FC similarities of single-task networks between modality pairings and no additional involvement of the control network during dual tasks. However, post-hoc connectivity analysis revealed a brain-behavior correlation for the modality-compatibility effect in dual tasks. This effect was locally restricted to FC between lateral frontal and sensory auditory regions, providing evidence for the modality-based crosstalk theory. More generally, the findings suggest that robust behavioral differences in multitasking are not necessarily related to global functional connectivity differences but to local connectivity changes.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The organization of the cingulate cortex has been the subject of intensive studies, concluding to its central role in motor control, cognition, and arousal. One of the key anatomical pathways through which the cingulate cortex influences behavior is its efferent connection to the locus coeruleus (LC). This brainstem region is responsible for noradrenaline (NA) release and is critical for various cognitive and behavioral functions. However, the specific impact of cingulate subregions on the LC-NA system remains unexplored. This study investigated how the different cingulate cortex areas affect LC-NA activity by measuring pupil-evoked responses (PERs) as an index of LC-NA activity. Using intra-cortical stimulation across the eight cingulate areas in rats, we found that anterior cingulate cortex and midcingulate cortex subregions evoked rare autonomic responses but significant pupil dilations whose amplitude increased along the caudo-rostral and dorso-ventral axes. By using the DSP-4, a neurotoxin-selective ablation of the LC-NA system, we suppressed PER and confirmed the role of LC-NA activity in this response. The differential influence of cortical areas on the PER demonstrates that each subregion of the rat cingulate cortex has the potential to differentially activate the LC-NA system, suggesting a clear parcellation of the rodent cingulate cortex, likely corresponding to functional specialization.</span>

Endomembrane breaching is a crucial strategy employed by intracellular pathogens enclosed within vacuoles to access the nutrient-rich cytosol for intracellular replication. While bacteria use various mechanisms to compromise host membranes, the specific processes and factors involved are often unknown. <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, a major human pathogen, accesses the cytosol relying on the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) and secreted effectors. Using in-cell correlative light and electron microscopy, we tracked the sequential steps of <i>Shigella</i> host cell entry. Moreover, we captured the T3SS, which projects a needle from the bacterial surface, in the process of puncturing holes in the vacuolar membrane. This initial puncture ensures disruption of the vacuole. Together this introduces the concept of mechanoporation via a bacterial secretion system as a crucial process for bacterial pathogen-induced membrane damage.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There are limited population-based data regarding the prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and associated risks of mortality and incident cerebrovascular events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective cohort study using inpatient and outpatient claims from 2008 to 2022 from a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries. CAA and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were identified using validated International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. We ascertained CAA from October 1, 2015 through 2022, and used data from 2008 through September 30, 2015 to ascertain comorbidities including prevalent stroke. We used Cox regression to examine the association of CAA with subsequent death and incident stroke subtypes after adjustment for demographics, vascular risk factors, and Charlson comorbidities.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,920,312 Medicare beneficiaries in our sample, 2,161 (11.3 per 10,000) had a diagnosis of CAA. In adjusted Cox regression analysis, there was an association between CAA and subsequent mortality (HR 4.9; 95% CI 4.6–5.2). Among 1,872,474 patients without prevalent stroke, including 900 of the CAA patients, there was a significant association between CAA and an increased risk of any stroke (HR 8.0; 95% CI 6.7–9.6), ischemic stroke (HR 4.6; 95% CI 3.6–6.0), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR 26.9; 95% CI 20.3–35.6), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR 21.6; 95% CI 12.2–38.1). After a diagnosis of CAA, absolute risks of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage were broadly similar.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a large, nationwide cohort of Medicare beneficiaries, the prevalence of clinically diagnosed CAA was approximately 11 per 10,000. CAA was associated with an increased risk of mortality and incident stroke, both hemorrhagic and ischemic. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 5 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 94.26%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least five days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study, conducted in 2019, aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. Participants were between 16 and 65 years old, provided informed consent, had no history of medically diagnosed liver disease, and submitted complete and accurate questionnaire responses. Confounding factors (physical activity, nutrition, smoking) were controlled through participant questionnaires and statistical adjustments. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

                Background Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care. Despite extensive preclinical research on sepsis pathophysiology, the development of effective therapies has been largely unsuccessful. Key obstacles include limited construct validity of animal models, insufficient methodological rigor and the lack of collaborative frameworks akin to clinical trials. These issues plague not only sepsis research, but preclinical research in general. The National Preclinical Sepsis Platform (NPSP), an interdisciplinary network under Sepsis Canada, addresses these challenges in sepsis research through multilaboratory, randomized, controlled preclinical studies. NPSP-01 will establish baseline conditions for future investigations using an acute fecal-induced peritonitis model of sepsis. Methods This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effect of standard sepsis therapy in a mouse model of sepsis across six centres. Interlaboratory variability and the interaction of biological sex on outcomes will also be examined. C57BL/6 mice of both sexes will be randomized into sham (healthy control) + treatment, sepsis, or sepsis + treatment groups. Sepsis will be induced via intraperitoneal injection of fecal slurry, while sham mice will receive vehicle control. Antibiotics and fluids will be administered to treatment groups at 4 hours post-induction, and mice with be euthanized at 8 hours post-induction. The primary outcome is plasma interleukin-6 levels. Secondary outcomes include biological (blood gas and chemistry, white blood cell count, bacterial load), clinical (body weight, core temperature, sepsis score, mortality as measured by surrogate humane endpoints), and feasibility measures. Conclusions NPSP-01 will be the first multilaboratory study of sepsis and represents a shift in preclinical critical illness research, mirroring the rigor of clinical multicenter trials. By addressing procedural standardization, interlaboratory variability, and sex-based differences, this study aims to enhance the reliability and translational relevance of preclinical findings. The outcomes of NPSP-01 will establish foundational data for future investigations and provide a roadmap for rigorous collaborative preclinical studies to accelerate the evaluation of novel sepsis therapies.

                Costa-Pereira et al. uncover a key role for regulatory T (Treg) cells in suppressing GM-CSF-producing T helper (TH) cells via IL-2 modulation, thereby preventing fatal immunopathology. Their study highlights how GM-CSF orchestrates phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction in the absence of Treg cells.

                Higaki et al. provided direct evidence that universal fibroblasts from the lung, the colon, and muscle differentiated into functional HSC niche cells, known as BM CAR cells. This is the first demonstration of the ability of universal fibroblasts to generate tissue-specific specialized fibroblasts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103247">The first complete 3D reconstruction and morphofunctional mapping of an insect eye</a></h4>

              
                The structure of compound eyes in arthropods has been the subject of many studies, revealing important biological principles. Until recently, these studies were constrained by the two-dimensional nature of available ultrastructural data. By taking advantage of the novel three-dimensional ultrastructural dataset obtained using volume electron microscopy, we present the first cellular-level reconstruction of the whole compound eye of an insect, the miniaturized parasitoid wasp <i>Megaphragma viggianii</i>. The compound eye of the female <i>M. viggianii</i> consists of 29 ommatidia and contains 478 cells. Despite the almost anucleate brain, all cells of the compound eye contain nuclei. As in larger insects, the dorsal rim area of the eye in <i>M. viggianii</i> contains ommatidia that are believed to be specialized in polarized light detection as reflected in their corneal and retinal morphology. We report the presence of three ‘ectopic’ photoreceptors. Our results offer new insights into the miniaturization of compound eyes and scaling of sensory organs in general.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100788">Seasonal and comparative evidence of adaptive gene expression in mammalian brain size plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Contrasting almost all other mammalian wintering strategies, Eurasian common shrews, <i>Sorex araneus</i>, endure winter by shrinking their brain, skull, and most organs, only to then regrow to breeding size the following spring. How such tiny mammals achieve this unique brain size plasticity while maintaining activity through the winter remains unknown. To discover potential adaptations underlying this trait, we analyzed seasonal differential gene expression in the shrew hypothalamus, a brain region that both regulates metabolic homeostasis and drastically changes size, and compared hypothalamus gene expression across species. We discovered seasonal variation in suites of genes involved in energy homeostasis and apoptosis, shrew-specific upregulation of genes involved in the development of the hypothalamic blood-brain barrier and calcium signaling, as well as overlapping seasonal and comparative gene expression divergence in genes implicated in the development and progression of human neurological and metabolic disorders, including <i>CCDC22</i>. With high metabolic rates and facing harsh winter conditions, <i>S. araneus</i> have evolved both adaptive and plastic mechanisms to sense and regulate their energy budget. Many of these changes mirrored those identified in human neurological and metabolic disease, highlighting the interactions between metabolic homeostasis, brain size plasticity, and longevity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101629">GPRC6A as a novel kokumi receptor responsible for enhanced taste preferences by ornithine</a></h4>

              
                The concept of ‘kokumi’, which refers to an enhanced and more delicious flavor of food, has recently generated considerable interest in food science. However, kokumi has not been well studied in gustatory physiology, and the underlying neuroscientific mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Our previous research demonstrated that ornithine (L-ornithine), which is abundant in shijimi clams, enhanced taste preferences in mice. The present study aimed to build on these findings and investigate the mechanisms responsible for kokumi in rats. In two-bottle preference tests, the addition of ornithine, at a low concentration that did not increase the favorability of this substance alone, enhanced the animals’ preferences for umami, sweet, fatty, salty, and bitter solutions, with the intake of monosodium glutamate showing the most significant increase. Additionally, a mixture of umami and ornithine synergistically induced significant responses in the chorda tympani nerve, which transmits taste information to the brain from the anterior part of the tongue. The observed preference enhancement and increase in taste-nerve response were abolished by antagonists of the G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A (GPRC6A). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that GPRC6A was expressed in a subset of type II taste cells in rat fungiform papillae. These results provide new insights into flavor-enhancement mechanisms, confirming that ornithine is a kokumi substance and GPRC6A is a novel kokumi receptor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100064">Neural geometry from mixed sensorimotor selectivity for predictive sensorimotor control</a></h4>

              
                Although recent studies suggest that activity in the motor cortex, in addition to generating motor outputs, receives substantial information regarding sensory inputs, it is still unclear how sensory context adjusts the motor commands. Here, we recorded population neural activity in the motor cortex via microelectrode arrays while monkeys performed flexible manual interceptions of moving targets. During this task, which requires predictive sensorimotor control, the activity of most neurons in the motor cortex encoding upcoming movements was influenced by ongoing target motion. Single-trial neural states at the movement onset formed staggered orbital geometries, suggesting that target motion modulates peri-movement activity in an orthogonal manner. This neural geometry was further evaluated with a representational model and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with task-specific input-output mapping. We propose that the sensorimotor dynamics can be derived from neuronal mixed sensorimotor selectivity and dynamic interaction between modulations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107067">ATP-release pannexin channels are gated by lysophospholipids</a></h4>

              
                In addition to its role as cellular energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) serves as an extracellular messenger that mediates diverse cell-to-cell communication. Compelling evidence supports that ATP is released from cells through pannexins, a family of membrane proteins that form heptameric large-pore channels. However, the activation mechanisms that trigger ATP release by pannexins remain poorly understood. Here, we discover lysophospholipids as endogenous pannexin activators, using activity-guided fractionation of mouse tissue extracts combined with untargeted metabolomics and electrophysiology. We show that lysophospholipids directly and reversibly activate pannexins in the absence of other proteins. Secretomics experiments reveal that lysophospholipid-activated pannexin 1 leads to the release of not only ATP but also other signaling metabolites, such as 5’-methylthioadenosine, which is important for immunomodulation. We also demonstrate that lysophospholipids activate endogenous pannexin 1 in human monocytes, leading to the release of IL-1β through inflammasome activation. Our results provide a connection between lipid metabolism and purinergic signaling, both of which play major roles in immune responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104121">Complex system modeling reveals oxalate homeostasis is driven by diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Decades of research have made clear that host-associated microbiomes touch all facets of health. However, effective therapies that target the microbiome have been elusive given its inherent complexity. Here, we experimentally examined diet-microbe-host interactions through a complex systems framework, centered on dietary oxalate. Using multiple, independent molecular, rodent, and in vitro experimental models, we found that microbiome composition influenced multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces. Importantly, the administration of the oxalate-degrading specialist, <i>Oxalobacter formigenes,</i> was only effective against a poor oxalate-degrading microbiota background and gives critical new insights into why clinical intervention trials with this species exhibit variable outcomes. Data suggest that, while heterogeneity in the microbiome impacts multiple diet-host-microbe interfaces, metabolic redundancy among diverse microorganisms in specific diet-microbe axes is a critical variable that may impact the efficacy of bacteriotherapies, which can help guide patient and probiotic selection criteria in probiotic clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97900">Perceptual and attentional impairments of conscious access involve distinct neural mechanisms despite equal task performance</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates failures in conscious access resulting from either weak sensory input (perceptual impairments) or unattended input (attentional impairments). Participants viewed a Kanizsa stimulus with or without an illusory triangle within a rapid serial visual presentation of distractor stimuli. We designed a novel Kanizsa stimulus that contained additional ancillary features of different complexity (local contrast and collinearity) that were independently manipulated. Perceptual performance on the Kanizsa stimulus (presence vs. absence of an illusion) was equated between the perceptual (masking) and attentional (attentional blink) manipulation to circumvent common confounds related to conditional differences in task performance. We trained and tested classifiers on electroencephalogram (EEG) data to reflect the processing of specific stimulus features, with increasing levels of complexity. We show that late stages of processing (~200–250 ms), reflecting the integration of complex stimulus features (collinearity, illusory triangle), were impaired by masking but spared by the attentional blink. In contrast, decoding of local contrast (the spatial arrangement of stimulus features) was observed early in time (~80 ms) and was left largely unaffected by either manipulation. These results replicate previous work showing that feedforward processing is largely preserved under both perceptual and attentional impairments. Crucially, however, under matched levels of performance, only attentional impairments left the processing of more complex visual features relatively intact, likely related to spared lateral and local feedback processes during inattention. These findings reveal distinct neural mechanisms associated with perceptual and attentional impairments and thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of distinct neural stages leading to conscious access.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98001">Physiological magnetic field strengths help magnetotactic bacteria navigate in simulated sediments</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial motility is typically studied in bulk solution, while their natural habitats often are complex environments. Here, we produced microfluidic channels that contained sediment-mimicking obstacles to study swimming of magnetotactic bacteria in a near-realistic environment. Magnetotactic bacteria are microorganisms that form chains of nanomagnets and that orient in Earth’s magnetic field. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. We characterized the swimming of the cells through these channels and found that swimming throughput was highest for physiological magnetic fields. This observation was confirmed by extensive computer simulations using an active Brownian particle model. The simulations indicate that swimming at strong fields is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in ‘corners’ that require transient swimming against the magnetic field for escape. At weak fields, the direction of swimming is almost random, making the process inefficient as well. We confirmed the trapping effect in our experiments and showed that lowering the field strength allows the bacteria to escape. We hypothesize that over the course of evolution, magnetotactic bacteria have thus evolved to produce magnetic properties that are adapted to the geomagnetic field in order to balance movement and orientation in such crowded environments.

">Daily light exposure habits of youth with migraine: A prospective pilot study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Eighty percent of youth with migraine report photophobia. It is unknown if photophobia leads to light avoidant behavior, and if such behaviors worsen light sensitivity and disrupt sleep. Recently developed wearable, continuous light loggers allow us to address these open questions. We conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of measuring light exposure using wearable light loggers in youth with migraine. Methods: Youth 10 to 21 years old with a headache-specialist confirmed ICHD-3 diagnosis of migraine were recruited from CHOP headache clinics. Each participant recorded 7 consecutive days of light logging data from the ActLumus device worn as a pendant around the neck paired with a text-based daily migraine symptom diary during a typical school week between November and March 2024. Validated questionnaires were used to capture headache and migraine frequency, headache-related disability, visual sensitivity, fear-of-pain, and sleep disturbance and impairment. Percent time spent within recommended light exposure levels was calculated for the day, 3 hours prior to bedtime, and night. Power analysis was calculated to determine sample size needed for group comparison of baseline characteristics across light intensity and light timing metrics to aid in the design of larger studies. Results: Twenty youth with a median age 17 years [IQR 16, 19], 70% of whom were female completed 7 days of continuous light logger recording and daily headache diary. Data completion rates were high with 136/140 (97.1%) useable days of light logger data, and 100% compliance on the daily headache diary. Participant feedback on the study was positive; 85% would recommend the study to others. On average, participants received recommended light exposure during only 14.5% +/- SD 7.0 of daylight hours. By contrast, participants were more consistently below the recommended maximum light levels 3 hours prior to bed (77.5% +/- 21.6 of the time), and at night (99.1% +/- 2.9 of the time). Youth with chronic migraine (i.e., at least 15 headache days and 8 migraine days per month) had daily light exposure patterns that were phase shifted 60 minutes later as compared to participants with non-chronic migraine. Power analyses suggest that future tests for differences in light exposure between migraine-characteristic groups (e.g., differing by headache frequency, severity, or disability) will require sample sizes on the order of 50 to 150 to reach 80% power with an alpha of 0.05. Conclusion: Measuring daily light exposure is feasible in pediatric populations with photophobia and reveals intriguing trends in youth with migraine that warrant further study.

">Mechanical Artifacts During Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Mimic Biologically Evoked Responses</a></h4>

              
                Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has emerged as a promising modality for non-invasive neuromodulation, offering deep brain penetration and high spatial precision. However, the electrophysiological effects of tFUS remain poorly understood, in part due to challenges distinguishing genuine neural responses from mechanical artifacts. In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological signatures captured during tFUS of the anesthetized rat hippocampus using silicon microelectrodes. We observed a strong, stereotyped local field potential (LFP) response that was time-locked to the onset and offset of sonication and resembled sensory-evoked potentials. Critically, the same waveform was observed in euthanized animals, confirming a non-biological, artifact-driven origin. The artifact scaled with acoustic intensity and was most pronounced under continuous-wave sonication. These findings suggest that electrode movement induced by ultrasound can generate artifactual LFP signals that closely mimic authentic neural responses. Our results underscore the need for caution when interpreting in situ electrophysiological recordings during tFUS and advocate for alternative, artifact-resistant readouts such as fiber photometry to unambiguously detect neuromodulatory effects.

">Plasma pTau-217 Correlates with Brain Atrophy, Cognition, and CSF Biomarkers in a Cognitively Healthy Community Cohort</a></h4>

              
                Plasma biomarkers are promising for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but their role in cognitively healthy individuals remains unclear. Plasma pTau-217 has high diagnostic accuracy for clinical and prodromal AD, yet its relevance in preclinical stages is underexplored. We examined if plasma biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation were associated with cognition, brain structure, and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) counterparts in dementia-free older adults. We studied community-based, dementia-free older adults from the Brain and Cognitive Health (BACH) cohort. Neuropsychological testing assessed global cognition (MMSE), memory (Logical Memory II), visual processing (Hooper Visual Organization Test), processing speed (Trail Making Test-A), and reasoning (Similarities). Paired plasma and CSF biomarkers (pTau-217, pTau-181, GFAP, NfL, A{beta}42/40) were measured using SIMOA. MRI-derived cortical thickness was used as a neurodegeneration marker. Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between log10-transformed plasma biomarker levels, cognition (adjusted for age, sex, education, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes), and cortical thickness (adjusted for age, sex, education, and intracranial volume). Pearson's correlations and Bland-Altman plots evaluated plasma-CSF agreement. There were 147 dementia-free participants (mean age{+/-}SD: 66.7{+/-}7.7 years; 56 % women). Higher plasma pTau-217 levels associated with lower global cognition scores ({beta} -0.80, 95% C.I. -1.56, -0.03, p=0.041) and abstract reasoning ({beta} -0.86, 95% confidence interval [C.I.] -1.62, -0.09, p=0.028). Greater plasma pTau-217 also associated with lower global cortical thickness ({beta}eta [{beta}] -0.21, 95% confidence interval [C.I]. -0.37, -0.06, per log unit change; p=0.006). No associations were found between the plasma biomarkers and processing speed or visual processing (p>0.05 for all). Among 47 participants with paired plasma-CSF biomarkers, plasma pTau-217 showed the strongest correlation with its CSF counterpart (R=0.76, p<0.0001), outperforming pTau-181 (R=0.61, p<0.0001), GFAP (R=0.66, p<0.0001), NfL (R=0.56, p<0.0001), and A{beta}42/40 (R=0.53, p=0.0001). In conclusion, plasma pTau-217 levels were associated with both cognition and cortical thickness in dementia-free older adults. All plasma biomarkers correlated significantly with their CSF counterpart. These findings reinforce the utility of plasma biomarkers, particularly pTau-217, as indicators of neurodegenerative processes, even in asymptomatic individuals.

                The China Brain Multi-omics Atlas Project (CBMAP) aims to generate a comprehensive molecular reference map of over 1,000 human brains (Phase I), spanning a broad age range and multiple regions in China, to address the underrepresentation of East Asian populations in brain research. By integrating genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome (including multiple post-translational modifications), and metabolome data, CBMAP is set to provide a rich and invaluable resource for investigating the molecular underpinnings of aging-related brain phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders. Leveraging high-throughput omics data and advanced technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-nucleus 3D chromatin structure analysis, this atlas will serve as a crucial resource for the brain science community, illuminating disease mechanisms and enhancing the utility of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). CBMAP is also poised to accelerate drug discovery and precision medicine for brain disorders.

">EEG Functional Connectivity as a Marker of Evolution from Infantile Epileptic Spasms Syndrome to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Timely diagnosis and effective treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) improve prognosis and lower healthcare costs, but the transition from infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) to LGS is highly variable and insidious. Objective biomarkers are needed to monitor this progression and guide clinical decision making. We retrospectively collected longitudinal EEG data at the Children's Hospital of Orange County from fifteen children who were diagnosed with IESS and later with LGS between 2012 and 2021. EEGs were from IESS and LGS diagnoses, between the two diagnoses, and following LGS diagnosis. Functional connectivity networks were calculated using a cross-correlation-based method and assessed relative to diagnostic timepoint, treatment response, presence of clinical markers of disease, age, and amplitude of interictal spikes. Connectivity strength was high at LGS diagnosis and decreased after favorable response to treatment, but it remained stable or increased when response was unfavorable. In all subjects, connectivity strength was higher at the time of LGS diagnosis than at the preceding timepoint. Presence of clinical markers of LGS were associated with high connectivity strength, but no single marker predicted connectivity strength. Computational EEG analysis can be used to map the evolution from IESS to LGS. Changes in connectivity may enable prediction of impending LGS and treatment response monitoring, thus facilitating earlier LGS treatment and guiding medical management.
