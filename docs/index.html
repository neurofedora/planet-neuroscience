	<p>Metabolic syndrome encompasses a spectrum of conditions that increases the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. It is widely accepted that the sex hormone estrogen plays a protective metabolic role in premenopausal women, in part through central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms. However, most work to date has focused on the loss of estrogen in females (e.g., menopause). Interestingly, transgender individuals receiving feminizing gender affirming therapy (i.e., estrogen) are relatively protected from metabolic syndrome conditions, pointing to a role for CNS estrogen in the development of metabolic syndrome in men. Here, we show that estrogen signaling in the brain protects males from metabolic syndrome and obesity related complications. First, short-term CNS specific supplementation of low-dose 17-&amp;amp;beta;-estradiol in diet-induced obese male mice resulted in a significant reduction in body weight in parallel with a decrease in food intake without alterations in energy expenditure. In conjunction, central supplementation of estrogen reduced visceral adiposity, including epididymal and abdominal regions, with slighter decreases in subcutaneous inguinal and thermogenic brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, central estrogen administration reduced the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome including hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings indicate that a lack of estrogen action in the brain may predispose males to metabolic syndrome pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Improved Manual Annotation of EEG Signals through Convolutional Neural Network Guidance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of validated algorithms for automated handling of artifacts is essential for reliable and fast processing of EEG signals. Recently, there have been methodological advances in designing machine-learning algorithms to improve artifact detection of trained professionals who usually meticulously inspect and manually annotate EEG signals. However, validation of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard as data are mostly private and data annotation is time consuming and error prone. In the effort to circumvent these issues, we propose an iterative learning model to speed up and reduce errors of manual annotation of EEG. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train on expert-annotated eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG data from typically developing children (<I>n</I> = 30) and children with neurodevelopmental disorders (<I>n</I> = 141). To overcome the circular reasoning of aiming to develop a new algorithm and benchmarking to a manually-annotated gold standard, we instead aim to improve the gold standard by revising the portion of the data that was incorrectly learned by the network. When blindly presented with the selected signals for re-assessment (23% of the data), the two independent expert-annotators changed the annotation in 25% of the cases. Subsequently, the network was trained on the expert-revised gold standard, which resulted in improved separation between artifacts and nonartifacts as well as an increase in balanced accuracy from 74% to 80% and precision from 59% to 76%. These results show that CNNs are promising to enhance manual annotation of EEG artifacts and can be improved further with better gold-standard data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Comprehensive Behavioral Analysis of Opsin 3 (Encephalopsin)-Deficient Mice Identifies Role in Modulation of Acoustic Startle Reflex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opsin-3 (<I>Opn3</I>, encephalopsin) was the first nonvisual opsin gene discovered in mammals. Since then, several <I>Opn3</I> functions have been described, and in two cases (adipose tissue, smooth muscle) light sensing activity is implicated. In addition to peripheral tissues, <I>Opn3</I> is robustly expressed within the central nervous system, for which it derives its name. Despite this expression, no studies have investigated developmental or adult CNS consequences of <I>Opn3</I> loss-of-function. Here, the behavioral consequences of mice deficient in <I>Opn3</I> were investigated. <I>Opn3</I>-deficient mice perform comparably to wild-type mice in measures of motor coordination, socialization, anxiety-like behavior, and various aspects of learning and memory. However, <I>Opn3</I>-deficient mice have an attenuated acoustic startle reflex (ASR) relative to littermates. This deficit is not because of changes in hearing sensitivity, although Opn3 was shown to be expressed in auditory and vestibular structures, including cochlear outer hair cells. Interestingly, the ASR was not acutely light-dependent and did not vary between daytime and nighttime trials, despite known functions of <I>Opn3</I> in photoreception and circadian gene amplitude. Together, these results demonstrate the first role of <I>Opn3</I> on behavior, although the role of this opsin in the CNS remains largely elusive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Contributes to Human Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>This study assesses the involvement in human motor learning, of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9/46v), a somatic region in the middle frontal gyrus. The potential involvement of this cortical area in motor learning is suggested by studies in nonhuman primates which have found anatomic connections between this area and sensorimotor regions in frontal and parietal cortex, and also with basal ganglia output zones. It is likewise suggested by electrophysiological studies which have shown that activity in this region is implicated in somatic sensory memory and is also influenced by reward. We directly tested the hypothesis that area 9/46v is involved in reinforcement-based motor learning in humans. Participants performed reaching movements to a hidden target and received positive feedback when successful. Before the learning task, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt activity in 9/46v in the left or right hemisphere. A control group received sham cTBS. The data showed that cTBS to left 9/46v almost entirely eliminated motor learning, whereas learning was not different from sham stimulation when cTBS was applied to the same zone in the right hemisphere. Additional analyses showed that the basic reward-history-dependent pattern of movements was preserved but more variable following left hemisphere stimulation, which suggests an overall deficit in somatic memory for target location or target directed movement rather than reward processing per se. The results indicate that area 9/46v is part of the human motor learning circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parentsâ perceptions on policies of early childhood care and education programmes in selected states of Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposed global equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all children. The quality of early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs helps shape childrenâs minds, attitudes and behaviors, and has short and long-term effects on a child, a family and a country. In Malaysia, the government has formulated some policies and laws to protect childrenâs rights. However, ECCE is facing some challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate parentsâ perceptions of the quality of ECCE programs implemented by Malaysian government. Methods: A mixed method was used to collect data on parentsâ perceptions of ECCE policies in selected states in Malaysia. The questionnaires, (P1/POL) from the research project âDevelopment of a Comprehensive and Integrated Model of Quality Malaysian ECCEâ, were distributed among 629 respondents who have a child in a preschool, and 22 participants were randomly selected to take part in five focus group interviews Results: The key findings of the study revealed 68% parents were not familiar with ECCE Malaysian government policy, however 84.3% stressed it is important for the government to educate them about ECCE. Thus findings indicated that the majority of parents lack awareness of the ECCE policies and quality of early childhood care and education programs related to the policies remain the issue. While interviewing the focus group ,most of them were not aware of ECCE and pointed out parents are stressing childrenâs academic learning in particular preschools. Conclusions: It is concluded that parentsâ awareness regarding the ECCE program must be part of the policies and needs to improve. It is recommended that the government of Malaysia should supply more information on ECCE policies to parents and focus on policy implementation. Moreover, the quality of ECCE programs should be improved based on the parentsâ perceptions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Machine learning-based heart attack prediction: A Â symptomatic heart attack prediction method and exploratory analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background; Heart attack prediction is one of the serious causes of morbidity in the worldâs population. The clinical data analysis includes a very crucial disease i.e., cardiovascular disease as one of the most important sections for the prediction. Data Science and machine learning (ML) can be very helpful in the prediction of heart attacks in which different risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, diabetes, etc... can be considered. The objective of this study is to optimize the prediction of heart disease using ML. Methods: In this paper, we are presenting a machine learning-based heart attack prediction (ML-HAP) method in which the analysis of different risk factors and prediction for heart attacks is done using ML approaches of Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes and XGBoost. The data of heart disease Â symptoms has been collected from the UCI ML Repository and analysis has been performed on the data using ML methods. The focus has been on optimizing the prediction on the basis of different parameters. Results: XGBoost provided the best prediction among the four. The Area under the curve achieved with XGBoost is .94 and Logistic Regression is .92. The prediction with ML models in identifying heart attack symptoms is highly efficient, especially with boosting algorithms. The prediction was done to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve. ML models are being trained to perform optimized predictions. Conclusions: This prediction can help clinically in analyzing the risk factors of the disease and interpretation of the patient scenario. Boosting the algorithm provided promising results to predict symptoms of heart disease. It can further be optimized by working further on risk factors associated with this condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indoor air quality at the Arab governmental girlsâ schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girlsâ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: Seventeen girlsâ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. In addition, a pre-designed questionnaire was used to evaluate the safety preparedness in the same selected schools. Results: Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. Levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmental constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion: The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease and viruses as negative factor prohibiting the growth of broiler chicken embryo as research topic trend: a bibliometric review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Broiler chickens have properties as meat-producing poultry and produce meat with soft fiber quality. Broilerâs embryo needs to be given attention, especially against disease. The purpose of the study was to observe the trend of the research topic and external factors which could affect the embryoâs growth of broiler. Methods This study used meta-data from Scopus. There were 162 samples started from 2006-to 2022. The data were analyzed using a bibliometric method with two software, Vosviewer, and Biblioshiy from R studio. Results It was found that the study of broiler chicken embryos had developed well, especially those related to genetics, disease, and also the immunity system. But the result showed that topics about the disease, viruses, and bacteria were more popular than topics about the gene. The result also showed that based on the importance and development of topics, the words such as âchickenâ, âgenesâ, âdevelopmentâ, âeffectâ, growthâ, and âcontrolâ had importance for the study and developed well in research. It means that genes influenced the growth of the embryo of a chicken. But still, even though a chicken gene was predetermined, the genetic engineering of chicken insemination to produce a superior breed with a fast-growing rate of the embryo could be used. Conclusions It could be stated that disease, especially research about the virus is one of the main determinants that could affect the growth of the embryo of broiler chicken.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dataset for the attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 preventive measures in diverse settings of Mozambique: a qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this data note, we provide the details of a qualitative study database conducted before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mozambique. During this period (from September 2020), several compulsory COVID-19 preventive measures were put forth as a response to the emerging pandemic in the country. Data were collected aiming to evaluate home confinement behaviours, household membersâ mobility, and the mobility routes and other attitudes and practices related to COVID-19 preventive measures at the community level. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, mixed method study was conducted involving adults from different regions in Mozambique. Data were collected using a combination of rapid ethnography and rapid rural assessment methods consisting of telephone-based semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, non-participant observations and short questionnaires. The COREQ guidelines for reporting qualitative studies were performed. Results: 295 semi-structured interviews (SSI) with adult household members were included in the study. Of these, 23 were conducted face-to-face and 272 by telephone, covering 24 districts and cities in 9 provinces. More than half (53.9%) of participants were females and aged 18 - 98 years old (median [interquartile range] = 35 [29-43]). Most had a relevant role in the household, with formal education and had to leave home for income generating. Conclusion: This data, available in our repository, favours several angles of assessments of behaviour related to home confinement, mobility and routes of a population group prior to the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for the perioperative outcome risk assessment with computer learning enhancement (Periop ORACLE) randomized study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery. Registration: ORACLE is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05042804; registered September 13, 2021.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Librarian: A quality control tool to analyse sequencing library compositions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Robust analysis of DNA sequencing data needs to include a set of quality control steps to ensure that technical bias is kept to a minimum. A metric easily obtained is the frequency of each of the nucleobases for each position across all sequencing reads. Here, we explore the differences in nucleobase compositions of various library types produced by standard experimental methodologies.Â  Methods: We obtained the compositions of nearly 3000 publicly available datasets and subjected them to Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction for a two-dimensional representation of their composition characteristics.Â Â  Results: We find that most library types result in a specific composition profile. We use this to give an estimate of how strongly the composition of a test library resembles the profiles of previously published libraries, and how likely the test sample is to be of a particular type. We introduce Librarian, a user-friendly web application and command line tool which enables checking base compositions of test libraries against known library types. Â  Conclusions: Library preparation methods strongly influence the per position nucleobase content. By comparing test libraries to a database of previously published library types we can make predictions regarding the library preparation method. Librarian is a user-friendly tool to access this information for quality assurance purposes as discrepancies can flag potential irregularities very early on.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling enculturated bias in entrainment to rhythmic patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Kaplan, Jonathan Cannon, Lorenzo Jamone, Marcus Pearce</p>

Long-term and culture-specific experience of music shapes rhythm perception, leading to enculturated expectations that make certain rhythms easier to track and more conducive to synchronized movement. However, the influence of enculturated bias on the moment-to-moment dynamics of rhythm tracking is not well understood. Recent modeling work has formulated entrainment to rhythms as a formal inference problem, where phase is continuously estimated based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing). Here we propose that the problem of optimally tracking a rhythm also requires an ongoing process of inferring which pattern of event timing expectations is most suitable to predict a stimulus rhythm. We formalize this insight as an extension of PIPPET called pPIPPET (PIPPET with pattern inference). The variational solution to this problem introduces terms representing the likelihood that a stimulus is based on a particular member of a set of event timing patterns, which we initialize according to culturally-learned prior expectations of a listener. We evaluate pPIPPET in three experiments. First, we demonstrate that pPIPPET can qualitatively reproduce enculturated bias observed in human tapping data for simple two-interval rhythms. Second, we simulate categorization of a continuous three-interval rhythm space by Western-trained musicians through derivation of a comprehensive set of priors for pPIPPET from metrical patterns in a sample of Western rhythms. Third, we simulate iterated reproduction of three-interval rhythms, and show that models configured with notated rhythms from different cultures exhibit both universal and enculturated biases as observed experimentally in listeners from those cultures. These results suggest the influence of enculturated timing expectations on human perceptual and motor entrainment can be understood as approximating optimal inference about the rhythmic stimulus, with respect to prototypical patterns in an empirical sample of rhythms that represent the music-cultural environment of the listener.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Generative and interpretable machine learning for aptamer design and analysis of in vitro sequence selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrea Di Gioacchino, Jonah Procyk, Marco Molari, John S. Schreck, Yu Zhou, Yan Liu, RÃ©mi Monasson, Simona Cocco, Petr Å ulc</p>

Selection protocols such as SELEX, where molecules are selected over multiple rounds for their ability to bind to a target of interest, are popular methods for obtaining binders for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), an unsupervised two-layer neural network architecture, can successfully be trained on sequence ensembles from single rounds of SELEX experiments for thrombin aptamers. RBMs assign scores to sequences that can be directly related to their fitnesses estimated through experimental enrichment ratios. Hence, RBMs trained from sequence data at a given round can be used to predict the effects of selection at later rounds. Moreover, the parameters of the trained RBMs are interpretable and identify functional features contributing most to sequence fitness. To exploit the generative capabilities of RBMs, we introduce two different training protocols: one taking into account sequence counts, capable of identifying the few best binders, and another based on unique sequences only, generating more diverse binders. We then use RBMs model to generate novel aptamers with putative disruptive mutations or good binding properties, and validate the generated sequences with gel shift assay experiments. Finally, we compare the RBMâs performance with different supervised learning approaches that include random forests and several deep neural network architectures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of the firing behaviour of a complete motoneuron pool by combining electromyography signal decomposition and realistic motoneuron modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arnault H. Caillet, Andrew T. M. Phillips, Dario Farina, Luca Modenese</p>

Our understanding of the firing behaviour of motoneuron (MN) pools during human voluntary muscle contractions is currently limited to electrophysiological findings from animal experiments extrapolated to humans, mathematical models of MN pools not validated for human data, and experimental results obtained from decomposition of electromyographical (EMG) signals. These approaches are limited in accuracy or provide information on only small partitions of the MN population. Here, we propose a method based on the combination of high-density EMG (HDEMG) data and realistic modelling for predicting the behaviour of entire pools of motoneurons in humans. The method builds on a physiologically realistic model of a MN pool which predicts, from the experimental spike trains of a smaller number of individual MNs identified from decomposed HDEMG signals, the unknown recruitment and firing activity of the remaining unidentified MNs in the complete MN pool. The MN pool model is described as a cohort of single-compartment leaky fire-and-integrate (LIF) models of MNs scaled by a physiologically realistic distribution of MN electrophysiological properties and driven by a spinal synaptic input, both derived from decomposed HDEMG data. The MN spike trains and effective neural drive to muscle, predicted with this method, have been successfully validated experimentally. A representative application of the method in MN-driven neuromuscular modelling is also presented. The proposed approach provides a validated tool for neuroscientists, experimentalists, and modelers to infer the firing activity of MNs that cannot be observed experimentally, investigate the neuromechanics of human MN pools, support future experimental investigations, and advance neuromuscular modelling for investigating the neural strategies controlling human voluntary contractions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interaction between games give rise to the evolution of moral norms of cooperation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Salahshour</p>

In many biological populations, such as human groups, individuals face a complex strategic setting, where they need to make strategic decisions over a diverse set of issues and their behavior in one strategic context can affect their decisions in another. This raises the question of how the interaction between different strategic contexts affects individualsâ strategic choices and social norms? To address this question, I introduce a framework where individuals play two games with different structures and decide upon their strategy in a second game based on their knowledge of their opponentâs strategy in the first game. I consider both multistage games, where the same opponents play the two games consecutively, and reputation-based model, where individuals play their two games with different opponents but receive information about their opponentâs strategy. By considering a case where the first game is a social dilemma, I show that when the second game is a coordination or anti-coordination game, the Nash equilibrium of the coupled game can be decomposed into two classes, a defective equilibrium which is composed of two simple equilibrium of the two games, and a cooperative equilibrium, in which coupling between the two games emerge and sustain cooperation in the social dilemma. For the existence of the cooperative equilibrium, the cost of cooperation should be smaller than a value determined by the structure of the second game. Investigation of the evolutionary dynamics shows that a cooperative fixed point exists when the second game belongs to coordination or anti-coordination class in a mixed population. However, the basin of attraction of the cooperative fixed point is much smaller for the coordination class, and this fixed point disappears in a structured population. When the second game belongs to the anti-coordination class, the system possesses a spontaneous symmetry-breaking phase transition above which the symmetry between cooperation and defection breaks. A set of cooperation supporting moral norms emerges according to which cooperation stands out as a valuable trait. Notably, the moral system also brings a more efficient allocation of resources in the second game. This observation suggests a moral system has two different roles: Promotion of cooperation, which is against individualsâ self-interest but beneficial for the population, and promotion of organization and order, which is at both the populationâs and the individualâs self-interest. Interestingly, the latter acts like a Trojan horse: Once established out of individualsâ self-interest, it brings the former with itself. Importantly, the fact that the evolution of moral norms depends only on the cost of cooperation and is independent of the benefit of cooperation implies that moral norms can be harmful and incur a pure collective cost, yet they are just as effective in promoting order and organization. Finally, the model predicts that recognition noise can have a surprisingly positive effect on the evolution of moral norms and facilitates cooperation in the Snow Drift game in structured populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Generalism drives abundance: A computational causal discovery approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chuliang Song, Benno I. Simmons, Marie-JosÃ©e Fortin, Andrew Gonzalez</p>

A ubiquitous pattern in ecological systems is that more abundant species tend to be more generalist; that is, they interact with more species or can occur in wider range of habitats. However, there is no consensus on whether generalism drives abundance (a selection process) or abundance drives generalism (a drift process). As it is difficult to conduct direct experiments to solve this chicken-and-egg dilemma, previous studies have used a causal discovery method based on formal logic and have found that abundance drives generalism. Here, we refine this method by correcting its bias regarding skewed distributions, and employ two other independent causal discovery methods based on nonparametric regression and on information theory, respectively. Contrary to previous work, all three independent methods strongly indicate that generalism drives abundance when applied to datasets on plant-hummingbird communities and reef fishes. Furthermore, we find that selection processes are more important than drift processes in structuring multispecies systems when the environment is variable. Our results showcase the power of the computational causal discovery approach to aid ecological research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep-promoting neurons remodel their response properties to calibrate sleep drive with environmental demands</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephane Dissel, Markus K. Klose, Bruno van Swinderen, Lijuan Cao, Melanie Ford, Erica M. Periandri, Joseph D. Jones, Zhaoyi Li, Paul J. Shaw</p>

Falling asleep at the wrong time can place an individual at risk of immediate physical harm. However, not sleeping degrades cognition and adaptive behavior. To understand how animals match sleep need with environmental demands, we used live-brain imaging to examine the physiological response properties of the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) following interventions that modify sleep (sleep deprivation, starvation, time-restricted feeding, memory consolidation) in <i>Drosophila</i>. We report that dFB neurons change their physiological response-properties to dopamine (DA) and allatostatin-A (AstA) in response to different types of waking. That is, dFB neurons are not simply passive components of a hard-wired circuit. Rather, the dFB neurons intrinsically regulate their response to the activity from upstream circuits. Finally, we show that the dFB appears to contain a memory trace of prior exposure to metabolic challenges induced by starvation or time-restricted feeding. Together, these data highlight that the sleep homeostat is plastic and suggests an underlying mechanism.

                Background: Construction development in Indonesia is growing rapidly, especially in Central Aceh District. Construction projects often experience risks, so that risk events can have a serious impact on the viability of the project. Project delays can result in cost overruns and project losses. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factors causing project delays.The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the risk factors that cause delays in construction projects and (2) determine those particular risk factors that have a greater influence on construction projects. The location of this research was Central Aceh District. Methods: The data in this study were primary data in the form of a questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the literature related to this particular type of research. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents, namely contractor companies located in the Central Aceh District. The questionnaires were distributed to determine respondents' opinions about the level of influence of risk factors causing project delays. We used a validity test, reliability test, and descriptive analysis for data processing. Results: Based on the results of the study from 47 respondents, the âvery high influenceâ category (Mode=5) for the tool malfunction factor, cost estimation inaccuracy, increased work costs, implementation of new technologies, details, accuracy and conformity to specifications that are not appropriate, worker quarrels, poor project planning and management, poor condition at locations and accessibility difficulty. Conclusions: Of the 80 risk factors that caused project delays, eight risk factors were found to have a very high influence on the implementation of construction projects in Central Aceh District. Practical implications: The results of this study provide knowledge to contractor companies about the delay factors that have the most influence on project implementation so that they are expected to be able to manage risks to avoid losses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A study protocol to prepare an RBD protein for vaccine against COVID-19 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background:Â SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global threat to humans and the worldâs economy. Effective and safe vaccines against this virus are essential to control and eradicate the pandemic. The currently applied vaccines carry SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein mRNA/cDNA. These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.Â  Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying threeÂ types ofÂ  DNAÂ sequences: RBDÂ cDNA, FP (fusion peptide)Â DNA and sfGFP(superfolder-green-fluorescent-protein),Â cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open-reading-frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic-interaction-chromatography), detected with a BioVision-Elisa-Kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nmÂ and immune simulation will be carried out using C57BL mice.Â  Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant)Â gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure immunoreactive RBD protein.Â  Conclusion: A positive BioVision-ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.

                Background Multiplexing tissue imaging is developing as a complement for single cell analysis, bringing the spatial information of cells in tissue in addition to multiple parameters measurements. More and more commercial or home-made systems are available. These techniques allow the imaging of tens of fluorescent reporters, where the spectral overlap is solved by imaging by cycles the fluorophores using microfluidics to change the reporters between each cycle. Methods For several systems, the acquisition system coupled to the microfluidic system is a wide field microscope, and the acquisition process is done by mosaicking to cover a large field of view, relying on image processing to obtain the data set to be analysed in intensity. The processed data set allows the identification of different populations, quite similarly to cytometry analysis, but with spatial information in addition. To obtain the final image for analysis from the raw acquisitions, several preprocessing steps are needed for inter-cycle registration, tissue autofluorescence correction or mosaicking. We propose a workflow for this preprocessing, implemented as an open source software (as a library, command line tool and standalone). Results We exemplify the workflow on the commercial system PhenoCyclerÂ® (formerly named CODEXÂ®) and provide a reduced size data set for testing. Conclusions We compare our processor with the commercially provided processor and show that we solve some problems also reported by other users.

                Background: Dermatoglyphics can be utilised in clinical settings to identify those who are more likely to have impacted teeth. Additionally, dermatoglyphics looks to have potential as a non-invasive diagnostic method for predicting the presence or absence of an impacted tooth. The goal of this study was to look at the most common dermatoglyphic pattern in people who had or didn't have an impacted mandibular third molar teeth and see if there was a dermatoglyphic signature. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 180 participants was conducted (90 cases and 90 controls). The rolling impression technique was used to apply blue duplicating ink to participants' fingertips, which was then recorded. There was an increase in the frequency of the whorl-plain pattern in the right-hand ring finger (60%; p=0.028) and left-hand little finger (33.3%; p=0.009), as well as the loop-ulnar pattern in the right-hand middle finger (74.4%; p=0.024) in individuals with a predisposition to the presence of impacted teeth. Results: The left-hand little finger was found to be the most predictive for impaction in a forward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Dermatoglyphics could be used as a non-invasive sign to predict whether or not a tooth is affected. Its value comes in early detection, which helps to avoid the surgical problems that come with symptomatic extraction of an impacted tooth.

                Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare condition marked by uncontrolled histiocyte proliferation and activation, and phagocytosis of normal hematopoietic cells. This disease is rare, and a concurrent presentation with acute polymyositis is rare. A 14-year-old male was admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital with a high-grade fever for 25 days, generalized severe body aches, and multiple large joint pain in the lower limb for the same duration. On examination, the patient was found to have splenomegaly, tenderness in both knee joints, symmetrical proximal weakness of both lower limbs, several sensory losses, and loss of bowel and bladder control. The laboratory data showed that he had anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypoalbuminemia, raised D-dimer, and serum creatine phosphokinase (S. CPK). Along with these, a bone marrow biopsy revealed hemophagocytic cells, and he was diagnosed with HLH with acute polymyositis (PM). The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone and dexamethasone. Clinical stability was achieved with gradual improvement of initial symptoms and biochemical markers. The patient was discharged with oral steroids at a tapering dose and was advised to regularly follow-up.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of genetic factors in microtia: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microtia is a congenital malformation of the outer ears caused by improper embryonic development. The origin of microtia and causes of its variations remain unknown. Because of the lack of clarity regarding the role of genetic variables in microtia, we conducted a systematic review to qualitatively identify the genes most important in the development of microtia to provide an up-to-date review. Methods: Using six search engines, we searched all published studies related to the genetic factors of isolated microtia and syndromic microtia. The identified publications were screened and selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by the authors and assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. We found 40 studies, including 22 studies on syndromic microtia and 18 studies on isolated microtia. Data extraction of each study was arranged in tabulation for syndromic and isolated microtia. The extracted data were: first authorâs surname, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample characteristic and gene assessed. Results: After the data were extracted, analyzed, and reviewed, the most common gene suspected to be involved in isolated microtia was Homeobox A2 (HOXA2, 12.1%). Conversely, in syndromic microtia, the two most common genes supposed to play a role were Fibroblast Growth Factor 3 (FGF3, 47.2%) and TreacherâCollinsâFranceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1, 30.2%). From the studies, the three most prevalent genes associated with microtia were HOXA2 (10%), FGF3 (8.4%), and TCOF1 (5.4%). In syndromic microtia, the most common mutation types were deletion in TCOF1 (46.9%) and missense and deletion in FGF3 (both 38%), and in isolated microtia, the most common mutation type was silent in HOXA2 (54.2%). Conclusions: In summary, genetic factors are involved in microtia; thus, molecular analysis is strongly advised. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021287294 (25/10/21).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of bypassing Microsoft Windows Security using the MITRE CALDERA Framework [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microsoft Windows Security is a recently implemented safeguard for the Windows operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows10 and 11. However, there is a major shortcoming in this system to stop Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These are government-financed groups that are funded to attack other government entities. Following the initial security breach, the hacked Windows device is used to access the rest of the network devices in order to transfer data to external storage (Exfiltration). Methods: In this work, we have tested the Microsoft Windows Security system using MITRE CALDERA and ATT&CK frameworks and explain how APT groups are able to bypass Windows Security. Results: In this study we used "54ndc47" agent through GoLang feature in MITRE CALDERA platform to test and bypass Microsoft Windows Security systems (MS Windows 10). Through it, we were able to bypass the Windows Security system and display entire files in the victim's device. Conclusions: In this paper, we have provided recommendations to Microsoft to improve their Windows Security tool through the use of Artificial intelligence (AI).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Experimental study and machine learning model to predict formability of magnesium alloy sheet [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnesium alloy is not only light in weight but also possesses moderate strength. Magnesium AZ31-H24 alloy sheet has many applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Experimental stretch forming tests are performed on this sheet to measure the materialâs formability by constructing forming limit diagrams. Methods: Several tests of Nakazima were carried out on rectangular samples at 24, 250, 350Â°C and 0.01, 0.001 mm/s using a hemispherical punch. The work done to predict the formability of magnesium alloys has not been recorded in recent literature on machine learning models. Hence, the researchers of this article choose to explore the same and build three models to predict the formability of magnesium alloy through Random Forest algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multiple linear Regression. Results: The Random Forest showed high accuracy of 96% in prediction. Conclusions: It is concluded that the need for physical experiments can be greatly minimized in formability studies by using machine learning concepts.

                The past three decades have seen a major shift in our understanding of the strong links between autism and identity. These developments have called for careful consideration of the language used to describe autism. Here, we briefly discuss some of these deliberations and provide guidance to researchers around language use in autism research.

                The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape neutralization can jeopardize the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Chen et al. report the isolation of potent human antibodies that neutralize emerging variants of concern, including various Omicron sublineages. These antibodies show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the hamster model.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 29 September 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03065-0">doi:10.1038/d41586-022-03065-0</a></p>An analysis of faculty members employed at academic institutions in the United States reveals that most employees were trained at just a few universities. The finding provides insights into how hiring perpetuates inequalities.

This facilitation determines which branches of sensory axons conduct action potentials to motor neurons, enabling computation at the level of the node to regulate sensory feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Putting perception into action with inverse optimal control for continuous psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysical methods are a cornerstone of psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience where they have been used to quantify behavior and its neural correlates for a vast range of mental phenomena. Their power derives from the combination of controlled experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection theory. Unfortunately, they require many tedious trials and preferably highly trained participants. A recently developed approach, continuous psychophysics, promises to transform the field by abandoning the rigid trial structure involving binary responses and replacing it with continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. However, what has precluded wide adoption of this approach is that current analysis methods do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task and therefore recover perceptual thresholds that are larger compared to equivalent traditional psychophysical experiments. Here, we introduce a computational analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control. We show via simulations and previously published data that this not only recovers the perceptual thresholds but additionally estimates subjectsâ action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. Taken together, we provide further evidence for the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and, crucially, the intrinsic costs of behavior, even in experiments seemingly only investigating perception.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Candida albicans virulence factor candidalysin polymerizes in solution to form membrane pores and damage epithelial cells</a></h4>

              
                <i>Candida albicans</i> causes severe invasive candidiasis. <i>C. albicans</i> infection requires the virulence factor candidalysin (CL) which damages target cell membranes. However, the mechanism that CL uses to permeabilize membranes is unclear. We reveal that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism. Unexpectedly, CL readily assembled into polymers in solution. We propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer, which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into a loop. CL loops appear to spontaneously insert into the membrane to become pores. A CL mutation (G4W) inhibited the formation of polymers in solution and prevented pore formation in synthetic lipid systems. Epithelial cell studies showed that G4W CL failed to activate the danger response pathway, a hallmark of the pathogenic effect of CL. These results indicate that CL polymerization in solution is a necessary step for the damage of cellular membranes. Analysis of CL pores by atomic force microscopy revealed co-existence of simple depressions and more complex pores, which are likely formed by CL assembled in an alternate oligomer orientation. We propose that this structural rearrangement represents a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation to achieve more robust cellular damage. To summarize, CL uses a previously unknown mechanism to damage membranes, whereby pre-assembly of CL loops in solution leads to formation of membrane pores. Our investigation not only unravels a new paradigm for the formation of membrane pores, but additionally identifies CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bronchus-associated macrophages efficiently capture and present soluble inhaled antigens and are capable of local Th2 cell activation</a></h4>

              
                In allergic asthma, allergen inhalation leads to local Th2 cell activation and peribronchial inflammation. However, the mechanisms for local antigen capture and presentation remain unclear. By two-photon microscopy of the mouse lung, we established that soluble antigens in the bronchial airway lumen were efficiently captured and presented by a population of CD11c<sup>+</sup> interstitial macrophages with high CX3CR1-GFP and MHC class II expression. We refer to these cells as Bronchus-Associated Macrophages (BAMs) based on their localization underneath the bronchial epithelium. BAMs were enriched in collagen-rich regions near some airway branchpoints, where inhaled antigens are likely to deposit. BAMs engaged in extended interactions with effector Th2 cells and promoted Th2 cytokine production. BAMs were also often in contact with dendritic cells (DCs). After exposure to inflammatory stimuli, DCs migrated to draining lymph nodes, whereas BAMs remained lung resident. We propose that BAMs act as local antigen presenting cells in the lung and also transfer antigen to DCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rabphilin 3A binds the N-peptide of SNAP-25 to promote SNARE complex assembly in exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Exocytosis of secretory vesicles requires the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and small GTPase Rabs. As a Rab3/Rab27 effector protein on secretory vesicles, Rabphilin 3A was implicated to interact with SNAP-25 to regulate vesicle exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we have characterized the physiologically relevant binding sites between Rabphilin 3A and SNAP-25. We found that an intramolecular interplay between the N-terminal Rab-binding domain and C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>AB domain enables Rabphilin 3A to strongly bind the SNAP-25 N-peptide region via its C<sub>2</sub>B bottom Î±-helix. Disruption of this interaction significantly impaired docking and fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane in rat PC12 cells. In addition, we found that this interaction allows Rabphilin 3A to accelerate SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, we revealed that this interaction accelerates SNARE complex assembly via inducing a conformational switch from random coils to Î±-helical structure in the SNAP-25 SNARE motif. Altogether, our data suggest that the promotion of SNARE complex assembly by binding the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom Î±-helix of Rabphilin 3A to the N-peptide of SNAP-25 underlies a pre-fusion function of Rabphilin 3A in vesicle exocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Macrophage innate training induced by IL-4 and IL-13 activation enhances OXPHOS driven anti-mycobacterial responses</a></h4>

              
                Macrophages are a highly adaptive population of innate immune cells. Polarization with IFNÎ³ and LPS into the 'classically activated' M1 macrophage enhances pro-inflammatory and microbicidal responses, important for eradicating bacteria such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. By contrast, 'alternatively activated' M2 macrophages, polarized with IL-4, oppose bactericidal mechanisms and allow mycobacterial growth. These activation states are accompanied by distinct metabolic profiles, where M1 macrophages favor near exclusive use of glycolysis, whereas M2 macrophages up-regulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here we demonstrate that activation with IL-4 and IL-13 counterintuitively induces protective innate memory against mycobacterial challenge. In human and murine models, prior activation with IL-4/13 enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to a secondary stimulation with mycobacterial ligands. In our murine model, enhanced killing capacity is also demonstrated. Despite this switch in phenotype, IL-4/13 trained murine macrophages do not demonstrate M1-typical metabolism, instead retaining heightened use of OXPHOS. Moreover, inhibition of OXPHOS with oligomycin, 2-deoxy glucose or BPTES all impeded heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine responses from IL-4/13 trained macrophages. Lastly, this work identifies that IL-10 attenuates protective IL-4/13 training, impeding pro-inflammatory and bactericidal mechanisms. In summary, this work provides new and unexpected insight into alternative macrophage activation states in the context of mycobacterial infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Olfactory responses of Drosophila are encoded in the organization of projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                The projection neurons (PNs), reconstructed from electron microscope (EM) images of the Drosophila olfactory system, offer a detailed view of neuronal anatomy, providing glimpses into information flow in the brain. About 150 uPNs constituting 58 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) are bundled together in the axonal extension, routing the olfactory signal received at AL to mushroom body (MB) calyx and lateral horn (LH). Here we quantify the neuronal organization in terms of the inter-PN distances and examine its relationship with the odor types sensed by Drosophila. The homotypic uPNs that constitute glomeruli are tightly bundled and stereotyped in position throughout the neuropils, even though the glomerular PN organization in AL is no longer sustained in the higher brain center. Instead, odor-type dependent clusters consisting of multiple homotypes innervate the MB calyx and LH. Pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes are spatially segregated in MB calyx, whereas two distinct clusters of food-related homotypes are found in LH in addition to the segregation of pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes. We find that there are statistically significant associations between the spatial organization among a group of homotypic uPNs and certain stereotyped olfactory responses. Additionally, the signals from some of the tightly bundled homotypes converge to a specific group of lateral horn neurons (LHNs), which indicates that homotype (or odor type) specific integration of signals occurs at the synaptic interface between PNs and LHNs. Our findings suggest that before neural computation in the inner brain, some of the olfactory information are already encoded in the spatial organization of uPNs, illuminating that a certain degree of labeled-line strategy is at work in the Drosophila olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional brain reconfiguration during sustained pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is constructed through complex interactions among multiple brain systems, but it remains unclear how functional brain networks are reconfigured over time while experiencing pain. Here, we investigated the time-varying changes in the functional brain networks during 20 min capsaicin-induced sustained orofacial pain. In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from other areas of the somatosensory cortex and integrated with subcortical and frontoparietal regions, constituting an extended brain network of sustained pain. As pain decreased over time, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were separated from this brain network and connected to multiple cerebellar regions. Machine-learning models based on these network features showed significant predictions of changes in pain experience across two independent datasets (<i>n</i> = 48 and 74). This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, advancing our mechanistic understanding of sustained pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings</a></h4>

              
                A brain-computer interface that decodes continuous language from non-invasive recordings would have many scientific and practical applications. Currently, however, decoders that reconstruct continuous language use invasive recordings from surgically implanted electrodes, while decoders that use non-invasive recordings can only identify stimuli from among a small set of letters, words, or phrases. Here we introduce a non-invasive decoder that reconstructs continuous natural language from cortical representations of semantic meaning recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given novel brain recordings, this decoder generates intelligible word sequences that recover the meaning of perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos, demonstrating that a single language decoder can be applied to a range of semantic tasks. To study how language is represented across the brain, we tested the decoder on different cortical networks, and found that natural language can be separately decoded from multiple cortical networks in each hemisphere. As brain-computer interfaces should respect mental privacy, we tested whether successful decoding requires subject cooperation, and found that subject cooperation is required both to train and to apply the decoder. Our study demonstrates that continuous language can be decoded from non-invasive brain recordings, enabling future multipurpose brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development shaped by cue reliability in the barn owl's auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems display capability to preferentially choose stimuli based on their reliability at conveying accurate information. While previous reports have shown the ability of the brain to reweigh cues based on ongoing or dynamic changes in reliability, how the brain may learn and maintain neural responses to sensory statistics expected to be stable over longer time periods remain significant open questions of potential mechanisms underlying naturalistic biased perception. This study provides evidence that the barn owl's midbrain is shaped by permanent statistics experienced during development. The barn owl's midbrain features a topographic map of auditory space where neurons compute horizontal sound location from the interaural time difference (ITD). Previous work has shown that frequency tuning of these midbrain map neurons is correlated with the pattern of most reliable frequencies for the neurons' preferred ITD. This pattern of ITD reliability is due to the filtering properties of the head, primarily determined by the facial ruff in the barn owl. In this study, we found that the absence of a facial ruff led to a decrease in the reliability of high frequencies originating from frontal space. To test if the owl's frequency tuning of midbrain map neurons is driven by permanent changes in the pattern of ITD reliability, these neurons were recorded from adult owls, who had the facial ruff removed as juveniles, and from juvenile owls, before the facial ruff developed. In both groups, we found that frontally-tuned neurons displayed tunings to frequencies lower than reported in normal adult owls, consistent with the difference in ITD reliability between the normal and ruff removed conditions. Juvenile owls also exhibited more heterogeneous frequency tuning, suggesting developmental processes that refine tuning to match the pattern of ITD reliability. Additional recordings immediately upstream of the midbrain map displayed ITD tuned neural responses for all frequencies across the owl's normal hearing range. Broader analysis of the effects of ruff-removal on the acoustical properties of spatial cues indicated a dominant role of ITD reliability in driving the adaptive changes in frequency tuning. These results support the hypothesis that frequency tuning in the midbrain map is developmentally adapted to permanent statistics of spatial cues, implementing probabilistic coding for sound localization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incorporating natural language into vision models improves prediction and understanding of higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                We hypothesize that high-level visual representations contain more than the representation of individual categories: they represent complex semantic information inherent in scenes that is most relevant for interaction with the world. Consequently, multimodal models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) which construct image embeddings to best match embeddings of image captions should better predict neural responses in visual cortex, since image captions typically contain the most semantically relevant information in an image for humans. We extracted image features using CLIP, which encodes visual concepts with supervision from natural language captions. We then used voxelwise encoding models based on CLIP features to predict brain responses to real-world images from the Natural Scenes Dataset. CLIP explains up to R2=78% of variance in stimulus-evoked responses from individual voxels in the held out test data. CLIP also explains greater unique variance in higher-level visual areas compared to models trained only with image/label pairs (ImageNet trained ResNet) or text (BERT). Visualizations of model embeddings and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveal that, with the use of captions, CLIP captures both global and fine-grained semantic dimensions represented within visual cortex. Based on these novel results, we suggest that human understanding of their environment form an important dimension of visual representation.

                The cardinal interneuron classes are a useful simplification of cortical interneuron diversity, but such broad subgroupings glosses over the molecular, morphological, and circuit specificity of interneuron subtypes, most notably among the somatostatin interneuron class. The organizing principles by which the connectivity of these subtypes is specified are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we designed a series of genetic strategies to target the breadth of somatostatin interneuron subtypes. Using these strategies to target three subtypes that span the entire cortical column, we examined their afferent and efferent connectivity. Our data demonstrated that each of these possesses remarkable reciprocal connectivity with the intracortical or corticofugal pyramidal classes, as well as parvalbumin interneurons. Even when two interneuron subtypes shared the same efferent target, their synaptic targeting proved selective for particular dendritic compartments. We thus provide evidence that subtypes of somatostatin cortical interneurons form cell-type specific cortical circuits.

	<p>Pain is often debilitating, and is associated with many pathologies, as either a cause or consequence. Pharmacological interventions, such as opioids, to manage pain may lead to potential problems, such as addiction. When pain is controlled and managed, it can prevent negative associated outcomes affiliated with disease. Music is a low-cost option that shows promise in the management of painful circumstances. Music therapy has provided potent options for pain relief across a variety of ages and populations. As a nonpharmacological alternative or complement lacking side effects, music interventions are growing in clinical application and research protocols. This article considers the neurological implications of varying kinds of pain to provide working considerations that preempt the use of music and music-therapy applications in treating pain.</p>

	<p>Background. After the declaration of the pandemic status in several countries, the continuity of face-to-face visits in psychiatric facilities has been delayed or even interrupted to reduce viral spread. Little is known about the personality factors associated with medication beliefs and adherence amongst individuals with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This brief report describes a preliminary naturalistic longitudinal study that explored whether the Big Five personality traits prospectively moderate the effects of medication beliefs on changes in adherence during the pandemic for a group of outpatients with psychosis or bipolar disorder. Methods. Thirteen outpatients undergoing routine face-to-face follow-up assessments during the pandemic were included (41 observations overall) and completed the Revised Italian Version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale&amp;amp;mdash;8-item and the Beck Depression Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;II. Results. Participants had stronger concerns about their psychiatric medications rather than beliefs about their necessity, and adherence to medications was generally low. Participants who had more necessity beliefs than concerns had better adherence to medications. People scoring higher in Conscientiousness and Neuroticism traits and more concerned about the medication side effects had poorer adherence. Conclusions. These preliminary data suggest the importance of a careful assessment of the adherence to medications amongst people with psychosis/bipolar disorder during the pandemic. Interventions aimed to improve adherence might focus on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; medication beliefs and their Conscientiousness and Neuroticism personality traits.</p>

	<p>The paper proposes an ecological and portable protocol for the large-scale collection of reading data in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children based on recording the finger movements of a subject reading a text displayed on a tablet touchscreen. By capitalizing on recent evidence that movements of a finger that points to a scene or text during visual exploration or reading may approximate eye fixations, we focus on recognition of written content and function words, pace of reading, and accuracy in reading comprehension. The analysis showed significant differences between typically developing and ASD children, with the latter group exhibiting greater variation in levels of reading ability, slower developmental pace in reading speed, less accurate comprehension, greater dependency on word length and word frequency, less significant prediction-based processing, as well as a monotonous, steady reading pace with reduced attention to weak punctuation. Finger-tracking patterns provides evidence that ASD readers may fail to integrate single word processing into major syntactic structures and lends support to the hypothesis of an impaired use of contextual information to predict upcoming stimuli, suggesting that difficulties in perception may arise as difficulties in prediction.</p>

	<p>Humans constantly calibrate their sensorimotor system to accommodate environmental changes, and this perception-action integration is extensively studied using sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. The cerebellum is one of the key brain regions for sensorimotor adaptation, but previous attempts to modulate sensorimotor adaptation with cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) produced inconsistent findings. Since both conscious/explicit learning and procedural/implicit learning are involved in adaptation, researchers have proposed that ctDCS only affects sensorimotor adaptation when implicit learning dominates the overall adaptation. However, previous research had both types of learning co-exist in their experiments without controlling their potential interaction under the influence of ctDCS. Here, we used error clamp perturbation and gradual perturbation, two effective techniques to elicit implicit learning only, to test the ctDCS effect on sensorimotor adaptation. We administrated ctDCS to independent groups of participants while they implicitly adapted to visual errors. In Experiment 1, we found that cerebellar anodal tDCS had no effect on implicit adaptation induced by error clamp. In Experiment 2, we applied both anodal and cathodal stimulation and used a smaller error clamp to prevent a potential ceiling effect, and replicated the null effect. In Experiment 3, we used gradually imposed visual errors to elicit implicit adaptation but still found no effect of anodal tDCS. With a total of 174 participants, we conclude that the previous inconsistent tDCS effect on sensorimotor adaptation cannot be explained by the relative contribution of implicit learning. Given that the cerebellum is simultaneously involved in explicit and implicit learning, our results suggest that the complex interplay between the two learning processes and large individual differences associated with this interplay might contribute to the inconsistent findings from previous studies on ctDCS and sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

	<p>The link between emotions and motor function has been known for decades but is still not clarified. The Adaptive Force (AF) describes the neuromuscular capability to adapt to increasing forces and was suggested to be especially vulnerable to interfering inputs. This study investigated the influence of pleasant and unpleasant food imagery on the manually assessed AF of elbow and hip flexors objectified by a handheld device in 12 healthy women. The maximal isometric AF was significantly reduced during unpleasant vs. pleasant imagery and baseline (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, dz = 0.98&amp;amp;ndash;1.61). During unpleasant imagery, muscle lengthening started at 59.00 &amp;amp;plusmn; 22.50% of maximal AF, in contrast to baseline and pleasant imagery, during which the isometric position could be maintained mostly during the entire force increase up to ~97.90 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.00% of maximal AF. Healthy participants showed an immediately impaired holding function triggered by unpleasant imagery, presumably related to negative emotions. Hence, AF seems to be suitable to test instantaneously the effect of emotions on motor function. Since musculoskeletal complaints can result from muscular instability, the findings provide insights into the understanding of the causal chain of linked musculoskeletal pain and mental stress. A case example (current stress vs. positive imagery) suggests that the approach presented in this study might have future implications for psychomotor diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>

	<p>Introduction. The focus of the present paper is on (1) how dyslexia research and hence definitions have developed during the period 1950&amp;amp;ndash;2020 and includes (2) a database search of scientific publications on dyslexia during the same period. The focus is on the definitions of dyslexia and the organization of the network search based on the causal four-level model by Morton and Frith. Method. (1) The definitions are presented in accordance with a historic review of dyslexia research from 1950 to 2020 and based on (2) Google Scholar counts of publications on dyslexia, on defining dyslexia, on dyslexia at the four levels (symptomatic, cognitive, biological, environmental), and by areas (sensorimotor, comorbidity). Finally, a percentage calculation shows the relative development within each level and area by decennium (1950&amp;amp;ndash;1960, 1960&amp;amp;ndash;1970, 1970&amp;amp;ndash;1980, 1990&amp;amp;ndash;2000, 2002&amp;amp;ndash;2010, 2010&amp;amp;ndash;2020). Results. (1) Of the seven definitions presented, only the definition by the BDA 2007 included the four levels of the causal model. (2) The number of publications increased substantially over the period. However, relatively few publications have defined dyslexia. An increase in publications from 1950 to 2020 was seen across the four levels and two areas&amp;amp;mdash;however, with an alteration in the thematic focus over this time span. Summary. Defining dyslexia has still not reached a consensus. This uncertainty may explain why only one of the seven definitions proved satisfactory according to the four-level model. Along with the general increase in research, publications on dyslexia have increased accordingly during the period 1950 to 2020. Although the symptomatic level has played a dominant role over the whole period, thematic shifts have been seen over these 70 years. In particular, a substantial thematic shift was seen by the turn of the millennium. There has been a relative increase in the focus on literacy at the symptomatic level, on phonological awareness at the cognitive level, in gender at the biological level, and second language learning as comorbidities. However, increases in counts are not alone a valid indication of scientific progress. In particular, the lack of definitional criteria as a basis for participant and method selection should attract much more focus in future studies. The present study underlines the multifactorial nature of dyslexia, as evidenced by a substantial increase in the number of publications on the subject. It is a challenge for future research to continuously use and possibly redefine dyslexia definitions in line with such standards.</p>

	<p>Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles that contain a variety of mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins. They are capable of being released by a variety of cells and are essential for cell&amp;amp;ndash;cell communication. The exosomes produced by cells have shown protective benefits against spinal cord damage (SCI). Recently, it was discovered that M2 macrophages aid in the angiogenesis of numerous illnesses. However, the functional role of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes on SCI is unclear. Here, we investigate the pro-angiogenesis of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes on SCI. We founded that M2 macrophage exosomes alleviated tissue damage and enhanced functional recovery post-SCI. We discovered that M2 macrophage exosome administration increased angiogenesis after SCI in vivo using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence labeling, and Western blot analysis. Additionally, the expression of the pro-angiogenesis factors, HIF-1&amp;amp;alpha; and VEGF, were enhanced with the treatment of the M2 macrophage exosomes. Furthermore, we found that M2 macrophage exosomes enhanced neurogenesis after SCI in vivo. In vitro, we found that M2 macrophage exosomes can be taken up by the brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) and that they enhanced the tube formation, migration, and proliferation of bEnd.3 cells. Furthermore, by using special siRNA to inhibit HIF-1&amp;amp;alpha; expression, we observed that the expression of VEGF decreased, and the tube formation, migration, and proliferation of bEnd.3 cells were attenuated with the treatment of HIF-1&amp;amp;alpha;-siRNA. In conclusion, our findings reveal that M2 macrophage exosomes improve neurological functional recovery and angiogenesis post-SCI, and this process is partially associated with the activation of the HIF-1/VEGF signaling pathway.</p>

	<p>Background: Wandering among people with dementia (PwD) is associated with a high risk of injury and death. The stigma of dementia prevents Chinese dementia families from seeking information and support earlier, which increases the demand for long-term care facilities. Despite universal recognition of the importance of care facilities, healthcare providers in care facilities still lack the relevant nursing knowledge and skills, including non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) that have been proven to be effective in preventing wandering. Systematic and culturally appropriate NPI programmes for healthcare providers to manage wandering among PwD in long-term care facilities are still lacking. We aimed to develop an evidence-based and culturally appropriate NPI programme for wandering in PwD to guide healthcare providers in nursing homes to prevent wandering and its adverse outcomes. Methods: The NPI programme was developed according to the framework of the Belgian Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBAM). We, (1) performed a systematic literature search to summarize the available evidence, (2) developed evidence-based recommendations for the NPI programme based on the existing evidence, and (3) carried out a validation process to revise the content of the recommendations and to determine the grades of recommendations, including group meetings with experts and a survey for end-users. Results: Based on 22 publications and validation from 7 experts and 76 end users, we developed 21 recommendations covering 4 domains: (1) caregiver education, (2) preventing excessive wandering, (3) promoting safe walking, and (4) preventing people with dementia from going missing. We created almost all recommendations of the four domains with accompanying levels of evidence and grades of recommendations. Conclusions: By combining the evidence with expert and end-user opinions, a comprehensive NPI programme was developed to support institutional healthcare providers to prevent wandering and its adverse outcomes. The benefits of this programme are currently being tested.</p>

	<p>Parental behavior problems have long-term effects on children&amp;amp;rsquo;s limbic brain structures and functions. Parental behavior problems-related brain changes in children may lead to mental disorders and behavior dysfunction later in life. However, our understanding of the relationship between parental behavior and children&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain structures is less obvious when children and adolescents are studied in a general population without mental disorders. The majority of studies on the relationship between parental behavior and adolescent brain structure have been focused on severe forms of the following parental behavior problems: (1) internalizing behavior associated with mood and anxiety disorders, and (2) externalizing behavior associated with substance use and violence. A few studies examined the effect of normative variations or subtle differences in parental behavior. Therefore, we utilized a large study&amp;amp;mdash;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)&amp;amp;mdash;to determine relationships between normative variation in parental internalizing and externalizing behavior and limbic brain structures in children and adolescents without mental disorders. Quantile (median) regression models were used to compute associations between parental behavior and children&amp;amp;rsquo;s limbic structures. We found that parental internalizing and externalizing behaviors are uniquely associated with children&amp;amp;rsquo;s limbic structures after adjustment for biological confounders and parental socioeconomic status. Our findings indicate that normative parental behavior may have a significant early influence on limbic structures of normally developing children and adolescents. Accelerated or delayed limbic structure maturation may account for children&amp;amp;rsquo;s and adolescents&amp;amp;rsquo; behavioral inadequacies and a risk of developing specific mood disorders or substance abuse problems later in life.</p>

	<p>The &amp;amp;ldquo;cocktail party&amp;amp;rdquo; problem&amp;amp;mdash;how a listener perceives speech in noisy environments&amp;amp;mdash;is typically studied using speech (multi-talker babble) or noise maskers. However, realistic cocktail party scenarios often include background music (e.g., coffee shops, concerts). Studies investigating music&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on concurrent speech perception have predominantly used highly controlled synthetic music or shaped noise, which do not reflect naturalistic listening environments. Behaviorally, familiar background music and songs with vocals/lyrics inhibit concurrent speech recognition. Here, we investigated the neural bases of these effects. While recording multichannel EEG, participants listened to an audiobook while popular songs (or silence) played in the background at a 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Songs were either familiar or unfamiliar to listeners and featured either vocals or isolated instrumentals from the original audio recordings. Comprehension questions probed task engagement. We used temporal response functions (TRFs) to isolate cortical tracking to the target speech envelope and analyzed neural responses around 100 ms (i.e., auditory N1 wave). We found that speech comprehension was, expectedly, impaired during background music compared to silence. Target speech tracking was further hindered by the presence of vocals. When masked by familiar music, response latencies to speech were less susceptible to informational masking, suggesting concurrent neural tracking of speech was easier during music known to the listener. These differential effects of music familiarity were further exacerbated in listeners with less musical ability. Our neuroimaging results and their dependence on listening skills are consistent with early attentional-gain mechanisms where familiar music is easier to tune out (listeners already know the song&amp;amp;rsquo;s expectancies) and thus can allocate fewer attentional resources to the background music to better monitor concurrent speech material.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroscience Milestones: Developing Standardized Core-Competencies for Research-Based Neuroscience Trainees</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the medical field, the implementation of Milestones by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has provided a common understanding among clinical and academic supervisors and trainees related to the development of core competencies during graduate medical training. These Milestones help establish developmental trajectories and aspirational goals for the trainee. Unfortunately, training in graduate and postgraduate neuroscience lacks a standardized developmental progression of competencies or outcomes expected of trainees. Without such standardizations, it may be difficult for both the mentor and trainee to identify levels of improvement, which may impact the trainee's future success. Here, we discuss the value of developing a nonexhaustive framework that may be used to evaluate trainees with the expectation that it will provide a template to help with the development of future neuroscientists.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Glycerol-3-Phosphate Shuttle Is a Backup System Securing Metabolic Flexibility in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrical activity in neurons is highly energy demanding and accompanied by rises in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in turn, secures energy supply by pushing mitochondrial metabolism either through augmented NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) transfer into mitochondria via the malate&ndash;aspartate shuttle (MAS) or via direct activation of dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle after passing into the matrix through the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU). Another Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive booster of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (G3PS), whose role in neuronal energy supply has remained elusive. Essential components of G3PS are expressed in hippocampal neurons. Single neuron metabolic measurements in primary hippocampal cultures derived from rat pups of either sex reveal only moderate, if any, constitutive activity of G3PS. However, during electrical activity neurons fully rely on G3PS when MAS and MCU are unavailable. Under these conditions, G3PS is required for appropriate action potential firing. Accordingly, G3PS safeguards metabolic flexibility of neurons to cope with energy demands of electrical signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are known to provide a link between the energy-demanding electrical activity and an adequate ATP supply in neurons. To do so, Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts both from outside and inside of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Neuronal function critically depends on this regulation, and its defects are often found in various neurologic disorders. Although interest in neuronal metabolism has increased, many aspects thereof have remained unresolved. In particular, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) shuttling system, the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, has been largely ignored with respect to its function in neurons. Our results demonstrate that this shuttle is functional in hippocampal neurons and safeguards ATP supply and appropriate action potential firing when malate aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter are unavailable, thereby ensuring neuronal metabolic flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Antagonistic Activities of Fmn2 and ADF Regulate Axonal F-Actin Patch Dynamics and the Initiation of Collateral Branching</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interstitial collateral branching of axons is a critical component in the development of functional neural circuits. Axon collateral branches are established through a series of cellular processes initiated by the development of a specialized, focal F-actin network in axons. The formation, maintenance and remodeling of this F-actin patch is critical for the initiation of axonal protrusions that are subsequently consolidated to form a collateral branch. However, the mechanisms regulating F-actin patch dynamics are poorly understood. Fmn2 is a formin family member implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We find that Fmn2 regulates the initiation of axon collateral protrusions in chick spinal neurons and in zebrafish motor neurons. Fmn2 localizes to the protrusion-initiating axonal F-actin patches and regulates the lifetime and size of these F-actin networks. The F-actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 is necessary for F-actin patch stability but not for initiating patch formation. We show that Fmn2 insulates the F-actin patches from disassembly by the actin-depolymerizing factor, ADF, and promotes long-lived, larger patches that are competent to initiate axonal protrusions. The regulation of axonal branching can contribute to the neurodevelopmental pathologies associated with Fmn2 and the dynamic antagonism between Fmn2 and ADF may represent a general mechanism of formin-dependent protection of Arp2/3-initiated F-actin networks from disassembly.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axonal branching is a key process in the development of functional circuits and neural plasticity. Axon collateral branching is initiated by the elaboration of F-actin filaments from discrete axonal F-actin networks. We show that the neurodevelopmental disorder-associated formin, Fmn2, is a critical regulator of axon collateral branching. Fmn2 localizes to the collateral branch-inducing F-actin patches in axons and regulates the stability of these actin networks. The F-actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 protects the patches from ADF-mediated disassembly. Opposing activities of Fmn2 and ADF exert a dynamic regulatory control on axon collateral branch initiation and may underly the neurodevelopmental defects associated with Fmn2.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Offset Responses in the Auditory Cortex Show Unique History Dependence</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory responses typically vary depending on the recent history of sensory experience. This is essential for processes, including adaptation, efficient coding, and change detection. In the auditory cortex (AC), the short-term history dependence of sound-evoked (onset) responses has been well characterized. Yet many AC neurons also respond to sound terminations, and little is known about the history dependence of these "offset" responses, whether the short-term dynamics of onset and offset responses are correlated, or how these properties are distributed among cell types. Here we presented awake male and female mice with repeating noise burst stimuli while recording single-unit activity from primary AC. We identified parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons through optotagging, and also separated narrow-spiking from broad-spiking units. We found that offset responses are typically less depressive than onset responses, and this result was robust to a variety of stimulus parameters, controls, measurement types, and selection criteria. Whether a cell's onset response facilitates or depresses does not predict whether its offset response facilitates or depresses. Cell types differed in the dynamics of their onset responses, and in the prevalence, but not the dynamics, of their offset responses. Finally, we clustered cells according to spiking responses and found that response clusters were associated with cell type. Each cluster contained cells of several types, but even within a cluster, cells often showed cell type-specific response dynamics. We conclude that onset and offset responses are differentially influenced by recent sound history, and discuss the implications of this for the encoding of ongoing sound stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory neuron responses depend on stimulus history. This history dependence is crucial for sensory processing, is precisely controlled at individual synapses and circuits, and is adaptive to the specific requirements of different sensory systems. In the auditory cortex, neurons respond to sound cessation as well as to sound itself, but how history dependence is used along this separate, "offset" information stream is unknown. We show that offset responses are more facilitatory than sound responses, even in neurons where sound responses depress. In contrast to sound onset responses, offset responses are absent in many cells, are relatively homogeneous, and show no cell type-specific differences in history dependence. Offset responses thus show unique response dynamics, suggesting their unique functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interfacing Motor Units in Nonhuman Primates Identifies a Principal Neural Component for Force Control Constrained by the Size Principle</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor units convert the last neural code of movement into muscle forces. The classic view of motor unit control is that the CNS sends common synaptic inputs to motoneuron pools and that motoneurons respond in an orderly fashion dictated by the size principle. This view, however, is in contrast with the large number of dimensions observed in motor cortex, which may allow individual and flexible control of motor units. Evidence for flexible control of motor units may be obtained by tracking motor units longitudinally during tasks with some level of behavioral variability. Here we identified and tracked populations of motor units in the brachioradialis muscle of two macaque monkeys during 10 sessions spanning &gt;1 month with a broad range of rate of force development (1.8&ndash;38.6 N &middot; m &middot; s<sup>&ndash;1</sup>). We found a very stable recruitment order and discharge characteristics of the motor units over sessions and contraction trials. The small deviations from orderly recruitment were fully predicted by the motor unit recruitment intervals, so that small shifts in recruitment thresholds happened only during contractions at a high rate of force development. Moreover, we also found that one component explained more than ~50% of the motor unit discharge rate variance, and that the remaining components represented a time-shifted version of the first. In conclusion, our results show that the recruitment of motoneurons is determined by the interplay of the size principle and common input and that this recruitment scheme is not violated over time or by the speed of the contractions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With a new noninvasive high-density electromyographic framework, we show the activity of motor unit ensembles in macaques during voluntary contractions. The discharge characteristics of brachioradialis motor units revealed a relatively fixed recruitment order and discharge characteristics across days and rate of force developments. These results were further confirmed through invasive axonal stimulation and recordings of intramuscular electromyographic activity from 16 arm muscles. The study shows for the first time the feasibility of longitudinal noninvasive motor unit interfacing and tracking of the same motor units in nonhuman primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Enhancement of Post-Sleep Visual Motion Perception by Repetitive Tactile Stimulation during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tactile sensations can bias visual perception in the awake state while visual sensitivity is known to be facilitated by sleep. It remains unknown, however, whether the tactile sensation during sleep can bias the visual improvement after sleep. Here, we performed nap experiments in human participants (<I>n</I> = 56, 18 males, 38 females) to demonstrate that repetitive tactile motion stimulation on the fingertip during slow wave sleep selectively enhanced subsequent visual motion detection. The visual improvement was associated with slow wave activity. The high activation at the high beta frequency was found in the occipital electrodes after the tactile motion stimulation during sleep, indicating a visual-tactile cross-modal interaction during sleep. Furthermore, a second experiment (<I>n</I> = 14, 14 females) to examine whether a hand- or head-centered coordination is dominant for the interpretation of tactile motion direction showed that the biasing effect on visual improvement occurs according to the hand-centered coordination. These results suggest that tactile information can be interpreted during sleep, and can induce the selective improvement of post-sleep visual motion detection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tactile sensations can bias our visual perception as a form of cross-modal interaction. However, it was reported only in the awake state. Here we show that repetitive directional tactile motion stimulation on the fingertip during slow wave sleep selectively enhanced subsequent visual motion perception. Moreover, the visual improvement was positively associated with sleep slow wave activity. The tactile motion stimulation during slow wave activity increased the activation at the high beta frequency over the occipital electrodes. The visual improvement occurred in agreement with a hand-centered reference frame. These results suggest that our sleeping brain can interpret tactile information based on a hand-centered reference frame, which can cause the sleep-dependent improvement of visual motion detection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Robust Effects of Working Memory Demand during Naturalistic Language Comprehension in Language-Selective Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>To understand language, we must infer structured meanings from real-time auditory or visual signals. Researchers have long focused on word-by-word structure building in working memory as a mechanism that might enable this feat. However, some have argued that language processing does not typically involve rich word-by-word structure building, and/or that apparent working memory effects are underlyingly driven by <I>surprisal</I> (how predictable a word is in context). Consistent with this alternative, some recent behavioral studies of naturalistic language processing that control for surprisal have not shown clear working memory effects. In this fMRI study, we investigate a range of theory-driven predictors of word-by-word working memory demand during naturalistic language comprehension in humans of both sexes under rigorous surprisal controls. In addition, we address a related debate about whether the working memory mechanisms involved in language comprehension are language specialized or domain general. To do so, in each participant, we functionally localize (1) the language-selective network and (2) the "multiple-demand" network, which supports working memory across domains. Results show robust surprisal-independent effects of memory demand in the language network and no effect of memory demand in the multiple-demand network. Our findings thus support the view that language comprehension involves computationally demanding word-by-word structure building operations in working memory, in addition to any prediction-related mechanisms. Further, these memory operations appear to be primarily conducted by the same neural resources that store linguistic knowledge, with no evidence of involvement of brain regions known to support working memory across domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study uses fMRI to investigate signatures of working memory (WM) demand during naturalistic story listening, using a broad range of theoretically motivated estimates of WM demand. Results support a strong effect of WM demand in the brain that is distinct from effects of word predictability. Further, these WM demands register primarily in language-selective regions, rather than in "multiple-demand" regions that have previously been associated with WM in nonlinguistic domains. Our findings support a core role for WM in incremental language processing, using WM resources that are specialized for language.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Data-Driven Clustering of Functional Signals Reveals Gradients in Processing Both within the Anterior Hippocampus and across Its Long Axis</a></h4>

              
                <p>A particularly elusive puzzle concerning the hippocampus is how the structural differences along its long anteroposterior axis might beget meaningful functional differences, particularly in terms of the granularity of information processing. One measure posits to quantify this granularity by calculating the average statistical independence of the BOLD signal across neighboring voxels, or intervoxel similarity (IVS), and has shown the anterior hippocampus to process coarser-grained information than the posterior hippocampus. This measure, however, has yielded opposing results in studies of developmental and healthy aging samples, which also varied in fMRI acquisition parameters and hippocampal parcellation methods. To reconcile these findings, we measured IVS across two separate resting-state fMRI acquisitions and compared the results across many of the most widely used parcellation methods in a large young-adult sample of male and female humans (Acquisition 1, <I>N</I> = 233; Acquisition 2, <I>N</I> = 176). Finding conflicting results across acquisitions and parcellations, we reasoned that a data-driven approach to hippocampal parcellation is necessary. To this end, we implemented a group masked independent components analysis to identify functional subunits of the hippocampus, most notably separating the anterior hippocampus into separate anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral components. Measuring IVS across these components revealed a decrease in IVS along the medial-lateral axis of the anterior hippocampus but an increase from anterior to posterior. We conclude that intervoxel similarity is deeply affected by parcellation and that grounding one's parcellation in a functionally informed approach might allow for a more complex and reliable characterization of the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Processing information along hierarchical scales of granularity is critical for many of the feats of cognition considered most human. Recently, the changes in structure, cortical connectivity, and apparent functional properties across parcels of the hippocampal long axis have been hypothesized to underlie this hierarchical gradient in information processing. We show here, however, that the choice of parcellation method itself drastically affects one particular measure of granularity across the hippocampus and that a functionally informed approach to parcellation reveals gradients both within the anterior hippocampus and in nonlinear form across the long axis. These results point to the issue of parcellation as a critical one in the study of the hippocampus and reorient interpretation of existing results.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Speech Understanding Oppositely Affects Acoustic and Linguistic Neural Tracking in a Speech Rate Manipulation Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                <p>When listening to continuous speech, the human brain can track features of the presented speech signal. It has been shown that neural tracking of acoustic features is a prerequisite for speech understanding and can predict speech understanding in controlled circumstances. However, the brain also tracks linguistic features of speech, which may be more directly related to speech understanding. We investigated acoustic and linguistic speech processing as a function of varying speech understanding by manipulating the speech rate. In this paradigm, acoustic and linguistic speech processing is affected simultaneously but in opposite directions: When the speech rate increases, more acoustic information per second is present. In contrast, the tracking of linguistic information becomes more challenging when speech is less intelligible at higher speech rates. We measured the EEG of 18 participants (4 male) who listened to speech at various speech rates. As expected and confirmed by the behavioral results, speech understanding decreased with increasing speech rate. Accordingly, linguistic neural tracking decreased with increasing speech rate, but acoustic neural tracking increased. This indicates that neural tracking of linguistic representations can capture the gradual effect of decreasing speech understanding. In addition, increased acoustic neural tracking does not necessarily imply better speech understanding. This suggests that, although more challenging to measure because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, linguistic neural tracking may be a more direct predictor of speech understanding.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An increasingly popular method to investigate neural speech processing is to measure neural tracking. Although much research has been done on how the brain tracks acoustic speech features, linguistic speech features have received less attention. In this study, we disentangled acoustic and linguistic characteristics of neural speech tracking via manipulating the speech rate. A proper way of objectively measuring auditory and language processing paves the way toward clinical applications: An objective measure of speech understanding would allow for behavioral-free evaluation of speech understanding, which allows to evaluate hearing loss and adjust hearing aids based on brain responses. This objective measure would benefit populations from whom obtaining behavioral measures may be complex, such as young children or people with cognitive impairments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Connectivity-Defined Subdivisions of the Intraparietal Sulcus Respond Differentially to Abstraction during Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has been implicated in numerous functions that range from representation of visual stimuli to action planning, but its role in abstract decision-making has been unclear, in part because low-level functions often act as confounds. Here, we address this problem using a task that dissociates abstract decision-making from sensory salience, attentional control, motor planning, and motor output. Functional MRI data were collected from healthy female and male human subjects while they performed a policy abstraction task requiring use of a more abstract (second-order) rule to select between two less abstract (first-order) rules that informed the motor response. By identifying IPS subdivisions with preferential connectivity to prefrontal regions that are differentially responsive to task abstraction, we found that a caudal IPS (cIPS) subregion with strongest connectivity to the pre-premotor cortex was preferentially active for second-order cues, whereas a rostral IPS subregion (rIPS) with strongest connectivity to the dorsal premotor cortex was active during attentional control over first-order cues. These effects for abstraction were seen in addition to cIPS activity that was specific to sensory salience, and rIPS activity that was specific to motor output. Notably, topographic responses to the second-order cue were detected along the caudal-rostral axis of IPS, mirroring the broader organization seen in lateral prefrontal cortex. Together, these data demonstrate that subregions within IPS exhibit activity responsive to policy abstraction, and they suggest that IPS may be organized into frontoparietal subnetworks that support hierarchical cognitive control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Abstract decision-making allows us to flexibly adapt our behavior to new contexts. Although much previous work has focused on the role of lateral prefrontal cortex in such decisions, the contributions of parietal cortex have been relatively understudied. Here, we demonstrate that spatially segregated subregions of human IPS with strong functional connections to lateral prefrontal cortex demonstrate activity selective for abstract decisions. This activity can be distinguished from responses resulting from cognitive processes related to sensory salience, attentional control, motor planning, and movement. Together, these findings indicate that different task demands are reflected in the topography of IPS, and they explicitly reveal a role in abstract decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">STAT1 Contributes to Microglial/Macrophage Inflammation and Neurological Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a plethora of inflammatory events in the brain that aggravate secondary injury and impede tissue repair. Resident microglia (Mi) and blood-borne infiltrating macrophages (M) are major players of inflammatory responses in the post-TBI brain and possess high functional heterogeneity. However, the plasticity of these cells has yet to be exploited to develop therapies that can mitigate brain inflammation and improve the outcome after TBI. This study investigated the transcription factor STAT1 as a key determinant of proinflammatory Mi/M responses and aimed to develop STAT1 as a novel therapeutic target for TBI using a controlled cortical impact model of TBI on adult male mice. TBI induced robust upregulation of STAT1 in the brain at the subacute injury stage, which occurred primarily in Mi/M. Intraperitoneal administration of fludarabine, a selective STAT1 inhibitor, markedly alleviated proinflammatory Mi/M responses and brain inflammation burden after TBI. Such phenotype-modulating effects of fludarabine on post-TBI Mi/M were reproduced by tamoxifen-induced, selective KO of STAT1 in Mi/M (STAT1 mKO). By propelling Mi/M away from a detrimental proinflammatory phenotype, STAT1 mKO was sufficient to reduce long-term neurologic deficits and brain lesion size after TBI. Importantly, short-term fludarabine treatment after TBI elicited long-lasting improvement of TBI outcomes, but this effect was lost on STAT1 mKO mice. Together, our study provided the first line of evidence that STAT1 causatively determines the proinflammatory phenotype of brain Mi/M after TBI. We also showed promising preclinical data supporting the use of fludarabine as a novel immunomodulating therapy to TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The functional phenotype of microglia and macrophages (Mi/M) critically influences brain inflammation and the outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, no therapies have been developed to modulate Mi/M functions to treat TBI. Here we report, for the first time, that the transcription factor STAT1 is a key mediator of proinflammatory Mi/M responses in the post-TBI brain, the specific deletion of which ameliorates neuroinflammation and improves long-term functional recovery after TBI. We also show excellent efficacy of a selective STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine against TBI-induced functional deficits and brain injury using a mouse model, presenting STAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ventral Hippocampal Formation Is the Primary Epileptogenic Zone in a Rat Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is common, but mechanisms of seizure initiation are unclear. We evaluated seizure initiation in female and male rats that had been systemically treated with pilocarpine, a widely used model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Local field potential (LFP) recordings from many brain regions revealed variable sites of earliest recorded seizure activity, but mostly the ventral hippocampal formation. To test whether inactivation of the ventral hippocampal formation would reduce seizures, mini-osmotic pumps were used to continually and focally deliver TTX. High doses of TTX infused unilaterally into the ventral hippocampal formation blocked seizures reversibly but also reduced LFP amplitudes in remote brain regions, indicating distant effects. A lower dose did not reduce LFP amplitudes in remote brain regions but did not reduce seizures when infused unilaterally. Instead, seizures tended to initiate in the contralateral ventral hippocampal formation. Bilateral infusion of the lower dose into the ventral hippocampal formation reduced seizure frequency 85%. Similar bilateral treatment in the amygdala was not effective. Bilateral infusion of the dorsal hippocampus reduced seizure frequency, but only 17%. Together, these findings reveal that the ventral hippocampal formation is a primary bilaterally independent epileptogenic zone, and the dorsal hippocampus is a secondary epileptogenic zone in pilocarpine-treated rats. This is consistent with many human patients, and the results further validate the LFP method for identifying seizure onset zones. Finally, the findings are more consistent with a focal mechanism of ictogenesis rather than one involving a network of interdependent nodes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To better understand how seizures start, investigators need to know where seizures start in the animal models they study. In the widely used pilocarpine-treated rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy, earliest seizure activity was most frequently recorded in the ventral hippocampal formation. Confirming the primary role of the ventral hippocampal formation, seizure frequency was reduced most effectively when it was inactivated focally, bilaterally, and continually with infused TTX. These findings suggest that the ventral hippocampal formation is the primary site of seizure initiation in this animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy, consistent with findings in many human patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of the Schizophrenia-Linked Furin Protein from Drosophila Mushroom Body Neurons Results in Antipsychotic-Reversible Habituation Deficits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Habituation is a conserved adaptive process essential for incoming information assessment, which drives the behavioral response decrement to recurrent inconsequential stimuli and does not involve sensory adaptation or fatigue. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the process are not well understood, habituation has been reported to be defective in a number of disorders including schizophrenia. We demonstrate that loss of <I>furin1</I>, the <I>Drosophila</I> homolog of a gene whose transcriptional downregulation has been linked to schizophrenia, results in defective habituation to recurrent footshocks in mixed sex populations. The deficit is reversible by transgenic expression of the <I>Drosophila</I> or human Furin in adult &alpha;'/&beta;' mushroom body neurons and by acute oral delivery of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the atypical clozapine, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenic patients. The results validate the proposed contribution of Furin downregulation in schizophrenia and suggest that defective footshock habituation is a <I>Drosophila</I> protophenotype of the human disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genome-wide association studies have revealed a number of loci linked to schizophrenia, but most have not been verified experimentally in a relevant behavioral task. Habituation deficits constitute a schizophrenia endophenotype. <I>Drosophila</I> with attenuated expression of the schizophrenia-linked highly conserved Furin gene present delayed habituation reversible with acute exposure to antipsychotics. This strongly suggests that footshock habituation defects constitute a schizophrenia protophenotype in <I>Drosophila</I>. Furthermore, determination of the neurons whose regulated activity is required for footshock habituation provides a facile metazoan system to expediently validate putative schizophrenia genes and variants in a well understood simple brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The validity and reliability test of the leprosy life quality questionnaire in leprosy patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                ackground: Leprosy is a public health problem because it potentially affects social life. In 2018, World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that Indonesia ranks third of new cases leprosy. Leprosy significantly influences patients' quality of life. Until now, there is still no specific questionnaire to assess the quality of life for leprosy patients. Leprosy Quality of Life Questionnaire (KUKUH) is a questionnaire to assess leprosy patients' quality of life, which includes questions about psychology, physical health, social environment, and treatment. The study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Leprosy Quality of Life Questionnaire (KUKUH) as a tool to assess the quality of life of leprosy patients in Indonesia.Â  Methods: The study was conducted at Saiful Anwar General Hospital in Malang, East Java. The validity analysis using construct validity with a minimum correlation coefficient value considered valid by 0.3. Internal consistency assessment for the questionnaire utilized the Cronbach Î± value where a value greater than or equal to 0.60 is acceptable, and a value greater than or equal to 0.80 is considered good.Â  Results: Based on the result of variable validity test, all items measuring each aspect have item correlation coefficient values with a total score (riT) > table correlation value (0.361). The results of reliability testing, the items that measure each aspect of the quality-of-life variable for leprosy patients have Cronbach's Alpha values greater than 0.6.Â Â  Conclusion: The validity test results of KUKUH Questionnaire are considered quite good, with a total score of 0.361 for the correlation coefficient for each question in KUKUH. The reliability test results were deemed satisfactory, with Cronbach's alpha > 0.6. The KUKUH questionnaire can be used to evaluate the quality of life of leprosy patients in Indonesia.

                Background: Abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia due to uterine myomas is a health problem affecting womenâs quality of life and it is considered a frequent cause of emergency visits for women. If first line medication fails to treat symptoms, surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy could be indicated, which could interfere with women's physical, social, emotional, and material quality of life. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of a mixture of two medicinal plants, Mentha pulegium L and Artemisia abrotanum L, on 13 women with menometrorrhagia, who were candidates for hysterectomy. Methods: The herbs were taken as a tea infusion by the oral route. A total of 5 g of the dried aerial parts of the mixture were added to 100 ml of boiling water and the tea infusion was taken three times a day starting from the onset of menstruation for three consecutive days, and it was repeated for three consecutive months. Results: The study results showed that 10 out of the 13 women involved avoided the surgical procedures. The mean number of bleeding days declined from 11.50 (Â±3.77) at baseline to 7.60 (Â±2.11) (p=0.01). Participants confirmed a change in the bleeding intensity, regularization of their menstrual cycle, and improvement in their quality of life. Conclusions: This preliminary study explores a new approach to treat abnormal uterine bleeding- menometrorrhagia, based on tea infusion consumption of a mixture of two medicinal herbs, and it paves the way for future studies. Trial registration: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05406960 (07/06/2022).

                Background: Bloodstream infection (BSI) contributes to a substantial proportion of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and is marked by the presence of bacterial and/or fungal microorganisms in the blood. Because BSI can be life threatening, it requires a timely, reliable and accurate diagnosis. This study retrospectively analyzed data of identified BSI pathogens and compared the performance of the different diagnostic technologies used in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, turnaround time (TAT) and cost. Methods: Currently, culture followed by analytical profile index biochemical strips (API), (BioMerieux) are used as the conventional standard diagnostics in Kenyan public hospitals and labs. We compared the results of this standard to that of the BioFire FilmArray (FA) (BioFire Diagnostics) and MicroScan WalkAway-40 plus System (MS) (Beckman Coulter) used in diagnosis of BSI.Â The FA technology was able to identify 150/152 bacterial and yeast isolates with an overall accuracy of 99.04% (95% CI: 96.59-99.88%), sensitivity of 98.68% (95% CI: 95.33-99.84%), mean TAT of 8 hours 40 minutes per eight samples and running cost per sample of USD 140.11. The MS identified 150/152 isolates with an overall accuracy of 98.56% (95% CI: 95.86-99.70%), sensitivity of 98.68% (95% CI: 95.30-99.84%), mean TAT per sample was 42 hours and running cost per sample of USD 28.05. API detected 150/152 isolates, with an overall accuracy of 99.04% (95% CI: 96.59-99.88%), sensitivity of 98.68% (95% CI: 95.33-99.84%) and the mean TAT per sample was 53 and 103 hours for bacterial and yeast samples, respectively, with a running cost per sample of USD 28.05.Conclusions: The findings in this paper suggest that the FA and MS platforms should be able to perform adequately in Kenya referral hospitals and medical clinics as a rapid diagnostic tool.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Implantation of guide cannulas is a widely used technique to access specific brain areas. Although commercially available, the need to personalize these implants and the high cost prompted us to design open-source customized devices taking advantage of 3D printing technology. Our cannulas consisted in a 3D-printed head mount designed according to the Paxinos coordinates to reach the CA1 area of the hippocampus. To cut guide cannulas to the proper length, we designed and realized an original 3D-printed linear motion apparatus. Polylactic acid thermoplastic polymer was used as printing material. Homemade or commercial cannulas were implanted in 4- to 6-month-old wild-type mice and intrahippocampal injections of amyloid-&beta; peptide at different concentrations were performed. <I>In vivo</I> behavioral studies of novel object recognition indicated that results obtained with homemade versus commercial devices were comparable. Methylene blue injections and Nissl staining confirmed the correct localization of cannulas in the CA1 area of mouse hippocampus. Our method allows a fast manufacturing of hippocampal cannulas preserving the required precision at very low cost. Furthermore, this system can be easily modified to produce cannulas to target other brain areas. In conclusion, 3D printing might be used as a useful and versatile technology to realize open-source customized devices in neuroscience laboratories.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pregnancy is associated with extraordinary plasticity in the maternal brain. Studies in humans and other mammals suggest extensive structural and functional remodeling of the female brain during and after pregnancy. However, we understand remarkably little about the molecular underpinnings of this natural phenomenon. To gain insight into pregnancy-associated hippocampal plasticity, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and snATAC-seq from the mouse hippocampus before, during, and after pregnancy. We identified cell type-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures associated with pregnancy and postpartum adaptation. In addition, we analyzed receptor-ligand interactions and transcription factor (TF) motifs that inform hippocampal cell type identity and provide evidence of pregnancy-associated adaption. In total, these data provide a unique resource of coupled transcriptional and epigenetic data across a dynamic time period in the mouse hippocampus and suggest opportunities for functional interrogation of hormone-mediated plasticity.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Goal-tracking (GT) rats are sensitive to Pavlovian outcome devaluation while sign-tracking (ST) rats are devaluation insensitive. During outcome devaluation, GT rats flexibly modify responding to cues based on the current value of the associated outcome. However, ST rats rigidly respond to cues regardless of the current outcome value. Prior work demonstrated disconnection of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and anterior insular cortex (aIC) decreased both GT and ST behaviors. Given the role of these regions in appetitive motivation and behavioral flexibility, we predicted that disrupting BLA to aIC pathway during outcome devaluation would reduce flexibility in GT rats and reduce rigid appetitive motivation in ST rats. We inhibited the BLA to aIC pathway by infusing inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di-mcherry) or control (mCherry) virus into the BLA and implanted cannulae into the aIC to inhibit BLA terminals using intracranial injections of clozapine N-oxide (CNO). After training, we used a within<b>-</b>subject satiety-induced outcome devaluation procedure in which we sated rats on training pellets (devalued condition) or homecage chow (valued condition). All rats received bilateral CNO infusions into the aIC before brief nonreinforced test sessions. Contrary to our hypothesis, BLA-IC inhibition did not interfere with devaluation sensitivity in GT rats but did make ST behaviors sensitive to devaluation. Intermediate rats showed the opposite effect, showing rigid responding to cues with BLA-aIC pathway inactivation. Together, these results demonstrate BLA-IC projections mediate tracking-specific Pavlovian devaluation sensitivity and highlights the importance of considering individual differences in Pavlovian approach when evaluating circuitry contributions to behavioral flexibility.</p>

Commercial options frequently come at high financial cost that prohibits scalability and throughput, whereas DIY solutions often require significant expertise and time investment unaffordable to many researchers. To address this, we combined a low-cost Raspberry Pi microcomputer, DIY electronics peripherals, freely available open-source firmware, and custom 3D-printed casings to create Pi USB Cam, a simple yet powerful and highly versatile video recording solution. Pi USB Cam is constructed using affordable and widely available components and requires no expertise to build and implement. The result is a system that functions as a plug-and-play USB camera that can be easily installed in various animal testing and housing sites and is readily compatible with popular behavioral and neural recording software. Here, we provide a comprehensive parts list and step-by-step instructions for users to build and implement their own Pi USB Cam system. In a series of benchmark comparisons, Pi USB Cam was able to capture ultra-wide fields of view of behaving rats given limited object distance and produced high image quality while maintaining consistent frame rates even under low-light and no-light conditions relative to a standard, commercially available USB camera. Video recordings were easily scaled using free, open-source software. Altogether, Pi USB Cam presents an elegant yet simple solution for behavioral neuroscientists seeking an affordable and highly flexible system to enable quality video recordings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Phytochemical profiling of Piper crocatum and its antifungal activity as Lanosterol 14Â alpha demethylase CYP51 inhibitor: a review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mycoses or fungal infections are a general health problem that often occurs in healthy and immunocompromised people in the community. The development of resistant strains in Fungi and the incidence of azole antibiotic resistance in the Asia Pacific which reached 83% become a critical problem nowadays. To control fungal infections, substances and extracts isolated from natural resources, especially in the form of plants as the main sources of drug molecules today, are needed. Especially from Piperaceae, which have long been used in India, China, and Korea to treat human ailments in traditional medicine. The purpose of this review was to describe antifungal activity from Piper crocatum and its phytochemical profiling against lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase CYP51. The methods used search databases from Google Scholar to find the appropriate databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram as a clinical information retrieval method. From 1,150,000 results search by database, there were 73 selected articles to review. The review shows that P. crocatum contains flavonoids, tannins, terpenes, saponins, polyphenols, eugenol, alkaloids, quinones, chavibetol acetate, glycosides, triterpenoids or steroids, hydroxychavikol, phenolics, glucosides, isoprenoids, and non-protein amino acids. Its antifungal mechanisms in fungal cells occur due to ergosterol especially lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase CYP51 inhibition as a result of 5,6 desaturase (ERG3) downregulation. P. crocatum has an antifungal activity by its phytochemical profiling that act against fungi by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome P 450 pathway, make damaging cell membranes, fungal growth inhibition, morphological changes, and fungal cell lysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigation of knowledge management and firm competitiveness: core competence as a mediator [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of the current study is to empirically investigate interrelationships among three variables; knowledge management (KM), core competence (CC), and firm competitiveness (FC), and to develop a framework based on empirical evidence for developing countries in South Asia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional quantitative study using the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) enlisted manufacturing and service organizations having a sample size of 136 companies. A questionnaire was self-administered to the respondents by executing a comprehensive strategy to get a high response rate. A total of 201 valid and complete responses from four manufacturing (automobiles, food & cosmetics, textile, and pharmaceutical) and one service organization (banks) were received using a Likert scale of five points in the questionnaire to examine the subject agreement level against statements. All hypothesized relationships were analyzed by employing SEM using AMOS ver. 20. Results: Results of the study confirmed the positive and significant influence of four constructs of knowledge management processes on four constructs of firm competitiveness (innovation, delivery, quality, and financial performance). Further, knowledge management significantly impacts the firm's competitiveness through the mediation of technology, organization and people (TOP) core competence. The findings also supported that managing the intangible resource of the organization can influence the firm's competitiveness and resource-based TOP competence. Conclusions: The SEM analysis confirmed all hypothetical relationships and supported the knowledge management's direct and indirect effects through core competence on firm competitiveness. The findings showed that the effectiveness of knowledge management will increase the organizations' competitiveness in developing countries' research perspective.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Abnormal CT findings among patients with abdominal pain in the radiology department of a tertiary care center [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Abdominal pain is a common symptom in people of different ages due to various benign and life-threatening causes. Imaging studies, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, explore the clinical reasons behind this pain to prevent delayed diagnosis. Owing to abnormal findings, timely identification of the exact cause of abdominal pain is important in most diseases so treatment can be started earlier, but it has not yet been studied, making this research novel. This study was conducted to identify the prevalence of abnormal CT scan findings among referred patients with abdominal pain and to confirm or determine other diagnoses compared to other imaging modalities in the Emergency Department (ED). Methods: This observational retrospective study was conducted at the King Fahad Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Qassim. We included 2,144 patients who visited the ED and underwent abdominal CT scans between January 2021 and January 2022. Data on age, sex, CT findings, and results from other imaging modalities were collected from the Radiology Department. Results: We found that 2,144 patients referred from the ED to the Radiology Department complained of acute abdominal pain in 2021 for CT diagnosis. Approximately 28.2% of these patients had normal CT diagnoses. The average age at normal CT diagnosis was 38.6 years old. While 52% of CT diagnoses were abnormal, including obstructive ureteric stone (435, 20.3%), appendicitis (205, 9.6%), bowel obstruction (51, 2.4%), renal cancer (27, 1.3%), ovarian cancer (25, 1.2%), and obstructive bladder stone (25, 1.2%), with an average age of 40.4 years old, and 19% with accidental findings. Conclusions: Most of the cases with abdominal pain showed abnormal results in the CT scan. These results demonstrate the sole inefficiency of CT scan for the diagnosis of abdominal pain. So, clinical evaluations should be used together with abdominal ultrasonography to perform a timely and exact diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Correcting motion induced fluorescence artifacts in two-channel neural imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew S. Creamer, Kevin S. Chen, Andrew M. Leifer, Jonathan W. Pillow</p>

Imaging neural activity in a behaving animal presents unique challenges in part because motion from an animalâs movement creates artifacts in fluorescence intensity time-series that are difficult to distinguish from neural signals of interest. One approach to mitigating these artifacts is to image two channels simultaneously: one that captures an activity-dependent fluorophore, such as GCaMP, and another that captures an activity-independent fluorophore such as RFP. Because the activity-independent channel contains the same motion artifacts as the activity-dependent channel, but no neural signals, the two together can be used to identify and remove the artifacts. However, existing approaches for this correction, such as taking the ratio of the two channels, do not account for channel-independent noise in the measured fluorescence. Here, we present Two-channel Motion Artifact Correction (TMAC), a method which seeks to remove artifacts by specifying a generative model of the two channel fluorescence that incorporates motion artifact, neural activity, and noise. We use Bayesian inference to infer latent neural activity under this model, thus reducing the motion artifact present in the measured fluorescence traces. We further present a novel method for evaluating ground-truth performance of motion correction algorithms by comparing the decodability of behavior from two types of neural recordings; a recording that had both an activity-dependent fluorophore and an activity-independent fluorophore (GCaMP and RFP) and a recording where both fluorophores were activity-independent (GFP and RFP). A successful motion correction method should decode behavior from the first type of recording, but not the second. We use this metric to systematically compare five models for removing motion artifacts from fluorescent time traces. We decode locomotion from a GCaMP expressing animal 20x more accurately on average than from control when using TMAC inferred activity and outperforms all other methods of motion correction tested, the best of which were ~8x more accurate than control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Towards reliable quantification of cell state velocities</a></h4>

A few years ago, it was proposed to use the simultaneous quantification of unspliced and spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) to add a temporal dimension to high-throughput snapshots of single cell RNA sequencing data. This concept can yield additional insight into the transcriptional dynamics of the biological systems under study. However, current methods for inferring cell state velocities from such data (known as RNA velocities) are afflicted by several theoretical and computational problems, hindering realistic and reliable velocity estimation. We discuss these issues and propose new solutions for addressing some of the current challenges in consistency of data processing, velocity inference and visualisation. We translate our computational conclusion in two velocity analysis tools: one detailed method <i>Îº</i>-velo and one heuristic method eco-velo, each of which uses a different set of assumptions about the data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Low levels of tetracyclines select for a mutation that prevents the evolution of high-level resistance to tigecycline</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Jagdmann, Dan I. Andersson, HervÃ© Nicoloff</p>

In a collection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolates, we discovered a new mechanism leading to frequent and high-level tigecycline resistance involving tandem gene amplifications of an efflux pump encoded by the <i>tet</i>(A) determinant. Some isolates, despite carrying a functional <i>tet</i>(A), could not evolve high-level tigecycline resistance by amplification due to the presence of a deletion in the TetR(A) repressor. This mutation impaired induction of <i>tetA</i>(A) (encoding the TetA(A) efflux pump) in presence of tetracyclines, with the strongest effect observed for tigecycline, subsequently preventing the development of <i>tet</i>(A) amplification-dependent high-level tigecycline resistance. We found that this mutated <i>tet</i>(A) determinant was common among <i>tet</i>(A)-carrying <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> isolates and analysed possible explanations for this high frequency. First, while the mutated <i>tet</i>(A) was found in several ST-groups, we found evidence of clonal spread among ST131 isolates, which increases its frequency within <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> databases. Second, evolution and competition experiments revealed that the mutation in <i>tetR</i>(A) could be positively selected over the wild-type allele at sub-inhibitory concentrations of tetracyclines. Our work demonstrates how low concentrations of tetracyclines, such as those found in contaminated environments, can enrich and select for a mutation that generates an evolutionary dead-end that precludes the evolution towards high-level, clinically relevant tigecycline resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Delivery of ceramide phosphoethanolamine lipids to the cleavage furrow through the endocytic pathway is essential for male meiotic cytokinesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Govind Kunduri, Si-Hung Le, Valentina Baena, Nagampalli Vijaykrishna, Adam Harned, Kunio Nagashima, Daniel Blankenberg, Izumi Yoshihiro, Kedar Narayan, Takeshi Bamba, Usha Acharya, Jairaj K. Acharya</p>

Cell division, wherein 1 cell divides into 2 daughter cells, is fundamental to all living organisms. Cytokinesis, the final step in cell division, begins with the formation of an actomyosin contractile ring, positioned midway between the segregated chromosomes. Constriction of the ring with concomitant membrane deposition in a specified spatiotemporal manner generates a cleavage furrow that physically separates the cytoplasm. Unique lipids with specific biophysical properties have been shown to localize to intercellular bridges (also called midbody) connecting the 2 dividing cells; however, their biological roles and delivery mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE), the structural analog of sphingomyelin, has unique acyl chain anchors in <i>Drosophila</i> spermatocytes and is essential for meiotic cytokinesis. The head group of CPE is also important for spermatogenesis. We find that aberrant central spindle and contractile ring behavior but not mislocalization of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) at the plasma membrane is responsible for the male meiotic cytokinesis defect in CPE-deficient animals. Further, we demonstrate the enrichment of CPE in multivesicular bodies marked by Rab7, which in turn localize to cleavage furrow. Volume electron microscopy analysis using correlative light and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy shows that CPE-enriched Rab7 positive endosomes are juxtaposed on contractile ring material. Correlative light and transmission electron microscopy reveal Rab7 positive endosomes as a multivesicular body-like organelle that releases its intraluminal vesicles in the vicinity of ingressing furrows. Genetic ablation of Rab7 or Rab35 or expression of dominant negative Rab11 results in significant meiotic cytokinesis defects. Further, we show that Rab11 function is required for localization of CPE positive endosomes to the cleavage furrow. Our results imply that endosomal delivery of CPE to ingressing membranes is crucial for meiotic cytokinesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medication-related burden among patients with diabetes mellitus and its relation to diabetic control parameters: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) refers to a group of metabolic abnormalities that are linked with significant morbidity, death, and health-care costs. Management options for patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes are growing more complicated, which may result in a therapeutic burden for patients. The purpose of this research was to quantify the forms of concerns diabetic individuals have with medication that influence overall burden, as well as to examine the sociodemographic and clinical factors linked with negative medication use experiences and increased levels of burden. Methods: Â The present research was a cross-sectional study of diagnosed diabetes patients who attended the Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes between 1st of December 2021 and 30th April 2022 in Baghdad, Iraq. The Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ) was used to assess medication-related burden (MRB). Results: The study recruited 193 patients with diabetes mellitus. The participants were adults with an average age of 50Â±15 years. More than half (52.8%) of the participating patients were women, and more than half (51.3%) also had one or more other chronic diseases. Additionally, 23.3% of patients had polypharmacy (â¥ 5 medications). More than one-third had diabetes complications: neuropathy (45.6%) or retinopathy (38.9%). The mean LMQ score was (122.8Â±15.5). The research revealed that most of the DM patients experienced a moderate degree of medication burden (72.5%), followed by high burden (14.5%), minimum burden (12.4%), and no burden at all (0.5%) with no patient experiencing extremely high burden (0.0 %). Patients with uncontrolled blood glucose (high HbA1c), neuropathy, or retinopathy had a significantly higher medication burden. Conclusions: The MRB among diabetic patients is at a very high level. This information may be helpful to health care professionals and policymakers seeking to understand MRB for patients with diabetes. Future studies should focus on developing interventions that help reduce such burdens.

                Background: In India, the number of patients with type II diabetes mellitus in 2006 was 40.9 million and is expected to increase by 2025 to 69.9 million. Annually 1,00,000 new patients get diagnosed with End-Stage Renal Disease and require maintenance dialysis. Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension were the usual triggers of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). A structured education program helps in the prevention of diabetes and hypertension related complications.Â  Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted among 88 participants who had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or both for five or more years with an objective to find the effect of a Disease Management Program on delaying progression of CKD in patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus.Â  Â The baseline data were collected on demographic proforma, serum creatinine, blood pressure, and random blood sugar, and the patients were taught the management of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In the fourth and the eighth month, blood pressure and blood sugar were reassessed. At one-year blood pressure, blood sugar, and serum creatinine were tested. Baseline and one-year follow-up blood pressure, blood sugar, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate were compared. Descriptive statistics and "Wilcoxon signed-rank test" were used to analyze the data.Â Â  Â Results: In one year, the mean systolic blood pressure reduced by six mm of Hg and mean blood sugar by 24 mg/dl. The prevalence of CKD stage three and above (< 60 ml/min/m2) was nine (10.22%). The median decline in eGFR was 5 ml/min/m2 (Z= 5.925, P< 0.001).Â  Conclusion: The Disease Management Program led to improvements in blood pressure and diabetes control and median progression of CKD was estimated at five ml/min/m2/year.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the increasing number of genes associated with CharcotâMarie-Tooth (CMT) disease, many patients currently still lack appropriate genetic diagnosis for this disease. Autosomal dominant mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) have been implicated in CMT. Here, we describe causal missense mutations in the gene encoding seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 (<i>SerRS</i>) for 3 families affected with CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 16 patients and 14 unaffected members of 3 unrelated families. The functional impact of the genetic variants identified was investigated using bioinformatic prediction tools and confirmed using cellular and biochemical assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Combined linkage analysis for the 3 families revealed significant linkage (Zmax LODÂ =Â 6.9) between the genomic co-ordinates on chromosome 1: 108681600â110300504. Within the linkage region, heterozygous <i>SerRS</i> missense variants segregated with the clinical phenotype in the 3 families. The mutant SerRS proteins exhibited reduced aminoacylation activity and abnormal SerRS dimerization, which suggests the impairment of total protein synthesis and induction of eIF2Î± phosphorylation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest the heterozygous <i>SerRS</i> variants identified represent a novel cause for autosomal dominant CMT. Mutant SerRS proteins are known to impact various molecular and cellular functions. Our findings provide significant advances on the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with ARS-related CMT. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">On climate order: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Climate change, largely triggered by human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, seems unstoppable. There was a strong rebound of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, the preponderant GHG in terms of contribution to global warming, around the world after the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, there is still no widely accepted international treaty on curbing the anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and N2O, the second and third predominant GHG, respectively, so far. Thereby, prima facie, in respect to mitigating climate change, currently, humans have no aces up their sleeves. It seems that current temperature rise is not high enough to take alarm until the occurrence of tipping point. Policy: Climate-related international treaties, such as 2016 Paris agreement, are compromises among conflicting geopolitical pressures. However, currently, the climate treaties show little mandatory binding force on the signatories who are able to violate and then get off scot-free, thus may end up like a nostrum. Throughout the European history, I find that the only way, if at all, to achieve the peace or obedience of a treaty is via balancing powers, embodied in Bismarckâs Realpolitik of Germany and Richelieuâs Raison d'Ã©tat of France. Similarly, the Chinese history in East Asia proved the significance of unadulterated ideological neutrality and Darwinian adaptability in the kaleidoscope of evolving circumstances in maintaining order and enforcement of international treaties through balancing the power of rivalries to constrain ever-recurring challengers for equilibrium. Recommendations: A successful policy needs to make a thorough analysis of all relevant factors to form a long-term strategic notion. Then, statesmen need to distill an array of nebulous, always contradictory options into a tenacious, controllable direction. Thereby, I suggest that, for better curbing global warming, climate agreements or climate club be incorporated into an overall geopolitical framework among the international communities.

                Crude oil pollution is an endemic environmental problem in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with background pollution levels greater than the regulatory intervention limit of 5000mg/kg of soil as stipulated in the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN) in most polluted sites. Hence, the essence of this study was to evaluate the extent of damage caused by the pollutant (crude oil hydrocarbons) on the soil physicochemical parameters and microbial communities as well as to determine pollution effects on soil microbial ecosystem services. The soil microbial community composition, diversity, functional genes, and metabolic pathways were studied to evaluate the pollutant effect on soil microbiomes and their ability to utilize petroleum hydrocarbons as carbon and energy sources. Two sites Bodo (N4.620134, 7.282998E) and Ngia-Ama Tombia (N4.9816667; 7.0608333E) were chosen for the study. The America standard testing methods (ASTM International) were used in measuring physicochemical parameters of the soil influencing microbial response and pollutant behavior in the soil environment. Soil pH was measured using a pH meter, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) using gas chromatography with a mass spectrophotometer (GC-MS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (ASTM D5412-93(2017) e1), Heavy metals analysis (ASTM D8404-21), soil texture (ASTM D6913/D6913M-17). Shotgun metagenomic analysis was used to determine microbial community composition, following âDNA extractionâ, library preparation (NexteraÂ®Â DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and sequencing using Illuminana NovaSeqÂ® 6000. The results were analyzed using bioinformatics pipelines. The sequences generated were deposited in the European nucleotide Archive (ENA) with project accession number PRJEB53529.

                Chae, Banerjee, et al. identify distinct feedback loops mediated by the mouse olfactory bulb outputs (mitral and tufted cells) and their preferred cortical targets. They suggest that in addition to the mitral-to-piriform cortex pathway, the non-canonical tufted-to-anterior olfactory nucleus pathway is ideally placed for decoding odor identity and intensity.

                Zika virus (ZIKV) infects parallel neural progenitor cell populations in the developing brain and in glioblastoma brain tumors. Bulstrode etÂ al. demonstrate that interferon secretion by human brain myeloid cells can render each neural progenitor population refractory to ZIKV infection, with important implications for neuroprotection and viral oncolysis.

                SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades most neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies and is associated with lower antibody titers upon breakthrough infections than previous variants. Tubiana et al. investigate the underlying mechanism using geometric deep learning, mice immunization experiments and biochemical assays. Mutations reduce antigenicity of the receptor binding site, leading to lower antibody response.
