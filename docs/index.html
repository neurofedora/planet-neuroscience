              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of cytokine production capacity in ancient and modern European populations</a></h4>

              
                As our ancestors migrated throughout different continents, natural selection increased the presence of alleles advantageous in the new environments. Heritable variations that alter the susceptibility to diseases vary with the historical period, the virulence of the infections, and their geographical spread. In this study we built polygenic scores for heritable traits that influence the genetic adaptation in the production of cytokines and immune-mediated disorders, including infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, and applied them to the genomes of several ancient European populations. We observed that the advent of the Neolithic was a turning point for immune-mediated traits in Europeans, favoring those alleles linked with the development of tolerance against intracellular pathogens and promoting inflammatory responses against extracellular microbes. These evolutionary patterns are also associated with an increased presence of traits related to inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution of strategy in bacterial warfare via the regulation of bacteriocins and antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria inhibit and kill one another with a diverse array of compounds, including bacteriocins and antibiotics. These attacks are highly regulated, but we lack a clear understanding of the evolutionary logic underlying this regulation. Here, we combine a detailed dynamic model of bacterial competition with evolutionary game theory to study the rules of bacterial warfare. We model a large range of possible combat strategies based upon the molecular biology of bacterial regulatory networks. Our model predicts that regulated strategies, which use quorum sensing or stress responses to regulate toxin production, will readily evolve as they outcompete constitutive toxin production. Amongst regulated strategies, we show that a particularly successful strategy is to upregulate toxin production in response to an incoming competitor’s toxin, which can be achieved via stress responses that detect cell damage (competition sensing). Mirroring classical game theory, our work suggests a fundamental advantage to reciprocation. However, in contrast to classical results, we argue that reciprocation in bacteria serves not to promote peaceful outcomes but to enable efficient and effective attacks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancient role of sulfakinin/cholecystokinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm</a></h4>

              
                Sulfakinin (SK)/cholecystokinin (CCK)-type neuropeptides regulate feeding and digestion in protostomes (e.g. insects) and chordates. Here, we characterised SK/CCK-type signalling for the first time in a non-chordate deuterostome – the starfish <i>Asterias rubens</i> (phylum Echinodermata). In this species, two neuropeptides (ArSK/CCK1, ArSK/CCK2) derived from the precursor protein ArSK/CCKP act as ligands for an SK/CCK-type receptor (ArSK/CCKR) and these peptides/proteins are expressed in the nervous system, digestive system, tube feet, and body wall. Furthermore, ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 cause dose-dependent contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot, and apical muscle preparations in vitro, and injection of these neuropeptides in vivo triggers cardiac stomach retraction and inhibition of the onset of feeding in <i>A. rubens</i>. Thus, an evolutionarily ancient role of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides as inhibitory regulators of feeding-related processes in the Bilateria has been conserved in the unusual and unique context of the extra-oral feeding behaviour and pentaradial body plan of an echinoderm.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Separable neural signatures of confidence during perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual confidence is an evaluation of the validity of perceptual decisions. While there is behavioural evidence that confidence evaluation differs from perceptual decision-making, disentangling these two processes remains a challenge at the neural level. Here, we examined the electrical brain activity of human participants in a protracted perceptual decision-making task where observers tend to commit to perceptual decisions early whilst continuing to monitor sensory evidence for evaluating confidence. Premature decision commitments were revealed by patterns of spectral power overlying motor cortex, followed by an attenuation of the neural representation of perceptual decision evidence. A distinct neural representation was associated with the computation of confidence, with sources localised in the superior parietal and orbitofrontal cortices. In agreement with a dissociation between perception and confidence, these neural resources were recruited even after observers committed to their perceptual decisions, and thus delineate an integral neural circuit for evaluating perceptual decision confidence.

     alt="Neuronal deficiency of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α increases hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal mice"/>
<p>Using CaMKIIαCre and floxed-HIF-2α mice, we generated mice with specific deletion of HIF-2α gene in the forebrain neurons. We showed that neuronal deficiency of HIF-2α increased cell death and brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia suggesting its involvement in neuroprotection.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cellular responses to hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are governed largely by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors. Our previous studies show that HIF-1α induction is an important factor that mediates protective effects in the brain after neonatal HI. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of another closely related HIF α isoform, HIF-2α, specifically the neuronal HIF-2α, to brain HI injury. Homozygous transgenic mice with a floxed exon 2 of HIF-2α were bred with CaMKIIα-Cre mice to generate a mouse line with selective deletion of HIF-2α in forebrain neurons. These mice, along with their wildtype littermates, were subjected to HI at postnatal day 9. Brain injury at different ages was evaluated by the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and spectrin breakdown products at 24 hr; and histologically at 6 days or 3 months after HI. Multiple behavioral tests were performed at 3 months, prior to sacrifice. Loss of neuronal HIF-2α exacerbated brain injury during the acute (24 hr) and subacute phases (6 days), with a trend toward more severe volume loss in the adult brain. The long-term brain function for coordinated movement and recognition memory, however, were not impacted in the neuronal HIF-2α deficient mice. Our data suggest that, similar to HIF-1α, neuronal HIF-2α promotes cell survival in the immature mouse brain. The two HIF alpha isoforms may act through partially overlapping or distinct transcriptional targets to mediate their intrinsic protective responses against neonatal HI brain injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Accidental firearm fatality during trophy hunting in Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Possession of a firearm without a certified valid license is against Nepalese law. After the civil war, the government issued a stringent rule of not allowing the public to keep firearms without a valid reason, despite having a license. However, there are still people who keep firearms in their homes. The present case reports the accidental death of a teenage boy who used a musket for hunting a wild animal. The present case highlights the fact that despite the stringent law, illegal possession of arms for trophy hunting is still prevalent in rural Nepal. Furthermore, this study aims to highlight the importance of paramedics in early intervention, stabilization and transport of the sick and injured to the hospital in emergency situations. Recruitment of paramedics in the ambulance service might prevent untimely death in many patients while being transported to the hospital which was lacking in the present case.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ethics issues identified by applicants and ethics experts in Horizon 2020 grant proposals [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We assessed the ethics review of proposals selected for funding under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and the European Research Council (ERC) in Horizon 2020, EU’s framework programme for research and innovation, 2014-2020. Methods: We analysed anonymized datasets for 3,054 MSCA individual fellowships (IF), 417 MSCA Innovative Training Networks (ITN), and 1,465 ERC main-listed proposals with ethics conditional clearance, over four years (2016 to 2019). The datasets included the information on ethics issues identified by applicants in their proposal and ethics issues and requirements identified by ethics experts during the ethics review. Results: 42% of proposals received ethical clearance. For proposals with conditional ethics clearance (n=3546), most of the identified ethics issues by both applicants and ethics experts were in the ethics categories related to humans; protection of personal data; environment, health and safety; and non-EU countries. Ethics experts identified twice as many ethics issues compared to applicants across funding schemes, years, and from high- and low-research performing countries. ERC grants had the highest number of ethics requirements per proposal (median (Md)=8, interquartile range (IQR=4-14), compared to ITN (Md=6, IQR=3-13) and IF grants (Md=3, IQR=2-6). The majority of requirements had to be fulfilled after grant agreement: 99.4% for IF, 99.5% for ITN, and 26.0% for ERC. For 9% of the proposals, the requirements included the appointment of an independent ethics advisor and 1% of the proposals had to appoint an ethics advisory board. Conclusions: Many applicants for highly competitive H2020 funding schemes lack awareness of ethics issues raised by their proposed research. There is a need for better training of researchers at all career stages about ethics issues in research, more support to researchers from research organizations to follow the funding agencies requirements, as well as further development and harmonization of the ethics appraisal process during grant assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bridging skill gaps and creating future ready accounting and finance graduates: an exploratory study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Changing trends in the use of technology have become an impelling force to be reckoned with for the accounting and finance profession. The curriculum offered in higher learning institutions must be quickly revamped so that students who complete a bachelor’s degree are digitally competent upon graduation. With US$55.3 billion invested in FinTech in 2019 alone and more than 72% of accounting jobs being automated, graduates must be trained on digital skills to be future proof. Accounting and finance graduates must be made competent in skills that are related to digital content such as blockchain technology, information assets and autonomous peer to peer systems, to name a few. Methods: We used a three-phase approach: 1) careful mapping of digital topics taught within the course structure offered at these institutions; 2) review of current best practices and digital learning tools for digital inclusion which was ascertained from literature; and 3) 80 experts in a think tank group were interviewed on antecedents, awareness and problems in relation to digital inclusion within the curriculum to validate our research objective. Results: Eleven key tools for inclusion in the curriculum were discussed with experts and then mapped to current curriculum offered at institutions. We discovered that less than 5% of these were being taught. In total, 78% of experts agreed that digital content is inevitable, 90% agreed that digital inclusion based on tools that were discussed will yield great benefits for students, and lastly 75% agreed that giving digital exposure to students must be standard practice. Conclusions: The response from experts confirms that digital inclusion is imperative, but instructors themselves lacked the know-how of emerging technologies. Only the curriculum of institutions with approved bachelor’s programs were included in this research. In our future work we hope to include all institutions and professional bodies as well.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Discrimination of the SARS–CoV-2 strains using of coloured s-LASCA-imaging of GB-speckles, developed for the gene “S” nucleotide sequences [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A recent bioinformatics technique involves changing nucleotide sequences into 2D speckles. This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics.   Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene «S») of SARS–CoV-2 gene as the molecular target.    Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.    Conclusion: The high effectiveness of an application of the colour images of GB-speckles that were generated by s-LASCA- has been demonstrated for discrimination between different variants of the SARS–CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attrition of methylnaltrexone treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with chronic noncancer pain and opioid-induced constipation: a post hoc pooled analysis of two clinical trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Opioids prescribed for the management of chronic noncancer pain are associated with nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist, has demonstrated robust efficacy and was well-tolerated in treating opioid-induced constipation without affecting central analgesia. Our objective was to assess changes in the frequency of adverse events after the first or second dose of methylnaltrexone or placebo. Methods: This post hoc analysis pooled data from two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials assessing methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation in the outpatient setting. Patients received subcutaneous methylnaltrexone (12 mg once daily or 12 mg once every other day), oral methylnaltrexone (150, 300, or 450 mg daily), or placebo. Adverse events, opioid withdrawal symptoms, pain intensity, and rescue-free bowel movements (RFBMs) within 4 hours of the first dose (i.e., RFBM responders) were assessed. Associations between adverse event frequencies and RFBM response were also evaluated. Results: The analysis included 1263 adult patients with chronic noncancer pain. Treatment-emergent adverse event rates declined from treatment day 1 to 2 (methylnaltrexone: 16.2%–5.3%; placebo: 6.6%−5.4%). Among methylnaltrexone-treated patients, significantly greater proportions of RFBM responders versus nonresponders reported gastrointestinal adverse events on day 1. No associations between RFBM response and the frequency of adverse events were observed in the placebo group. No meaningful changes in opioid withdrawal symptoms or pain intensity were observed. Conclusions: Early-onset adverse events following methylnaltrexone treatment, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, are at least partially due to laxation. Methylnaltrexone treatment effectively relieves opioid-induced constipation without affecting the central analgesic effects of opioids.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vasoactive agents in acute mesenteric ischaemia in critical care.  A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a surgical emergency which has an associated high mortality.  The mainstay of active treatment includes early surgical intervention, with resection of non-viable bowel, and revascularisation of the ischaemic bowel where possible. Due to the physiological insult of AMI however, perioperative care often involves critical care and the use of vasoactive agents to optimise end organ perfusion. A number of these vasoactive agents are currently available with varied mechanism of action and effects on splanchnic blood flow. However, specific guidance on which is the optimal vasoactive drug to use in these settings is limited. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current evidence comparing vasoactive drugs in AMI. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review was performed on the 5th of November 2020 to identify randomised clinical trials comparing different vasoactive agents in AMI on outcomes including mortality. The search was performed through the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSEng) search support library. Results were analysed using the Rayyan platform, and independently screened by four investigators. Results: 614 distinct papers were identified. After screening, there were no randomised clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria. Conclusions: This review identifies a gap in literature, and therefore recommends an investigation into current practice and clinician preference in relation to vasoactive agents in AMI. Multicentre randomised controlled trials comparing these medications on clinical outcomes will therefore be required to address this question.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endocannabinoid system has been extensively studied in recent decades, particularly the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, due to their important role in neuroinflammation. Among these, CB2 has gained prominence due to its selective overexpression in glial cells during neuroinflammation. In contrast to CB1 agonists, CB2 agonists have no side effects such as ataxia, hypothermia, euphoria, psychological, or addiction liabilities. CB2 and its selective agonists' above-mentioned unique properties have become a research focus in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The review discusses the neuroprotective role of CB receptors, particularly CB2, in AD, as well as the significance and limitations of this research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of airborne transmission: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February to 20 December 2020 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: We included 67 primary studies and 22 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 67 primary studies, 53 (79%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 12 (18%) report cycle threshold values and 18 (127%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational and of low quality. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 36 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 42 studies conducted in-hospital that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 24 (57%) reported positive results for SARs-CoV-2 (142 positives out of 1,403 samples: average 10.1%, range 0% to 100%). There was no pattern between the type of hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU) and RT-PCR positivity. Seventeen studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community, of which seven performed RT-PCR sampling, and two studies reported weak positive RNA samples for 2 or more genes (5 of 125 samples positive: average 4.0%). Ten studies attempted viral culture with no serial passage. Conclusion:  SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture samples of SARS-CoV-2 prevents firm conclusions from being drawn about airborne transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1: Role in placenta accreta spectrum disorder [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta  is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1  (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim  to see if  sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods: This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group)  at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia.  Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum  Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses  were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05  considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results: Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated  with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion: sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

                Aims: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from 2000-2020 in various parts of Nepal. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched using the appropriate keywords. All Nepalese studies mentioning the prevalence of T2DM and/or details such as risk factors were included. Studies were screened using Covidence. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software v.3. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of T2DM, pre-diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance in Nepal in the last two decades was 10% (CI, 7.1%- 13.9%), 19.4% (CI, 11.2%- 31.3%), and 11.0% (CI, 4.3%- 25.4%) respectively. The prevalence of T2DM in the year 2010-15 was 7.75% (CI, 3.67-15.61), and it increased to 11.24% between 2015-2020 (CI, 7.89-15.77). There were 2.19 times higher odds of having T2DM if the body mass index was ≥24.9 kg/m2. Analysis showed normal waist circumference, normal blood pressure, and no history of T2DM in a family has 64.1%, 62.1%, and 67.3% lower odds of having T2DM, respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence of T2DM, pre-diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance in Nepal was estimated to be 10%, 19.4%, and 11% respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Playing Edcraft at Home: Gamified Online Learning for Recycling Intention during Lockdown [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Recycling is a way to sustain ecosystems. There are substantial studies on recycling intention due to the continual growth of unethical and unsustainable waste disposal. Creative approaches to recycling awareness activities should be made to fulfil youths’ increasing interest in and demand for recycling. The main objective of this study is to explore the factors related to youths’ recycling intentions after experiencing a gamified online recycling learning activity, Edcraft Gamified Learning (EGL). Gamified recycling education is believed to be a practical and engaging approach for youths. Methods: 100 students participated in EGL, consisting of two levels of plastic crafting and recycling activities. They experienced online EGL at home between May and September in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic total lockdown in Malaysia, namely, Movement Control Order (MCO). 29 participants were selected to participate in five focus group discussions (FGDs) with five to eight participants per session to explore their opinions towards gamified learning, motivation and recycling intention. Results: This paper reports the findings of the FGDs. A codebook was developed based on the codes from the FGD feedback. The codes were rated by two raters, followed by an assessment of inter-rater reliability and thematic analysis. The findings emerged and were confirmed with four themes as factors that influence recycling intention. They are gameful experience, social influence, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Conclusion: The dependent variable, recycling intention, was connected to the four themes to verify the conceptual framework. One limitation of the study was the design of the EGL activity, which was only carried out over two days with two levels of gamified recycling education, as students had concurrent academic online classes during that period.

However, little is known about microglia-vascular interactions. In a recent paper published in Nature Communications, Bisht et al. identify a signalling mechanism that attracts and maintains microglia at the capillary wall. Moreover, they show that microglia regulate capillary vascular tone, playing a more significant role in blood flow regulation than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor planning under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Actions often require the selection of a specific goal amongst a range of possibilities, like when a softball player must precisely position her glove to field a fast-approaching ground ball. Previous studies have suggested that during goal uncertainty the brain prepares for all potential goals in parallel and averages the corresponding motor plans to command an intermediate movement that is progressively refined as additional information becomes available. Although intermediate movements are widely observed, they could instead reflect a neural decision about the single best action choice given the uncertainty present. Here we systematically dissociate these possibilities using novel experimental manipulations and find that when confronted with uncertainty, humans generate a motor plan that optimizes task performance rather than averaging potential motor plans. In addition to accurate predictions of population-averaged changes in motor output, a novel computational model based on this performance-optimization theory accounted for a majority of the variance in individual differences between participants. Our findings resolve a long-standing question about how the brain selects an action to execute during goal uncertainty, providing fundamental insight into motor planning in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrated evaluation of telomerase activation and telomere maintenance across cancer cell lines</a></h4>

              
                In cancer, telomere maintenance is critical for the development of replicative immortality. Using genome sequences from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project, we calculated telomere content across 1,299 cancer cell lines. We find that telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>) expression correlates with telomere content in lung, central nervous system, and leukemia cell lines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening data, we show that lower telomeric content is associated with dependency of CST telomere maintenance genes. Increased dependencies of shelterin members are associated with wild-type <i>TP53</i> status. Investigating the epigenetic regulation of <i>TERT</i>, we find widespread allele-specific expression in promoter-wildtype contexts. <i>TERT</i> promoter-mutant cell lines exhibit hypomethylation at PRC2-repressed regions, suggesting a cooperative global epigenetic state in the reactivation of telomerase. By incorporating telomere content with genomic features across comprehensively characterized cell lines, we provide further insights into the role of telomere regulation in cancer immortality.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modelling the impact of decidual senescence on embryo implantation in human endometrial assembloids</a></h4>

              
                Decidual remodelling of midluteal endometrium leads to a short implantation window after which the uterine mucosa either breaks down or is transformed into a robust matrix that accommodates the placenta throughout pregnancy. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we established and characterised endometrial assembloids, consisting of gland-like organoids and primary stromal cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that decidualized assembloids closely resemble midluteal endometrium, harbouring differentiated and senescent subpopulations in both glands and stroma. We show that acute senescence in glandular epithelium drives secretion of multiple canonical implantation factors, whereas in the stroma it calibrates the emergence of anti-inflammatory decidual cells and pro-inflammatory senescent decidual cells. Pharmacological inhibition of stress responses in pre-decidual cells accelerated decidualization by eliminating the emergence of senescent decidual cells. In co-culture experiments, accelerated decidualization resulted in entrapment of collapsed human blastocysts in a robust, static decidual matrix. By contrast, the presence of senescent decidual cells created a dynamic implantation environment, enabling embryo expansion and attachment, although their persistence led to gradual disintegration of assembloids. Our findings suggest that decidual senescence controls endometrial fate decisions at implantation and highlight how endometrial assembloids may accelerate the discovery of new treatments to prevent reproductive failure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and dynamics of the chromatin remodeler ALC1 bound to a PARylated nucleosome</a></h4>

              
                The chromatin remodeler ALC1 is recruited to and activated by DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains deposited by PARP1/PARP2/HPF1 upon detection of DNA lesions. ALC1 has emerged as a candidate drug target for cancer therapy as its loss confers synthetic lethality in homologous recombination-deficient cells. However, structure-based drug design and molecular analysis of ALC1 have been hindered by the requirement for PARylation and the highly heterogeneous nature of this post-translational modification. Here, we reconstituted an ALC1 and PARylated nucleosome complex modified <i>in vitro</i> using PARP2 and HPF1. This complex was amenable to cryo-EM structure determination without cross-linking, which enabled visualization of several intermediate states of ALC1 from the recognition of the PARylated nucleosome to the tight binding and activation of the remodeler. Functional biochemical assays with PARylated nucleosomes highlight the importance of nucleosomal epitopes for productive remodeling and reveal that ALC1 preferentially slides nucleosomes away from DNA breaks.

                Enhancers and silencers often depend on the same transcription factors (TFs) and are conflated in genomic assays of TF binding or chromatin state. To identify sequence features that distinguish enhancers and silencers, we assayed massively parallel reporter libraries of genomic sequences targeted by the photoreceptor TF CRX in mouse retinas. Both enhancers and silencers contain more TF motifs than inactive sequences, but relative to silencers, enhancers contain motifs from a more diverse collection of TFs. We developed a measure of information content that describes the number and diversity of motifs in a sequence and found that, while both enhancers and silencers depend on CRX motifs, enhancers have higher information content. The ability of information content to distinguish enhancers and silencers targeted by the same TF illustrates how motif context determines the activity of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences.

                Aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transitions of biomolecular condensates have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying molecular interactions that drive aging remain enigmatic. Here, we develop quantitative time-resolved crosslinking mass spectrometry to monitor protein interactions and dynamics inside condensates formed by the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS). We identify misfolding of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of FUS as a key driver of condensate ageing. We demonstrate that the small heat shock protein HspB8 partitions into FUS condensates via its intrinsically disordered domain and prevents condensate hardening via condensate-specific interactions that are mediated by its α-crystallin domain (αCD). These αCD-mediated interactions are altered in a disease-associated mutant of HspB8, which abrogates the ability of HspB8 to prevent condensate hardening. We propose that stabilizing aggregation-prone folded RNA-binding domains inside condensates by molecular chaperones may be a general mechanism to prevent aberrant phase transitions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The dynamics of touch sensing studied in a mass-spring-damper model of the skin</a></h4>

              
                It has been shown that the skin can provide highly resolvable, dynamic tactile information to the central nervous system. However, currently available skin models do not provide a matching level of dynamic complexity. Motivated by recent observations that everyday interactions create a diversity of widespread travelling waves of multiple overlaid frequencies in the skin, we here model the skin as a 3D-distributed mass-spring-damper model. Shear forces across each spring were reported back as separate sources of information, on which we performed information content analysis using principal component analysis. We found that a wide range of settings of spring constants, dampening coefficients and baseline tension resulted in highly resolvable dynamic information even for simple skin-object interactions. Optimization showed that there were some settings that were more beneficial for a higher temporal resolution, i.e. where multiple independent interactions could be more easily resolved temporally. Whereas even a single sensor reporting a skin shear force with infinite precision by itself can achieve infinite resolution, biological sensors are noisy. We therefore also analyzed the resolution of force direction in the dynamic skin model, when their simulated signal-to-noise ratio was varied. We conclude that biological skin due to its inherent dynamics can afford a low spatial resolution of sensors (subsampling) while still maintaining a very high resolution for detecting skin-object interaction dynamics, and that biological evolution moreover due to this construct likely has been free to play around with a variety of mechanical skin parameters and sensor densities without significantly compromising this resolution.

                Sensory perception is profoundly shaped by attention. Attending to an odor strongly regulates if and how a smell is perceived - yet the brain systems involved in this process are unknown. Here we report integration of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a collection of brain regions integral to attention, with the olfactory system in the context of selective attention to odors. First, we used tracing methods to establish the tubular striatum (TuS, also known as the olfactory tubercle) as the primary olfactory region to receive direct mPFC input in rats. Next, we recorded local field potentials from the olfactory bulb (OB), mPFC, and TuS while rats completed an olfactory selective attention task. Gamma power and coupling of gamma oscillations with theta phase were consistently high as rats flexibly switched their attention to odors. Beta and theta synchrony between mPFC and olfactory regions were elevated as rats switched their attention to odors. Finally, we found that sniffing was consistent despite shifting attentional demands, suggesting that the mPFC-OB theta coherence is independent of changes in active sampling. Together, these findings begin to define an olfactory attention network wherein mPFC activity, as well as that within olfactory regions, are coordinated in manners based upon attentional states.

                Thalamocortical network dysfunction contributes to seizures and sleep deficits in Dravet syndrome (DS), an infantile epileptic encephalopathy, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain elusive. DS is primarily caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, which is highly expressed in GABAergic reticular thalamus (nRT) neurons as well as glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons. We hypothesized that Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency alters somatosensory corticothalamic circuit function through both intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms in nRT and thalamocortical neurons. Using Scn1a heterozygous mice of both sexes aged P25-P30, we discovered reduced intrinsic excitability in nRT neurons and thalamocortical neurons in the ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamus, while thalamocortical ventral posteromedial (VPM) neurons exhibited enhanced excitability. Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency enhanced GABAergic synaptic input and reduced ascending glutamatergic sensory input to VPL neurons, but not VPM neurons. In addition, glutamatergic cortical input to nRT neurons was reduced in Scn1a heterozygous mice, whereas cortical input to VPL and VPM neurons remained unchanged. These findings introduce input-specific alterations in glutamatergic synapse function and aberrant glutamatergic neuron excitability in the thalamus as disease mechanisms in Dravet syndrome, which has been widely considered a disease of GABAergic neurons. This work reveals additional complexity that expands current models of thalamic dysfunction in Dravet syndrome and identifies new components of corticothalamic circuitry as potential therapeutic targets.

                Perisomatic inhibition of neocortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) coordinates cortical network activity during sensory processing, and it has been mainly attributed to parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (BCs). However, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1)-expressing interneurons also inhibit the perisomatic region of PNs but the connectivity and function of these elusive, yet prominent, neocortical GABAergic cells is unknown. We found that the connectivity pattern of CB1-positive BCs strongly differs between primary and high-order cortical visual areas. Moreover, persistently active CB1 signaling suppresses GABA release from CB1 BCs in the medial secondary visual cortex (V2M), but not in the primary (V1) visual area. Accordingly, in vivo, tonic CB1 signaling is responsible for higher but less coordinated PN activity in V2M than in V1. Our results indicate a differential CB1-mediated mechanism controlling PN activity, and suggest an alternative connectivity schemes of a specific GABAergic circuit in different cortical areas

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A subset of nucleus accumbens neurons receiving dense and functional prelimbic cortical input are required for cocaine seeking</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prelimbic cortical projections to the nucleus accumbens core are critical for cue-induced cocaine seeking, but the identity of the accumbens neuron(s) targeted by this projection, and the transient neuroadaptations contributing to relapse within these cells, remain unknown. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cocaine or sucrose self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement. Pathway-specific chemogenetics, patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo electrochemistry, and high-resolution confocal microscopy were used to identify and characterize a small population of nucleus accumbens core neurons that receive dense prelimbic cortical input to determine their role in regulating cue-induced cocaine and natural reward seeking. Results: Chemogenetic inhibition of prelimbic cortical projections to the nucleus accumbens core suppressed cue-induced cocaine relapse and normalized real-time cue-evoked increases in accumbens glutamate release to that of sucrose seeking animals. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of the population of nucleus accumbens core neurons receiving the densest prelimbic cortical input suppressed cocaine, but not sucrose seeking. These neurons also underwent morphological plasticity during the peak of cocaine seeking in the form of dendritic spine expansion and increased ensheathment by astroglial processes at large spines. Conclusions: We identified and characterized a unique subpopulation of nucleus accumbens neurons that receive dense prelimbic cortical input. The functional specificity of this subpopulation is underscored by their ability to mediate cue-induced cocaine relapse, but not sucrose seeking. This subset of cells represents a novel target for addiction therapeutics revealed by anterograde targeting to interrogate functional circuits imbedded within a known network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of spontaneous firing of fusiform neurons from the dorsal cochlear nucleus of mice occurs after hearing onset.</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) in the auditory brainstem integrates auditory and somatosensory information. Mature fusiform neurons express two qualitative intrinsic states in equal proportions: quiet, with no spontaneous regular action potential firing, or active, with regular spontaneous action potential firing. However, how these firing states and other electrophysiological properties of fusiform neurons develop during early postnatal days to adulthood is not known. Thus, we recorded fusiform neurons from mice from P4 to P21 and analyzed their electrophysiological properties. In the pre-hearing phase (P4-P13), we found that fusiform neurons are mostly quiet, with the active state emerging after hearing onset at P14. Subthreshold properties present more variations before hearing onset, while action potential properties vary more after P14, developing bigger, shorter, and faster action potentials. Interestingly, the activity threshold is more depolarized in pre-hearing cells suggesting that persistent sodium current (INaP) increases its expression after hearing. In fact, INaP increases its expression after hearing, accordingly with the development of active neurons. Thus, we suggest that the post-hearing expression of INaP creates the active state of the fusiform neuron. At the same time, other changes refine the passive membrane properties and increase the speed of action potential firing of fusiform neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ascertaining cells' synaptic connections and RNA expression simultaneously with massively barcoded rabies virus libraries</a></h4>

              
                Brain function depends on forming and maintaining connections between neurons of specific types, ensuring neural function while allowing the plasticity necessary for cellular and behavioral dynamics. However, systematic descriptions of how brain cell types organize into synaptic networks and which molecules instruct these relationships are not readily available. Here, we introduce SBARRO (Synaptic Barcode Analysis by Retrograde Rabies ReadOut), a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal directional, monosynaptic relationships based on the paths of a barcoded rabies virus from its "starter" postsynaptic cell to that cell's presynaptic partners1. Thousands of these partner relationships can be ascertained in a single experiment, alongside genome-wide RNA profiles - and thus cell identities and molecular states - of each host cell. We used SBARRO to describe synaptic networks formed by diverse mouse brain cell types in vitro, leveraging a system similar to those used to identify synaptogenic molecules. We found that the molecular identity (cell type/subtype) of the starter cell predicted the number and types of cells that had synapsed onto it. Rabies transmission tended to occur into cells with RNA-expression signatures related to developmental maturation and synaptic transmission. The estimated size of a cell's presynaptic network, relative to that of other cells of the same type, associated with increased expression of Arpp21 and Cdh13. By tracking individual virions and their clonal progeny as they travel among host cells, single-cell, single-virion genomic technologies offer new opportunities to map the synaptic organization of neural circuits in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Analysis of Rod/Cone Gap Junctions from the Reconstruction of Mouse Photoreceptor Terminals</a></h4>

              
                Using serial blockface-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), combined with confocal microscopy for the gap junction protein Cx36, we reconstructed mouse photoreceptor terminals and located the gap junctions between them. An exuberant spray of fine telodendria extends from each cone pedicle (including blue cones) to contact 40-50 nearby rod spherules where Cx36 clusters were located, close to the mouth of the synaptic opening. There were approximately Cx36 clusters per cone 50 pedicle and 2-3 per rod spherule. We were unable to detect rod/rod or cone/cone coupling. Thus, rod/cone coupling accounts for nearly all gap junctions between photoreceptors. Our calculations suggest a mean of 82 Cx36 channels between a rod/cone pair of which 25% are open at rest. Rod/cone gap junctions are modulated by dopamine. Comparing our morphological calculations of maximum coupling to previous physiological results suggests that dopamine antagonists can drive rod/cone gap junctions to a surprisingly high open probability, approaching 100%.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral state tunes mouse vision to ethological features through pupil dilation</a></h4>

              
                Across animal species, sensory processing dynamically adapts to behavioral context. In the mammalian visual system, sensory neural responses and behavioral performance increase during an active behavioral state characterized by locomotion activity and pupil dilation, whereas preferred stimuli of individual neurons typically remain unchanged. Here, we address how behavioral states modulate stimulus selectivity in the context of colored natural scenes using a combination of large-scale population imaging, behavior, pharmacology, and deep neural network modeling. In visual cortex of awake mice, we identified a consistent shift of individual neuron color preferences towards ultraviolet stimuli during active behavioral periods that was particularly pronounced in the upper visual field. We found that the spectral shift in neural tuning is mediated by pupil dilation, resulting in a dynamic switch from rod- to cone-driven visual responses for constant ambient light levels. We further showed that this shift selectively enhances the discriminability of ultraviolet objects and facilitates the detection of ethological stimuli, such as aerial predators against the ultraviolet background of the twilight sky. Our results suggest a novel functional role for pupil dilation during active behavioral states as a bottom-up mechanism that, together with top-down neuromodulatory mechanisms, dynamically tunes visual representations to different behavioral demands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of closed-loop electrical stimulation enables robust cerebellar-directed seizure control</a></h4>

              
                Additional treatment options for temporal lobe epilepsy are needed, and potential interventions targeting the cerebellum are of interest. Previous animal work has shown strong inhibition of hippocampal seizures through on-demand optogenetic manipulation of the cerebellum. However, decades of work examining electrical stimulation - a more immediately translatable approach - targeting the cerebellum has produced very mixed results. We were therefore interested in exploring the impact that stimulation parameters may have on seizure outcomes. Using a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we conducted on-demand electrical stimulation of the cerebellar cortex, and varied stimulation charge, frequency, and pulse width, resulting in over a thousand different potential combinations of settings. To explore this parameter space in an efficient, data-driven, manner, we utilized Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression, implemented in Matlab with an Expected Improvement Plus acquisition function. We examined two different fitting conditions and two different electrode orientations. Following the optimization process, we conducted additional on-demand experiments to test the effectiveness of selected settings. Across all animals, we found that Bayesian optimization allowed identification of effective intervention settings. Additionally, generally similar optimal settings were identified across animals, suggesting that personalized optimization may not always be necessary. While optimal settings were consistently effective, stimulation with settings predicted from the Gaussian process regression to be ineffective failed to provide seizure control. Taken together, our results provide a blueprint for exploration of a large parameter space for seizure control, and illustrate that robust inhibition of seizures can be achieved with electrical stimulation of the cerebellum, but only if the correct stimulation parameters are used.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effective connectivity reveals distinctive patterns in response to others' genuine affective experience of disgust as compared to pain</a></h4>

              
                Empathy is significantly influenced by the identification of others' emotions. In a recent study, we have found increased activation in the anterior insular cortex (aIns) that could be attributed to affect sharing rather than perceptual saliency, when seeing another person genuinely experiencing pain as opposed to merely acting to be in pain. This study further revealed effective connectivity between aIns and the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) to track what another person really feels. In the present study, we used a similar paradigm to investigate the corresponding neural signatures in the domain of empathy for disgust - with participants seeing others genuinely sniffing unpleasant odors as compared to pretending to smell something disgusting. Consistent with the previous findings on pain, we found stronger activations in aIns associated with affect sharing for genuine disgust compared with pretended disgust. However, instead of rSMG we found engagement of the olfactory cortex. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we estimated the neural dynamics of aIns and the olfactory cortex between the genuine and pretended conditions. This revealed an increased excitatory modulatory effect for genuine disgust compared to pretended disgust. For genuine disgust only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a link between the observed modulatory effect and the perspective-taking empathic trait. Altogether, the current findings complement and expand our previous work, by showing that perceptual saliency alone does not explain responses in the insular cortex. Moreover, it reveals that different brain networks are implicated in a modality-specific way when sharing the affective experiences associated with pain vs. disgust.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech categorization reveals the role of early-stage temporal-coherence processing in auditory scene analysis</a></h4>

              
                Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across spectral channels is thought to aid auditory grouping and scene segregation. Although prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, neurophysiological evidence suggests that temporal-coherence-based scene analysis may start as early as the cochlear nucleus (i.e., the first auditory region supporting cross-channel processing over a wide frequency range). Accordingly, we hypothesized that aspects of temporal-coherence processing that could be realized in early auditory areas may shape speech understanding in noise. We then explored whether physiologically plausible computational models could account for results from a behavioral experiment that measured consonant categorization in different masking conditions. We tested whether within-channel masking of target-speech modulations predicted consonant confusions across the different conditions, and whether predicted performance was improved by adding across-channel temporal-coherence processing mirroring the computations known to exist in the cochlear nucleus. Consonant confusions provide a rich characterization of error patterns in speech categorization, and are thus crucial for rigorously testing models of speech perception; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been utilized in prior studies of scene analysis. We find that within-channel modulation masking can reasonably account for category confusions, but that it fails when temporal fine structure (TFS) cues are unavailable. However, the addition of across-channel temporal-coherence processing significantly improves confusion predictions across all tested conditions. Our results suggest that temporal-coherence processing strongly shapes speech understanding in noise, and that physiological computations that exist early along the auditory pathway may contribute to this process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phase-amplitude coupling and phase synchronization between medial temporal, frontal and posterior brain regions support episodic autobiographical memory recall</a></h4>

              
                Episodic autobiographical memory (EAM) is a complex cognitive function that emerges from the coordination of specific and distant brain regions. Specific brain rhythms, namely theta and gamma oscillations and their synchronization, are thought of as putative mechanisms enabling EAM. Yet, the mechanisms of inter-regional interaction in the EAM network remain unclear in humans at the whole brain level. To investigate this, we analyzed EEG recordings of participants instructed to retrieve autobiographical episodes. EEG recordings were projected in the source space, and time-courses of atlas-based brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) were derived. Directed phase synchrony in high theta (7-10 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands and high theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were computed between each pair of ROIs. Using network-based statistics, a graph-theory method, we found statistically significant networks for each investigated mechanism. In the gamma band, two sub-networks were found, one between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and another within the medial frontal areas. In the high theta band, we found a PCC to ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) network. In phase-amplitude coupling, we found the high theta phase of the left MTL biasing the gamma amplitude of posterior regions and the vmPFC. Other regions of the temporal lobe and the insula were also phase biasing the vmPFC. These findings suggest that EAM, rather than emerging from a single mechanism at a single frequency, involves precise spatio-temporal signatures mapping on distinct memory processes. We propose that the MTL orchestrates activity in vmPFC and PCC via precise phase-amplitude coupling, with vmPFC and PCC interaction via high theta phase synchrony and gamma synchronization contributing to bind information within the PCC-MTL sub-network or valuate the candidate memory within the medial frontal sub-network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expectations boost the reconstruction of auditory features from electrophysiological responses to noisy speech</a></h4>

              
                Online speech processing imposes significant computational demands on the listening brain. Predictive coding provides an elegant account of the way this challenge is met through the exploitation of prior knowledge. While such accounts have accrued considerable evidence at the sublexical- and word-levels, relatively little is known about the predictive mechanisms that support sentence-level processing. Here, we exploit the 'pop-out' phenomenon (i.e. dramatic improvement in the intelligibility of degraded speech following prior information) to investigate the psychophysiological correlates of sentence comprehension. We recorded electroencephalography and pupillometry from 21 humans (10 females) while they rated the clarity of full sentences that had been degraded via noise-vocoding or sine-wave synthesis. Sentence pop-out was reliably elicited following visual presentation of the corresponding written sentence, despite never hearing the undistorted speech. No such effect was observed following incongruent or no written information. Pop-out was associated with improved reconstruction of the acoustic stimulus envelope from low-frequency EEG activity, implying that pop-out is mediated via top-down signals that enhance the precision of cortical speech representations. Spectral analysis revealed that pop-out was accompanied by a reduction in theta-band power, consistent with predictive coding accounts of acoustic filling-in and incremental sentence processing. Moreover, delta- and alpha-band power, as well as pupil diameter, were increased following the provision of any written information. We interpret these findings as evidence of a transition to a state of active listening, whereby participants selectively engage attentional and working memory processes to evaluate the congruence between expected and actual sensory input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin neurons mediates the effect of social isolation via the VTA circuits</a></h4>

              
                Social interaction during adolescence strongly influences brain function and behaviour, and the recent pandemic has emphasized the devastating effect of social distancing on mental health. While accumulating evidences have shown the importance of the reward system in encoding specific aspects of social interaction, the consequences of social isolation on the reward system and the development of social skills later in adulthood are still largely unknown. Here, we found that one week of social isolation during adolescence in mice increased social interaction at the expense of social habituation and social novelty preference. Behavioural changes were accompanied by the acute hyperexcitability of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral segmental area (VTA) and long-lasting expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at excitatory inputs onto DA neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Social isolation-dependent behavioural deficits and changes in neural activity and synaptic plasticity were reversed by chemogenetic inhibition of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that social isolation has acute and long-lasting effects on social interaction and suggest that these effects are mediated by homeostatic adaptations within the reward circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information dynamics in neuronal networks of macaque cerebral cortex reflect cognitive state and behavior.</a></h4>

              
                The brain is often described as "processing" information: somehow, the decentralized interactions of billions of neurons collectively are somehow able to give rise to "emergent" behaviors, such as perception, cognition, and action. In neuroscience and cognitive science, however, "information processing" is often vaguely defined, making an exact model connecting neurodynamics, information processing, and behavior difficult to pin down. While considerable previous work has examined the structure of information dynamics in cultures or models, it remains uncertain what insights information dynamics can provide about cognition and behavior in order to interact with the environment. In this paper, we use information theory and the theory of information dynamics as a formal framework to explore information processing in multi area neuronal networks recorded from three macaques engaged in sensory-motor transformations: perceiving a visual cue, preparation of a grasping movement, and movement execution. We found that different states and grasp conditions are associated with significant re-configurations of the effective network structure and the overall information flowing through the system. Crucially, differences between cognitive and behavioral states and conditions were related to changes to higher-order, synergistic information dynamics not localizable to a single pair of source/target neurons. Our results suggest that the combined application of information-theoretic analysis of dynamics and network science inference to networks of neurons is a powerful tool to probe the neuronal basis of cognition and behavior. Keywords: Information Theory, Macaque, Synergy, Transfer Entropy, Networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal astroglial hypertrophy in mice subjected to early life maternal deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS), including chronic deprivation of maternal care, exerts persistent life-long effects on animal physiology and behavior, and is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Long-lasting changes in neuronal plasticity and electrophysiology are documented extensively in the animal models of ELS. However, the role of astroglia in the lasting effects of ELS remains elusive. Astrocytes are intricately involved in the regulation of synaptic physiology and behavior. Moreover, astrocytes play a major role in the innate and adaptive immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS). The role of immune responses and neuroinflammation in the altered brain development and persistent adverse effects of ELS are beginning to be explored. Innate immune response in the CNS is characterized by a phenomenon called astrogliosis, a process in which astrocytes undergo hypertrophy, along with changes in gene expression and function. While the immune activation and neuroinflammatory changes concomitant with ELS, or in juveniles and young adults have been reported, it is unclear whether mice subjected to ELS exhibit astrogliosis-like alterations well into late-adulthood. Here, we subjected mice to maternal separation from postnatal day 2 to day 22 and performed comprehensive morphometric analysis of hippocampal astrocytes during late-adulthood. We found that the astrocytes in the stratum radiatum region of the CA1 hippocampal subfield from maternally separated mice exhibit significant hypertrophy as late as 8 months of age, revealing the crucial changes in astrocytes that manifest long after the cessation of ELS. This study highlights the persistence of neuroinflammatory changes in mice exposed to ELS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feed-forward inhibition fine-tunes response timing in auditory-vocal interactions</a></h4>

              
                The ability to regulate vocal timing is a fundamental aspect of communicative interactions for many species, including conversational speech among humans, yet little is known about the neural circuitry that regulates the input-dependent timing of vocal replies. Exploring this topic in the zebra finch premotor area HVC, we identify feed-forward inhibition as a key regulator of vocal response timing. Based on a spiking network model informed by behavioral and electrophysiological data from communicating zebra finches, we predicted that two different patterns of inhibition regulate vocal-motor responses. In one scenario, the strength of production-related premotor inhibition translates into plasticity in vocal response delays. In the other scenario, fast transient interneuron activity in response to auditory input results in the suppression of call production while a call is heard, thereby reducing acoustic overlap between callers. Extracellular recordings in HVC during the listening phase confirm the presence of auditory-evoked response patterns in putative inhibitory interneurons, along with corresponding signatures of auditory-evoked activity suppression. The proposed model provides a parsimonious framework to explain how auditory-vocal transformations can give rise to vocal turn-taking and highlights multiple roles of local inhibition for behavioral modulation at different time scales.

                This study investigated the potential therapeutic effects of the FDA-approved drug metformin on cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Metformin (dimethyl-biguanide) is a first-line treatment for type II diabetes that, among other mechanisms, is involved in the activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). Cocaine self-administration and extinction is associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated AMPK within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Previously it was shown that increasing AMPK activity in the NAcore decreased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Decreasing AMPK activity produced the opposite effect. The goal of the present study was to determine if metformin in the NAcore reduces cue-induced cocaine seeking in adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine followed by extinction prior to cue-induced reinstatement trials. Metformin microinjected in the NAcore attenuated cue-induced reinstatement in male and female rats. Importantly, metformin's effects on cocaine seeking were not due to a general depression of spontaneous locomotor activity. In female rats, metformin's effects did generalize to a reduction in cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking. These data support a potential role for metformin as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorder, but warrant caution given the potential for metformin's effects to generalize to a natural reward in female rats.

                Deliberative decisions based on an accumulation of evidence over time depend on working memory, and working memory has limitations, but how these limitations affect deliberative decision-making is not understood. We used human psychophysics to assess the impact of working-memory limitations on the fidelity of a continuous decision variable. Participants decided the average location of multiple visual targets. This computed, continuous decision variable degraded with time and capacity in a manner that depended critically on the strategy used to form the decision variable. This dependence reflected whether the decision variable was computed either: 1) immediately upon observing the evidence, and thus stored as a single value in memory; or 2) at the time of the report, and thus stored as multiple values in memory. These results provide important constraints on how the brain computes and maintains temporally dynamic decision variables.

                Physical practice (PP) and motor imagery practice (MP) lead to the execution of fast and accurate arm movements. However, there is currently no information about the influence of MP on movement smoothness, nor about which performance parameters best discriminate these practices. In the current study, we assessed motor performances with an arm pointing task with constrained precision before and after PP (n= 15), MP (n= 15), or no practice (n= 15). We analyzed gains between Pre- and Post-Test for five performance parameters: movement duration, mean and maximal velocities, total displacements, and the number of velocity peaks characterizing movement smoothness. The results showed an improvement of performance after PP and MP for all parameters, except for total displacements. The gains for movement duration, and mean and maximal velocities were statistically higher after PP and MP than after no practice, and comparable between practices. However, motor gains for the number of velocity peaks were higher after PP than MP, suggesting that movements were smoother after PP than after MP. A discriminant analysis also identified the number of velocity peaks as the most relevant parameter that differentiated PP from MP. The current results provide evidence that PP and MP specifically modulate movement smoothness during arm reaching tasks. This difference may rely on online corrections through sensory feedback integration, available during PP but not during MP.

                Understanding the dynamical transformation of neural activity to behavior requires modeling this transformation while both dissecting its potential nonlinearities and dissociating and preserving its nonlinear behaviorally relevant neural dynamics, which remain unaddressed. We present RNN PSID, a nonlinear dynamic modeling method that enables flexible dissection of nonlinearities, dissociation and preferential learning of neural dynamics relevant to specific behaviors, and causal decoding. We first validate RNN PSID in simulations and then use it to investigate nonlinearities in monkey spiking and LFP activity across four tasks and different brain regions. Nonlinear RNN PSID successfully dissociated and preserved nonlinear behaviorally relevant dynamics, thus outperforming linear and non-preferential nonlinear learning methods in behavior decoding while reaching similar neural prediction. Strikingly, dissecting the nonlinearities with RNN PSID revealed that consistently across all tasks, summarizing the nonlinearity only in the mapping from the latent dynamics to behavior was largely sufficient for predicting behavior and neural activity. RNN PSID provides a novel tool to reveal new characteristics of nonlinear neural dynamics underlying behavior.

                Batch effects, undesirable sources of variance across multiple experiments, present a substantial hurdle for scientific and clinical discoveries. Specifically, the presence of batch effects can create both spurious discoveries and hide veridical signals, contributing to the ongoing reproducibility crisis. Typical approaches to dealing with batch effects conceptualize 'batches' as an associational effect, rather than a causal effect, despite the fact that the sources of variance that comprise the batch -- potentially including experimental design and population demographics -- causally impact downstream inferences. We therefore cast batch effects as a causal problem rather than an associational problem. This reformulation enables us to make explicit the assumptions and limitations of existing approaches for dealing with batch effects. We therefore develop causal batch effect strategies---Causal Dcorr for discovery of batch effects and Causal ComBat for mitigating batch effects -- which build upon existing statistical associational methods by incorporating modern causal inference techniques. We apply these strategies to a large mega-study of human connectomes assembled by the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility, consisting of 24 batches including over 1700 individuals to illustrate that existing approaches create more spurious discoveries (false positives) and miss more veridical signals (true positives) than our proposed approaches. Our work therefore introduces a conceptual framing, as well as open source code, for combining multiple distinct datasets to increase confidence in claims of scientific and clinical discoveries.

                Data-driven discovery of image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from large-scale multimodal brain imaging data has enormous potential for neuroscientific and clinical research by linking IDPs to subjects' demographic, behavioural, clinical and cognitive measures (i.e., non-imaging derived phenotypes or nIDPs). However, current approaches are primarily based on unsupervised approaches, without use of information in nIDPs. In this paper, we proposed Supervised BigFLICA (SuperBigFLICA), a semi-supervised, multimodal, and multi-task fusion approach for IDP discovery, which simultaneously integrates information from multiple imaging modalities as well as multiple nIDPs. SuperBigFLICA is computationally efficient and largely bypasses the need for parameter tuning. Using the UK Biobank brain imaging dataset with around 40,000 subjects and 47 modalities, along with more than 17,000 nIDPs, we showed that SuperBigFLICA enhances the prediction power of nIDPs, benchmarked against IDPs derived by conventional expert-knowledge and unsupervised-learning approaches (with average nIDP prediction accuracy improvements of up to 46%). It also enables learning of generic imaging features that can predict new nIDPs. Further empirical analysis of the SuperBigFLICA algorithm demonstrates its robustness in different prediction tasks and the ability to derive biologically meaningful IDPs in predicting health outcomes and cognitive nIDPs, such as fluid intelligence and hypertension scores.

                Roles of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in brain waste clearance and homeostasis has been increasingly recognized, thus measuring its flow dynamics could provide important information about its function and perturbance. While phase-contrast MRI can be used for non-invasive flow mapping, so far its mapping of low velocity flow (such as mouse brain CSF) is not possible. Here we developed a novel generalized Hadamard encoding based multi-band acceleration scheme dubbed HEAP-METRIC (Hadamard Encoding APproach of Multi-band Excitation for short TR Imaging aCcelerating), and with significantly increased SNR per time, HEAP-METRIC phase-contrast MRI achieved fast and accurate mapping of slow (~102 micron/s) flow. Utilizing this novel method, we revealed a heterogeneous global pattern of CSF flow in the awake mouse brain with a averaged flow of ~200 micron/s, and further found isoflurane anesthesia reduced CSF flow that was accompanied by reduction of glymphatic function. Therefore, we developed the novel HEAP-METRIC phase-contrast MRI for mapping low velocity flow, and demonstrated its capability for global mapping of mouse CSF flow and its potential alterations related to various physiological or pathological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific divergent maturational trajectories in the post-natal rat basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA), the part of the amygdala complex involved in the transduction of perceptual stimuli into emotion, undergoes profound reorganization at adolescence in rodents and humans. How cellular and synaptic plasticity evolve throughout postnatal development in both sexes is only partially understood. We used a cross-sectional approach to compare the morphology, neuronal, and synaptic properties of BLA neurons in rats of both sexes at adolescence and adulthood. While BLA pyramidal neurons from rats of both sexes displayed similar current-voltage relationships, rheobases, and resting potentials during pubescence, differences in these parameters emerged between sexes at adulthood: BLA neurons were more excitable in males than females. During pubescence, BLA neuron excitability was highest in females and unchanged in males; male action potentials were smaller and shorter than females and fast afterhyperpolarizations were larger in males. During post-natal maturation, no difference in spine density was observed between groups or sexes but spine length increased and decreased in females and males, respectively. A reduction in spine head diameter and volume was observed exclusively in females. Basic synaptic properties also displayed sex-specific maturational differences. Stimulus-response relationships and maximal fEPSP amplitudes where higher in male adolescents compared with adults but were similar in females of both ages. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by AMPA receptors were smaller in BLA neurons from adolescent female compared with their adult counterparts but were unchanged in males. These differences did not directly convert into changes in overall synaptic strength estimated from the AMPA/NMDA ratio, which was smaller in adolescent females. Finally, the developmental courses of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP, LTD) were sexually dimorphic. LTP was similarly present during the adolescent period in males and females but was not apparent at adulthood in females. In contrast, LTD followed an opposite development: present in adolescent females and expressed in both sexes at adulthood. These data reveal divergent maturational trajectories in the BLA of male and female rats and suggest cellular substrates to the BLA linked sex-specific behaviors at adolescence and adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrical impulse characterization along actin filaments in pathological conditions</a></h4>

              
                We present an interactive Mathematica notebook that characterizes the electrical impulses along actin filaments in both muscle and non-muscle cells for a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. The program is based on a multi-scale (atomic [-&gt;] monomer [-&gt;] filament) approach capable of accounting for the atomistic details of a protein molecular structure, its biological environment, and their impact on the travel distance, velocity, and attenuation of monovalent ionic wave packets propagating along microfilaments. The interactive component allows investigators to conduct original research by choosing the experimental conditions (intracellular Vs in vitro), nucleotide state (ATP Vs ADP), actin isoform (alpha, gamma, beta, and muscle or non-muscle cell), as well as, a conformation model that covers a variety of mutants and wild-type (the control) actin filament. The simplicity of the theoretical formulation and the high performance of the Mathematica software enable the analysis of multiple conditions without computational restrictions. These studies may provide an unprecedented molecular understanding of why and how age, inheritance, and disease conditions induce dysfunctions in the biophysical mechanisms underlying the propagation of electrical signals along actin filaments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of acute and repeated administration of the selective M4 PAM VU0152099 on cocaine vs. food choice in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Ligands that stimulate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors 1 and 4 (M1, M4) have shown promising effects as putative pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorder in rodent assays. We have previously shown reductions in cocaine effects with acute M4 stimulation, as well as long-lasting, delayed, reductions in cocaine taking and cocaine seeking with combined M1/M4 receptor stimulation or with M1 stimulation alone. M4 stimulation opposes dopaminergic signaling acutely, but direct dopamine receptor antagonists have proved unhelpful in managing cocaine use disorder because they lose efficacy with long-term administration. It is therefore critical to determine whether M4 approaches themselves can remain effective with repeated or chronic dosing. We assessed the effects of repeated administration of the M4 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0152099 in rats trained to choose between intravenous cocaine and a liquid food reinforcer, to obtain quantitative measurement of whether M4 stimulation could produce delayed and lasting reduction in cocaine taking. VU0152099 produced progressively augmenting suppression of cocaine choice and cocaine intake, but produced neither rebound nor lasting effects after treatment ended. To compare and contrast effects of M1 vs. M4 stimulation, we tested whether the M4 PAM VU0152100 suppressed cocaine self-administration in mice lacking CalDAG-GEFI signaling factor, required for M1- mediated suppression of cocaine self-administration. CalDAG-GEFI ablation had no effect on M4- mediated suppression of cocaine self-administration. These findings support the potential usefulness of M4 PAMs as pharmacotherapy to manage cocaine use disorder, alone or in combination with M1-selective ligands, and show that M1 and M4 stimulation modulate cocaine-taking behavior by distinct mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical Timescales in the Neocortex: Mathematical Mechanism and Biological Insights</a></h4>

              
                A cardinal feature of the neocortex is the progressive increase of the spatial receptive fields along the cortical hierarchy. Recently, theoretical and experimental findings have shown that the temporal response windows also gradually enlarge, so that early sensory neural circuits operate on short-time scales whereas higher association areas are capable of integrating information over a long period of time. While an increased receptive field is accounted for by spatial summation of inputs from neurons in an upstream area, the emergence of timescale hierarchy cannot be readily explained, especially given the dense inter-areal cortical connectivity known in modern connectome. To uncover the required neurobiological properties, we carried out a rigorous analysis of an anatomically-based large-scale cortex model of macaque monkeys. Using a perturbation method, we show that the segregation of disparate timescales is defined in terms of the localization of eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix, which depends on three circuit properties: (1) a macroscopic gradient of synaptic excitation, (2) distinct electrophysiological properties between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and (3) a detailed balance between long-range excitatory inputs and local inhibitory inputs for each area-to-area pathway. Our work thus provides a quantitative understanding of the mechanism underlying the emergence of timescale hierarchy in large-scale primate cortical networks.

	<p>A subgroup of COVID-19 patients requires intensive respiratory care. The prolonged immobilization and aggressive treatments predispose these patients to develop intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW). Furthermore, this condition could increase the chance of positioning-related peripheral nerve injuries. On the basis of the latest literature review, we describe a case series of three patients with COVID-19 who developed ICUAW complicated by positioning-related peripheral nerve injuries Every patient presented sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy and concomitant myopathy in electrophysiological studies. Furthermore, muscle MRI helped the diagnosis of ICUAW, showing massive damage predominantly in the proximal muscles. Notably, nerve ultrasound detected positioning-related peripheral nerve injuries, even though the concomitant ICUAW substantially masked their clinical features. During the acute phase of severe COVID-19 infection, most medical attention tends to be assigned to critical care management, and neuromuscular complications such as ICUAW and positioning-related peripheral nerve injuries could be underestimated. Hence, when starting post-ICU care for COVID-19 cases, the combination of electrophysiological and imaging studies will aid appropriate evaluation on the patients with COVID-19-related ICUAW.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid dynamic naturalistic monitoring of bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease using a wrist-worn accelerometer</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease are characterized by unpredictability in the timing and duration of dopaminergic therapeutic benefit on symptoms including bradykinesia and rigidity. These fluctuations significantly impair the quality of life of many Parkinson's patients. However, current clinical evaluation tools are not designed for the continuous, naturalistic (real-world) symptom monitoring needed to optimize clinical therapy to treat fluctuations. Although commercially available wearable motor monitoring, used over multiple days, can augment neurological decision making, the feasibility of rapid and dynamic detection of motor fluctuations is unclear. So far, applied wearable monitoring algorithms are trained on group data. Here, we investigate the influence of individual model training on short timescale classification of naturalistic bradykinesia fluctuations in Parkinson's patients using a single wrist-accelerometer. Methods: As part of the Parkinson@Home study protocol, 20 Parkinson patients were recorded with bilateral wrist-accelerometers for a one hour OFF medication session and a one hour ON medication session during unconstrained activities in their own homes. Kinematic metrics were extracted from the accelerometer data from the bodyside with the largest unilateral bradykinesia fluctuations across medication states. The kinematic accelerometer features were compared over the whole one-hour recordings, and medication-state classification analyses were performed on one-minute segments of data. The influence of individual versus group model training, data window length, and total amount of training patients included in group model training on classification was analyzed. Results: Statistically significant areas under the curves (AUCs) for medication induced bradykinesia fluctuation classification were seen in 85% of the Parkinson patients at the single minute timescale using the group models. Individually trained models performed at the same level as the group trained models (mean AUC both 0.70, +/- respectively 0.18 and 0.10) despite the small individual training dataset. AUCs of the group models improved as the length of the feature windows was increased to 300 seconds, and with additional training patient datasets. Conclusion: Medication induced fluctuations in bradykinesia can be classified using wrist worn accelerometery at the time scale of a single minute. Rapid, naturalistic Parkinson motor monitoring has important clinical potential to evaluate dynamic symptomatic and therapeutic fluctuations and help tailor treatments on a fast timescale.

                Collagen VI is a key component of muscle basement membranes, and genetic variants can cause monogenic muscular dystrophies. Conversely, human genetic studies recently implicated collagen VI in central nervous system function, with variants causing the movement disorder dystonia. To elucidate the neurophysiological role of collagen VI, we generated mice with a truncation of the dystonia-related collagen 3 (VI) (COL6A3) C-terminal domain (CTD). These Col6a3CTT mice showed a recessive dystonia-like phenotype. We found that COL6A3 interacts with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) complex in a CTD-dependent manner. Col6a3CTT mice have impaired homeostasis of excitatory input to the basal pontine nuclei (BPN), a motor control hub with dense COL6A3 expression, consistent with deficient endocannabinoid signaling. Aberrant synaptic input in the BPN was normalized by a CB1R agonist, and motor performance in Col6a3CTT mice was improved by CB1R agonist treatment. Our findings identify a readily therapeutically addressable synaptic mechanism for motor control.

                Head-fixed linear treadmill tasks have been used to study hippocampal physiology in mice. Although some hippocampal neurons establish place fields along linear treadmills, it is not clear if the hippocampus is required for spatial memory on this task. Using a Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) approach, we found that silencing hippocampal output on rewarded treadmill tasks impaired search for rewards signaled by spatial cues but did not impair search for rewards signaled by local cues, recapitulating findings from other behavior tasks. These findings serve to contextualize data on hippocampal physiology from mice performing this task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuit dynamics of drug-context associative learning in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The environmental context associated with previous drug consumption serves as a potent trigger for relapse to drug use. The mechanism by which existing neural representations of context are modified to incorporate information associated with a given drug however, remains unknown. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we reveal that drug-context associations for psychostimulants and opioids are encoded in a subset of hippocampal neurons. In these neurons, drug context pairing in a conditioned place preference task weakened their spatial coding for the nondrug-paired context, with drug-induced changes to spatial coding predictive of drug-seeking behavior. Furthermore, the dissociative drug ketamine blocked both the drug-induced changes to hippocampal coding and corresponding drug-seeking behavior. Together, this work reveals how drugs of abuse can alter the hippocampal circuit to encode drug-context associations and points to the hippocampus as a key node in the cognitive process of drug addiction and context-induced drug relapse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ISL1 is an essential determinant of structural and functional tonotopic representation of sound</a></h4>

              
                A cardinal feature of the auditory pathway is frequency selectivity, represented in the form of a tonotopic map from the cochlea to the cortex. The molecular determinants of the auditory frequency map are unknown. Here, we discovered that the transcription factor ISL1 regulates molecular and cellular features of auditory neurons, including the formation of the spiral ganglion, and peripheral and central processes that shape the tonotopic representation of the auditory map. We selectively knocked out Isl1 in auditory neurons using Neurod1Cre strategies. In the absence of Isl1, spiral ganglion neurons migrate into the central cochlea and beyond, and the cochlear wiring is profoundly reduced and disrupted. The central axons of Isl1 mutants lose their topographic projections and segregation at the cochlear nucleus. Transcriptome analysis of spiral ganglion neurons shows that Isl1 regulates neurogenesis, axonogenesis, migration, neurotransmission-related machinery, and synaptic communication patterns. We show that peripheral disorganization in the cochlea affects the physiological properties of hearing in the midbrain and auditory behavior. Surprisingly, auditory processing features are preserved despite the significant hearing impairment, revealing central auditory pathway resilience and plasticity in Isl1 mutant mice. Mutant mice have a reduced acoustic startle reflex, altered prepulse inhibition, and characteristics of compensatory neural hyperactivity centrally. Our findings show that ISL1 is one of the obligatory factors required to sculpt auditory structural and functional tonotopic maps. Still, upon Isl1 deletion, the ensuing central compensatory plasticity of the auditory pathway does not suffice to overcome developmentally induced peripheral dysfunction of the cochlea.

However, currently, no method is available to selectively access neurons that receive monosynaptic inputs from two upstream regions. Here, we devised a method to genetically label such neurons in mice by combining the anterograde transsynaptic spread of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) with intersectional gene expression. Injections of AAV1s expressing either Cre or Flpo recombinases and the Cre/Flpo double-dependent AAV into two upstream regions and the downstream region, respectively, were used to label the postsynaptic neurons receiving inputs from the two upstream regions. We demonstrated this labelling in two distinct circuits: the retina/primary visual cortex to the superior colliculus and the bilateral motor cortex to the dorsal striatum. Systemic delivery of the intersectional AAV allowed for unbiased detection of the labelled neurons throughout the brain. This strategy may help analyse the interregional integration of information in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Control of protein synthesis and memory by GluN3A-NMDA receptors through inhibition of GIT1/mTORC1 assembly</a></h4>

              
                De novo protein synthesis is required for synapse modifications underlying stable memory encoding. Yet neurons are highly compartmentalized cells and how protein synthesis can be regulated at the synapse level is unknown. Here we characterize neuronal signaling complexes formed by the postsynaptic scaffold GIT1, the mTOR kinase and Raptor that couple synaptic stimuli to mTOR-dependent protein synthesis; and identify NMDA receptors containing GluN3A subunits as key negative regulators of GIT1 binding to mTOR. Disruption of GIT1/mTOR complexes by enhancing GluN3A expression or silencing GIT1 inhibits synaptic mTOR activation and restricts the mTOR-dependent translation of specific activity-regulated mRNAs. Conversely, GluN3A removal enables complex formation, potentiates mTOR-dependent protein synthesis, and facilitates the consolidation of associative and spatial memories in mice. The memory enhancement becomes evident with light or spaced training, can be achieved by selectively deleting GluN3A from excitatory neurons during adulthood, and does not compromise other aspects of cognition such as memory flexibility or extinction. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into synaptic translational control and reveal a potentially selective target for cognitive enhancement.

	<p>Individuals affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience psychiatric symptoms, including depression and suicidal ideation, that could lead to chronic impairment and a reduction in quality of life. Specifically, depressive disorder shows high incidence and may lead to chronic impairment and a reduction in the quality of life. To date, no studies on the presence of suicidality and quantitative analysis of depressive symptoms and their risk factors have yet been published. In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms and related risk factors at 3 months after discharge to home care following hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. Methods: Participants were contacted three months after hospital discharge from one of the five COVID-19 hospitals in Rome, as part of a larger project on health outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients (Long Term Neuropsychiatric Disorder in COVID-19 Project), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered by telephone interview. Results: Of 115 participants, 14.8% (N = 17) received a PHQ-9-based diagnosis of depression, and n = 7 of them scored 1 or more on the item on suicidality. A linear regression model showed the predictive role of female sex, pulmonary chronic condition and previous mental disorder in the development of depressive disorder; the latter was confirmed also by binary logistic regression. Severity indexes of disease (length of hospitalization and intensive care treatment) were found not to be associated with the development of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: A small but clinically meaningful number of participants in the current study reported that they experienced symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation 3 months post-discharge from their COVID-19 hospitalization. In particular, given the findings that a history of prior psychiatric disorders was predictive of the development of depression symptoms, clinicians should carefully monitor for the presence of all psychiatric symptoms at follow-up visits.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep occupies one-third of human life and is essential for health and for emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being. Poor or insufficient sleep is associated with a wide range of dysfunctions that involve different body systems, such as the endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems, thus compromising the higher cortical functions, cognitive performance, mood, and post-physical activity recovery. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the effectiveness of physical therapy exercises on sleep disorders in patients with neurological disorders. Our systematic review identified 10 articles that investigated the effects of physical therapy on sleep disorders in patients with neurological disorders, 6 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Results suggest that physical therapy exercises are a safe and useful strategy for managing sleep disorders in neurorehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine-dependent cAMP dynamics in basal amygdala glutamatergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic inputs to basal amygdala (BA) instruct learning of motivational salience. Here, we investigated the dynamics of dopamine release and downstream signaling during multiple salient events occurring within tens of seconds. We established in vitro and in vivo real-time tracking and manipulation of cAMP - a key intracellular plasticity signal downstream of dopamine receptor activation. Optogenetically-evoked release of dopamine drove proportional increases in cAMP in almost all BA glutamatergic neurons, suggesting widespread actions of dopamine across neurons preferring positive or negative valence. These cAMP responses decayed more slowly than dopamine release, potentially extending the window of plasticity. cAMP levels accumulated following direct photostimulation of cAMP but not repeated stimulation of dopamine axons, due to potent depression of dopamine release. cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) responses to repeated appetitive or aversive stimuli also exhibited pronounced depression. Thus, history-dependent dynamics of dopamine and cAMP may regulate learning of temporally clustered, salient stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical role of brain network architecture in a continuum model of autism spectrum disorders spanning from healthy individuals with genetic liability to individuals with ASD</a></h4>

              
                Studies have shown cortical alterations in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as well as in individuals with high polygenic risk for ASD. An important addition to the study of altered cortical anatomy is the investigation of the underlying brain network architecture that may reveal brain-wide mechanisms in ASD and in polygenic risk for ASD. Such an approach has been proven useful in other psychiatric disorders by revealing that brain network architecture shapes (to an extent) the disorder-related cortical alterations. This study uses data from a clinical dataset: 560 male subjects (266 individuals with ASD and 294 healthy individuals, CTL, mean age at 17.2 years) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database, and data of 391 healthy individuals (207 males, mean age at 12.1 years) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics database. ASD-related cortical alterations (group difference, ASD-CTL, in cortical thickness) and cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD were assessed, and then statistically compared with structural connectome-based network measures (such as hubs) using spin permutation tests. Next, we investigated whether polygenic risk for ASD could be predicted by network architecture by building machine-learning based prediction models, and whether the top predictors of the model were identified as disease epicenters of ASD. We observed that ASD-related cortical alterations as well as cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD implicated cortical hubs more strongly than non-hub regions. We also observed that age progression of ASD-related cortical alterations and cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD implicated cortical hubs more strongly than non-hub regions. Further investigation revealed that structural connectomes predicted polygenic risk for ASD (r=0.30, p<0.0001), and two brain regions (the left inferior parietal and left suparmarginal) with top predictive connections were identified as disease epicenters of ASD. Our study highlights a critical role of network architecture in a continuum model of ASD spanning from healthy individuals with genetic risk to individuals with ASD. Our study also highlights the strength of investigating polygenic risk scores in addition to multi-modal neuroimaging measures to better understand the interplay between genetic risk and brain alterations associated with ASD.

	<p>Recent evidence showed that EEG activity alterations that occur during sleep are associated with structural, age-related, changes in healthy aging brains, and predict age-related decline in memory performance. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients show specific EEG alterations during sleep associated with cognitive decline, including reduced sleep spindles during NREM sleep and EEG slowing during REM sleep. We investigated the relationship between these EEG sleep alterations and brain structure changes in a study of 23 AD patients who underwent polysomnographic recording of their undisturbed sleep and 1.5T MRI scans. Cortical thickness measures were correlated with EEG power in the sigma band during NREM sleep and with delta- and beta-power during REM sleep. Thinning in the right precuneus correlated with all the EEG indexes considered in this study. Frontal–central NREM sigma power showed an inverse correlation with thinning of the left entorhinal cortex. Increased delta activity at the frontopolar and temporal regions was significantly associated with atrophy in some temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices, and with mean thickness of the right hemisphere. Our findings revealed an association between sleep EEG alterations and the changes to AD patients’ brain structures. Findings also highlight possible compensatory processes involving the sources of frontal–central sleep spindles.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus not only gates the flow of information into the hippocampus, it also integrates and processes this information. Mossy cells (MCs) are a major type of excitatory neuron strategically located in the hilus of the dentate gyrus where they can contribute to this processing through networks of synapses with inhibitory neurons and dentate granule cells. Some prior work has suggested that MCs can form excitatory synapses with other MCs, but the role of these synapses in the network activity of the dentate gyrus has received little attention. Here, we investigated synaptic inputs to MCs in mouse hippocampal slices using a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to MCs by Cre-lox technology. This enabled optical recording of voltage changes from multiple MCs simultaneously. Stimulating granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells activated well-established inputs to MCs and elicited synaptic responses as expected. However, the weak blockade of MC responses to granule cell layer stimulation by DCG-IV raised the possibility of another source of excitation. To evaluate synapses between MCs as this source, single MCs were stimulated focally. Stimulation of one MC above its action potential threshold evoked depolarizing responses in neighboring MCs that depended on glutamate receptors. Short latency responses of MCs to other MCs did not depend on release from granule cell axons. However, granule cells did contribute to the longer latency responses of MCs to stimulation of other MCs. Thus, MCs transmit their activity to other MCs both through direct synaptic coupling and through polysynaptic coupling with dentate granule cells. MC–MC synapses can redistribute information entering the dentate gyrus and thus shape and modulate the electrical activity underlying hippocampal functions such as navigation and memory, as well as excessive excitation during seizures.</p>

                <p>by Lars Keuninckx, Axel Cleeremans</p>

We show how anomalous time reversal of stimuli and their associated responses can exist in very small connectionist models. These networks are built from dynamical toy model neurons which adhere to a minimal set of biologically plausible properties. The appearance of a “ghost” response, temporally and spatially located in between responses caused by actual stimuli, as in the phi phenomenon, is demonstrated in a similar small network, where it is caused by priming and long-distance feedforward paths. We then demonstrate that the color phi phenomenon can be present in an echo state network, a recurrent neural network, without explicitly training for the presence of the effect, such that it emerges as an artifact of the dynamical processing. Our results suggest that the color phi phenomenon might simply be a feature of the inherent dynamical and nonlinear sensory processing in the brain and in and of itself is not related to consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hydro-osmotic coarsening theory of biological cavity formation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mathieu Le Verge-Serandour, Hervé Turlier</p>

Fluid-filled biological cavities are ubiquitous, but their collective dynamics has remained largely unexplored from a physical perspective. Based on experimental observations in early embryos, we propose a model where a cavity forms through the coarsening of myriad of pressurized micrometric lumens, that interact by ion and fluid exchanges through the intercellular space. Performing extensive numerical simulations, we find that hydraulic fluxes lead to a self-similar coarsening of lumens in time, characterized by a robust dynamic scaling exponent. The collective dynamics is primarily controlled by hydraulic fluxes, which stem from lumen pressures differences and are dampened by water permeation through the membrane. Passive osmotic heterogeneities play, on the contrary, a minor role on cavity formation but active ion pumping can largely modify the coarsening dynamics: it prevents the lumen network from a collective collapse and gives rise to a novel coalescence-dominated regime exhibiting a distinct scaling law. Interestingly, we prove numerically that spatially biasing ion pumping may be sufficient to position the cavity, suggesting a novel mode of symmetry breaking to control tissue patterning. Providing generic testable predictions, our model forms a comprehensive theoretical basis for hydro-osmotic interaction between biological cavities, that shall find wide applications in embryo and tissue morphogenesis.

In visual search tasks, repeating features or the position of the target results in faster response times. Such inter-trial ‘priming’ effects occur not just for repetitions from the immediately preceding trial but also from trials further back. A paradigm known to produce particularly long-lasting inter-trial effects–of the target-defining feature, target position, and response (feature)–is the ‘priming of pop-out’ (PoP) paradigm, which typically uses sparse search displays and random swapping across trials of target- and distractor-defining features. However, the mechanisms underlying these inter-trial effects are still not well understood. To address this, we applied a modeling framework combining an evidence accumulation (EA) model with different computational updating rules of the model parameters (i.e., the drift rate and starting point of EA) for different aspects of stimulus history, to data from a (previously published) PoP study that had revealed significant inter-trial effects from several trials back for repetitions of the target color, the target position, and (response-critical) target feature. By performing a systematic model comparison, we aimed to determine which EA model parameter and which updating rule for that parameter best accounts for each inter-trial effect and the associated <i>n</i>-back temporal profile. We found that, in general, our modeling framework could accurately predict the <i>n</i>-back temporal profiles. Further, target color- and position-based inter-trial effects were best understood as arising from redistribution of a limited-capacity weight resource which determines the EA rate. In contrast, response-based inter-trial effects were best explained by a bias of the starting point towards the response associated with a previous target; this bias appeared largely tied to the position of the target. These findings elucidate how our cognitive system continually tracks, and updates an internal predictive model of, a number of separable stimulus and response parameters in order to optimize task performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Insights into the dynamic trajectories of protein filament division revealed by numerical investigation into the mathematical model of pure fragmentation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Magali Tournus, Miguel Escobedo, Wei-Feng Xue, Marie Doumic</p>

The dynamics by which polymeric protein filaments divide in the presence of negligible growth, for example due to the depletion of free monomeric precursors, can be described by the universal mathematical equations of ‘pure fragmentation’. The rates of fragmentation reactions reflect the stability of the protein filaments towards breakage, which is of importance in biology and biomedicine for instance in governing the creation of amyloid seeds and the propagation of prions. Here, we devised from mathematical theory inversion formulae to recover the division rates and division kernel information from time dependent experimental measurements of filament size distribution. The numerical approach to systematically analyze the behaviour of pure fragmentation trajectories was also developed. We illustrate how these formulae can be used, provide some insights on their robustness, and show how they inform the design of experiments to measure fibril fragmentation dynamics. These advances are made possible by our central theoretical result on how the length distribution profile of the solution to the pure fragmentation equation aligns with a steady distribution profile for large times.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning brain dynamics for decoding and predicting individual differences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joyneel Misra, Srinivas Govinda Surampudi, Manasij Venkatesh, Chirag Limbachia, Joseph Jaja, Luiz Pessoa</p>

Insights from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), as well as recordings of large numbers of neurons, reveal that many cognitive, emotional, and motor functions depend on the multivariate interactions of brain signals. To <i>decode</i> brain dynamics, we propose an architecture based on recurrent neural networks to uncover distributed spatiotemporal signatures. We demonstrate the potential of the approach using human fMRI data during movie-watching data and a continuous experimental paradigm. The model was able to learn spatiotemporal patterns that supported 15-way movie-clip classification (∼90%) at the level of brain regions, and binary classification of experimental conditions (∼60%) at the level of voxels. The model was also able to learn individual differences in measures of fluid intelligence and verbal IQ at levels comparable to that of existing techniques. We propose a dimensionality reduction approach that uncovers low-dimensional trajectories and captures essential informational (i.e., classification related) properties of brain dynamics. Finally, <i>saliency</i> maps and lesion analysis were employed to characterize brain-region/voxel importance, and uncovered how dynamic but consistent changes in fMRI activation influenced decoding performance. When applied at the level of voxels, our framework implements a dynamic version of multivariate pattern analysis. Our approach provides a framework for visualizing, analyzing, and discovering dynamic spatially distributed brain representations during naturalistic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The N-terminal domain of RfaH plays an active role in protein fold-switching</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo Galaz-Davison, Ernesto A. Román, César A. Ramírez-Sarmiento</p>

The bacterial elongation factor RfaH promotes the expression of virulence factors by specifically binding to RNA polymerases (RNAP) paused at a DNA signal. This behavior is unlike that of its paralog NusG, the major representative of the protein family to which RfaH belongs. Both proteins have an N-terminal domain (NTD) bearing an RNAP binding site, yet NusG C-terminal domain (CTD) is folded as a β-barrel while RfaH CTD is forming an α-hairpin blocking such site. Upon recognition of the specific DNA exposed by RNAP, RfaH is activated via interdomain dissociation and complete CTD structural rearrangement into a β-barrel structurally identical to NusG CTD. Although RfaH transformation has been extensively characterized computationally, little attention has been given to the role of the NTD in the fold-switching process, as its structure remains unchanged. Here, we used Associative Water-mediated Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) molecular dynamics to characterize the transformation of RfaH, spotlighting the sequence-dependent effects of NTD on CTD fold stabilization. Umbrella sampling simulations guided by native contacts recapitulate the thermodynamic equilibrium experimentally observed for RfaH and its isolated CTD. Temperature refolding simulations of full-length RfaH show a high success towards α-folded CTD, whereas the NTD interferes with βCTD folding, becoming trapped in a β-barrel intermediate. Meanwhile, NusG CTD refolding is unaffected by the presence of RfaH NTD, showing that these NTD-CTD interactions are encoded in RfaH sequence. Altogether, these results suggest that the NTD of RfaH favors the α-folded RfaH by specifically orienting the αCTD upon interdomain binding and by favoring β-barrel rupture into an intermediate from which fold-switching proceeds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">On the inference of complex phylogenetic networks by Markov Chain Monte-Carlo</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles-Elie Rabier, Vincent Berry, Marnus Stoltz, João D. Santos, Wensheng Wang, Jean-Christophe Glaszmann, Fabio Pardi, Celine Scornavacca</p>

For various species, high quality sequences and complete genomes are nowadays available for many individuals. This makes data analysis challenging, as methods need not only to be accurate, but also time efficient given the tremendous amount of data to process. In this article, we introduce an efficient method to infer the evolutionary history of individuals under the multispecies coalescent model in networks (MSNC). Phylogenetic networks are an extension of phylogenetic trees that can contain <i>reticulate</i> nodes, which allow to model complex biological events such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization and introgression. We present a novel way to compute the likelihood of <i>biallelic</i> markers sampled along genomes whose evolution involved such events. This likelihood computation is at the heart of a Bayesian network inference method called SnappNet, as it extends the Snapp method inferring evolutionary trees under the multispecies coalescent model, to networks. SnappNet is available as a package of the well-known beast 2 software.
Recently, the MCMC_BiMarkers method, implemented in PhyloNet, also extended Snapp to networks. Both methods take biallelic markers as input, rely on the same model of evolution and sample networks in a Bayesian framework, though using different methods for computing priors. However, SnappNet relies on algorithms that are exponentially more time-efficient on non-trivial networks. Using simulations, we compare performances of SnappNet and MCMC_BiMarkers. We show that both methods enjoy similar abilities to recover simple networks, but SnappNet is more accurate than MCMC_BiMarkers on more complex network scenarios. Also, on complex networks, SnappNet is found to be extremely faster than MCMC_BiMarkers in terms of time required for the likelihood computation. We finally illustrate SnappNet performances on a rice data set. SnappNet infers a scenario that is consistent with previous results and provides additional understanding of rice evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Transformational entrepreneurship and its effect on readiness for change, psychological capital, and employee performance: evidence from an Indonesian bank [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Continuing failures of financial capitalism across borders have led corporation to develop a more balanced economic growth model of transformational entrepreneurship that emphasises both short-term economic and longer-term social impacts. The model encourages entrepreneurial activities that bring major changes in the related markets and industries, as well as changes in society and culture. At the corporate level, transformational entrepreneurship prepares employees for any potential changes induced by a dynamic environment; it also improves the psychological capital of individual employees, and effective transformational entrepreneurship can eventually accelerate performance. The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) the direct and indirect effects of transformational entrepreneurship on readiness for change, psychological capital and employee performance, and (2) how the effects to readiness for change and psychological capital influence employee performance. The study data were collected using questionnaires completed by employees in 257 branches of a state-owned bank with locations throughout Indonesia. The data were analysed using the structural equation model. The results show that transformational entrepreneurship significantly and positively influences readiness for change, psychological capital, and employee performance and that readiness for change and psychological capital significantly and positively influences employee performance. Additionally, the effect of transformational entrepreneurship on employee performance is more significant if it is related to psychological capital than to readiness for change or to aspects of employee performance unrelated to transformational entrepreneurship. These findings enrich our understanding of transformational entrepreneurship and its value related to the direct and indirect effects on variables such as readiness for change, psychological capital and employee performance.

                Introduction Communicating science is one of the main steps in the research process. However, the method of communication must be aligned with the audience for the message. This is especially evident in institutions that promote teaching, research, and extension, especially when considering joint actions that promote a dialogue between themselves and the community. Methods In light of this need, this study was conducted with the aim of analyzing the main documents guiding the policies and institutional actions related to research at the two federal institutes based in the state of Goiás/Brazil: Institution A and Institution B and proposing ways to include scientific dissemination as a mediator of the research consolidation process. This is a bibliographic, documentary study with a descriptive, qualitative approach based on a case study. Results and Discussion The analyses indicate that research must be consolidated as institutional policy and that a policy to encourage research must be implemented. This has yet to be achieved at these institutions, although scientific dissemination is explicitly addressed by institutional documents guiding the development and dissemination of pedagogical practices, especially in teaching and extension. Scientific journalism and scientific dissemination are mediators and facilitators of this endeavor.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms, and eventual dementia (PDD). Neuropathological hallmarks include nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, Lewy body (LB) pathology, and neuroinflammation. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a primary component of LBs, is implicated in PD pathogenesis, accumulating and aggregating in both familial and sporadic PD. However, as α-syn pathology is often comorbid with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles in PDD, it is still unclear whether α-syn is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in sporadic PDD. We aimed to determine how the absence of α-syn would affect PDD manifestation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IFN-β knockout (<i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>) mice spontaneously develop progressive behavior abnormalities and neuropathology resembling PDD, notably with α-syn<sup>+</sup> LBs. We generated <i>Ifnb/Snca</i> double knockout (DKO) mice and evaluated their behavior and neuropathology compared with wild-type (Wt), <i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>
<i>,</i> and <i>Snca</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, immunoblots, qPCR, and modification of neuronal signaling.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Ifnb/Snca</i> DKO mice developed all clinical PDD-like behavioral manifestations induced by IFN-β loss. Independently of α-syn expression, lack of IFN-β alone induced Aβ plaques, pTau tangles, and LB-like Aβ<sup>+</sup>/pTau<sup>+</sup> inclusion bodies and neuroinflammation. IFN-β loss caused significant elevated glial and neuronal TNF-α and neuronal TNFR1, associated with neurodegeneration. Restoring neuronal IFN-β signaling or blocking TNFR1 rescued caspase 3/t-BID-mediated neuronal-death through upregulation of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub> and lowered intraneuronal Aβ and pTau accumulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings increase our understanding of PD pathology and suggest that targeting α-syn alone is not sufficient to mitigate disease. Targeting specific aspects of neuroinflammation, such as aberrant neuronal TNF-α/TNFR1 or IFN-β/IFNAR signaling, may attenuate disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Sleep deprivation exacerbates seizures and diminishes GABAergic tonic inhibition.</a></h4>

              
                <p>Patients with epilepsy report that sleep deprivation is a common trigger for breakthrough seizures. The basic mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In the Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of epilepsy, daily sleep deprivation indeed exacerbated seizures though these effects were lost after the 3<sup>rd</sup> day. Sleep deprivation also accelerated mortality in ~52% of Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, not observed in controls. Voltage-clamp experiments on the day after recovery from sleep deprivation showed reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells in epileptic Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation is detrimental to seizures and survival, possibly due to reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Proteostatic regulation in neuronal compartments</a></h4>

              
                Neurons continuously adapt to external cues and challenges, including stimulation, plasticity-inducing signals and aging. These adaptations are critical for neuronal physiology and extended survival. Proteostasis is the process by which cells adjust their protein content to achieve the specific protein repertoire necessary for cellular function. Due to their complex morphology and polarized nature, neurons possess unique proteostatic requirements. Proteostatic control in axons and dendrites must be implemented through regulation of protein synthesis and degradation in a decentralized fashion, but at the same time, it requires integration, at least in part, in the soma.

                Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, regulate neuronal gene expression through changes in histone modifications. Xu et al. apply epigenetic editing to define a novel role for the histone modification H3K36me3 in alternative splicing of the splice factor gene Srsf11 and the regulation of cocaine-reward behavior.

                Previous reports have described worsening inequalities of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. We analyzed Research Project Grant data through the end of Fiscal Year 2020, confirming worsening inequalities beginning at the time of the NIH budget doubling (1998-2003), while finding that trends in recent years have reversed for both investigators and institutions, but only to a modest degree. We also find that career-stage trends have stabilized, with equivalent proportions of early-, mid-, and late-career investigators funded from 2017 to 2020. The fraction of women among funded PIs continues to increase, but they are still not at parity. Analyses of funding inequalities show that inequalities for investigators, and to a lesser degree for institutions, have consistently been greater within groups (i.e., within groups by career stage, gender, race, and degree) than between groups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional independence of endogenous µ- and δ-opioid receptors co-expressed in cholinergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) normally function as monomers, although evidence from heterologous expression systems suggests they may sometimes form homodimers and/or heterodimers. This study aims to evaluate possible functional interplay of endogenous µ- and d-Opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) in mouse neurons. Detecting GPCR dimers in native tissues however has been challenging. Previously, MORs and DORs co-expressed in transfected cells have been reported to form heterodimers, and their possible co-localization in neurons has been studied in knock-in mice expressing genetically engineered receptors fused to fluorescent proteins. Here we find that single cholinergic neurons in the mouse striatum endogenously express both MORs and DORs. The receptors on neurons from live brain slices were fluorescently labeled in live brain slices with a ligand-directed labeling reagent, NAI-A594. The selective activation of MORs and DORs, with DAMGO (µ-agonist) and deltorphin (d-agonist) inhibited spontaneous firing in all cells examined. In the continued presence of agonist, the firing rate returned to baseline as the result of receptor desensitization with the application of deltorphin but was less observed with the application of DAMGO. In addition, agonist-induced internalization of DORs but not MORs was detected. When MORs and DORs were activated simultaneously with [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin, desensitization of MORs was facilitated but internalization was not increased. Together, these results indicate that while MORs and DORs are expressed in single striatal cholinergic interneurons, the two receptors function independently.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dual expression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 promotes transformation of adult cochlear supporting cells into outer hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for hearing. Severe hearing impairment follows OHC degeneration. Previous attempts at regenerating new OHCs from cochlear supporting cells (SCs) have been unsuccessful, notably lacking expression of the key OHC motor protein, Prestin. Thus, regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs represents a barrier to restore auditory function <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we reported the successful <i>in vivo</i> conversion of adult mouse cochlear SCs into Prestin+ OHC-like cells through the concurrent induction of two key transcriptional factors known to be necessary for OHC development: <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Ikzf2</i>. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed the upregulation of 729 OHC genes and downregulation of 331 SC genes in OHC-like cells. The resulting differentiation status of these OHC-like cells was much more advanced than previously achieved. This study thus established an efficient approach to induce the regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs, paving the way for <i>in vivo </i>cochlear repair via SC transdifferentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LIN37-DREAM prevents DNA end resection and homologous recombination at DNA double-strand breaks in quiescent cells</a></h4>

              
                DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be restricted to the S- and G<sub>2</sub>- phases of the cell cycle in part due to 53BP1 antagonizing DNA end resection in G<sub>1</sub>-phase and non-cycling quiescent (G<sub>0</sub>) cells. Here, we show that LIN37, a component of the DREAM transcriptional repressor, functions in a 53BP1-independent manner to prevent DNA end resection and HR in G<sub>0</sub> cells. Loss of LIN37 leads to the expression of HR proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51, and promotes DNA end resection in G<sub>0</sub> cells even in the presence of 53BP1. In contrast to 53BP1-deficiency, DNA end resection in LIN37-deficient G<sub>0</sub> cells depends on BRCA1 and leads to RAD51 filament formation and HR. LIN37 is not required to protect DNA ends in cycling cells at G<sub>1</sub>-phase. Thus, LIN37 regulates a novel 53BP1-independent cell phase-specific DNA end protection pathway that functions uniquely in quiescent cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental fluctuations reshape an unexpected diversity-disturbance relationship in a microbial community</a></h4>

              
                Environmental disturbances have long been theorized to play a significant role in shaping the diversity and composition of ecosystems. However, an inability to specify the characteristics of a disturbance experimentally has produced an inconsistent picture of diversity-disturbance relationships (DDRs). Here, using a high-throughput programmable culture system, we subjected a soil-derived bacterial community to dilution disturbance profiles with different intensities (mean dilution rates), applied either constantly or with fluctuations of different frequencies. We observed an unexpected U-shaped relationship between community diversity and disturbance intensity in the absence of fluctuations. Adding fluctuations increased community diversity and erased the U-shape. All our results are well-captured by a Monod consumer resource model, which also explains how U-shaped DDRs emerge via a novel 'niche flip' mechanism. Broadly, our combined experimental and modeling framework demonstrates how distinct features of an environmental disturbance can interact in complex ways to govern ecosystem assembly and offers strategies for reshaping the composition of microbiomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal regulated ire-1-dependent mRNA decay controls germline differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the molecular events that regulate cell pluripotency versus acquisition of differentiated somatic cell fate is fundamentally important. Studies in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> demonstrate that knockout of the germline-specific translation repressor <i>gld-1</i> causes germ cells within tumorous gonads to form germline-derived teratoma. Previously we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enhances this phenotype to suppress germline tumor progression(Levi-Ferber et al., 2015). Here, we identify a neuronal circuit that non-autonomously suppresses germline differentiation and show that it communicates with the gonad via the neurotransmitter serotonin to limit somatic differentiation of the tumorous germline. ER stress controls this circuit through regulated inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1)-dependent mRNA decay of transcripts encoding the neuropeptide FLP-6. Depletion of FLP-6 disrupts the circuit’s integrity and hence its ability to prevent somatic-fate acquisition by germline tumor cells. Our findings reveal mechanistically how ER stress enhances ectopic germline differentiation and demonstrate that regulated Ire1-dependent decay can affect animal physiology by controlling a specific neuronal circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Concerted conformational dynamics and water movements in the ghrelin G protein-coupled receptor</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing support for water molecules playing a role in signal propagation through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, exploration of the hydration features of GPCRs is still in its infancy. Here, we combined site-specific labeling with unnatural amino acids to molecular dynamics to delineate how local hydration of the ghrelin receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is rearranged upon activation. We found that GHSR is characterized by a specific hydration pattern that is selectively remodeled by pharmacologically distinct ligands and by the lipid environment. This process is directly related to the concerted movements of the transmembrane domains of the receptor. These results demonstrate that the conformational dynamics of GHSR are tightly coupled to the movements of internal water molecules, further enhancing our understanding of the molecular bases of GPCR-mediated signaling.

                In developing vertebrate neurons, a neurite is formed by more than a hundred microtubules. While individual microtubules are dynamic, the microtubule array itself has been regarded as stationary. Using live cell imaging in combination with photoconversion techniques and pharmacological manipulations, we uncovered that the microtubule array flows retrogradely within neurites to the soma. This microtubule retrograde flow drives cycles of microtubule density, a hallmark of the fluctuating state before axon formation. Shortly after axon formation, microtubule retrograde flow slows down in the axon, which stabilizes microtubule density cycles and thereby functions as a molecular wedge to enable axon extension. We propose microtubule retrograde flow and its specific slowdown in the axon to be the long-sought mechanism to single one neurite out to drive neuronal polarization.

                The main aim of this study was to determine sex differences in central and peripheral fatigue produced by a sustained isometric exercise of ankle plantar flexors in healthy young adults. Ten males and fourteen females performed a sustained isometric ankle exercise until task failure. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque (plantarflexion), voluntary activation level (using the twitch interpolation technique), and twitch contractile properties (twitch peak torque, twitch half relaxation time, and low frequency fatigue index) were measured before, immediately after, and throughout a recovery period (1, 2, 5, and 10 min) following the exercise protocol in order to characterize neuromuscular fatigue. Fatigue had a significant effect (p {pound} 0.05) on all dependent variables. Other than for the maximal voluntary contraction torque, where males showed a greater fatigue-related decrease than females, males and females showed generally similar changes with fatigue. Altogether, our findings indicate no major differences in central or peripheral fatigue mechanisms between males and females to explain a somewhat greater fatigability in males.

                Due to the widespread access to, and implementation of, combination antiretroviral therapy, individuals perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are living into adolescence and adulthood. Perinatally infected adolescents living with HIV-1 (pALHIV) are plagued by progressive, chronic neurocognitive impairments; the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these deficits, however, remains understudied. A longitudinal experimental design from postnatal day (PD) 30 to PD 180 was utilized to establish the development of pyramidal neurons, and associated dendritic spines, from layers II-III of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Three putative neuroinflammatory markers (i.e., IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-) were evaluated early in development (i.e., PD 30) as a potential mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunction in the mPFC. Constitutive expression of HIV-1 viral proteins induced prominent neurodevelopmental alterations, independent of biological sex, in pyramidal neurons from layers II-III of the mPFC. Specifically, HIV-1 transgenic rats exhibited prominent deficits in dendritic and synaptic pruning, a developmental decrease in synaptic connectivity, and an age-related decline in synaptic efficacy. Examination of dendritic spine morphology revealed an age-related population shift towards a more immature dendritic spine phenotype in HIV-1 transgenic animals. There was no compelling evidence for neuroinflammation in the mPFC during early development. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying chronic neurocognitive impairments in pALHIV may afford a key target for innovative therapeutics and cure strategies; an urgent need given the growing population of pALHIV.

                Understanding of the relationship between cellular function and molecular composition holds a key to next-generational therapeutics but requires measurement of all types of molecules in cells. Developments in sequencing enabled semi-routine measurement of single-cell genomes and transcriptomes, but analytical tools are scarce for detecting diverse proteins in tissue-embedded cells. To bridge this gap for neuroscience research, we report the integration of patch-clamp electrophysiology with subcellular shot-gun proteomics by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Recording of electrical activity permitted identification of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Ca. 20-50% of the neuronal soma content, containing an estimated 100 pg of total protein, was aspirated into the patch pipette filled with ammonium bicarbonate. About ~1 pg of somal protein, or ~0.25% of the total cellular proteome, was analyzed on a custom-built capillary electrophoresis (CE) high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS). A series of experiments were conducted to systematically enhance detection sensitivity through refinements in sample processing and detection, allowing us to quantify ~275 different proteins from somal aspirate-equivalent protein digests. From single neurons, patch-clamp proteomics of the soma quantified 91, 80, and 95 different proteins from 3 different dopaminergic neurons, or 157 proteins in total. Quantification revealed detectable proteomic differences between the somal protein samples. Analysis of canonical knowledge predicted rich interaction networks between the proteins. The integration of patch-clamp electrophysiology with subcellular CE-HRMS proteomics expands the analytical toolbox of neuroscience.

                Individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exhibit an increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbities (e.g., apathy) relative to their seronegative counterparts. Given the profound functional consequences associated with apathy, conceptualizing the multidimensional neuropsychiatric syndrome, and associated neural mechanisms, following chronic HIV-1 viral protein exposure remains a critical need. HIV-1 associated apathy was examined by quantifying goal-directed behaviors, indexed using voluntary wheel running, during the diurnal and nocturnal cycle. Apathetic behaviors in the HIV-1 Tg rat were characterized by a profound decrease in the number of running bouts during both the diurnal and nocturnal cycle, supporting a prominent deficit in the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors. Additionally, HIV-1 Tg animals exhibited a decreased reinforcing efficacy of voluntary wheel running during the nocturnal cycle. Following the completion of voluntary wheel running, synaptic dysfunction in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was examined as a potential neural mechanism underlying HIV-1 associated apathy. HIV-1 Tg animals displayed prominent synaptic dysfunction in MSNs of the NAc, characterized by decreased synaptic connectivity and a population shift towards an immature dendritic spine phenotype relative to control animals. Synaptic dysfunction accounted for 42.0% to 68.5% of the variance in the number of running bouts affording a key neural mechanism underlying the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors. The establishment of a fundamental neural mechanism underlying apathy affords a key target for the development of novel therapeutics and cure strategies for affective alterations associated with HIV-1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human spindle variability</a></h4>

              
                In humans, sleep spindles are 10-16 Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5-2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as slow versus fast, modeled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial sEEG recordings (n=20, 365 bipolar recordings), we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared to parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region and between-region factors.

                Uncovering cognitive representations is an elusive goal that is increasingly pursued using the reverse correlation method. Employing reverse correlation often entails collecting thousands of stimulus-response pairs from human subjects, a burdensome task that limits the feasibility of many such studies. This methodological barrier can potentially be overcome using recent advances in signal processing designed to improve sampling efficiency, specifically compressive sensing. Here, compressive sensing is shown to be directly compatible with reverse correlation, and a trio of simulations are performed to demonstrate that compressive sensing can improve the accuracy of reconstructed representations while dramatically reducing the required number of samples. This work concludes by outlining the potential of compressive sensing to improve representation reconstruction throughout the field of neuroscience and beyond.

                Neural activity has been implicated in the motility and outgrowth of glial cell processes throughout the central nervous system. Here we explore this phenomenon in Muller glia, which are specialized radial astroglia that are the predominant glial type of the vertebrate retina. Muller glia extend fine filopodia-like processes into retinal synaptic layers, in similar fashion to brain astrocytes and radial glia which exhibit perisynaptic processes. Using two-photon volumetric imaging, we found that during the second postnatal week, Muller glial processes were highly dynamic, with rapid extensions and retractions that were mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements. During this same stage of development, retinal waves led to increases in cytosolic calcium within Muller glial lateral processes and stalks. These comprised distinct calcium compartments, distinguished by variable participation in waves, timing, and sensitivity to an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. However, we found that motility of lateral processes was unaffected by the presence of pharmacological agents that enhanced or blocked wave-associated calcium transients. Finally, we found that mice lacking normal cholinergic waves in the first postnatal week also exhibited normal Muller glial process morphology. Hence, outgrowth of Muller glial lateral processes into synaptic layers is determined by factors that are independent of neuronal activity.

                The ability to encode and update information about individuals is critical for lasting social relationships. Although the hippocampus is important for social recognition memory, its underlying neural representations remain elusive. Here we investigate the neural codes mediating social recognition and learning by examining social odor recognition and associative odor-reward learning in mice. We performed high-resolution calcium imaging from the hippocampal CA2 region of awake head-fixed mice, as CA2 is necessary for social recognition memory. We find that CA2 encodes specific neural representations of novel social odors that are further refined during associative odor-reward learning. Optogenetic silencing of CA2 impairs the formation of reward associations. Furthermore, CA2 population activity represents odors in a geometry that enables abstract representations of social versus non-social odors. Thus, CA2 distinguishes multiple forms of olfactory stimuli to enhance the learning of social odors and associations, which are poised to serve as substrates of social memory.

                In insects and mammals, chronic exposure to odors at high concentrations in early life alters olfactory function, but the role of odor experience-dependent plasticity in more naturalistic contexts is less clear. We investigated olfactory plasticity in the Drosophila antennal lobe by exposing flies to odors at concentrations that are typically encountered in natural odor sources. These stimuli also strongly and selectively activated only a single class of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) input, facilitating the investigation of input-specific plasticity. Overall, chronic exposure to three such odors elicited limited plasticity in the odor responses of second-order projection neurons (PNs). Exposure to some odors elicited mild increases in PN responses to weak stimuli, extending the lower bound of the dynamic range of PN signaling. When present, plasticity was observed broadly in multiple PN types and thus was not selective for PNs receiving direct input from the chronically active ORNs. Chronic E2-hexenal exposure did not affect PN intrinsic properties, local inhibitory innervation, ORN responses, or ORN-PN synaptic strength, but modestly increased broad lateral excitation evoked by some odors. These results show that PN odor coding is only mildly affected by strong persistent activation of a single olfactory input and highlight the stability of early stages of insect olfactory processing to significant perturbations in the sensory environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Central hormone-sensitive lipase is located at synapses and is necessary for normal memory performance in mice</a></h4>

              
                Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is mainly present in the adipose tissue where it hydrolyses diacylglycerol. Although brain expression of HSL has been reported, its presence in different cellular compartments is uncertain, and its role in regulating brain lipid metabolism remains hitherto unexplored. We propose that HSL has a role in regulating the availability of bioactive lipids necessary for adequate neuronal function. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that dampening HSL activity leads to brain dysfunction. We found HSL protein and activity throughout all the mouse brain, localised in neurons and especially enriched in synapses. HSL null mice were then analysed using a battery of behavioural tests. Relative to wild-type littermates, HSL null mice showed impaired short- and long-term memory, but preserved exploratory behaviours. Molecular analysis of the cortex and hippocampus showed increased expression of genes involved in glucose utilization in the hippocampus but not cortex of HSL null mice compared to controls. Lipidomics analyses indicated an impact of HSL deletion on the profile of bioactive lipids, including endocannabinoids and eicosanoids that are known to modulate neuronal activity, cerebral blood blow and inflammation processes. Accordingly, mild increases in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggest low grade inflammation in HSL null mice compared to littermates. We conclude that HSL has a homeostatic role in maintaining pools of lipids that are needed for brain function. It remains to be tested, however, whether the recruitment of HSL for the synthesis of these lipids occurs during increased neuronal activity, or whether HSL participates in neuroinflammatory responses.

                Pubertal maturation aids development of emotion, cognition, and reproduction. We investigated transcriptional dynamics in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a hypothalamic center for reproductive behaviors, in male and female mice at single-cell resolution (scRNAseq) during puberty. Defined subsets of neurons expressing Slc32a1 and Esr1 (Vgat+ Esr1+) were the most transcriptionally dynamic compared to other cell types throughout puberty. These cell type specific transcriptional progressions towards adulthood were bidirectionally controlled by the levels of circulating testosterone and estradiol. Selective deletion of Esr1 in Slc32a1-expressing cells in the MPOA prior to puberty arrested transcriptional progression and revealed a sexually dimorphic gene-regulatory network governed by Esr1. Deletion of Esr1 in Vgat+ cells prevented the development of mating behavior in both sexes. These analyses reveal both sexually common and dimorphic transcriptional progressions during puberty as well as their regulatory mechanisms, which have important implications towards understanding adaptative and maladaptive processes governing adolescent brain development.

                Significance: Mayer waves are spontaneous oscillations in arterial blood pressure that can mask cortical hemodynamic responses associated with neural activity of interest. Aim: To characterize the properties of oscillations in the fNIRS signal generated by Mayer waves in a large sample of fNIRS recordings. Further, we aim to determine the impact of short-channel correction for the attenuation of these unwanted signal components. Approach: Mayer wave oscillation parameters were extracted from 310 fNIRS measurements using the Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F (FOOOF) method to compute normative values. The effect of short-channel correction on Mayer wave oscillation power was quantified on 222 measurements. The practical benefit of the short-channel correction approach for reducing Mayer waves and improving response detection was also evaluated on a subgroup of 17 fNIRS measurements collected during a passive auditory speech detection experiment. Results: Mayer wave oscillations had a mean frequency of 0.108 Hz, bandwidth of 0.075 Hz, and power of 3.5 M2/Hz. The distribution of oscillation signal power was positively skewed, with some measurements containing large Mayer waves. Short-channel correction significantly reduced the amplitude of these undesired signals; greater attenuation was observed for measurements containing larger Mayer wave oscillations. Conclusions: A robust method for quantifying Mayer wave oscillations in the fNIRS signal spectrum was presented and used to provide normative parameterization. Short-channel correction is recommended as an approach for attenuating Mayer waves, particularly in participants with large oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of V3 neurons in speed-dependent interlimb coordination during locomotion in mice</a></h4>

              
                Speed-dependent interlimb coordination allows animals to maintain stable locomotion under different circumstances. We have previously demonstrated that a subset of spinal V3 neurons contributes to stable locomotion by mediating mutual excitation between left and right lumbar rhythm generators (RGs). Here, we expanded our investigation to the V3 neurons involved in ascending long propriospinal interactions (aLPNs). Using retrograde tracing, we revealed a subpopulation of lumbar V3 aLPNs with contralateral cervical projections. V3OFF mice, in which all V3 neurons were silenced, had a significantly reduced maximal locomotor speed, were unable to move using stable trot, gallop, or bound, and predominantly used lateral-sequence walk. To understand the functional roles of V3 aLPNs, we adapted our previous model of spinal circuitry controlling quadrupedal locomotion (Danner et al., 2017), by incorporating diagonal V3 aLPNs mediating inputs from each lumbar RG to the contralateral cervical RG. The updated model reproduces our experimental results and suggests that locally projecting V3 neurons, mediating left-right interactions within lumbar and cervical cords, promote left-right synchronization necessary for gallop and bound, whereas the V3 aLPNs promote synchronization between diagonal fore and hind RGs necessary for trot. The model proposes the organization of spinal circuits available for future experimental testing.

                The pupillary light response is an important automatic physiological response that optimises light reaching the retina. Recent work has shown that the pupil also adjusts in response to illusory brightness and a range of cognitive functions, however, it remains unclear what exactly drives these endogenous changes. Here we show that the imagery pupillary light response correlates with objective measures of sensory imagery strength. Further, the trial-by-trial phenomenological vividness of visual imagery is tracked by the imagery pupillary light response. We also demonstrated that there was no evidence for an imagery pupillary light response in a group of individuals without visual imagery (aphantasia), however, they did show perceptual pupil light responses and pupil dilation with larger cognitive load. Our results provide evidence that the pupillary light response indexes the sensory strength of visual imagery and also provides the first physiological validation of aphantasia.

                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during post-learning sleep is known to enhance motor memory consolidation but the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial effect of auditory TMR on motor performance. At the neural level, TMR enhanced slow waves (SW) characteristics. Additionally, greater TMR-related phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.3-2 Hz) and sigma (12-16 Hz) oscillations after the SW peak was related to higher TMR effect on performance. Importantly, sounds that were not associated to learning strengthened SW-sigma coupling at the SW trough and the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the potential evoked by these unassociated sounds was related to the TMR benefit. Altogether, our data suggest that, depending on their precise temporal coordination during post learning sleep, slow and sigma oscillations play a crucial role in either memory reinstatement or protection against irrelevant information; two processes that critically contribute to motor memory consolidation.

                Humans vary greatly in their motor learning abilities, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this variability. Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that large-scale neural dynamics inhabit a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, and that learning is constrained by this intrinsic manifold architecture. Here we asked, using functional MRI, whether subject-level differences in neural excursion from manifold structure can explain differences in learning across participants. We had subjects perform a sensorimotor adaptation task in the MRI scanner on two consecutive days, allowing us to assess their learning performance across days, as well as continuously measure brain activity. We find that the overall neural excursion from manifold activity in both cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks is associated with differences in subjects' patterns of learning and relearning across days. These findings suggest that off-manifold activity provides an index of the relative engagement of different neural systems during learning, and that intersubject differences in patterns of learning and relearning across days are related to reconfiguration processes in cognitive and sensorimotor networks during learning.

                We are utilizing an adult penetrating traumatic brain injury (PTBI) model in Drosophila to investigate regenerative mechanisms after damage to the central brain. We focused on cell proliferation as an early event in the regenerative process. To identify candidate pathways that may trigger cell proliferation following PTBI, we utilized RNA-Seq. We find that transcript levels for components of both Toll and Immune Deficiency (Imd) innate immunity pathways are rapidly and highly upregulated post-PTBI. We then tested mutants for the NF-{kappa}B transcription factors of the Toll and Imd pathways, Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) and Relish (Rel) respectively. We find that loss of either or both Dif and Rel results in loss of cell proliferation after injury. We then tested canonical downstream targets of Drosophila innate immune signaling, the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and find that they are not required for cell proliferation following PTBI. This suggests that there are alternative targets of Toll and Imd signaling that trigger cell division after injury. Furthermore, we find that while AMP levels are substantially elevated after PTBI, their levels revert to near baseline within 24 hours. Finally, we identify tissue-specific requirements for Dif and Rel. Taken together, these results indicate that the innate immunity pathways play an integral role in the regenerative response. Innate immunity previously has been implicated as both a potentiator and an inhibitor of regeneration. Our work suggests that modulation of innate immunity may be essential to prevent adverse outcomes. Thus, this work is likely to inform future experiments to dissect regenerative mechanisms in higher organisms.

                The use of multi-site datasets in neuroimaging provides neuroscientists with more statistical power to perform their analyses. However, it has been shown that imaging-site introduces a variability in the data that cannot be attributed to biological sources. In this work, we show that functional connectivity matrices derived from resting-state multi-site data contain a significant imaging-site bias. To this aim, we exploited the fact that functional connectivity matrices belong to the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, making possible to operate on them with Riemannian geometry. We hereby propose a geometry-aware harmonization approach, Rigid Log-Euclidean Translation, that accounts for this site bias. Moreover, we adapted other Riemannian-geometric methods designed for other domain adaptation tasks, and compared them to our proposal. Based on our results, Rigid Log-Euclidean Translation of multi-site functional connectivity matrices seems the most suitable method in a clinical setting. This represents an advance with respect to previous functional connectivity data harmonization approaches, which do not respect the geometric constraints imposed by the underlying structure of the manifold. In particular, when applying our proposed method on data from the ADHD-200 dataset, a multi-site dataset built for the study of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we obtained results that display a remarkable correlation with established pathophysiological findings and, therefore, represent a substantial improvement when compared to the non-harmonization analysis. Thus, we present evidence supporting that harmonization should be extended to other functional neuroimaging datasets, and provide a simple geometric method to address it.

                Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex disease affecting many facets of movement, especially gait abnormalities such as shuffling and freezing of gait. The nigrostriatal pathways of the basal ganglia are traditionally targeted by existing therapies; however, other pathways may be more relevant to gait, such as the pedunculopontine nucleus and the zona incerta (ZI). The A13 nucleus may be such a target as it has emerged as an area of interest in dopamine motor function. Yet, this area remains understudied compared to other dopamine nuclei, especially in animal models of PD. In 6-OHDA mice, we found a reduction in locomotion in the open field and gait dysfunction during treadmill tests. Medial ZI dopamine cells, containing the A13 nucleus, were preserved following 6-OHDA, in contrast to a marked reduction in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons. There was extensive remodelling of the A13 afferent and efferent connectome following nigrostriatal lesions. Afferent input patterns displayed a marked reduction in cross-correlation across brain regions in 6-OHDA mice, while efferent projections showed an increase. In a human PD patient with advanced gait dysfunction we found that the A13 nucleus was preserved, suggesting that remodelling could also occur in humans. This work points to the A13 region as a potential therapeutic target in PD.

                Neuronal populations code similar concepts by similar activity patterns across the human brain's networks supporting language comprehension. However, it is unclear to what extent such meaning-to-symbol mapping reflects statistical distributions of symbol meanings in language use, as quantified by word co-occurrence frequencies, or, rather, experiential information thought to be necessary for grounding symbols in sensorimotor knowledge. Here we asked whether integrating distributional semantics with human judgments of grounded sensorimotor semantics better approximates the representational similarity of conceptual categories in the brain, as compared with each of these methods used separately. We examined the similarity structure of activation patterns elicited by action- and object-related concepts using multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) of fMRI data. The results suggested that a semantic vector integrating both sensorimotor and distributional information yields best category discrimination on the cognitive-linguistic level, and explains the corresponding activation patterns in left posterior inferior temporal cortex. In turn, semantic vectors based on detailed visual and motor information uncovered category-specific similarity patterns in fusiform and angular gyrus for object-related concepts, and in motor cortex, left inferior frontal cortex (BA 44), and supramarginal gyrus for action-related concepts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cerebellar-prepontine circuit for tonic immobility triggered by inescapable threat</a></h4>

              
                Sudden changes in the sensory environment are frequently perceived as threats and may provoke defensive behavioral states. One such state is tonic immobility, a conserved defensive strategy characterized by a powerful suppression of movement and motor reflexes. Tonic immobility has been associated with multiple brainstem regions and cell types, but the underlying circuit is not known. Here, we demonstrate that a strong vibratory stimulus evokes tonic immobility in larval zebrafish defined by suppression of exploratory locomotion and sensorimotor responses. Using a circuit-breaking screen and targeted neuron ablations we show that cerebellar granule cells and a cluster of glutamatergic ventral prepontine neurons (vPPNs) that express key stress-associated neuropeptides are critical components of the circuit that suppresses movement. The complete sensorimotor circuit transmits information from primary sensory neurons through the cerebellum to vPPNs to regulate reticulospinal premotor neurons. These results show that cerebellar regulation of a neuropeptide-rich prepontine structure governs a conserved and ancestral defensive behavior that is triggered by inescapable threat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Wide-Angle, Monocular Head Tracking using Passive Markers</a></h4>

              
                Camera images can encode large amounts of visual information of an animal and its environment, enabling high fidelity 3D reconstruction of the animal and its environment using computer vision methods. Most systems, both markerless (e.g. deep learning based) and marker-based, require multiple cameras to track features across multiple points of view to enable such 3D reconstruction. However, such systems can be expensive and are challenging to set up in small animal research apparatuses. We present an open-source, marker-based system for tracking the head of a rodent for behavioral research that requires only a single camera with a potentially wide field of view. The system features a lightweight visual target and computer vision algorithms that together enable high-accuracy tracking of the six-degree-of-freedom position and orientation of the animal's head. The system, which only requires a single camera positioned above the behavioral arena, robustly reconstructs the pose over a wide range of head angles (360 degrees in yaw, and approximately +/-120 degrees in roll and pitch). Experiments with live animals demonstrate that the system can reliably identifyrat head position and orientation. Evaluations using a commercial optical tracker device show that the system achieves accuracy that rivals commercial multi-camera systems. Our solution significantly improves upon existing monocular marker-based tracking methods, both in accuracy and in allowable range of motion. The proposed system enables the study of complex behaviors by providing robust, fine-scale measurements of rodent head motions in a wide range of orientations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Analysis and extension of exact mean-field theory with dynamic synaptic currents</a></h4>

              
                Neural mass models such as the Jansen-Rit system provide a practical framework for representing and interpreting electrophysiological activity in both local and global brain models. However, they are only partly derived from first principles. While the post-synaptic potential dynamics in NMM are inferred from data and can be grounded on diffusion physics, Freeman's ''wave to pulse'' sigmoid, used to transduce mean population membrane potential into firing rate, rests on a weaker theoretical standing. On the other hand, Montbrio et al derive an exact mean-field theory (MPR) from a quadratic integrate and fire neuron model under some simplifying assumptions, thereby connecting microscale neural mechanisms and meso/macroscopic phenomena. The MPR model can be seen to replace Freeman's sigmoid function with a pair of differential equations for the mean membrane potential and firing rate variables---a dynamical transfer function---, providing a mechanistic interpretation of NMM semi-empirical sigmoid parameters. In doing so, we show it sheds light on the mechanisms behind enhanced network response to weak but uniform perturbations: in the exact mean-field theory, intrinsic population connectivity modulates the steady-state firing rate transfer function in a monotonic manner, with increasing self-connectivity leading to higher firing rates. This provides a plausible mechanism for the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak, uniform inputs such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain stimulation. The new, dynamic transfer function also endows the neural mass model with a form of ``inertia'', an intrinsic delay to external inputs that depends on, e.g., self-coupling strength and state of the system. Next, we complete the MPR model by adding the second-order equations for delayed post-synaptic currents, bringing together the MPR and the usual NMM formalisms into a unified exact mean-field theory (NMM2) displaying rich dynamical features. As an example, we analyze the dynamics of a single population model, and a model of two coupled populations with a simple excitation-inhibition (E-I) architecture, showing it displays rich dynamics with limit cycles, period doubling, bursting behavior, and enhanced sensitivity to external inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Response outcome gates the effect of spontaneous cortical state fluctuations on perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Sensory responses of cortical neurons are more discriminable when evoked on a baseline of desynchronized spontaneous activity, but cortical desynchronization has not generally been associated with more accurate perceptual decisions. Here we show that mice perform more accurate auditory judgements when activity in the auditory cortex is elevated and desynchronized before stimulus onset, but only if the previous trial was an error, and that this relationship is occluded if previous outcome is ignored. We confirmed that the outcome-dependent effect of brain state on performance is neither due to idiosyncratic associations between the slow components of either signal, nor to the existence of specific cortical states evident only after errors. Instead, errors appear to gate the effect of cortical state fluctuations on discrimination accuracy. Neither facial movements nor pupil size during the baseline were associated with accuracy, but they were predictive of measures of responsivity, such as the probability of not responding to the stimulus or of responding prematurely. These results suggest that the functional role of cortical state on behavior is dynamic and constantly regulated by performance monitoring systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor learning in reaching tasks leads to homogenization of task space error distribution</a></h4>

              
                A human arm, up to the wrist, is often modelled as a redundant 7 degree-of-freedom serial robot. Despite its inherent nonlinearity, we can perform point-to-point reaching tasks reasonably fast and with reasonable accuracy in the presence of external disturbances and noise. In this work, we take a closer look at the task space error during point-to-point reaching tasks and learning during an external force-field perturbation. From experiments and quantitative data, we confirm a directional dependence of the peak task space error with certain directions showing larger errors than others at the start of a force-field perturbation, and the larger errors are reduced with repeated trials implying learning. The analysis of the experimental data further shows that a) the distribution of the peak error is made more uniform across directions with trials and the error magnitude and distribution approaches the value when no perturbation is applied, b) the redundancy present in the human arm is used more in the direction of the larger error, and c) homogenization of the error distribution is not seen when the reaching task is performed with the non-dominant hand. The results support the hypothesis that not only magnitude of task space error, but the directional dependence is reduced during motor learning and the workspace is homogenized possibly to increase the control efficiency and accuracy in point-to-point reaching tasks. The results also imply that redundancy in the arm is used to homogenize the workspace, and additionally since the bio-mechanically similar dominant and non-dominant arms show different behaviours, the homogenizing is actively done in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep spindles track cortical learning patterns for memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation, the transformation of labile memory traces into stable long-term representations, is facilitated by post-learning sleep. Computational and biophysical models suggest that sleep spindles may play a key mechanistic role for consolidation, igniting structural changes at cortical sites involved in prior learning. Here we tested the resulting prediction that spindles are most pronounced over learning-related cortical areas and that the extent of this learning-spindle overlap predicts behavioural measures of memory consolidation. Using high-density scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) and Polysomnography (PSG) in healthy volunteers, we first identified cortical areas engaged during a temporospatial associative memory task (power decreases in the alpha/beta frequency range, 6-20 Hz). Critically, we found that participant-specific topographies (i.e., spatial distributions) of post-learning sleep spindle amplitude correlated with participant-specific learning topographies. Importantly, the extent to which spindles tracked learning patterns further predicted memory consolidation across participants. Our results provide empirical evidence for a role of post-learning sleep spindles in tracking learning networks, thereby facilitating memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity of fMRI using differential covariance predicts structural connectivity and behavioral reaction times</a></h4>

              
                Recordings from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) reflect the influence of pathways between brain areas. A wide range of methods have been proposed to measure this functional connectivity (FC), but the lack of ''ground truth'' has made it difficult to systematically validate them. Most measures of FC produce connectivity estimates that are symmetrical between brain areas. Differential covariance (dCov) is an algorithm for analyzing FC with directed graph edges. Applied to synthetic datasets, dCov-FC was more effective than covariance and partial correlation in reducing false positive connections and more accurately matching the underlying structural connectivity. When we applied dCov-FC to resting state fMRI recordings from the human connectome project (HCP) and anesthetized mice, dCov-FC accurately identified strong cortical connections from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) in individual humans and viral tract tracing in mice. In addition, those HCP subjects whose rs-fMRI were more integrated, as assessed by a graph-theoretic measure, tended to have shorter reaction times in several behavioral tests. Thus, dCov-FC was able to identify anatomically verified connectivity that yielded measures of brain integration causally related to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glial TGFβ activity promotes axon survival in peripheral nerves</a></h4>

              
                Axons can represent the majority of the volume of a neuron and are energetically very demanding. Specialized glia ensheathe axons and are believed to support axon function and maintenance throughout life, but molecular details of glia-neuron support mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we identify a collection of secreted and transmembrane genes that are required in glia for long-term axon survival in vivo. We show that key components of the TGF{beta} superfamily are required cell-autonomously in glia for peripheral nerve maintenance, although their loss does not disrupt glial morphology. We observe age-dependent neurodegeneration in the absence of glial TGF{beta} signaling that can be rescued by genetic blockade of Wallerian degeneration. Our data argue that glial TGF{beta} signaling normally acts to promote axon survival and suppress neurodegeneration.

Significance StatementAxon maintenance is critical to preserving the functional integrity of the nervous system across animal lifespan. Glia contribute to axon maintenance, but their precise roles remain to be fully characterized. We identify glial genes that regulate axon support and provide new molecular insight into the means by which glia promote axon survival, which may help explain why neurodegeneration occurs when glia are lost in disease. We show that TGF{beta} signaling in mature glia is essential for long-term maintenance of axons, and that loss of TGF{beta} signaling activates an axon death signaling pathway.

	<p>Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered common facilitating factors, along with other infections, in triggering febrile seizures (FS). The main purpose of our study was to identify specific inflammatory patterns of UTI cases from other infections in a specific cluster, using a combination of inflammatory biomarkers to differentiate UTIs from other bacterial diseases triggering FS. Method: This prospective study included a number of 136 patients with 197 distinct FS events, from patients hospitalized in the Pediatric Clinical Hospital Sibiu, among which 10.2% were diagnosed with UTIs. Results: In one-third of the patients with UTIs (20 cases), the symptoms were limited to fever and FS. Using two-step cluster analysis, a distinct UTI inflammatory pattern has emerged: highest platelet values (PLT), median value 331 × 103/mm3 and intermediate C-reactive protein (CRP), median value 15 mg/dL, platelet distribution width (PDW), median value 9.65%, platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR), median value 14.45%, mean platelet volume (MPV), median value 8.60 fL and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte values (NLR), median value 3.64. Furthermore, higher PDW (median value 12.25%), P-LCR (median value 28.55%), MPV (median value 10.40 fL), CRP (median value 74.00 mg/dL) and NLR values (median value 4.11) were associated mainly (85.7%) with bacterial lower respiratory infections. UTIs were highly unlikely in these patients with significantly increased CRP values and normal values of platelet indices. Conclusions: Considering the nonspecific clinical picture of UTIs at an early age, to optimize the management of FS, a fast diagnosis of UTI is mandatory. The analysis of the inflammatory biomarker clusters (rather than individual parameters) correlated with urine leukocyte and nitrite stick evaluation for specific age groups could help in identifying even oligosymptomatic UTIs patients. The study limitation (20 UTI cases) recommends future multicentric trials on larger datasets to validate the model.</p>

	<p>Music perception deficits are common following acquired brain injury due to stroke, epilepsy surgeries, and aneurysmal clipping. Few studies have examined these deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI), resulting in an under-diagnosis in this population. We aimed to (1) compare TBI patients to controls on pitch and rhythm perception during the acute phase; (2) determine whether pitch and rhythm perception disorders co-occur; (3) examine lateralization of injury in the context of pitch and rhythm perception; and (4) determine the relationship between verbal short-term memory (STM) and pitch and rhythm perception. Music perception was examined using the Scale and Rhythm tests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, in association with CT scans to identify lesion laterality. Verbal short-term memory was examined using Digit Span Forward. TBI patients had greater impairment than controls, with 43% demonstrating deficits in pitch perception, and 40% in rhythm perception. Deficits were greater with right hemisphere damage than left. Pitch and rhythm deficits co-occurred 31% of the time, suggesting partly dissociable networks. There was a dissociation between performance on verbal STM and pitch and rhythm perception 39 to 42% of the time (respectively), with most individuals (92%) demonstrating intact verbal STM, with impaired pitch or rhythm perception. The clinical implications of music perception deficits following TBI are discussed.</p>

	<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), the early detection of disease activity or progression is key to inform treatment changes and could be supported by digital tools. We present a novel CE-marked and FDA-cleared digital care management platform consisting of (1) a patient phone/web application and healthcare professional portal (icompanion) including validated symptom, disability, cognition, and fatigue patient-reported outcomes; and (2) clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantifications (icobrain ms). We validate both tools using their ability to detect (sub)clinical disease activity (known-groups validity) and real-world data insights. Surveys showed that 95.6% of people with MS (PwMS) were interested in using an MS app, and 98.2% were interested in knowing about MRI changes. The icompanion measures of disability (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and symptoms (p = 0.005) and icobrain ms MRI parameters were sensitive to (sub)clinical differences between MS subtypes. icobrain ms also decreased intra- and inter-rater lesion count variability and increased sensitivity for detecting disease activity/progression from 24% to 76% compared to standard radiological reading. This evidence shows PwMS’ interest, the digital care platform’s potential to improve the detection of (sub)clinical disease activity and care management, and the feasibility of linking different digital tools into one overarching MS care pathway.</p>

	<p>Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have been accumulating adverse psychological symptoms due to the closure of educational centers and the need to adapt to different teaching modalities. Methods: Medline and PubMed were searched for studies on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and burn-out in teachers, published from 1 December 2019 to 15 June 2021. Results: In total, eight studies were included in this study. The results show that teachers report levels of anxiety (17%), depression (19%), and stress (30%). In Asia, there has been more anxiety compared to other continents. Overall, anxiety has been higher among teachers in schools compared to universities. However, stress levels have been higher among teachers in universities compared to schools. Statistically, there were no significant differences regarding gender and age in any of the symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest that teachers at different educational levels are experiencing adverse psychological symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that anxiety levels vary between different countries. However, more international studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the pandemic on teachers’ mental health.</p>

	<p>Sleep problems have a bi-directional impact on the daytime performance of children, parental well-being, and overall family functioning in the general population. Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at a high risk of sleep problems, yet the relationship between sleep problems, adaptive functioning, and family stress in children with DS is not well documented. We examined the relationship between sleep (i.e., duration and quality) and child and parent/family functioning. Sixty-six children with DS wore an actigraph for a week to assess their sleep duration and sleep efficiency. Their parents completed ratings on child sleep duration and parasomnias, child adaptive functioning, parental depression and sleep, and family stress. The parents’ reports of their children’s sleep duration were associated with parental depressive symptoms. The parents’ reports of their children’s restless sleep behaviors were associated with poorer performances in child-compliant/calm behaviors, worse parental sleep, and negative parental feelings and sibling relationships. The findings from actigraph measures of the children’s sleep demonstrated that greater sleep efficiency was associated with greater child adaptive functioning and fewer parental depressive symptoms. The study findings provide preliminary evidence that sleep problems are related to child adaptive functioning, parental functioning, and family stress in children with DS.</p>

	<p>Objective: There is limited literature comparing the uniportal full endoscopic posterolateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion outside-in approach (ETLIF (O)) with the inside-out approach (ETLIF (I)). Methods: Radiological evaluation was performed on disc height restoration and coronal wedging angle, and operation time (inferior articular process resection time/total operation time) and clinical evaluation were made. Result: 48 cases of inside-out and 38 cases of outside-in cases were included. Compared to inside-out, the outside-in approach had significantly less operative time required to resect inferior articular process: 36.55 ± 10.37, and total operative time: 87.45 ± 20.14 min compared to 49.83 ± 23.97 and 102.56 ± 36.53 min, respectively, for the inside-out approach, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Compared to the preoperative state, both cohorts achieved significant improvement of VAS and ODI at post-operative 1 week, 3 months and at final follow up. Both cohorts achieved statistically significant increased disc height with 5.00 ± 2.87 mm, 5.49 ± 2.33 mm and statistically significant improvement in coronal wedge angle with 1.76 ± 1.63°, 3.24 ± 2.92° in the inside-out and outside-in approaches respectively. Conclusions: Complete removal of inferior articular process is the key part of endoscopic fusion with two methods that can be applied: an inside-out approach or an outside-in approach. Comparing both techniques, the outside-in approach has a shorter operative time required for inferior articular process resection and total length of operation with similar good clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>
