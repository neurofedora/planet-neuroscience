              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14-16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 hours post-inoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using In situ Hybridization and/or Immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt;50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker TpH2. Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated GABA transporter VGAT with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early evoked brain activity underlies auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: People with Schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits in auditory and audiovisual speech recognition. It is possible that these deficits are related to aberrant early sensory processing, combined with an impaired ability to utilize visual cues to improve speech recognition. In this electroencephalography study we tested this by having SZ and healthy controls (HC) identify different unisensory auditory and bisensory audiovisual syllables at different auditory noise levels. Methods: SZ (N = 24) and HC (N = 21) identified one of three different syllables (/da/, /ga/, /ta/) at three different noise levels (no, low, high). Half the trials were unisensory auditory and the other half provided additional visual input of moving lips. Task-evoked mediofrontal N1 and P2 brain potentials triggered to the onset of the auditory syllables were derived and related to behavioral performance. Results: In comparison to HC, SZ showed speech recognition deficits for unisensory and bisensory stimuli. These deficits were primarily found in the no noise condition. Paralleling these observations, reduced N1 amplitudes to unisensory and bisensory stimuli in SZ were found in the no noise condition. In HC the N1 amplitudes were positively related to the speech recognition performance, whereas no such relationships were found in SZ. Moreover, no group differences in multisensory speech recognition benefits and N1 suppression effects for bisensory stimuli were observed. Conclusion: Our study shows that reduced N1 amplitudes relate to auditory and audiovisual speech processing deficits in SZ. The findings that the amplitude effects were confined to salient speech stimuli and the attenuated relationship with behavioral performance, compared to HC, indicates a diminished decoding of the auditory speech signals in SZs. Our study also revealed intact multisensory benefits in SZs, which indicates that the observed auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits were primarily related to aberrant auditory speech processing.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuropathological Variability within a Spectrum of NMDAR‐Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe the neuropathological features of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-encephalitis in an archival autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined four autopsies from patients with NMDAR-encephalitis; two patients were untreated, three had comorbidities: small cell lung cancer, brain post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and overlapping demyelination.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two untreated patients had inflammatory infiltrates predominantly composed of perivascular and parenchymal CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>−</sup> T cells and CD79a<sup>+</sup> B cells/plasma cells in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus with surrounding white matter. The hippocampi showed a significant decrease of NMDAR-immunoreactivity that correlated with disease severity. The patient with NMDAR-encephalitis and immunosuppression for kidney transplantation developed a brain monomorphic PTLD. Inflammatory changes were compatible with NMDAR-encephalitis. Additionally, plasma cells accumulated in the vicinity of the necrotic tumor along with macrophages and activated microglia that strongly expressed pro-inflammatory activation markers HLA-DR, CD68, and IL18. The fourth patient developed demyelinating lesions in the setting of a relapse 4 years after NMDAR-encephalitis. These lesions exhibited the hallmarks of classic multiple sclerosis with radially expanding lesions and remyelinated shadow plaques without complement or immunoglobulin deposition, compatible with a pattern I demyelination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The topographic distribution of inflammation in patients with NMDAR-encephalitis reflects the clinical symptoms of movement disorders, abnormal behavior, and memory dysfunction with inflammation dominantly observed in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, and loss of NMDAR-immunoreactivity correlates with disease severity. Co-occurring pathologies influence the spatial distribution, composition, and intensity of inflammation, which may modify patients’ clinical presentation and outcome.

                <p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody (Ab)–associated diseases (MOGADs) account for a substantial proportion of pediatric and adult patients who present with acquired demyelinating disorders. Its pathogenesis and optimal therapy are incompletely understood. We profiled systemic complement activation in adult and pediatric patients with MOGAD compared with patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and pediatric control and adult healthy donors. Proteins indicative of systemic classical and alternative complement activation were substantially increased in patients with MOGAD compared to control groups. Elevated levels were detected in both adult and pediatric cases and across all clinical syndromes. Complement inhibition should be explored for its therapeutic merit in patients with MOGAD.

                Although originally implicated in appetite and sleep/wakefulness, the hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system has now been demonstrably linked with motivated behavior. This highly plastic system responds to reward-associated environmental stimuli and becomes pathologically overactive in addicted states. Here, we provide a brief overview of the roles of the orexin system in reward-seeking and addiction, as well as potential therapeutic opportunities for substance use disorders based on normalizing orexin function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability and Stability Challenges in ABCD Task fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Trait stability of measures is an essential requirement for individual differences research. Functional MRI has been increasingly used in studies that rely on the assumption of trait stability, such as attempts to relate task related brain activation to individual differences in behavior and psychopathology. However, recent research using adult samples has questioned the trait stability of task-fMRI measures, as assessed by test-retest correlations. To date, little is known about trait stability of task fMRI in children. Here, we examined within-session reliability and longitudinal stability of task-fMRI using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using its tasks focused on reward processing, response inhibition, and working memory. We also evaluated the effects of factors potentially affecting reliability and stability. Reliability and stability [quantified via an intraclass correlation (ICC) that focuses on rank consistency] was poor in virtually all brain regions, with an average ICC of .078 and .054 for short (within-session) and long-term (between-session) ICCs, respectively, in regions of interest (ROIs) historically-recruited by the tasks. ICC values in ROIs did not exceed the 'poor' cut-off of .4, and in fact rarely exceeded .2 (only 5.9%). Motion had a pronounced effect on estimated ICCs, with the lowest motion quartile of participants having a mean reliability/stability three times higher (albeit still 'poor') than the highest motion quartile. Regions with stronger activation tended to show higher ICCs, with the absolute value of activity and reliability/stability correlating at .53. Across regions, the magnitude of age-related longitudinal (between-session) changes positively correlated with the longitudinal stability of individual differences, which suggests developmental change was not necessarily responsible for poor stability. Poor reliability and stability of task-fMRI, particularly in children, diminishes potential utility of fMRI data due to a drastic reduction of effect sizes and, consequently, statistical power for the detection of brain-behavior associations. This essential issue needs to be addressed through optimization of preprocessing pipelines and data denoising methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating Network Threshold Selection for Structural and Functional Brain Connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Structural and functional brain connectomes represent macroscale neurophysical data collected through methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such data may contain noise that contribute to false positive edges, which motivates the use of edge-wise thresholding. Thresholding procedures are useful for reducing network density in graphs to retain only the most informative, non-noisy edges. Nevertheless, limited consensus exists on selecting appropriate threshold levels. We compare existing thresholding methods and introduce a novel thresholding approach in the context of MRI-derived and simulated brain connectomes. Performance is measured using normalized mutual information (NMI), a quantity robust to arbitrary changes in partition labeling, and describes the similarity of community structure between two node-matched networks. We found that the percolation-based threshold and our newly proposed objective function-based threshold exhibited the best performance in terms of NMI. We show an application of these two thresholding methods to real data that showed that both percolation-based and objective function-based thresholding provide statistically similar NMI values between real world FC networks and structural connectivity (SC) counterparts, where shared modular structure is assumed. The two thresholding methods, however, achieve these NMI values at significantly different thresholds (p<0.0001) in both simulated and real networks. Moreover, the threshold obtained from the objective function gives a more accurate estimate of the number of modules present in the network and includes more flexibility in threshold selection, suggesting that this method may represent a useful option for graph thresholding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mechanisms underlying anxiety-related deficits of attentional inhibition: direct ERP evidence from the Pd component</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral evidence shows that anxious individuals tend to be distracted by irrelevant stimulation not only for threat-related stimuli but also for non-emotional neutral stimuli. These findings suggest that anxious individuals may have a general impairment of attentional control, especially inhibition function. However, the neural mechanism underlying the anxiety-related impairment in attentional control is unclear. Here, in a visual search task with geometric stimuli, we examined attentional processing of the non-emotional neutral distractor on participants with different levels of anxiety, using the event-related-potential (ERP) indices of attentional selection (N2 posterior contralateral [N2pc]) and top-down inhibition (distractor positivity [Pd]). We found that distractor-evoked Pd amplitudes were negatively correlated with trait-anxiety scores, i.e., the higher the level of anxiety, the worse the ability of attentional inhibition. In contrast, the amplitudes of distractor-evoked N2pc did not vary with anxiety levels, suggesting that trait-anxiety level does not affect stimulus-driven attentional capture. We also observed attentional processing of target stimuli and found that the peak latency of target-evoked N2pc was delayed as anxiety levels rise, suggesting that anxiety impairs the efficiency of top-down attentional selection of the target. The present study provides direct neurophysiological evidence for general anxiety-related impairment of attentional control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-grooming promotes social interaction in mice via chemosensory communication</a></h4>

              
                Self-grooming is a stereotyped behavior displayed by nearly all animals. Among other established functions, self-grooming is implicated in social communication in some animals. However, whether self-grooming specifically influences behaviors of nearby individuals has not been directly tested, partly due to the technical challenge of inducing self-grooming in a reliable and temporally controllable manner. We recently found that optogenetic activation of dopamine D3 receptor expressing neurons in the ventral striatal islands of Calleja robustly induces orofacial grooming in mice. Using this optogenetic manipulation, here we demonstrate that observer mice display social preference for grooming over non-grooming mice regardless of biological sex. Moreover, grooming-induced social attraction depends on volatile chemosensory cues broadcasted from grooming mice. Collectively, our study establishes self-grooming as a means of promoting social interaction among mice via volatile cues, suggesting an additional benefit for animals to allocate a significant amount of time to this behavior.

                A long-term change in neurotransmitter release is a widely expressed mechanism controlling neural circuits in the mammalian brain. This presynaptic plasticity is commonly mediated by retrograde signaling whereby a messenger released from the postsynaptic neuron upon activity modifies neurotransmitter release in a long-term manner by targeting a presynaptic receptor. In the dentate gyrus (DG), the main input area of the hippocampus, granule cells (GCs) and mossy cells (MCs) form a recurrent excitatory circuit that is critically involved in DG function and epilepsy. Here, we identified adenosine/A2A receptor (A2AR) as a novel retrograde signaling system that mediates presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at MC-GC synapses. Using an adenosine sensor, we found that neuronal activity triggered phasic, postsynaptic TrkB-dependent release of adenosine. Additionally, epileptic seizures released adenosine in vivo, while removing A2ARs from DG decreased seizure susceptibility. Thus, adenosine/A2AR retrograde signaling mediates presynaptic LTP that may contribute to DG-dependent learning and promote epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF signaling in Hebbian and Stentian structural plasticity in the developing visual system</a></h4>

              
                During development, patterned neural activity in input neurons innervating their target, instructs topographic map refinement. Axons from adjacent neurons, firing with similar patterns of neural activity, converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners (Hebbian plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing of inputs promotes synaptic weakening and exploratory axonal growth (Stentian plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the visually-evoked correlation structure of neural activity in ectopic ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell axons with respect to their neighboring contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton imaging of the ipsi axons in the live tadpole, combined with manipulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB both promoted axonal branch addition during Stentian plasticity, whereas predominantly postsynaptic BDNF signaling mediated activity-dependent Hebbian suppression of axon branch addition. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling is required for local suppression of branch loss induced by correlated firing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability is actively regulated in speech</a></h4>

              
                Although movement variability is often attributed to unwanted noise in the motor system, recent work has demonstrated that variability may be actively controlled. To date, research on regulation of motor variability has relied on relatively simple, laboratory-specific reaching tasks. It is not clear how these results translate to complex, well-practiced and real-world tasks. Here, we test how variability is regulated during speech production, a complex, highly over-practiced and natural motor behavior that relies on auditory and somatosensory feedback. Specifically, in a series of four experiments, we assessed the effects of auditory feedback manipulations that modulate perceived speech variability, shifting every production either towards (inward-pushing) or away from (outward-pushing) the center of the distribution for each vowel. Participants exposed to the inward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 1) increased produced variability while the perturbation was applied as well as after it was removed. Unexpectedly, the outward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 2) also increased produced variability during exposure, but variability returned to near baseline levels when the perturbation was removed. Outward-pushing perturbations failed to reduce participants' produced variability both with larger perturbation magnitude (Experiment 3) or after their variability had increased above baseline levels as a result of the inward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 4). Simulations of the applied perturbations using a state space model of motor behavior suggest that the increases in produced variability in response to the two types of perturbations may arise through distinct mechanisms: an increase in controlled variability in response to the inward-pushing perturbation, and an increase in sensitivity to auditory errors in response to the outward-pushing perturbation. Together, these results suggest that motor variability is actively regulated even in complex and well-practiced behaviors, such as speech.

                The purpose of our study is to understand the impact of a partial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) on cognitive behavior, mitophagy/autophagy, mitochondrial and synaptic activities in transgenic Tau mice in Alzheimers disease (AD). Our lab reported increased levels of A{beta} and P-Tau, and abnormal interactions between A{beta} and Drp1, P-Tau and Drp1 induced increased mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced fusion and synaptic activities in AD. These abnormal interactions, result in the proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria in AD neurons. Recent research on mitochondria revealed that fission protein Drp1 is largely implicated in mitochondrial dynamics in AD. To determine the impact of reduced Drp1 in AD, we recently crossed transgenic Tau mice with Drp1 heterozygote knockout (Drp1+/-) mice and generated double mutant (Drp1+/- X Tau) mice. In the current study, we assessed cognitive behavior, mRNA and protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and synaptic genes, mitochondrial morphology & mitochondrial function, dendritic spines in Tau mice relative to double mutant mice. When compared to Tau mice, double mutant mice did better on Morris Maze (reduced latency to find hidden platform, increased swimming speed and time spent on quadrant) and rotarod (stayed a longer period of time) tests. Both mRNA and proteins levels autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic proteins were increased in double mutant mice compared to Tau mice. Dendritic spines were significantly increased; mitochondrial number is reduced and length is increased in double mutant mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that reduced Drp1 is beneficial in a symptomatic-transgenic Tau mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated skull stripping in mouse fMRI analysis using 3D U-Net</a></h4>

              
                Skull stripping is an initial and critical step in the pipeline of mouse fMRI analysis. Manual labeling of the brain usually suffers from intra- and inter-rater variability and is highly time-consuming. Hence, an automatic and efficient skull-stripping method is in high demand for mouse fMRI studies. In this study, we investigated a 3D U-Net based method for automatic brain extraction in mouse fMRI studies. Two U-Net models were separately trained on T2-weighted anatomical images and T2*-weighted functional images. The trained models were tested on both interior and exterior datasets. The 3D U-Net models yielded a higher accuracy in brain extraction from both T2-weighted images (Dice > 0.984, Jaccard index > 0.968 and Hausdorff distance < 7.7) and T2*-weighted images (Dice > 0.964, Jaccard index > 0.931 and Hausdorff distance < 3.3), compared with the two widely used mouse skull-stripping methods (RATS and SHERM). The resting-state fMRI results using automatic segmentation with the 3D U-Net models are identical to those obtained by manual segmentation for both the seed-based and group independent component analysis. These results demonstrate that the 3D U-Net based method can replace manual brain extraction in mouse fMRI analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hearing Ability of Prairie Voles (Microtus ochrogaster)</a></h4>

              
                Hearing ability of mammals can be impacted by many factors including social cues, environment, and physical properties of animal morphology. Despite being used commonly to study social behaviors, the hearing ability of the monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) has never been fully characterized. In this study, we measure morphological head and pinna features and use auditory brainstem responses to measure hearing ability of prairie voles characterizing monaural and binaural hearing and hearing range. Additionally, we measured unbonded male and female voles to characterize differences due to sex. We found that prairie voles have intermediate hearing ability with an optimal hearing range of 8 to 32 kHz, robust binaural hearing ability, and characteristic monaural ABRs. We show no differences between the sexes for binaural hearing or hearing range, however female voles have increased amplitude of peripheral ABR waves I and II and increased latency of wave IV. Our results confirm that prairie voles have both low and high frequency hearing, binaural hearing capability, and despite biparental care and monogamy, differences in processing of sound information between the sexes. These data further highlight the necessity to understand sex-specific differences in neural processing that may underly variability in behavioral responses between sexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of stimulation location relative to grey and white matter on single pulse electrical stimulation responses in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electrical neuromodulation is an increasingly common therapy for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. Unfortunately, therapeutic efficacy is inconsistent, possibly a result of our limited understanding of the mechanisms and the massive stimulation parameter space. Objective/Hypothesis: To better understand the role different parameters play in inducing a response, we systematically examined single pulse-induced cortico-cortico evoked potentials (CCEP) as a function of stimulation amplitude, duration and location in the brain and relative to grey and white matter. Methods: We measured voltage peak amplitudes and area under the curve of intracranially recorded stimulation responses as a function of distance from the stimulation site, pulse width, current injected, location relative to grey and white matter, and brain region stimulated (N=52, n=719 stimulation sites). Results: Increasing stimulation pulse width increased response values near the stimulation location. Increasing stimulation amplitude (current) increased responses nonlinearly. Locally (<15 mm from the stimulation site), stimulation closer to the grey matter-white matter boundary induced larger responses. In contrast, for distant sites (>15 mm), white matter stimulation consistently produced larger responses than stimulation in or near grey matter. These relationships were different between cingulate, lateral prefrontal, and lateral temporal cortical stimulation. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of location and stimulation parameters in inducing a specific output and indicate that a stronger local response may require stimulation in the grey-white boundary while stimulation in the white matter may be needed for network activation, suggesting that stimulation location can be tailored for a specific outcome, key to informed neuromodulatory therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vagus nerve stimulation increases stomach-brain coupling via a vagal afferent pathway</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining energy homeostasis is vital and supported by vagal signaling between digestive organs and the brain. Previous research has established a gastric network in the brain that is phase synchronized with the rhythm of the stomach, but tools to perturb its function were lacking. Here, we investigated the effect of acute right-sided transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) versus sham stimulation (randomized crossover-design) on stomach-brain coupling. In line with preclinical research, taVNS increased stomach-brain coupling in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the midbrain while boosting coupling across the brain. Crucially, in the cortex, taVNS-induced changes in coupling occurred primarily in transmodal regions and were associated with changes in hunger ratings as indicators of the subjective metabolic state. Hence, taVNS alters stomach-brain coupling via an NTS-midbrain pathway that signals gut-induced reward, potentially paving the way for novel treatments in disorders such as Parkinson's disease or depression.

                Paul Lauterbur closed his seminal paper on MRI with the statement that "zeugmatographic (imaging) techniques should find many useful applications in studies of the internal structures, states and composition of microscopic objects" {Lauterbur, 1973 #967}. Magnetic resonance microscopy was subsequently demonstrated in 1986 by three groups{Aguayo, 1986 #968}{Eccles, 1986 #969}{Johnson, 1986 #970}. The application of MRI to the study of tissue structure, i.e. magnetic resonance histology (MRH) was suggested in 1993 {Johnson, 1993 #957}. MRH, while based on the same physical principals as MRI is something fundamentally different than the clinical exams which are typically limited to voxel dimensions of ~ 1 mm3. Preclinical imaging systems can acquire images with voxels ~ 1000 times smaller. The MR histology images presented here have been acquired at yet another factor of 1000 increase in spatial resolution. Figure S1 in the supplement shows a comparison of a state-of-the-art fractional anisotropy images of a C57 mouse brain in vivo @ 150 um resolution (voxel volume of 3.3 x10-3 mm3) with the atlas we have generated for this work at 15 um spatial resolution (voxel volume of 3.3 x 10-6 mm3). In previous work, we have demonstrated the utility of MR histology in neurogenetics at spatial/angular resolution of 45 um /46 angles {Wang N, 2020 #972}. At this spatial/angular resolution it is possible to map whole brain connectivity with high correspondence to retroviral tracers {Calabrese, 2015 #895}. But the MRH derived connectomes can be derived in less than a day where the retroviral tracer studies require months/years {Oh, 2014 #971}. The resolution index (angular samples/voxel volume) for this previous work was >500,000 {Johnson, 2018 #894}. Figure S2 shows a comparison between that previous work and the new atlas presented in this paper with a resolution index of 32 million. Light sheet microscopy (LSM) has undergone similar rapid evolution over the last 20 years. The invention of tissue clearing, advances in immuno histochemistry and development of selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) now make it possible to acquire whole mouse brain images at submicron spatial resolution with a vast array of cell specific markers{Ueda, 2020 #974}{Park, 2018 #953}{Murray, 2015 #952}{Gao, 2014 #973}. And these advantages can be realized in scan times of < 6hrs. The major limitation from these studies is the distortion in the tissue from dissection from the cranium, swelling from clearing and staining, and tissue damage from handling. We report here the merger of these two methods: 1. MRH with the brain in the skull to provide accurate geometry, cytoarchitectural measures using scalar imaging metrics and whole brain connectivity at 15 um isotropic spatial resolution with super resolution track density images @ 5 um isotropic resolution; 2. whole brain multichannel LSM @ 1.8x1.8x4.0 um; 3. a big image data infrastructure that enables label mapping from the atlas to the MR image, geometric correction to the light sheet data, label mapping to the light sheet volumes and quantitative extraction of regional cell density. These methods make it possible to generate a comprehensive collection of image derived phenotypes (IDP) of cells and circuits covering the whole mouse brain with throughput that can be scaled for quantitative neurogenetics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CCR5 closes the temporal window for memory linking</a></h4>

              
                Real world memories are formed in a particular context and are not acquired or recalled in isolation. Time is a key variable in the organization of memories, since events experienced close in time are more likely to be meaningfully associated, while those experienced with a longer interval are not. How does the brain segregate events that are temporally distinct? Here, we report that a delayed (12-24h) increase in the expression of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), an immune receptor well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection, following the formation of a contextual memory, determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories. This delayed CCR5 expression in mouse dorsal CA1 (dCA1) neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, thus closing the temporal window for memory linking. Remarkably, our findings also show that an age-related increase in CCL5/CCR5 expression leads to impairments in memory linking in aged mice, which could be reversed with a CCR5 knockout and an FDA approved drug that inhibits this receptor, a result with significant clinical implications. All together the findings reported here provide the first insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that shape the temporal window for memory linking.

                Neurons in parietal cortex exhibit task-related activity during decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear how long-term training to perform different tasks over months or even years shapes neural computations and representations. We examine lateral intraparietal area (LIP) responses during a visual motion delayed-match-to-category (DMC) task. We consider two pairs of monkeys with different training histories: one trained only on the DMC task, and another first trained to perform fine motion-direction discrimination. We introduce generalized multilinear models to quantify low-dimensional, task-relevant components in population activity. During the DMC task, we found stronger cosine-like motion-direction tuning in the pretrained monkeys than in the DMC-only monkeys, and that the pretrained monkeys' performance depended more heavily on sample-test stimulus similarity. These results suggest that sensory representations in LIP depend on the sequence of tasks that the animals have learned, underscoring the importance of training history in studies with complex behavioral tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Light-induced asymmetries in the embryonic retina are mediated by the vascular system and extracellular matrix</a></h4>

              
                Left-right asymmetries in the nervous system (lateralisation) influence a broad range of behaviours, from social responses to navigation and language. The role and pathways of endogenous and environmental mechanisms in the ontogeny of lateralisation remains to be established. The domestic chick is a model of both endogenous and experience-induced lateralisation driven by light exposure. Following the endogenous rightward rotation of the embryo, the asymmetrical position in the egg results in a greater exposure of the right eye to environmental light. To identify the genetic pathways activated by asymmetric light stimulation, and their time course, we exposed embryos to different light regimes: darkness, 6 hours of light and 24 hours of light. We used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in the right and left retinas and telencephalon. As expected, no differential expression between left and right was present in darkness. We detected differential gene expression in right vs left retina after 6 hours of light exposure. This difference disappeared before 24 hours of light exposure, suggesting that light-induced activation is a self-terminating phenomenon. This transient effect of light exposure was associated with a downregulation of the sensitive-period mediator gene DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2) in the right retina. No differences between genes expressed in the right vs. left telencephalon were detected. Gene networks associated with lateralisation were connected to vascularisation, cell motility, and the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, we know that the extracellular matrix - including the differentially expressed PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor {beta}) gene - is involved in both sensitive periods and in the endogenous chiral mechanism of primary cilia, that drives lateralisation. Our data show a similarity between endogenous and experience-driven lateralisation, identifying functional gene networks that affect lateralisation in a specific time window.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">iLQR-VAE : control-based learning of input-driven dynamics with applications to neural data</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural dynamics give rise to behaviour is one of the most fundamental questions in systems neuroscience. To achieve this, a common approach is to record neural populations in behaving animals, and model these data as emanating from a latent dynamical system whose state trajectories can then be related back to behavioural observations via some form of decoding. As recordings are typically performed in localized circuits that form only a part of the wider implicated network, it is important to simultaneously learn the local dynamics and infer any unobserved external input that might drive them. Here, we introduce iLQR-VAE, a novel control-based approach to variational inference in nonlinear dynamical systems, capable of learning both latent dynamics, initial conditions, and ongoing external inputs. As in recent deep learning approaches, our method is based on an input-driven sequential variational autoencoder (VAE). The main novelty lies in the use of the powerful iterative linear quadratic regulator algorithm (iLQR) in the recognition model. Optimization of the standard evidence lower-bound requires differentiating through iLQR solutions, which is made possible by recent advances in differentiable control. Importantly, having the recognition model implicitly defined by the generative model greatly reduces the number of free parameters and allows for flexible, high-quality inference. This makes it possible for instance to evaluate the model on a single long trial after training on smaller chunks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iLQR-VAE on a range of synthetic systems, with autonomous as well as input-driven dynamics. We further show state-of-the-art performance on neural and behavioural recordings in non-human primates during two different reaching tasks.

                In a recent bioRxiv preprint, Ott et al. argue that sensitivities to sunk costs that have been reported in two serial foraging tasks (the Restaurant Row task in mice and rats, and the Web-Surf task in humans) may be due to simple consequences of the way that subjects perform these tasks and not due to an actual sensitivity to sunk costs. However, several variants of these tasks have been studied, in which the sensitivity to sunk costs changes. In order to test the Ott et al. model against these experimental observations, we simulated the model under these additional experimental conditions. We find that it is incompatible with the actual data. While we applaud the simplicity of the Ott et al. model, we must reject it as an explanation for the observed sensitivity to sunk costs seen in these tasks. We thus conclude that the alternative explanation - that mice, rats, and humans are sensitive to actual sunk costs in these tasks - is a better explanation for the data.

                Bitterlings are a group of teleost fish (Cyprinifromes: Acheilanathidae) notable for their brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos develop as parasites inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about brain development in this species. Here, we have imaged the development of the brain of the Rosy Bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus) at four embryonic stages (165, 185, 210, 235 hours post-fertilization) using micro-computed tomography (microCT) with special emphasis on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization. We provide a detailed neuroanatomical account of the development of the brain divisions with reference to The Atlas of Early zebrafish Brain Development and the updated prosomeric model. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system were performed in order to clarify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. During early embryonic and larval development, we find that histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all recognizable using microCT. Importantly, our approach is validated by the fact that the profile of CT values displayed here in the bitterling brain are consistent with genoarchitecture identified in previous studies. We also find developmental heterochrony of the inferior lobe in the Rosy Bitterling compared to the zebrafish. Our study provides a foundation for future studies of the brain development in the Rosy Bitterling, a valuable model species for studying the evolutionary adaptations associated with brood parasitism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning from the physical consequences of our actions improves motor memory</a></h4>

              
                Actions have consequences. Motor learning involves correcting actions that lead to movement errors and remembering these actions for future behavior. In most laboratory situations, movement errors have no physical consequences and simply indicate the progress of learning. Here we asked how experiencing a physical consequence when making a movement error affects motor learning. Two groups of participants adapted to a new, prism-induced mapping between visual input and motor output while performing a precision walking task. Importantly, one group experienced an unexpected slip perturbation when making foot-placement errors during adaptation. Because of our innate drive for safety, and the fact that balance is fundamental to movement, we hypothesized that this experience would enhance motor memory. Learning generalized to different walking tasks to a greater extent in the group who experienced the adverse physical consequence. This group also showed faster relearning one week later despite exposure to a competing mapping during initial learning--evidence of greater memory consolidation. The group differences in generalization and consolidation occurred even though they both experienced similar magnitude foot-placement errors and adapted at similar rates. Our results suggest the brain considers the potential physical consequences of movement error when learning and that balance-threatening consequences serve to enhance this process.

                There has been considerable interest in the development of the amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) given the central role of these brain regions in emotional processes. While several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes across the first two decades of life, they have typically employed cross-sectional designs, and findings have been mixed. Additionally, analytic choices may contribute to discrepancies across studies. Here we used an accelerated longitudinal design to examine task-evoked changes in amygdala-mPFC circuitry from 4-22 years of age (N=98; 183 total scans; 1-3 scans per participant). Participants were recruited from the greater Los Angeles area, and completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task designed to be appropriate for the wide age range. 'Multiverse' analyses examined the robustness of our findings to fMRI analysis choices. 2808 parallel analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found evidence for average age-related decreases in amygdala reactivity to faces. Greater amygdala reactivity at younger ages was attributable to elevated responses during the first few trials relative to later trials. Within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity with age could not be differentiated from between-participant differences, however. Across analysis decision points, we did not find consistent evidence of age-related change in amygdala-mPFC connectivity through generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) or beta-series correlation (BSC) methods. We also did not find evidence for associations between separation anxiety behaviors and amygdala reactivity or amygdala-mPFC connectivity. Within the context of this faces task and age range, age-related changes in amygdala reactivity were more robust to processing pipeline than were task-evoked functional connectivity measures, particularly those using gPPI. These findings highlight both the challenges in estimating developmental change in longitudinal cohorts and the value of multiverse approaches in developmental neuroimaging for assessing robustness of results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A bias generating temporal distortions in serial perception</a></h4>

              
                A precise estimation of event timing is essential for survival. Yet, temporal distortions are ubiquitous in our daily sensory experience. A specific type of temporal distortion is the time order error (TOE), which occurs when estimating the duration of events organized in a series. TOEs shrink or dilate objective event duration. Understanding the mechanics of subjective time distortions is fundamental since we perceive events in a series, not in isolation. In previous work, we showed that TOEs appear when discriminating small duration differences (20 or 60 ms) between two short events (Standard, S and Comparison, C), but only if the interval between events is shorter than 1 second. TOEs have been variously attributed to sensory desensitization, reduced temporal attention, poor sensory weighting of C relative to S, or idiosyncratic response bias. Surprisingly, the serial dynamics of relative event duration were never considered as a factor generating TOEs. In two experiments we tested them by swapping the order of presentation of S and C. Bayesian hierarchical modelling showed that TOEs emerge when the first event in a series is shorter than the second event, independently of event type (S or C), sensory precision or individual response bias. Participants disproportionately expanded first-position shorter events. Significantly fewer errors were made when the first event was objectively longer, confirming the inference of a strong bias in perceiving ordered event durations. Our finding identifies a hitherto unknown duration-dependent encoding inefficiency in human serial perception.

There are limited efficacious therapies to save lives despite CA being such a lethal disease process. Surviving patients suffer extensive brain damage with mitochondrial dysfunction implicated as a major source of injury. Metformin, a first-line treatment for diabetes, has also shown promising results in other diseases and is known to interact with mitochondria. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic benefits of metformin administration immediately after resuscitation using a 10 min asphxyial-CA rat model. This is the first study to show that metformin treatment post-CA a) improves survival and neurologic function, b) potentiates early normalization of brain electrophysiologic activity, and c) protects mitochondrial function with a reduction in apoptotic brain injury. Overall, as an effective and safe drug, metformin has the potential to be an easily translatable intervention for improving survival and preventing brain damage after CA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterogeneity and developmental dynamics of LYVE-1 perivascular macrophages distribution in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain perivascular macrophages (PVMs) belong to border-associated macrophages. PVMs are situated along blood vessels in the Virchow-Robin space and are thus found at a unique anatomical position between the endothelium and the parenchyma. Owing to their location and phagocytic capabilities, PVMs are regarded as important components that regulate various aspects of brain physiology in health and pathophysiological states. Here, used LYVE-1 to identify PVMs in the mouse brain. We used brain-tissue sections and cleared whole-brain to learn how they are distributed within the brain and across different developmental postnatal stages. We find that LYVE-1+ PVMs associate with the vasculature in a brain-region-dependent manner, where the hippocampus shows the highest density of LYVE-1+ PVMs. We show that their postnatal distribution is developmentally dynamic and peaks at P10-P20 depending on the brain region. We further demonstrate that their density is reduced in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimers Disease. In conclusion, our results show an unexpected heterogeneity and dynamics of LYVE-1+ PVMs, and support an important role for this population of PVMs during development and in regulating brain functions in steady-state and disease conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disrupted intrinsic connectivity links to language and social deficits in toddlers with autism</a></h4>

              
                Social and language abilities are closely intertwined during early development. Yet, it is still unknown how neural features underlying early social and language deficits are linked in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We examined functional connectivity of left and right temporal language regions and its correlations with language and social abilities in a cohort of 1-4 years old toddlers (52 ASD/34 non-ASD). Further, ASD toddlers were stratified into those who strongly prefer social visual stimuli (ASDSoc) vs. those who do not (ASDnonSoc) based on performance on an eye-tracking paradigm. In non-ASD toddlers, connectivity between temporal regions and other language- and social-related cortical regions was significantly correlated with language, communication, and social scores. Conversely, ASD toddlers showed atypical correlations between temporal-visual cortex (cuneus) connectivity and communication ability. This temporal-visual connectivity was also correlated with social visual attention in ASDnonSoc but not in ASDSoc toddlers. These findings suggest language- and social-related functional connectivity was not correlated with language and social functions in ASD toddlers. Abnormal engagement of temporal-visual cortex connectivity may be an early-age signature of ASD and may help explain why interventions targeting social skills and language are so challenging, particularly in those with poor social engagement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Txn1 mutation causes epilepsy associated with vacuolar degeneration in the midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Thioredoxin (TXN), encoded by Txn1, acts as a critical antioxidant in the defense against oxidative stress by regulating the dithiol/disulfide balance of interacting proteins. The role of TXN in the central nervous system (CNS) is largely unknown. A phenotype-driven study of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutated rats with running seizures at around five-week of age revealed the relevance of Txn1 mutations to CNS disorders. Genetic mapping identified Txn1-F54L in epileptic rats. The insulin-reducing activity of Txn1-F54L rats was approximately one-third that of the wild-type. Vacuolar degeneration in the midbrain, mainly in the thalamus and the inferior colliculus, was observed in the Txn1-F54L rats. The lesions displayed neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell death. Neurons in Txn1-F54L rats showed morphological changes in the mitochondria. Vacuolar degeneration began at three weeks of age, and spontaneous repair began at seven weeks; a dramatic change from cell death to repair occurred in the midbrain during a restricted period. In conclusion, Txn1 is essential for the development of the midbrain in juvenile rats.

                Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are highly self-renewing, resistant to therapy, and are able to form lethal tumors1,2. Tumor organoids have been developed to study tumor evolution1-4, and while GSCs can form organoids for glioblastoma multiforme, our understanding of their intrinsic immune, metabolic, genetic, and molecular programs is limited. To address this, we deeply characterized GSC-derived GBM organoids using a modified protocol (GBMOsm) from several patient-derived GSCs and found they develop into complex 3D tissues with unique self-organization, cancerous metabolic states, and burdensome genetic landscapes. We discovered that GBMOsc recapitulate the presence of two important cell populations thought to drive GBM progression, SATB2+ and HOPX+ progenitors. Despite being devoid of immune cells, transcriptomic analysis across GBMOsc revealed an immune-like molecular program, enriched in cytokine, antigen presentation and processing, T-cell receptor inhibitors, and interferon genes. We determined that SATB2+ and HOPX+ populations contribute to this immune and interferon landscape in GBM in vivo and GBMOsm. Our work deepens our understanding of the intrinsic molecular and cellular architecture of GSC-derived GBMO and defines a novel GBMOsm intrinsic immune-like program.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A robust receptive field code for optic flow detection and decomposition during self-motion</a></h4>

              
                The perception of optic flow is essential for any visually guided behavior of a moving animal. To mechanistically predict behavior and understand the emergence of self-motion perception in vertebrate brains, it is essential to systematically characterize the motion receptive fields (RFs) of optic flow processing neurons. Here, we present the fine-scale RFs of thousands of motion-sensitive neurons studied in the diencephalon and the midbrain of zebrafish. We found neurons that serve as linear filters and robustly encode directional and speed information of translation-induced optic flow. These neurons are topographically arranged in pretectum according to translation direction. The unambiguous encoding of translation enables the decomposition of translational and rotational self-motion information from mixed optic flow. In behavioral experiments, we successfully demonstrated the predicted decomposition in the optokinetic and optomotor responses. Together, our study reveals the algorithm and the neural implementation for self-motion estimation in a vertebrate visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-regulation of the brain's Beta rhythm using a brain-computer interface improves inhibitory control</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations, or brain rhythms, fluctuate in a manner reflecting ongoing behavior. Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using non-invasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain-computer interface that human participants (n=44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6-day period to self-regulate their Beta rhythm (13-20 Hz) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC). This Beta modulation had observable consequences on cognitive behavior: changes in an individual's inhibitory control performance before and after training were predicted by the magnitude of their training-related change in Beta over rIFC. This was not the case for a control group (n=38) who underwent training of their Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). The present data support the view that the right frontal Beta rhythm is a key component of the brain's inhibitory control system. Most importantly, we introduce causality to this relationship for the first time, as experimental modulation of rIFC Beta activity had a measurable impact upon behavior.

	<p>Background: Some clinical studies have indicated that neutral and happy music may relieve state anxiety. However, the brain mechanisms by which these effective interventions in music impact state anxiety remain unknown. Methods: In this study, we selected music with clinical effects for therapy, and 62 subjects were included using the evoked anxiety paradigm. After evoking anxiety with a visual stimulus, all subjects were randomly divided into three groups (listening to happy music, neutral music and a blank stimulus), and EEG signals were acquired. Results: We found that different emotional types of music might have different mechanisms in state anxiety interventions. Neutral music had the effect of alleviating state anxiety. The brain mechanisms supported that neutral music ameliorating state anxiety was associated with decreased power spectral density of the occipital lobe and increased brain functional connectivity between the occipital lobe and frontal lobe. Happy music also had the effect of alleviating state anxiety, and the brain mechanism was associated with enhanced brain functional connectivity between the occipital lobe and right temporal lobe. Conclusions: This study may be important for a deep understanding of the mechanisms associated with state anxiety music interventions and may further contribute to future clinical treatment using nonpharmaceutical interventions.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to understand the impact of sex on the neurocognitive function of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Ninety-four participants with idiopathic PD and 167 age-matched healthy individuals as normal controls (NCs) were recruited and underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. Sex differences were found in NCs, but not in patients with PD. Among male participants, patients with PD showed worse performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) test and Symbol Search (SS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than NCs. Among female participants, patients with PD showed worse performance on the category score of the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and pentagon copying (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than NCs. After controlling for the effects of age and years of education, Hoehn and Yahr stage was found to predict the performance of the Color Trails Test part A (βA = 0.241, pA = 0.036), Stroop Color and Word Test (β = −0.245, p = 0.036), and DSS (β = −0.258, p = 0.035) in men with PD. These results indicate the differential effect of sex on the neurocognitive function among healthy aging and PD populations. The disappearance of sex differences, which is present in healthy aging, in patients with PD suggests a gradual loss of the neuroprotective effect of estrogen after the initiation of the neurodegenerative process. This study also found mental flexibility and visuospatial function to be the susceptible cognitive domains in women with PD, while the disease severity could predict the working memory and processing speed in men with PD.</p>

	<p>Although obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and the conduct disorders (CD) express a contrasting symptomatology, they could represent different answers to a common matrix about morality. In the literature, some theoretical models describe people with OCD as individuals who experience high levels of responsibility and guilt. On the other hand, adolescents with a CD are described as if they do not feel guilty at all or consider anti-social purposes as more important than existing moral purposes. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of forgiveness in responsibility and guilt levels and to test whether this putative relation was influenced by tendencies towards obsessive–compulsive problems (OCP) or conduct problems (CP). In total, 231 adolescents aged between 16 and 18 years were self-assessed using a Youth Self-Report, Child Responsibility Attitudes Questionnaire, Heartland Forgiveness Scale, and Test Of Self-Conscious Affect. The results show that self-forgiveness predicted responsibility levels, while guilt was predicted by self-forgiveness and situation-forgiveness. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the effects of OCP on responsibility and guilt were mediated by self-forgiveness and situation-forgiveness. Regarding CP, no mediated effects were found. In conclusion, lower proneness to forgive increases responsibility and guilt, and this is particularly evident in subjects with higher levels of OCP.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Results from item-method directed forgetting suggest that individuals are able to intentionally forget processed information. Most research suggests that either selective rehearsal of to-be-remembered or inhibitory control of to-be-forgotten information is accountable for the effects of intentional forgetting. Some research, however, hypothesized that the time to process information mediates the underlying mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the current study investigated associations between oscillatory power in theta (3&ndash;7.5 Hz) and alpha frequencies (8&ndash;13 Hz) and intentional forgetting in human participants and explored whether or not these mechanisms depended on processing time. Previously, theta power was shown to be associated with the creation of episodic memory traces and alpha power with inhibition. We therefore expected to find associations between these neural signatures and behavioral effects. Consistent with our hypotheses, we revealed increased theta power for to-be-remembered and increased alpha power for to-be-forgotten information and that the effects of activity in both frequency bands were influenced by the time individuals were given for processing the memory cue. These results suggest that not one but two mechanisms, rehearsal and inhibitory control, are accountable for item-method directed forgetting, both with different temporal profiles.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human infants who suffer from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which is a failure to attain their genetically predetermined weight, are at increased risk for postnatal learning and memory deficits. Hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons play an important role in memory formation; however, it is unknown whether IUGR affects embryonic DG neurogenesis, which could provide a potential mechanism underlying abnormal postnatal learning and memory function. Using a mouse model of the most common cause of IUGR, induced by hypertensive disease of pregnancy, we first assessed adult learning and memory function. We quantified the percentages of embryonic hippocampal DG neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitor cells and developing glutamatergic granule neurons, as well as hippocampal volumes and neuron cell count and morphology 18 and 40 d after delivery. We characterized the differential embryonic hippocampal transcriptomic pathways between appropriately grown and IUGR mouse offspring. We found that IUGR offspring of both sexes had short-term adult learning and memory deficits. Prenatally, we found that IUGR caused accelerated embryonic DG neurogenesis and Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural stem cell depletion. IUGR mice were marked by decreased hippocampal volumes and decreased doublecortin<sup>+</sup> neuronal progenitors with increased mean dendritic lengths at postnatal day 18. Consistent with its known molecular role in embryonic DG neurogenesis, we also found evidence for decreased Wnt pathway activity during IUGR. In conclusion, we have discovered that postnatal memory deficits are associated with accelerated NSC differentiation and maturation into glutamatergic granule neurons following IUGR, a phenotype that could be explained by decreased embryonic Wnt signaling.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Relapse is a major challenge to the treatment of substance use disorders. A progressive increase in cue-induced drug craving, termed incubation of craving, is observed after withdrawal from multiple drugs of abuse in humans and rodents. Incubation of cocaine craving involves the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons via postsynaptic accumulation of high-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors. This enhances reactivity to drug-associated cues and is required for the expression of incubation. Additionally, incubation of cocaine craving is associated with loss of the synaptic depression normally triggered by stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5), leading to endocannabinoid production, and expressed presynaptically via cannabinoid receptor 1 activation. Previous studies have found alterations in mGlu5 and Homer proteins associated with the loss of this synaptic depression. Here we conducted coimmunoprecipitation studies to investigate associations of diacylglycerol lipase-&alpha; (DGL), which catalyzes formation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), with mGlu5 and Homer proteins. Although these interactions were unchanged in the NAc core at incubation-relevant withdrawal times, the association of DGL with total and phosphorylated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&alpha; (CaMKII&alpha;) and CaMKII&beta; was increased. This would be predicted, based on other studies, to inhibit DGL activity and therefore 2-AG production. This was confirmed by measuring DGL enzymatic activity. However, the magnitude of DGL inhibition did not correlate with the magnitude of incubation of craving for individual rats. These results suggest that CaMKII contributes to the loss of mGlu5-dependent synaptic depression after incubation, but the functional significance of this loss remains unclear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Fading of a Stabilized Cortical Image: Replication in the Undergraduate Classroom</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Prolonged exposure to a stimulus causes desensitization of cortical neurons and results in perceptual changes. One example of this phenomenon is contrast adaptation, in which perceived differences between light and dark regions of a stimulus decrease. Blakemore, Muncey, and Ridley reported evidence for the "perceptual fading of a stabilized cortical image" in a 1971 <I>Nature</I> paper. Our goal was to replicate their second experiment, in which adaptation was measured across many contrasts, and develop an active learning exercise for undergraduate students. The experiment was coded using an open-source python package and psychophysical data were collected from two observers. On each trial, a sinusoidally modulated luminance grating appeared above fixation, and the task of the observer was to adjust the contrast of a grating below fixation until the two appeared identical. Between trials in the adaptation condition, a high contrast grating was presented in the top location; no such grating appeared between trials in the control condition. Contrast matches showed a clear reduction during the adaptation condition, thus demonstrating perceptual fading and a successful replication of <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B1">Blakemore et al. (1971)</cross-ref>. We then simplified the approach and modified the code to create a single, seamless experience for use in the classroom. With instructions and theoretical background provided in a one-page handout, students can perform the experiment on themselves and view their results in an automatically generated figure. This exercise, a primary example of active learning, will help students gain a first-hand understanding of the perceptual effects of adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">High Behavioral Variability Mediated by Altered Neuronal Excitability in auts2 Mutant Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by abnormal behavioral traits arising from neural circuit dysfunction. While a number of genes have been implicated in ASDs, in most cases, a clear understanding of how mutations in these genes lead to circuit dysfunction and behavioral abnormality is absent. The <I>autism susceptibility candidate 2</I> (<I>AUTS2</I>) gene is one such gene, associated with ASDs, intellectual disability and a range of other neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the role of AUTS2 in neural development and circuit function is not at all known. Here, we undertook functional analysis of Auts2a, the main homolog of AUTS2 in zebrafish, in the context of the escape behavior. Escape behavior in wild-type zebrafish is critical for survival and is therefore, reliable, rapid, and has well-defined kinematic properties. <I>auts2a</I> mutant zebrafish are viable, have normal gross morphology and can generate escape behavior with normal kinematics. However, the behavior is unreliable and delayed, with high trial-to-trial variability in the latency. Using calcium imaging we probed the activity of Mauthner neurons during otic vesicle (OV) stimulation and observed lower probability of activation and reduced calcium transients in the mutants. With direct activation of Mauthner by antidromic stimulation, the threshold for activation in mutants was higher than that in wild-type, even when inhibition was blocked. Taken together, these results point to reduced excitability of Mauthner neurons in <I>auts2a</I> mutant larvae leading to unreliable escape responses. Our results show a novel role for Auts2a in regulating neural excitability and reliability of behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">HFOApp: A MATLAB Graphical User Interface for High-Frequency Oscillation Marking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epilepsy affects 3.4 million people in the United States, and, despite the availability of numerous antiepileptic drugs, 36% of patients have uncontrollable seizures, which severely impact quality of life. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a potential biomarker of epileptogenic tissue that could be useful in surgical planning. As a result, research into the efficacy of HFOs as a clinical tool has increased over the last 2 decades. However, detection and identification of these transient rhythms in intracranial electroencephalographic recordings remain time-consuming and challenging. Although automated detection algorithms have been developed, their results are widely inconsistent, reducing reliability. Thus, manual marking of HFOs remains the gold standard, and manual review of automated results is required. However, manual marking and review are time consuming and can still produce variable results because of their subjective nature and the limitations in functionality of existing open-source software. Our goal was to develop a new software with broad application that improves on existing open-source HFO detection applications in usability, speed, and accuracy. Here, we present HFOApp: a free, open-source, easy-to-use MATLAB-based graphical user interface for HFO marking. This toolbox offers a high degree of intuitive and ergonomic usability and integrates interactive automation-assist options with manual marking, significantly reducing the time needed for review and manual marking of recordings, while increasing inter-rater reliability. The toolbox also features simultaneous multichannel detection and marking. HFOApp was designed as an easy-to-use toolbox for clinicians and researchers to quickly and accurately mark, quantify, and characterize HFOs within electrophysiological datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Workplace ergonomics problems and solutions: Working from home [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, many employees were required to work from home (WFH). During this WFH period, some employees encountered health issues related to sprains and neck or back pain owing to poor working conditions at home. As the WFH trend may continue over a prolonged period, the underlying causes and solutions to ergonomic issues must be addressed to reduce injuries. This study aims to identify the ergonomic issues encountered when working from home and suggests several solutions to minimise these issues.  Methods: A qualitative ethnographic methodology was adopted. This study used focus group discussion and the panellists were among experts from the fields of higher education, healthcare, human resources (HR), and ergonomics patient in Malaysia.  The most common ergonomic issues identified were based on diagnoses and observations in previous studies.  Results: The panellists agreed on ergonomics issues, comprising the use of unergonomic chairs, incorrect sitting postures, irregular arrangement of key objects, improper reach distances of the laptop/keyboard/mouse, poor desk designs, footrest absence, distortion/noise, poor lighting, and poor work environment. Over time, WFH ergonomics issues may lead to burnout, carpal tunnel syndrome or other cumulative trauma disorders, high blood pressure, and stress on the cervical spine and neck. The proposed solutions include a complete WFH ergonomics and wellness checklist for employees and employers, webinar sessions on WFH ergonomics, meet-up sessions with ergonomics or HR experts, workspace rentals for co-workers, implementation of the 20-20-20 rule and job-sharing practices, and the involvement of employers or the government in procuring ergonomic equipment for WFH employees.  Conclusions: This is a preliminary study and the researchers are exploring the root causes of WFH ergonomics issues and proposed solutions. While previous studies have examined workplace ergonomics, this study focuses on WFH ergonomic issues and solutions during the ongoing pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese sound-symbolic words in global contexts: from translation to hybridization [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper explores the global reception and development of the artistic expression of onomatopoeia and mimetic words in modern and contemporary Japanese literary texts adopting the method of comparative literature. By analyzing sound-symbolic words and their translations in modern Japanese poetry and contemporary comics, the intercultural dialogues of these texts are examined and the emergence of hybrid onomatopoeia in global comic works is illuminated. The Japanese language is often noted for its richness of sound-symbolic words. In the literary world, modern poetry adopted and elaborated the use of these words from the late 19th century in its quest for a new style of poetry. In the early 20th century, poets developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words and succeeded in giving musicality to the “new-style poem”. However, the translation of Japanese sound-symbolic words has always been problematic. Experimental uses of these words in modern poems were often untranslatable, making the translations incomprehensible or dull. Nevertheless, graphic narratives and their worldwide distribution changed that situation. Japanese comics (manga) has particularly developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words. Usually placed outside speech balloons, these words are elaborately depicted and are important elements of the panel/page layout. Notably, the global popularity of the genre developed a new phase of intercultural dialogue. As not every word has an equivalent or is translatable in the target language, translators have left sound-symbolic words untouched in the translated versions, putting translation aside. Thus, the combination of Japanese and the target language seems to influence the visual comprehension of sound effects among the readers. Through the examinations of some cases, this paper brings to light the emergence of some hybrid onomatopoeia and reveals that the “Third Space” formed by the translation and hybridization of manga is a dynamic field that creates a new culture.

                Background: : Rugby league involves repeated, complex, and high intensity change-of-direction (COD) movements with no existing test protocols that specifically assesses these multiple physical fitness components simultaneously. Thus, the current study examined the convergent validity of a repeated Illinois Agility (RIA) protocol with the repeated T-agility protocol, and the repeatability of the RIA protocol in adolescent Rugby League players. Furthermore, aerobic capacity and anaerobic and COD performance were assessed to determine whether these physical qualities were important contributors to the RIA protocol. Methods: Twenty-two junior Rugby League players completed 4 sessions with each separated by 7 days. Initially, physical fitness characteristics at baseline (i.e., Beep test,, countermovement jump, 30-m sprint, single-effort COD and repeated sprint ability [RSA]) were assessed. The second session involved a familiarisation of RIA and repeated T-agility test (RTT) protocols. During the third and fourth sessions, participants completed the RIA and RTT protocols in a randomised, counterbalanced design to examine the validity and test-retest reliability of these protocols. Results: For convergent validity, significant correlations were identified between RIA and RTT performances (r= >0.80; p<0.05). For contributors to RIA performance, significant correlations were identified between all baseline fitness characteristics and RIA (r = >0.71; p < 0.05). Reliability of the RIA protocol was near perfect with excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (0.87-0.97), good ratio limits of agreement (×/÷ 1.05-1.06) and low coefficient of variations (1.8-2.0%). Conclusions: The current study has demonstrated the RIA to be a simple, valid and reliable field test for RL athletes that can provide coaches with information about their team’s ability to sustain high intensity, multi-directional running efforts.

                Machine learning approaches have been fruitfully applied to several neurophysiological signal classification problems. Considering the relevance of emotion in human cognition and behaviour, an important application of machine learning has been found in the field of emotion identification based on neurophysiological activity. Nonetheless, there is high variability in results in the literature depending on the neuronal activity measurement, the signal features and the classifier type. The present work aims to provide new methodological insight into machine learning applied to emotion identification based on electrophysiological brain activity. For this reason, we analysed previously recorded EEG activity measured while emotional stimuli, high and low arousal (auditory and visual) were provided to a group of healthy participants. Our target signal to classify was the pre-stimulus onset brain activity. Classification performance of three different classifiers (LDA, SVM and kNN) was compared using both spectral and temporal features. Furthermore, we also contrasted the performance of static and dynamic (time evolving) approaches. The best static feature-classifier combination was the SVM with spectral features (51.8%), followed by LDA with spectral features (51.4%) and kNN with temporal features (51%). The best dynamic feature‑classifier combination was the SVM with temporal features (63.8%), followed by kNN with temporal features (63.70%) and LDA with temporal features (63.68%). The results show a clear increase in classification accuracy with temporal dynamic features.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulsed low-energy stimulation initiates electric turbulence in cardiac tissue</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rupamanjari Majumder, Sayedeh Hussaini, Vladimir S. Zykov, Stefan Luther, Eberhard Bodenschatz</p>

Interruptions in nonlinear wave propagation, commonly referred to as wave breaks, are typical of many complex excitable systems. In the heart they lead to lethal rhythm disorders, the so-called arrhythmias, which are one of the main causes of sudden death in the industrialized world. Progress in the treatment and therapy of cardiac arrhythmias requires a detailed understanding of the triggers and dynamics of these wave breaks. In particular, two very important questions are: 1) What determines the potential of a wave break to initiate re-entry? and 2) How do these breaks evolve such that the system is able to maintain spatiotemporally chaotic electrical activity? Here we approach these questions numerically using optogenetics in an <i>in silico</i> model of human atrial tissue that has undergone chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) remodelling. In the lesser studied sub-threshold illumination régime, we discover a new mechanism of wave break initiation in cardiac tissue that occurs for gentle slopes of the restitution characteristics. This mechanism involves the creation of conduction blocks through a combination of wavefront-waveback interaction, reshaping of the wave profile and heterogeneous recovery from the excitation of the spatially extended medium, leading to the creation of re-excitable windows for sustained re-entry. This finding is an important contribution to cardiac arrhythmia research as it identifies scenarios in which low-energy perturbations to cardiac rhythm can be potentially life-threatening.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Engineering gene overlaps to sustain genetic constructs in vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Antoine L. Decrulle, Antoine Frénoy, Thomas A. Meiller-Legrand, Aude Bernheim, Chantal Lotton, Arnaud Gutierrez, Ariel B. Lindner</p>

Evolution is often an obstacle to the engineering of stable biological systems due to the selection of mutations inactivating costly gene circuits. Gene overlaps induce important constraints on sequences and their evolution. We show that these constraints can be harnessed to increase the stability of costly genes by purging loss-of-function mutations. We combine computational and synthetic biology approaches to rationally design an overlapping reading frame expressing an essential gene within an existing gene to protect. Our algorithm succeeded in creating overlapping reading frames in 80% of <i>E. coli</i> genes. Experimentally, scoring mutations in both genes of such overlapping construct, we found that a significant fraction of mutations impacting the gene to protect have a deleterious effect on the essential gene. Such an overlap thus protects a costly gene from removal by natural selection by associating the benefit of this removal with a larger or even lethal cost. In our synthetic constructs, the overlap converts many of the possible mutants into evolutionary dead-ends, reducing the evolutionary potential of the system and thus increasing its stability over time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel A. Mihelic, William A. Sikora, Ahmed M. Hassan, Michael R. Williamson, Theresa A. Jones, Andrew K. Dunn</p>

Recent advances in two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PM) have allowed large scale imaging and analysis of blood vessel networks in living mice. However, extracting network graphs and vector representations for the dense capillary bed remains a bottleneck in many applications. Vascular vectorization is algorithmically difficult because blood vessels have many shapes and sizes, the samples are often unevenly illuminated, and large image volumes are required to achieve good statistical power. State-of-the-art, three-dimensional, vascular vectorization approaches often require a segmented (binary) image, relying on manual or supervised-machine annotation. Therefore, voxel-by-voxel image segmentation is biased by the human annotator or trainer. Furthermore, segmented images oftentimes require remedial morphological filtering before skeletonization or vectorization. To address these limitations, we present a vectorization method to extract vascular objects directly from unsegmented images without the need for machine learning or training. The Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization (SLAVV) source code in MATLAB is openly available on GitHub. This novel method uses simple models of vascular anatomy, efficient linear filtering, and vector extraction algorithms to remove the image segmentation requirement, replacing it with manual or automated vector classification. Semi-automated SLAVV is demonstrated on three in vivo 2PM image volumes of microvascular networks (capillaries, arterioles and venules) in the mouse cortex. Vectorization performance is proven robust to the choice of plasma- or endothelial-labeled contrast, and processing costs are shown to scale with input image volume. Fully-automated SLAVV performance is evaluated on simulated 2PM images of varying quality all based on the large (1.4×0.9×0.6 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1.6×10<sup>8</sup> voxel) input image. Vascular statistics of interest (e.g. volume fraction, surface area density) calculated from automatically vectorized images show greater robustness to image quality than those calculated from intensity-thresholded images.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tracking calcium dynamics from individual neurons in behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thibault Lagache, Alison Hanson, Jesús E. Pérez-Ortega, Adrienne Fairhall, Rafael Yuste</p>

Measuring the activity of neuronal populations with calcium imaging can capture emergent functional properties of neuronal circuits with single cell resolution. However, the motion of freely behaving animals, together with the intermittent detectability of calcium sensors, can hinder automatic monitoring of neuronal activity and their subsequent functional characterization. We report the development and open-source implementation of a multi-step cellular tracking algorithm (Elastic Motion Correction and Concatenation or EMC<sup>2</sup>) that compensates for the intermittent disappearance of moving neurons by integrating local deformation information from detectable neurons. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using calcium imaging data from two-photon volumetric microscopy in visual cortex of awake mice, and from confocal microscopy in behaving <i>Hydra</i>, which experiences major body deformation during its contractions. We quantify the performance of our algorithm using ground truth manual tracking of neurons, along with synthetic time-lapse sequences, covering a wide range of particle motions and detectability parameters. As a demonstration of the utility of the algorithm, we monitor for several days calcium activity of the same neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex <i>in vivo</i>, finding significant turnover within the active neurons across days, with only few neurons that remained active across days. Also, combining automatic tracking of single neuron activity with statistical clustering, we characterize and map neuronal ensembles in behaving <i>Hydra</i>, finding three major non-overlapping ensembles of neurons (CB, RP1 and RP2) whose activity correlates with contractions and elongations. Our results show that the EMC<sup>2</sup> algorithm can be used as a robust and versatile platform for neuronal tracking in behaving animals.

                Background: Bioinformatics is becoming an essential tool for the majority of biological and biomedical researchers. Although bioinformatics data is exploited by academic and industrial researchers, limited focus is on teaching this area to undergraduates, postgraduates and senior scientists. Many scientists are developing their own expertise without formal training and often without appreciating the source of the data they are reliant upon. Some universities do provide courses on a variety of bioinformatics resources and tools, a few also provide biocuration projects, during which students submit data to annotation resources. Methods: To assess the usefulness and enjoyability of annotation projects a survey was sent to University College London (UCL) students who have undertaken Gene Ontology biocuration projects. Results: Analysis of survey responses suggest that these projects provide students with an opportunity not only to learn about bioinformatics resources but also to improve their literature analysis, presentation and writing skills. Conclusion: Biocuration student projects provide valuable annotations as well as enabling students to develop a variety of skills relevant to their future careers. It is also hoped that, as future scientists, these students will critically assess their own manuscripts and ensure that these are written with the biocurators of the future in mind.

                <p>Younger adults with epilepsy have an increased mortality. Some deaths are seizure-related, for example, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), whereas others, for example, suicide, have multiple causes, including adverse effects of the treatment on mood. In this retrospective population-based study of all Danish persons with epilepsy aged 18 to 49 years during 2007 to 2009 we evaluated the risk of death from seizures and suicide. SUDEP comprised 82.7% of all seizure-related death. Younger adults with epilepsy had an 8.3-fold increased risk of death from seizure-related causes compared with suicide. This underpins the importance of effective seizure control in preventing premature death. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a protein which is expressed by ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and humans. In all species, Satb1 was exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2 % of the ganglion cell population in central retina of all species, rising to a maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching dendritic tree and included broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified and parasol cells, all of which showed some co-stratification with the outer or inner cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest co-stratification but did not show extensive co-fasciculation as reported for ON-OFF direction selective cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.</p>

                Background: The objective of this review was to evaluate the medicinal potential of Morus alba leaves on the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The research question was: what is the therapeutic potential of Morus alba leaves for the control of DM2? Methods: This systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The included studies were extracted from Scopus, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Scielo, and Google Scholar; January 2015 to July 2021. Key search terms were MeSH and DeCS: Morus alba, mulberry, hypoglycemic agent. The inclusion criteria were: studies in rats administered Morus alba leaf extracts; studies that included the dimensions of lipidemia and glycemia; studies that included indicators such as fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and insulin resistance. Exclusion criteria: studies in which Morus alba leaves were administered with other plants; studies with other parts of the Morus alba plant; proteomic studies, cancer, duplicate studies, in vitro studies, and evaluation of included studies. All included investigations were evaluated for biases. Results: Of 253 studies found, 29 were included. The extracts of Morus alba leaves at the phytochemical level improve glucose uptake. Chlorogenic acid, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin, present in the leaves of Morus alba, have hypoglycemic properties and an ameliorating effect on diabetic nephropathy. This leaf has pharmacological effects such as glucose absorption, insulin secretion production, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity management. Conclusions: Morus alba leaves have pharmacological effects on DM2 that include glucose absorption, production of insulin secretion, antioxidant agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity control. Beyond these results, there is a lack of studies on the potential and synergistic effects of Morus alba leaves' components, limiting the possibility of a more effective therapy using the plant's leaves.

                Elmaleh et al. use high-density recordings to measure the activity of the song control pathway in the zebra finch. They precisely decode snippets of song-related activity during sleep and leverage these “offline” dynamics to test three models of network connectivity responsible for sequence generation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intergenerational adaptations to stress are evolutionarily conserved, stress-specific, and have deleterious trade-offs</a></h4>

              
                Despite reports of parental exposure to stress promoting physiological adaptations in progeny in diverse organisms, there remains considerable debate over the significance and evolutionary conservation of such multigenerational effects. Here, we investigate four independent models of intergenerational adaptations to stress in <i>C. elegans </i>- bacterial infection, eukaryotic infection, osmotic stress and nutrient stress - across multiple species. We found that all four intergenerational physiological adaptations are conserved in at least one other species, that they are stress-specific, and that they have deleterious trade-offs in mismatched environments. By profiling the effects of parental bacterial infection and osmotic stress exposure on progeny gene expression across species we established a core set of 587 genes that exhibited a greater than 2-fold intergenerational change in expression in response to stress in <i>C. elegans</i> and at least one other species, as well as a set of 37 highly conserved genes that exhibited a greater than 2-fold intergenerational change in expression in all four species tested. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that presumed adaptive and deleterious intergenerational effects are molecularly related at the gene expression level. Lastly, we found that none of the effects we detected of these stresses on <i>C. elegans</i> F1 progeny gene expression persisted transgenerationally three generations after stress exposure. We conclude that intergenerational responses to stress play a substantial and evolutionarily conserved role in regulating animal physiology and that the vast majority of the effects of parental stress on progeny gene expression are reversible and not maintained transgenerationally.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuropsychological evidence of multi-domain network hubs in the human thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Hubs in the human brain support behaviors that arise from brain network interactions. Previous studies have identified hub regions in the human thalamus that are connected with multiple functional networks. However, the behavioral significance of thalamic hubs has yet to be established. Our framework predicts that thalamic subregions with strong hub properties are broadly involved in functions across multiple cognitive domains. To test this prediction, we studied human patients with focal thalamic lesions in conjunction with network analyses of the human thalamocortical functional connectome. In support of our prediction, lesions to thalamic subregions with stronger hub properties were associated with widespread deficits in executive, language, and memory functions, whereas lesions to thalamic subregions with weaker hub properties were associated with more limited deficits. These results highlight how a large-scale network model can broaden our understanding of thalamic function for human cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An improved fluorescent noncanonical amino acid for measuring conformational distributions using time-resolved transition metal ion FRET</a></h4>

              
                With the recent explosion in high-resolution protein structures, one of the next frontiers in biology is elucidating the mechanisms by which conformational rearrangements in proteins are regulated to meet the needs of cells under changing conditions. Rigorously measuring protein energetics and dynamics requires the development of new methods that can resolve structural heterogeneity and conformational distributions. We have previously developed steady-state transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) approaches using a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor (Anap) and transition metal ion acceptor to probe conformational rearrangements in soluble and membrane proteins. Here, we show that the fluorescent noncanonical amino acid Acd has superior photophysical properties that extend its utility as a donor for tmFRET. Using maltose-binding protein (MBP) expressed in mammalian cells as a model system, we show that Acd is comparable to Anap in steady-state tmFRET experiments and that its long, single-exponential lifetime is better suited for probing conformational distributions using time-resolved FRET. These experiments reveal differences in heterogeneity in the apo and holo conformational states of MBP and produce accurate quantification of the distributions among apo and holo conformational states at subsaturating maltose concentrations. Our new approach using Acd for time-resolved tmFRET sets the stage for measuring the energetics of conformational rearrangements in soluble and membrane proteins in near-native conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TAZ inhibits glucocorticoid receptor and coordinates hepatic glucose homeostasis in normal physiologic states</a></h4>

              
                The elucidation of the mechanisms whereby the liver maintains glucose homeostasis is crucial for the understanding of physiologic and pathologic states. Here, we show a novel role of hepatic transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). TAZ is abundantly expressed in pericentral hepatocytes and its expression is markedly reduced by fasting. TAZ interacts <i>via</i> its WW domain with the ligand-binding domain of GR to limit the binding of GR to the GR response element in gluconeogenic gene promoters. Therefore, liver-specific TAZ knockout mice show increases in glucose production and blood glucose concentration. Conversely, the overexpression of TAZ in mouse liver reduces the binding of GR to gluconeogenic gene promoters and glucose production. Thus, our findings demonstrate that hepatic TAZ inhibits GR-transactivation of gluconeogenic genes and coordinates gluconeogenesis in response to physiologic fasting and feeding.

                Retinoic acid (RA) is an essential signaling molecule for cardiac development and plays a protective role in the heart after myocardial infarction (MI). In both cases, the effect of RA signaling on cardiomyocytes, the principle cell type of the heart, has been reported to be indirect. Here we have developed an inducible murine transgenic RA-reporter line using CreER<sup>T2</sup> technology that permits lineage tracing of RA-responsive cells and faithfully recapitulates endogenous RA activity in multiple organs during embryonic development. Strikingly, we have observed a direct RA response in cardiomyocytes during mid-late gestation and after MI. Ablation of RA signaling through deletion of the <i>Aldh1a1/a2/a3</i> genes encoding RA-synthesizing enzymes leads to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in adults subjected to MI. RNA sequencing analysis reveals <i>Tgm2</i> and <i>Ace1, </i>two genes with well-established links to cardiac repair<i>, </i>as potential targets of RA signaling in primary cardiomyocytes, thereby providing novel links between the RA pathway and heart disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary transcriptomics implicates new genes and pathways in human pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary changes in the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system underlie the origins and diversification of pregnancy in Eutherian ('Placental') mammals. This developmental and evolutionary history constrains normal physiological functions and biases the ways in which dysfunction contributes to reproductive trait diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, we show that gene expression changes in the human endometrium during pregnancy are associated with the evolution of human-specific traits and pathologies of pregnancy. We found that hundreds of genes gained or lost endometrial expression in the human lineage. Among these are genes that may contribute to human-specific maternal-fetal communication (<i>HTR2B</i>) and maternal-fetal immunotolerance (<i>PDCD1LG2</i>) systems, as well as vascular remodeling and deep placental invasion (<i>CORIN</i>). These data suggest that explicit evolutionary studies of anatomical systems complement traditional methods for characterizing the genetic architecture of disease. We also anticipate our results will advance the emerging synthesis of evolution and medicine ('evolutionary medicine') and be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, the gene expression changes we identified may contribute to the development of diagnostics and interventions for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Duox generated reactive oxygen species activate ATR/Chk1 to induce G2 arrest in Drosophila tracheoblasts</a></h4>

              
                Progenitors of the thoracic tracheal system of adult <i>Drosophila</i> (tracheoblasts) arrest in G2 during larval life and rekindle a mitotic program subsequently. G2 arrest is dependent on ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 that is actuated in the absence of detectable DNA damage. We are interested in the mechanisms that activate ATR/Chk1 (Kizhedathu et al., 2018, 2020). Here we report that levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are high in arrested tracheoblasts and decrease upon mitotic re-entry. High ROS is dependent on expression of Duox, an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generating-Dual Oxidase. ROS quenching by overexpression of Superoxide Dismutase 1, or by knockdown of Duox, abolishes Chk1 phosphorylation and results in precocious proliferation. Tracheae deficient in Duox, or deficient in both Duox and regulators of DNA damage-dependent ATR/Chk1 activation (ATRIP/TOPBP1/ Claspin), can induce phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to micromolar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in minutes. The findings presented reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates ATR/Chk1 in tracheoblasts by a non-canonical, potentially direct, mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Memory recall involves a transient break in excitatory-inhibitory balance</a></h4>

              
                The brain has a remarkable capacity to acquire and store memories that can later be selectively recalled. These processes are supported by the hippocampus which is thought to index memory recall by reinstating information stored across distributed neocortical circuits. However, the mechanism that supports this interaction remains unclear. Here, in humans, we show that recall of a visual cue from a paired associate is accompanied by a transient increase in the ratio between glutamate and GABA in visual cortex. Moreover, these excitatory-inhibitory fluctuations are predicted by activity in the hippocampus. These data suggest the hippocampus gates memory recall by indexing information stored across neocortical circuits using a disinhibitory mechanism.

                Nanocolumns are trans-synaptic structures which align presynaptic vesicles release sites and postsynaptic receptors. However, how these nano structures shape synaptic signaling remains little understood. Given the difficulty to probe submicroscopic structures experimentally, computer modelling is a usefull approach to investigate the possible functional impacts of nanocolumns. In our in silico model, as has been experimentally observed, a nanocolumn is characterized by a tight distribution of postsynaptic receptors aligned with the presynaptic vesicle release site and by the presence of trans-synaptic molecules which can modulate neurotransmitter diffusion. We found that nanocolumns can play an important role in reinforcing synaptic current mostly when the presynaptic vesicle contains a small number of neurotransmitters. We also show that synapses with and without nanocolumns could have differentiated responses to spontaneous or evoked events. Our work provides a new methodology to investigate in silico the role of the submicroscopic organization of the synapse.

                For individual neurons to function appropriately within a network that is undergoing synaptic reorganization and refinement due to developmental or experience-dependent changes in circuit activity, they must homeostatically adapt their intrinsic excitability to maintain a consistent output despite the changing levels of synaptic input. This homeostatic plasticity of excitability is particularly important for the development of sensory circuits, where subtle deficits in neuronal and circuit function cause developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Despite the critical importance of this process for normal circuit development, the molecular mechanism by which this homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. These are regulated with developmental changes in synaptic input, and homeostatically in response to changes in visual input. We show that expression of the voltage-gated Na+ channel subtype Nav1.6 is regulated with changes in intrinsic excitability, that blocking Nav1.6 channels is sufficient to decrease intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, that upregulation of Nav1.6 expression is necessary for experience-dependent increases in Na+ currents and intrinsic excitability. Finally, by examining behaviors that rely on visual and multisensory integration, we extend these findings to show that tight regulation of Na+ channel gene expression during a critical period of tectal circuit development is required for the normal functional development of the tectal circuitry.

                Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons, which constitute 10-15% of the cortical inhibitory neuron population, have emerged as an important cell type for regulating excitatory cell activity based on behavioral state. VIP cells in sensory cortex are potently engaged by neuromodulatory and motor inputs during active exploratory behaviors like locomotion and whisking, which in turn promote pyramidal cell firing via disinhibition. Such state-dependent modulation of activity by VIP cells in sensory cortex has been studied widely in recent years. However, the function of VIP cells during goal-directed behavior is less well understood. It is not clear how task-related events like sensory stimuli, motor actions, or reward activate VIP cells in sensory cortex since there is often temporal overlap in the occurrence of these events. We developed a Go/NoGo whisker touch detection task which incorporates a post-stimulus delay period to separate sensory-driven activity from action- or reward-related activity during behavior. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to measure task-related signals of L2/3 VIP neurons in S1 of behaving mice. We report for the first time that VIP cells in mouse whisker S1 are activated by both whisker stimuli and goal-directed licking. Whisker- and lick-related signals were spatially organized in relation to anatomical columns in S1. Sensory responses of VIP cells were tuned to specific whiskers, whether or not they also displayed lick-related activity.

                Animals are constantly bombarded with stimuli, which presents a fundamental problem of sorting among pervasive uninformative stimuli and novel, possibly meaningful stimuli. We evaluated novelty detection behaviorally in honey bees as they position their antennae differentially in an air stream carrying familiar or novel odors. We then characterized neuronal responses to familiar and novel odors in the first synaptic integration center in the brain, the antennal lobes. We found that the neurons that exhibited stronger initial responses to the odor that was to be familiarized are the same units that later distinguish familiar and novel odors, independently of chemical identities. These units, including both projection neurons and local neurons, showed a decreased response to the familiar odor but an increased response to the novel odor. Our results suggest that the antennal lobe may assign a category of familiarity or novelty to an odor stimulus in addition to its chemical identity code. Therefore, the mechanisms for novelty detection may be present in early sensory processing, either as a result of local synaptic interaction or via feedback from higher brain centers.

                In todays world, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons Disease, Huntingtons Disease as well as brain cancers such as astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas have become a great threat to us. In this study, we are trying to find a probable molecular connection associated with two very much different diseases, Glioblastoma, also known as Glioblastoma Multiforme (cancers of microglial cells of our brain) and Parkinsons disease. We at first downloaded the microarray datasets of these two diseases from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and then analyzed them by the GEO2R tool. After analysis, we found 249 common upregulated differential expressed genes and 135 common downregulated differential expressed genes of these two diseases. Therefore the common differentially expressed genes, both upregulated and downregulated, were imported into STRING online tool to find out the protein-protein interactions. Now, this whole network was subjected to Cytoscape and the top ten hub genes were found by Cyto-Hubba plug-in. The top then hub genes are EGFR, CCNB1, CDK1, CCNA2, CHEK1, RAD51, MAD2L1, KIF20A, BUB1, and CCNB2. These all genes are upregulated in both diseases. To find out the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways associated with these hub genes Enrichr online software was used. We used miRNet software to determine the interactions of hub genes with microRNAs. This study will be useful in the future for drug targets discovery for these diseases.

                Background: Peak individual alpha frequencies (IAF) extracted from an EEG exam can provide novel sources of information regarding brain function. This information can help measure and track changes in cognition arising from conditions such as concussion or unhealthy aging. Objective 1: To validate a method for combining eyes-closed EEG with eyes-closed audio P300 ERP in order to streamline testing times involved in IAF extraction. Objective 2: To validate age-stratified target ranges of IAF collected in clinic against published research. Objective 3: To validate the stability of IAF for data collected in routine clinical settings. Participants: Two thousand twenty-five subjects aged 13-90. Methods: EEG with audio P300 was collected as part of a health screening exam for studies through Colorado University, Children's Hospital Colorado, Boone Heart Institute, WAVi Co., and various clinics alongside other clinical evaluations. Results: (1) No differences were seen between IAF extracted during an eyes-closed resting and the P300 protocol. (2) The age-related AF trends measured in clinic match the age-related trends from previous research. (3) IAF remained stable over the course of 0-2 years in a test-retest dataset. Conclusion: In-clinic measures of peak EEG frequency corroborate the age-related trends of published research taken over the last several decades and IAF. These results also confirm that IAF is a stable trait, making it useful for within-person longitudinal tracking. By following changes in IAF over time, deviations from normal CNS functioning, such as onset or progression of disease, can be monitored.

                In a typical text, readers look much longer at some words than at others and fixate some words multiple times, while skipping others altogether. Historically, researchers explained this variation via low-level visual or oculomotor factors, but today it is primarily explained via cognitive factors, such as how well words can be predicted from context or discerned from parafoveal preview. While the existence of these effects has been well established in experiments, the relative importance of prediction, preview and low-level factors for eye movement variation in natural reading is unclear. Here, we address this question using a deep neural network and Bayesian ideal observer to model linguistic prediction and parafoveal preview from moment to moment in natural reading (n=104, 1.5 million words). Strikingly, neither prediction nor preview was important for explaining word skipping - the vast majority of skipping was explained by a simple oculomotor model. For reading times, by contrast, we found clear but independent contributions of both prediction and preview, and effect sizes matching those from controlled experiments. Together, these results challenge dominant models of eye movements in reading by showing that linguistic prediction and parafoveal preview are not important determinants of word skipping.

                Manual sleep stage annotation is a time-consuming but often essential step in the analysis of sleep data. To address this bottleneck several algorithms have been proposed that automate this process, reporting performance levels that are on par with manual annotation according to measures of inter-rater agreement. Here we first demonstrate that inter-rater agreement can provide a biased and imprecise measure of annotation quality. We therefore develop a principled framework for assessing performance against a consensus annotation derived from multiple experienced sleep researchers. We then construct a new sleep stage classifier that combines automated feature extraction using linear discriminant analysis with inference based on vigilance state-dependent contextual information using a hidden Markov model. This produces automated annotation accuracies that exceed expert performance on rodent electrophysiological data. Furthermore, our classifier is shown to be robust to errors in the training data, robust to experimental manipulations, and compatible with different recording configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that the classifier identifies both successful and failed attempts to transition between vigilance states, which may offer new insights into the occurrence of short awake periods between REM and NREM sleep. We call our classifier 'Somnotate' and make an implementation available to the neuroscience community.

                In order to understand the health promotive, rejuvenative and disease preventive approach of the Ayurvedic system of medicine in the light of current principles, we examined two Rasayana formulations, viz., Kalayanaka Ghrita (KG) and Saraswata Ghrita (SG) for their effects in Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's (HD) neurodegenerative disease models of Drosophila. Initial experiments involving feeding of wild type flies on food supplemented with 0.05%, 0.25% and 0.5% (w/v) KG or SG revealed 0.05% to be without any adverse effect while higher concentrations caused dose-dependent reduction in pupation frequency and adult life span in wild type flies. Rearing GMR-GAL4>127Q (HD model) and ey-GAL4>A{beta}42 (AD model) larvae and adults on 0.05% or 0.25% SG or KG supplemented food enhanced the otherwise significantly reduced larval lethality and enhanced their median life span, with the 0.25% SG or KG concentrations being less effective than the 0.05%. In parallel with the better larval survival and enhanced adult life span, feeding the HD and AD model larvae on either of the Ghrita supplemented food (0.05% and 0.25%) substantially reduced the polyQ aggregates or amyloid plaques, respectively, in the larval eye discs. The present first in vivo organismic model study results have clinical implications for the increasing burden of age-associated dementia and neurodegenerative diseases like AD and HD in human populations.

                Cross-frequency synchronization (CFS) has been proposed as a mechanism for integrating spatially and spectrally distributed information in the brain. However, investigating CFS in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) is hampered by the presence of spurious neuronal interactions due to the non-sinusoidal waveshape of brain oscillations. Such waveshape gives rise to the presence of oscillatory harmonics mimicking genuine neuronal oscillations. Until recently, however, there has been no methodology for removing these harmonics from neuronal data. In order to address this long-standing challenge, we introduce a novel method (called HARMOnic miNImization - Harmoni) that removes the signal components which can be harmonics of a non-sinusoidal signal. Harmoni's working principle is based on the presence of CFS between harmonic components and the fundamental component of a non-sinusoidal signal. We extensively tested Harmoni in realistic EEG simulations. The simulated couplings between the source signals represented genuine and spurious CFS and within-frequency phase synchronization. Using diverse evaluation criteria, including ROC analyses, we showed that the within- and cross-frequency spurious interactions are suppressed significantly, while the genuine activities are not affected. Additionally, we applied Harmoni to real resting-state EEG data revealing intricate remote connectivity patterns which are usually masked by the spurious connections. Given the ubiquity of non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations in electrophysiological recordings, Harmoni is expected to facilitate novel insights into genuine neuronal interactions in various research fields, and can also serve as a steppingstone towards the development of further signal processing methods aiming at refining within- and cross-frequency synchronization in electrophysiological recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aberrant Functional Connectivity between Reward and Inhibitory Control Networks in Pre-Adolescent Binge Eating Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Behavioral features of binge eating disorder (BED) suggest abnormalities in reward and inhibitory control. Studies of adult populations suggest functional abnormalities in reward and inhibitory control networks. Despite behavioral markers often developing in children, the neurobiology of pediatric BED remains unstudied. Methods: 58 pre-adolescent children (aged 9-10-years) with BED and 66 age, BMI and developmentally-matched control children were extracted from the 3.0 baseline (Year 0) release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We investigated group differences in resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) functional connectivity (FC) within and between reward and inhibitory control networks. A seed-based approach was employed to assess nodes in the reward (orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala) and inhibitory control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) networks via hypothesis-driven seed-to-seed analyses, and secondary seed-to-voxel analyses. Results: Our findings revealed reduced FC between the dlPFC and amygdala, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in pre-adolescent children with BED, relative to age, gender, BMI and developmentally matched controls. These findings indicating aberrant connectivity between nodes of inhibitory control and reward networks were corroborated by the whole-brain FC analyses. Conclusions: Early-onset BED may be characterized by diffuse abnormalities in the functional synergy between reward and cognitive control networks, without perturbations within reward and inhibitory control networks, respectively. The decreased capacity to regulate a reward-driven pursuit of hedonic foods, which is characteristic of BED, may in part, rest on this dysconnectivity between reward and inhibitory control networks.

                Background: Anosmia/hyposmia affects 13.3 million people in the U.S. alone according to the recent U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Hundreds of thousands more people with persistent olfactory dysfunction will be added to this number due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding NaV1.7, experience anosmia in addition to congenital insensitivity to pain. Tsp1a is a recently discovered peptide that inhibits NaV1.7 with high potency and selectivity. In this study, we examined whether a fluorescently tagged version of Tsp1a could be used to visualize normal and damaged mouse olfactory nerves. Methods: Athymic nude mice were intravenously injected with Tsp1a-IR800. As a control, mice were injected with PBS only, and as a blocking control were injected with combination of Tsp1a and Tsp1a-IR800. All mice were imaged in-vivo and epifluorescence images were acquired using an IVIS Spectrum animal imaging system. Semiquantitative analysis of the Tsp1a-IR800 signal was conducted by measuring the average radiant efficiency in the region of the olfactory epithelium/bulb (ROEB). Methimazole was used to chemically ablate the olfactory epithelium. We performed a food buried test to correlate the level of anosmia with the level of radiance efficiency. Results: The area of olfactory epithelium/bulb was clearly visible in epifluorescence in-vivo images of mice receiving the imaging agent. The radiant efficiency was significantly less in both mice injected with PBS and in mice injected with the blocking formulation. The mice after olfactory ablation had a significantly reduced radiant efficiency compared with normal mice. Moreover, there was a statistically significant and inverse correlation between the time required for the mouse to find buried food and the radiant efficiency. We also performed immunohistochemistry using NaV1.7 antibody. Mice after olfactory ablation as well as COVID-19-infected mice had significantly lower expression of NaV1.7 on the level of olfactory epithelium/bulb. Conclusion: We show that the fluorescent imaging of mouse olfactory epithelium/bulb is possible, suggesting that labeled Tsp1a tracers may serve as the first objective diagnostic tool of smell disorders, including those caused by COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneous Mnemonic and Predictive Representations in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that stimulus history can be decoded via the use of broadband sensory impulses to reactivate mnemonic representations. It has also been shown that predictive mechanisms in the auditory system demonstrate similar tonotopic organization of neural activity as that elicited by the perceived stimuli. However, it remains unclear if the mnemonic and predictive information can be decoded from cortical activity simultaneously and from overlapping neural populations. Here, we recorded neural activity using electrocorticography (ECoG) in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while exposed to repeated stimulus sequences, where events within the sequence were occasionally replaced with a broadband noise burst or omitted entirely. We show that both stimulus history and predicted stimuli can be decoded from neural responses to broadband impulse at overlapping latencies but linked to largely independent neural populations. We also demonstrate that predictive representations are learned over the course of stimulation at two distinct time scales, reflected in two dissociable time windows of neural activity. These results establish a valuable tool for investigating the neural mechanisms of passive sequence learning, memory encoding, and prediction mechanisms within a single paradigm, and provide novel evidence for learning predictive representations even under anaesthesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysfunction of cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling axis in striatal medium spiny neurons: a role in schizophrenia and Huntington's disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are preferentially lost in Huntington's disease. Genomic studies also implicate a direct role for MSNs in schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder known to involve cortical neuron dysfunction. It remains unknown whether the two diseases share similar MSN pathogenesis or if neuronal deficits can be attributed to cell type-dependent biological pathways. Transcription factor BCL11B, which is expressed by all MSNs and deep layer cortical neurons, was recently proposed to drive selective neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease and identified as a candidate risk gene in schizophrenia. Methods: Using human stem cell-derived neurons lacking BCL11B as a model, we investigated cellular pathology in MSNs and cortical neurons in the context of these disorders. Integrative analyses between differentially expressed transcripts and published GWAS datasets identified cell type-specific disease-related phenotypes. Results: We uncover a role for BCL11B in calcium homeostasis in both neuronal types, while deficits in mitochondrial function and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent calcium transients are detected only in MSNs. Moreover, BCL11B-deficient MSNs display abnormal responses to glutamate and fail to integrate dopaminergic and glutamatergic stimulation, a key feature of striatal neurons in vivo. Gene enrichment analysis reveals overrepresentation of disorder risk genes among BCL11B-regulated pathways, primarily relating to cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling axis and synaptic signaling. Conclusions: Our study indicates that Huntington's disease and schizophrenia are likely to share neuronal pathogenesis where dysregulation of intracellular calcium levels is found in both striatal and cortical neurons. In contrast, reduction in PKA signaling and abnormal dopamine/glutamate receptor signaling is largely specific to MSNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative study of alpha-synuclein prion-like spreading in fully oriented reconstructed neural networks reveals non-synaptic dissemination of seeding aggregates</a></h4>

              
                The trans-neuronal spread of protein aggregates in a prion-like manner underlies the progression of neuronal lesions in the brain of patients with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. Despite being studied actively, the mechanisms of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates propagation remain poorly understood. This hinders the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at preventing the spatial progression of intracellular inclusions in neural networks. To assess the role of synaptic structures and neuron characteristics in the transfer efficiency of aggregates with seeding propensity, we developed a novel microfluidic culture system which allows for the first time to reconstruct in vitro fully oriented and synaptically connected neural networks. This is achieved by filtering axonal growth with unidirectional "axon valves" microchannels. We exposed the presynaptic compartment of reconstructed networks to well characterized human aSyn aggregates differing in size: Fibrils and Oligomers. Both aggregates were transferred to postsynaptic neurons through active axonal transport, albeit with poor efficiency. By manipulating network maturity, we compared the transfer rate of aggregates in networks with distinct levels of synaptic connectivity. Surprisingly, we found that transfer efficiency was lower in mature networks with higher synaptic connectivity. We then investigated the seeding efficiency of endogenous aSyn in the postsynaptic population. We found that exposure to Fibrils, and not Oligomers, resulted in low efficiency trans-neuronal seeding which was restricted to postsynaptic axons. Finally, we assessed the impact of neuron characteristics and aSyn expression on the propagation of aSyn aggregates. By reconstructing chimeric networks, we found that neuron characteristics, such as the brain region from which they originate or aSyn expression levels, did not significantly impact aggregates transfer, and observed no trans-neuronal seeding where the presynaptic population did not express aSyn. Overall, we demonstrate that this novel platform uniquely allows the quantitative interrogation of original aspects of the trans-neuronal propagation of seeding pathogenic entities.

                Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by disturbances in cognition and behaviour surrounding eating and weight, which may relate to the structural connectivity of the brain that supports effective information processing and transfer. Methods: Diffusion-weighted MRI data acquired from female patients with AN (n = 148) and female healthy controls (HC; n = 119), aged 12-40 years, were combined across five cross-sectional studies. Probabilistic tractography was completed, and full cortex connectomes describing streamline counts between 84 brain regions generated and harmonised. The network-based statistic tested between-group differences in connectivity strength of brain subnetworks. Whole-brain connectivity of brain regions was indexed using graph theory tools, and compared between groups using multiple linear regression. Associations between structural connectivity variables that differed between groups, and illness severity markers, were explored amongst AN patients using multiple linear regression. Statistical models included age, motion, and study as covariates. Outcomes: The network-based statistic indicated AN patients, relative to HC, had reduced connectivity in a network comprising subcortical regions and greater connectivity between frontal cortical regions (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Graph theory analyses supported reduced connectivity of subcortical regions, and greater connectivity of left occipital cortex, in patients relative to HC (p < 0.05, permutation corrected). Reduced subcortical network connectivity was associated with lower BMI among the AN group. Interpretation: Structural differences in subcortical and cortical networks are present in AN, and may reflect illness mechanisms.

	<p>Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) is one of the causative genes for early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD). Recently, emerging studies have reported several novel PSEN1 mutations among Asians. In this study, a PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation was discovered in two siblings from Malaysia with a strong family history of disease. This is the second report of PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation among EOAD patients in Asia and in the world. Patients presented symptomatic changes in their behaviors and personality, such as apathy and withdrawal in their 40s. Previous cellular studies with COS1 cell lines revealed the mutation increased the amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) productions. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing was performed on the two siblings with EOAD, and they were analyzed against the virtual panel of 100 genes from various neurodegenerative diseases. In silico modeling was also performed on PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation. This mutation was located on the first transmembrane helix of PSEN1 protein, resulting significant intramolecular stresses in the helices. This helical domain would play a significant role in γ-secretase cleavage for the increased Aβ42 productions. Several other adjacent mutations were reported in this helical domain, including Ile83Thr or Val89Leu. Our study suggested that perturbations in TMI-HLI-TMII regions could also be associated with C-terminal fragment accumulation of APP and enhanced amyloid productions.</p>

	<p>Changes in brain connectivity during language therapy were examined among participants with aphasia (PWA), aiming to shed light on neural reorganization in the language network. Four PWA with anomia following left hemisphere stroke and eight healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Two fMRI scans were administered to all participants with a 3.5-month interval. The fMRI scans included phonological and semantic tasks, each consisting of linguistic and perceptual matching conditions. Between the two fMRI scans, PWA underwent Phonological Components Analysis treatment. Changes in effective connectivity during the treatment were examined within right hemisphere (RH) architecture. The results illustrate that following the treatment, the averaged connectivity of PWA across all perceptual and linguistic conditions in both tasks increased resemblance to HC, reflecting the normalization of neural processes associated with silent object name retrieval. In contrast, connections that were specifically enhanced by the phonological condition in PWA decreased in their resemblance to HC, reflecting emerging compensatory reorganization in RH connectivity to support phonological processing. These findings suggest that both normalization and compensation play a role in neural language reorganization at the chronic stage, occurring simultaneously in the same brain.</p>

	<p>Mind-wandering (MW) is a common phenomenon, defined as task-unrelated thoughts. This study is based on event-related potentials (ERPs), using modified sustained attention to response task (modified SART, mSART) to discuss the neural patterns of different types of MW. In the current study, we defined the MW realized by participants as self-caught MW, and the MW measurement acquired by probes as probe-caught MW. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times (RTs) during self-caught MW were greater than those during non-self-caught MW. The ERP results showed that during self-caught MW, the mean amplitudes of N1 decreased significantly, indicating that the participants’ attention had deviated from the current task. The increase in the mean amplitudes of P2 during self-caught MW indicated lower vigilance. We also found that the mean amplitudes of N300 reduced during self-caught MW, which indicated that cognitive control or monitoring might be affected by self-caught MW. The average amplitudes of P300 were significantly lower during probe-caught MW than during on-task, indicating the impact on high-level cognitive processing. In addition, the amplitudes of N1, P2, and N300 in anterior regions were greater than those in posterior regions. P300 amplitudes during probe-caught MW in the right hemisphere were greater than those of the left hemisphere. In summary, our research results demonstrated that alertness and cognitive processing decreased during both self-caught MW and probe-caught MW. ERPs were statistically different under the conditions of self-caught MW and probe-caught MW. The current study provided new insights into the relationship between MW and neural markers. It was the first study exploring the ERP correlates between self-caught MW and probe-caught MW based on mSART.</p>

                Background: Postoperative hypotension associated with postoperative morbidity and early mortality has been studied previously. Hypertension and other hemodynamic, respiratory, and temperature abnormalities have comparatively understudied during the first postoperative days. Methods: This bi-centre observational cohort study will include 114 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery hospitalized on an unmonitored general care floor and wearing a multi-signal wearable sensor, allowing remote monitoring (Biobeat Technologies Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel). The study will cover the first 72 hours after discharge of the patient from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Several thresholds will be used for each variable (arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and skin temperature). Data obtained using the sensor will be compared to data obtained during the routine nurse follow-up. The primary outcome is hemodynamic abnormality. The secondary outcomes are postoperative respiratory and temperature abnormalities, artefacts and blank/null outputs from the wearable device, postoperative complications, and finally, the ease of use of the device. We hypothesize that remote monitoring will detect abnormalities in vital signs more often or more quickly than the detection by nurses’ routine surveillance. Discussion: A demonstration of the ability of wireless sensors to outperform standard monitoring techniques paves the way for the creation of a loop which includes this monitoring mode, the automated creation of alerts, and the sending of these alerts to caregivers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Paranoia, self-deception and overconfidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rosa A. Rossi-Goldthorpe, Yuan Chang Leong, Pantelis Leptourgos, Philip R. Corlett</p>

Self-deception, paranoia, and overconfidence involve misbeliefs about the self, others, and world. They are often considered mistaken. Here we explore whether they might be adaptive, and further, whether they might be explicable in Bayesian terms. We administered a difficult perceptual judgment task with and without social influence (suggestions from a cooperating or competing partner). Crucially, the social influence was uninformative. We found that participants heeded the suggestions most under the most uncertain conditions and that they did so with high confidence, particularly if they were more paranoid. Model fitting to participant behavior revealed that their prior beliefs changed depending on whether the partner was a collaborator or competitor, however, those beliefs did not differ as a function of paranoia. Instead, paranoia, self-deception, and overconfidence were associated with participants’ perceived instability of their own performance. These data are consistent with the idea that self-deception, paranoia, and overconfidence flourish under uncertainty, and have their roots in low self-esteem, rather than excessive social concern. The model suggests that spurious beliefs can have value–self-deception is irrational yet can facilitate optimal behavior. This occurs even at the expense of monetary rewards, perhaps explaining why self-deception and paranoia contribute to costly decisions which can spark financial crashes and devastating wars.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Narrative event segmentation in the cortical reservoir</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Ford Dominey</p>

Recent research has revealed that during continuous perception of movies or stories, humans display cortical activity patterns that reveal hierarchical segmentation of event structure. Thus, sensory areas like auditory cortex display high frequency segmentation related to the stimulus, while semantic areas like posterior middle cortex display a lower frequency segmentation related to transitions between events. These hierarchical levels of segmentation are associated with different time constants for processing. Likewise, when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, neural responses for the groups were initially different and then gradually aligned. The time constant for alignment followed the segmentation hierarchy: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while some higher-order cortical regions took more than 10 seconds to align. These hierarchical segmentation phenomena can be considered in the context of processing related to comprehension. In a recently described model of discourse comprehension word meanings are modeled by a language model pre-trained on a billion word corpus. During discourse comprehension, word meanings are continuously integrated in a recurrent cortical network. The model demonstrates novel discourse and inference processing, in part because of two fundamental characteristics: real-world event semantics are represented in the word embeddings, and these are integrated in a reservoir network which has an inherent gradient of functional time constants due to the recurrent connections. Here we demonstrate how this model displays hierarchical narrative event segmentation properties beyond the embeddings alone, or their linear integration. The reservoir produces activation patterns that are segmented by a hidden Markov model (HMM) in a manner that is comparable to that of humans. Context construction displays a continuum of time constants across reservoir neuron subsets, while context forgetting has a fixed time constant across these subsets. Importantly, virtual areas formed by subgroups of reservoir neurons with faster time constants segmented with shorter events, while those with longer time constants preferred longer events. This neurocomputational recurrent neural network simulates narrative event processing as revealed by the fMRI event segmentation algorithm provides a novel explanation of the asymmetry in narrative forgetting and construction. The model extends the characterization of online integration processes in discourse to more extended narrative, and demonstrates how reservoir computing provides a useful model of cortical processing of narrative structure.

COVID-19 most likely had its origins in wildlife, and hundreds of thousands of new viruses could spill over from wildlife to humans. We are struggling to combat climate change, and we are staring down the loss of a million species. It’s time to change course.

This Perspective article argues that as we struggle to combat climate change, with the potential loss of a million species and increasing exposure to thousands of new viruses that could spill over from wildlife to humans (as SARS-CoV-2 likely did), it is time to change course.

Evolving in sync with the computation revolution over the past 30 years, computational biology has emerged as a mature scientific field. While the field has made major contributions toward improving scientific knowledge and human health, individual computational biology practitioners at various institutions often languish in career development. As optimistic biologists passionate about the future of our field, we propose solutions for both eager and reluctant individual scientists, institutions, publishers, funding agencies, and educators to fully embrace computational biology. We believe that in order to pave the way for the next generation of discoveries, we need to improve recognition for computational biologists and better align pathways of career success with pathways of scientific progress. With 10 outlined steps, we call on all adjacent fields to move away from the traditional individual, single-discipline investigator research model and embrace multidisciplinary, data-driven, team science.

The widely held assumption that any important scientific information would be available in English underlies the underuse of non-English-language science across disciplines. However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e., the number of 2° × 2° grid cells with relevant studies) of English-language evidence by 12% to 25%, especially in biodiverse regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by the relevant studies) by 5% to 32%, although they do tend to be based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing decisions to address other global challenges.

                Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech, and nonverbal communication, in addition to repetitive or restrictive behaviours. For decades, children with ASD have been familiarising themselves with information and communication technologies (ICT) in their training and diagnosis. One of the ICT areas, namely non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR), has become a noticeable tool to help ASD children in their social training. It provides extensive virtual interaction, a safe environment, and is affordable. An NIVR application is developed to assist the intervention on ASD children. However, the whole experiences of the training need to be validated to conclude its effectiveness.   Methods: A case study was employed as the research method. An evaluation of NIVR application using multiple sources of evidence was guided by Kirkpatrick Model of Evaluation (KME) which was executed via questionnaires, pre- and post-test. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate level 1 and 2 of KME. The target for Level 1 is to assess the reactions to the NIVR application. Level 2 is to gauge the knowledge, confidence, or mindset of participants. Level 2 covers the evaluation prior to the training (pre-test) and after the training (post-test).   Results: On average the ASD children had good experiences and were able to improve their social skills with the NIVR application. Therefore, the combination of serious game, analytics and specific VR type provides good data assessment, facilitate comfortable training, and can be an effective intervention for children with ASD.  Conclusion: The positive trend on both levels shows that the application has a good potential to be used in ASD training. The results could be improved in a higher number of participants. Currently, only a limited number of research participants could be obtained due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cortico-thalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher-order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions, such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the Cerebellum and the Olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn, and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical down-states typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods to measure calcitonin receptor activity, up-regulated in cell stress, apoptosis and autophagy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The expression of the calcitonin receptor (CT Receptor) is widespread throughout the life cycle of mammals and in many diseases, and in these contexts the functions of the common isoforms is largely unknown. The relatively recent development of anti-CT Receptor antibodies that bind separate epitopes on the CTa Receptor and CTb Receptor isoforms has advanced our knowledge and understanding of these events. CT Receptor at the protein level is upregulated in programmed cell death including apoptosis (as described in a previous publication) and autophagy, which is discussed in our upcoming, unpublished review. Incomplete data sets are cited in this review on the upregulation of CACLR (encoding CT Receptor) mRNA, in particular the insert-positive isoform (CTb Receptor), in response to cell stress. Cell stress is induced by growth in depleted foetal bovine serum (dFBS) or without FBS, both of which induce degrees of starvation and autophagy, or dFBS plus staurosporine, which induces apoptosis. Details of the methods deployed to generate these data are described here including measurement of the upregulation of CTb Receptor mRNA with qPCR and nanopore long range sequencing. An anti-CT Receptor antibody also known as CalRexinTM, which binds an epitope in the N-terminal domain, was conjugated to either fluorophore 568, which is accumulated into apoptotic cells as previously reported, or pHrodo Red, a pH dependent fluorescent dye, which is accumulated into autophagic and apoptotic cells.  These conjugates are under development to image programmed cell death. The methods for conjugation and high content imaging on the Operetta platform are described. The high fluorescence intensity at low pH of CalRexin:pHrodo Red in both autophagic and apoptotic cells suggests localisation in autophago-lysosomes and lysosomes respectively. Overall, these observations and the methods that underpin them have contributed to our understanding of the widespread expression of CT Receptor isoforms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau‐atrophy variability reveals phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tau neurofibrillary tangles (T) are the primary driver of downstream neurodegeneration (N) and subsequent cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is substantial variability in the T-N relationship – manifested in higher or lower atrophy than expected for level of tau in a given brain region. The goal of this study was to determine if region-based quantitation of this variability allows for identification of underlying modulatory factors, including polypathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cortical thickness (N) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir SUVR (T) were computed in 104 gray matter regions from a cohort of cognitively-impaired, amyloid-positive (A+) individuals. Region-specific residuals from a robust linear fit between SUVR and cortical thickness were computed as a surrogate for T-N mismatch. A summary T-N mismatch metric defined using residuals were correlated with demographic and imaging-based modulatory factors, and to partition the cohort into data-driven subgroups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The summary T-N mismatch metric correlated with underlying factors such as age and burden of white matter hyperintensity lesions. Data-driven subgroups based on clustering of residuals appear to represent different biologically relevant phenotypes, with groups showing distinct spatial patterns of higher or lower atrophy than expected.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data support the notion that a measure of deviation from a normative relationship between tau burden and neurodegeneration across brain regions in individuals on the AD continuum captures variability due to multiple underlying factors, and can reveal phenotypes, which if validated, may help identify possible contributors to neurodegeneration in addition to tau, which may ultimately be useful for cohort selection in clinical trials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Remdesivir overcomes the S861 roadblock in SARS-CoV-2 polymerase elongation complex</a></h4>

              
                Remdesivir (RDV), a drug effective in COVID-19 treatment, induces a characteristic delayed intervention once incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. Wu et al. reveal that RDV incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase elongation complex can pass the intervention site, while similar mechanism is also found in enterovirus 71 polymerase.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase by nucleotide analogs from a single-molecule perspective</a></h4>

              
                The absence of ‘shovel-ready’ anti-coronavirus drugs during vaccine development has exceedingly worsened the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, new vaccine-resistant variants and coronavirus outbreaks may occur in the near future, and we must be ready to face this possibility. However, efficient antiviral drugs are still lacking to this day, due to our poor understanding of the mode of incorporation and mechanism of action of nucleotides analogs that target the coronavirus polymerase to impair its essential activity. Here, we characterize the impact of remdesivir (RDV, the only FDA-approved anti-coronavirus drug) and other nucleotide analogs (NAs) on RNA synthesis by the coronavirus polymerase using a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform. We reveal that the location of the modification in the ribose or in the base dictates the catalytic pathway(s) used for its incorporation. We show that RDV incorporation does not terminate viral RNA synthesis, but leads the polymerase into backtrack as far as 30 nt, which may appear as termination in traditional ensemble assays. SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the endogenously synthesized product of the viperin antiviral protein, ddhCTP, though the polymerase incorporates this NA well. This experimental paradigm is essential to the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting viral polymerases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experience-dependent weakening of callosal synaptic connections in the absence of postsynaptic FMRP</a></h4>

              
                Reduced structural and functional interhemispheric connectivity correlates with the severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) behaviors in humans. Little is known of how ASD-risk genes regulate callosal connectivity. Here we show that <i>Fmr1</i>, whose loss-of-function leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), cell autonomously promotes maturation of callosal excitatory synapses between somatosensory barrel cortices in mice. Postnatal, cell-autonomous deletion of <i>Fmr1</i> in postsynaptic Layer (L) 2/3 or L5 neurons results in a selective weakening of AMPA receptor- (R), but not NMDA receptor-, mediated callosal synaptic function, indicative of immature synapses. Sensory deprivation by contralateral whisker trimming normalizes callosal input strength, suggesting that experience-driven activity of postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses. In contrast to callosal inputs, synapses originating from local L4 and L2/3 circuits are normal, revealing an input-specific role for postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> in regulation of synaptic connectivity within local and callosal neocortical circuits. These results suggest direct cell autonomous and postnatal roles for FMRP in development of specific cortical circuits and suggest a synaptic basis for long-range functional underconnectivity observed in FXS patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mammalian rod synaptic ribbon is essential for Cav channel facilitation and ultrafast synaptic vesicle fusion</a></h4>

              
                Rod photoreceptors (PRs) use ribbon synapses to transmit visual information. To signal 'no light detected' they release glutamate continually to activate post-synaptic receptors. When light is detected glutamate release pauses. How a rod's individual ribbon enables this process was studied here by recording evoked changes in whole-cell membrane capacitance from wild type and ribbonless (<i>Ribeye</i>-ko) mice. Wild type rods filled with high (10 mM) or low (0.5 mM) concentrations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer EGTA created a readily releasable pool (RRP) of 87 synaptic vesicles (SVs) that emptied as a single kinetic phase with a τ &lt; 0.4 msec. The lower concentration of EGTA accelerated Ca<sub>v</sub> channel opening and facilitated release kinetics. In contrast, ribbonless rods created a much smaller RRP of 22 SVs, and they lacked Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation; however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-release coupling remained tight. These release deficits caused a sharp attenuation of rod-driven light responses. We conclude that the synaptic ribbon facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and establishes a large RRP of SVs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The East Asian gut microbiome is distinct from colocalized white subjects and connected to metabolic health</a></h4>

              
                East Asians experience worse metabolic health outcomes compared to other ethnic groups at lower body mass indices; however, the potential role of the gut microbiota in contributing to these health disparities remains unknown. We conducted a multi-omic study of 46 lean and obese East Asian and White participants living in the San Francisco Bay Area, revealing marked differences between ethnic groups in bacterial richness and community structure. White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading <i>Akkermansia muciniphila.</i> East Asian subjects had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end-products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White subjects could not be explained by dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice demonstrated stable diet- and host genotype-independent differences between the gut microbiotas of East Asian and White individuals that differentially impact host body composition. Taken together, our findings add to the growing body of literature describing variation between ethnicities and provide a starting point for defining the mechanisms through which the microbiome may shape disparate health outcomes in East Asians.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NHE6-depletion corrects ApoE4-mediated synaptic impairments and reduces amyloid plaque load</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the most important and prevalent risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The isoelectric point of ApoE4 matches the pH of the early endosome (EE), causing its delayed dissociation from ApoE receptors and hence impaired endolysosomal trafficking, disruption of synaptic homeostasis and reduced amyloid clearance. We have shown that enhancing endosomal acidification by inhibiting the EE-specific sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) restores vesicular trafficking and normalizes synaptic homeostasis. Remarkably and unexpectedly, loss of NHE6 (encoded by the gene <i>Slc9a6</i>) in mice effectively suppressed amyloid deposition even in the absence of ApoE4, suggesting that accelerated acidification of early endosomes caused by the absence of NHE6 occludes the effect of ApoE on amyloid plaque formation. NHE6 suppression or inhibition may thus be a universal, ApoE-independent approach to prevent amyloid buildup in the brain. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD by which partial NHE6 inhibition reverses the ApoE4 induced endolysosomal trafficking defect and reduces plaque load.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modulation of fracture healing by the transient accumulation of senescent cells</a></h4>

              
                Senescent cells have detrimental effects across tissues with aging but may have beneficial effects on tissue repair, specifically on skin wound healing. However, the potential role of senescent cells in fracture healing has not been defined. Here, we performed an <i>in silico</i> analysis of public mRNAseq data and found that senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers increased during fracture healing. We next directly established that the expression of senescence biomarkers increased markedly during murine fracture healing. We also identified cells in the fracture callus that displayed hallmarks of senescence, including distension of satellite heterochromatin and telomeric DNA damage; the specific identity of these cells, however, requires further characterization. Then, using a genetic mouse model (<i>Cdkn2a<sup>LUC</sup></i>) containing a <i>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></i>-driven luciferase reporter, we demonstrated transient <i>in vivo</i> senescent cell accumulation during callus formation. Finally, we intermittently treated young adult mice following fracture with drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells ('senolytics', Dasatinib plus Quercetin), and showed that this regimen both decreased senescence and SASP markers in the fracture callus and significantly accelerated the time course of fracture healing. Our findings thus demonstrate that senescent cells accumulate transiently in the murine fracture callus and, in contrast to the skin, their clearance does not impair but rather improves fracture healing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired trigeminal control of ingestive behavior in the Prrxl1- / - mouse is associated with a lemniscal-biased orosensory deafferentation</a></h4>

              
                Although peripheral deafferentation studies have demonstrated a critical role for trigeminal afference in modulating the orosensorimotor control of eating and drinking, the central trigeminal pathways mediating that control, as well as the timescale of control, remain to be elucidated. In rodents, three ascending somatosensory pathways process and relay orofacial mechanosensory input: the lemniscal, paralemniscal, and extralemniscal. Two of these pathways (the lemniscal and extralemniscal) exhibit highly structured topographic representations of the orofacial sensory surface, as exemplified by the one-to-one somatotopic mapping between vibrissae on the animals face and barrelettes in brainstem, barreloids in thalamus, and barrels in cortex. Here we use the Prrxl1 knockout mouse model to investigate ingestive behavior deficits associated with disruption of the lemniscal pathway. The Prrxl1 deletion disrupts somatotopic patterning and axonal projections throughout the lemniscal pathway but spares patterning in the extralemniscal nucleus. Our data reveal an imprecise and inefficient ingestive phenotype with deficits that span timescales from milliseconds to months, tightly linking trigeminal input with ingestion, from moment-to-moment consummatory to long term appetitive control. We suggest that ordered assembly of trigeminal sensory information along the lemniscal pathway is critical for the rapid and precise modulation of motor circuits driving eating and drinking action sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Minimal required exposures reveal the primacy of awareness in human face perception</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system is capable of detecting extremely small light signals, as little as one single photon. But what is the visual system's minimal exposure threshold to detect meaningful stimuli? Due to hardware limitations, studies examining fast visual processing typically present stimuli for suprathreshold durations and disrupt processing with a mask. Here, we employed a newly developed tachistoscope that enables sub-millisecond presentations. Combining measures of perceptual sensitivity and recordings of neural activity, we find that both the holistic configuration and the emotional expression of a human face have the same minimal required exposure as the minimal required exposure for faces to reach awareness. These findings indicate that conscious awareness is required for processing meaningful visual information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Key Factors in the Cortical Response to Transcranial Electrical Stimulations--A Multi-Scale Modeling Study</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial electrode stimulation (tES), one of the techniques used to apply non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), modulates cortical activities by delivering weak electric currents through scalp-attached electrodes. This emerging technique has gained increasing attention recently; however, the results of tES vary greatly depending upon subjects and the stimulation paradigm, and its cellular mechanism remains uncertain. In particular, there is a controversy over the factors that determine the cortical response to tES. Some studies have reported that the electric field's (EF) orientation is the determining factor, while others have demonstrated that the EF magnitude itself is the crucial factor. In this work, we conducted an in-depth investigation of cortical activity in two types of electrode montages used widely-the conventional (C)-tES and high-definition (HD)-tES-as well as two stimulation waveforms-direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). To do so, we constructed a multi-scale model by coupling an anatomically realistic human head model and morphologically realistic multi-compartmental models of three types of cortical neurons (layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron, layer 4 basket cell, layer 5 pyramidal neuron). Then, we quantified the neuronal response to the C-/HD-tDCS/tACS and explored the relation between the electric field (EF) and the radial field's (RF: radial component of EF) magnitude and the cortical neurons' threshold. The EF tES induced depended upon the electrode montage, and the neuronal responses were correlated with the EF rather than the RF's magnitude. The electrode montages and stimulation waveforms caused a small difference in threshold, but the higher correlation between the EF's magnitude and the threshold was consistent. Further, we observed that the neurons' morphological features affected the degree of the correlation highly. Thus, the EF magnitude was a key factor in the responses of neurons with arborized axons. Our results demonstrate that the crucial factor in neuronal excitability depends upon the neuron models' morphological and biophysical properties. Hence, to predict the cellular targets of NIBS precisely, it is necessary to adopt more advanced neuron models that mimic realistic morphological and biophysical features of actual human cells.

                Unlike mammals, zebrafish regenerate in response to retinal damage. Because microglia are activated by retinal damage, we investigated their role during regeneration following acute or chronic damage. At three weeks-post-fertilization (wpf), fish exhibiting NMDA-induced acute damage or cone photoreceptor-specific chronic degeneration, the gold rush (gosh) mutant, displayed reactive microglia and Muller glia proliferation. Retinas treated to inhibit the immune response lacked reactive microglia and possessed fewer PCNA-positive cells, while LPS treatment increased microglia and PCNA-labeled cells. NMDA-injured retinas upregulated the expression of il-1{beta} and tnf- pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, followed by increased expression of il-10 and arg1 anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine genes. An early and transiently TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia population was identified in the NMDA-damaged retina. In contrast, gosh mutant retinas exhibited a mild increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression concurrently with a greater increased in anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine gene expression. Few TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia were observed in the gosh retina. How inflammation regulates regeneration in zebrafish would provide important clues towards improving the therapeutic strategies for repairing injured mammalian tissues.

                Sexual assault and rape are crimes that impact victims worldwide. Although the psychosocial and eco-evolutionary factors associated with this antisocial behavior have repeatedly been studied, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unknown mainly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model of sexual aggression (SxA). Here, we established a novel paradigm to provoke and subsequently assess SxA in adult male Wistar rats: the sexual aggression test (SxAT). Briefly, male Wistar rats are sexually aroused by a receptive female, which is exchanged by a non-receptive female immediately after the first intromission. This protocol elicits forced mounting (FM) and aggressive behavior (AB) towards the non-receptive female to different degrees, which can be scored. In a series of experiments we can show that SxA behavior is a relatively stable trait in rats and correlates positively with sexual motivation. Rats with innate abnormal anxiety and aggressive behavior also show abnormal SxA behavior. In addition, central infusion of oxytocin moderately inhibits AB, but increases FM. Finally, we identified the agranular insular cortex to be specifically activated by SxA, and inhibition of this region mildly decreased AB during the SxAT. Altogether, the SxAT is a paradigm that can be readily implemented in behavioral laboratories as a valuable tool to find answers regarding the biological mechanisms underlying SxA in humans, as well as social decision-making in general.

                Sex-specific differences in the aging cerebellum may be related to hormone changes with menopause. We evaluated the influence of reproductive stage on lobular cerebellar network connectivity using data from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience repository. We used raw structural and resting state neuroimaging data and information regarding age, sex, and menopause-related variables. Crus I and II and Lobules V and VI were our cerebellar seeds of interest. We characterized reproductive stage using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria. Results show that postmenopausal females have lower cerebello-striatal and cerebello-cortical connectivity, particularly in frontal regions, along with lower connectivity within the cerebellum, compared to reproductive females. Postmenopausal females also exhibit greater connectivity in some brain areas as well. Differences begin to emerge across transitional stages of menopause. Further, results reveal sex-specific differences in connectivity between female reproductive groups and age-matched male control groups. This suggests that menopause may influence cerebellar network connectivity in aging females, and sex differences in the aging brain may be related to this biological process.

                Gastrointestinal complaints in autism are common and impact the quality of life of affected individuals, yet the underlying mechanisms are understudied. We have found that individuals with mutations in CHD8 present with gastrointestinal disturbances. We have shown that loss of chd8, the sole ortholog of CHD8 in zebrafish, leads to reduced number of enteric neurons and decreased intestinal mobility. However, it remains unclear how chd8 acts during the development of the enteric nervous system and whether CHD8-associated gastrointestinal complaints are solely due to impaired neuronal function in the intestine. Here, utilizing a stable chd8 mutant zebrafish model, we found that the loss of chd8 leads to reduced number of vagal neural crest cells (NCCs), enteric neural progenitors, emigrating from the neural tube and their early migration capability was altered. At later stages, although the intestinal colonization by the NCCs was complete, we found decreased numbers of both NCC-derived serotonergic neurons and serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, suggesting an intestinal hyposerotonemia in absence of chd8. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed altered expression of key receptors and enzymes in serotonin and acetylcholine signaling pathways. Next, tissue examination of chd8 mutants revealed thinner intestinal epithelium accompanied by accumulation of neutrophils and decreased numbers of goblet cells and eosinophils. Last, single-cell sequencing of whole mid- and posterior intestines showed a global disruption of the immune balance with perturbed expression of inflammatory interleukins and changes in immune cell clusters. Our findings propose a causal developmental link between chd8, serotonergic pathway, intestinal homeostasis, and autism-associated gastrointestinal complaints.

                Developmental neuron death plays a pivotal role in refining organization and wiring during neocortex formation. Aberrant regulation of this process results in neurodevelopmental disorders including impaired learning and memory. Underlying molecular pathways are incompletely determined. Loss of Bcl11a in cortical projection neurons induces pronounced cell death in upper-layer cortical projection neurons during postnatal corticogenesis. We used this genetic model to explore genetic mechanisms by which developmental neuron death is controlled. Unexpectedly, we found Bcl6, previously shown to be involved in transition of cortical neurons from progenitor to postmitotic differentiation state to provide a major check point regulating neuron survival during late cortical development. We show that Bcl11a is a direct transcriptional regulator of Bcl6. Deletion of Bcl6 exerts death of cortical projection neurons. In turn, reintroduction of Bcl6 into Bcl11a mutants prevents induction of cell death in these neurons. Together, our data identify a novel Bcl11a/Bcl6-dependent molecular pathway in regulation of developmental cell death during corticogenesis.

                Muller glia (MG) in mammalian retinas are incapable of regenerating neurons after damage, whereas the MG in lower vertebrates regenerate functional neurons. Identification networks that regulate MG-mediated regeneration is key to harnessing the regenerative potential of MG. Here we study how NFkB-signaling influences glial responses to damage and reprogramming of MG into neurons in the rodent retina. We find activation of NFkB and dynamic expression of NFkB-associated genes in MG after damage, however NFkB activity is inhibited by microglia ablation. Knockout of NFkB in MG suppressed the accumulation of immune cells after damage. Inhibition of NFkB following NMDA-damage significantly enhanced the reprogramming of Ascl1-overexpressing MG into neuron-like cells. scRNA-seq of retinal glia following inhibition of NFkB reveals coordination with signaling via TGFb2 and suppression of NFI and Id transcription factors. Inhibition of Smad3 or Id transcription factors increased numbers of neuron-like cells produced by Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that NFkB is a key signaling hub that is activated in MG after damage, mediates the accumulation of immune cells, and suppresses the neurogenic potential of MG.

                Geosmin is an odorant produced by bacteria in moist soil. It has been found to be extraordinarily relevant to some insects, but the reasons for this are not yet fully understood. Here we report the first tests of the effect of geosmin on honey bees. A stinging assay showed that the defensive behaviour elicited by the bee's alarm pheromone is strongly suppressed by geosmin. Surprisingly, the suppression is, however, only present at very low geosmin concentrations, and completely disappears at higher concentrations. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the behavioural change at the level of the olfactory receptor neurons by means of electroantennography and at the level of the antennal lobe output via calcium imaging. Unusual effects were observed at both levels. The responses of the olfactory receptor neurons to mixtures of geosmin and the alarm pheromone component isoamyl acetate (IAA) were lower than to pure IAA, suggesting an interaction of both compounds at the olfactory receptor level. In the antennal lobe, the neuronal representation of geosmin showed a glomerular activation that decreased with increasing concentration, correlating well with the concentration dependence of the behaviour. Computational modelling of odour transduction and odour coding in the antennal lobe suggests that a broader than usual activation of different olfactory receptor types by geosmin in combination with lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe could lead to the observed non-monotonic increasing-decreasing responses to geosmin and thus underlie the specificity of the behavioural response to low geosmin concentrations.

                Neural computations can be framed as dynamical processes, whereby the structure of the dynamics within a neural network are a direct reflection of the computations that the network performs. A key step in generating mechanistic interpretations within this computation through dynamics framework is to establish the link between network connectivity, dynamics and computation. This link is only partly understood. Recent work has focused on producing algorithms for engineering artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) with dynamics targeted to a specific goal manifold. Some of these algorithms only require a set of vectors tangent to the target manifold to be computed, and thus provide a general method that can be applied to a diverse set of problems. Nevertheless, computing such vectors for an arbitrary manifold in a high dimensional state space remains highly challenging, which in practice limits the applicability of this approach. Here we demonstrate how topology and differential geometry can be leveraged to simplify this task, by first computing tangent vectors on a low-dimensional topological manifold and then embedding these in state space. The simplicity of this procedure greatly facilitates the creation of manifold-targeted RNNs, as well as the process of designing task-solving on-manifold dynamics. This new method should enable the application of network engineering-based approaches to a wide set of problems in neuroscience and machine learning. Furthermore, our description of how fundamental concepts from differential geometry can be mapped onto different aspects of neural dynamics is a further demonstration of how the language of differential geometry can enrich the conceptual framework for describing neural dynamics and computation.

To that end, we used the spatial resolution and sensitivity of ultra-high field fMRI to probe timescales across the whole macaque brain. We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from fMRI and electrophysiology. Crucially, we were not only able to demonstrate that we can replicate existing electrophysiological hierarchies, but we extended these to whole brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Second, with those results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional FC topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match functional connectivity gradient topographies across the whole brain. We conclude that intrinsic timescales are an unifying organizational principle of neural processing across the whole brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel and Functionally Diverse Class of Acetylcholine-gated Ion Channels</a></h4>

              
                Fast cholinergic neurotransmission is mediated by pentameric acetylcholine-gated ion channels; in particular, cationic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play well-established roles in virtually all nervous systems. Acetylcholine-gated anion channels have also been identified in some invertebrate phyla, yet their roles in the nervous system are less well-understood. Here we describe the functional properties of five previously-uncharacterized acetylcholine-gated anion channels from C. elegans, including four from a novel nematode specific subfamily known as the diverse group. In addition to their activation by acetylcholine, these diverse group channels are activated at physiological concentrations by other ligands; three, encoded by the lgc-40, lgc-57 and lgc-58 genes, are activated by choline, while lgc-39 encoded channels are activated by octopamine and tyramine. Intriguingly, these and other acetylcholine-gated anion channels show extensive co-expression with cation-selective nicotinic receptors, implying that many cholinergic synapses may have both excitatory and inhibitory potential. Thus, the evolutionary expansion of cholinergic ligand-gated ion channels may enable complex synaptic signalling in an anatomically compact nervous system.

                Predatory animals first detect, then pursue, and ultimately capture prey. Sensory cues, including scent emitted by prey, are detected by the predator and used to guide pursuit. Because the pursuit phase can last for extended periods of time, it is critical for predators to persist in the chase even when prey is difficult to detect in a noisy sensory land-scape. It is equally important for predators to abandon pursuit if enough time has elapsed that prey capture is unlikely to occur. We studied prey detection and sustained pursuit in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a micropredator of humans. These animals first detect hu-mans through sensory cues that are emitted at a distance such as carbon dioxide in breath and odor from skin. As the mosquito approaches a human, additional cues such as body heat and visual contrast signal the promise of a blood meal, which females need to produce eggs. To study how initial prey detection influences the duration of pursuit, we developed optogenetic tools to induce a brief fictive sensation of carbon dioxide and used machine learning-based classification of behavior to investigate how mosquitoes respond to subsequent human cues. We found that a 5-second optogenetic pulse of fictive carbon dioxide induced a persistent behavioral state in female mosquitoes that lasted for more than 10 minutes. This state is highly specific to females searching for a blood meal and was not induced in recently blood-fed females or in males, who do not feed on blood. In males that lack the gene fruitless, which controls persistent social behaviors in other insects, fictive carbon dioxide induced a long-lasting behavior response resembling the predatory state of females. Finally, we show that the persistent state triggered by detection of fictive carbon dioxide enabled females to engorge on a blood meal mimic offered up to 14 minutes after the initial stimulus. Our results demonstrate that a persistent internal state allows female mosquitoes to integrate multiple human sensory cues over long timescales, an ability that is key to their success as an apex micropredator of humans

                Theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) are dynamically modulated by speed and direction in freely moving animals. However, due to the paucity of electrophysiological recordings of freely moving humans, this mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we combined mobile-EEG with fully immersive virtual-reality to investigate theta dynamics in twenty-two healthy adults (aged 18-29 years old) freely navigating a T-maze to find rewards. Our results revealed three dynamic periods of theta modulation: 1) theta power increases coincided with the participants' decision-making period; 2) theta power increased for fast and leftward trials as subjects approached the goal location; and 3) feedback onset evoked two phase-locked theta bursts over the right temporal and frontal-midline channels. These results suggest that recording scalp EEG in freely moving humans navigating a simple virtual T-maze can be utilized as a powerful translational model by which to map theta dynamics during "real-life" goal-directed behavior in both health and disease.

                Perceptual learning (PL) involves long-lasting improvement in perceptual tasks following extensive training. Such improvement has been found to correlate with modifications in neuronal response properties in early as well as late sensory cortical areas. A major challenge is to dissect the causal relation between modification of the neural circuits and the behavioral changes. Previous theoretical and computational studies of PL have largely focused on single-layer model networks, and thus did not address salient characteristics of PL arising from the multiple-staged "deep" structure of the perceptual system. Here we develop a theory of PL in a deep neuronal network architecture, addressing the questions of how changes induced by PL are distributed across the multiple stages of cortex, and how do the respective changes determine the performance in fine discrimination tasks. We prove that in such tasks, modifications of synaptic weights of early sensory areas are both sufficient and necessary for PL. In addition, optimal synaptic weights in the deep network are not unique but span a large space of solutions. We postulate that, in the brain, plasticity throughout the deep network is distributed such that the resultant perturbation on prior circuit structures is minimized. In contrast to most previous models of PL, the minimum perturbation (MP) learning does not change the network readout weights. Our results provide mechanistic and normative explanations for several important physiological features of PL and reconcile apparently contradictory psychophysical findings.

                Training of autobiographical memory has been proposed as intervention to improve cognitive functions. The neural substrates for such improvements are poorly understood. Several brain networks have been previously linked to autobiographical recollections, including the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Here we tested the hypothesis that different neural networks support distinct aspects of memory improvement in response to training on a group of 59 subjects. We found that memory training increases DMN connectivity, and this associates with improved recollection of cue-specific memories. On the contrary, training decreased connectivity in the sensorimotor network, a decrease that correlated with improved ability for voluntary recall. Moreover, only decreased sensorimotor connectivity associated with training-induced decrease in the TNFalpha; immunological factor, which has been previously linked to improved cognitive performance. We identified functional and biochemical factors that associate with distinct memory processes improved by autobiographical training. Pathways which connect autobiographical memory to both high level cognition and somatic physiology are discussed.

                The understanding of brain network interactions in cognitively healthy older adults informs how brain characteristics vary as individuals age and how these variations affect cognitive functioning. A functional connectivity analysis can reveal important insight into the brain's organization, which is crucial to examining cognitive aging. We investigated functional network properties in 146 cognitively healthy participants aged 85+ in the McKnight Brain Aging Registry. We found that the segregation of the cortical association system and the segregation of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) were stronger predictors of cognition and executive function. Compared to other network metrics, the segregation of networks may be more closely linked with cognitive performance and age-related dedifferentiation. We also provide a healthy oldest-old (85+) cortical parcellation that can be used in future work in this age group. This study shows that network segregation of the oldest-old brain supports cognition. Specifically, the FPN plays an important role in supporting overall cognition and executive function in an aging population. By studying network dynamics and cognitive abilities of healthy brain aging, we advance the literature on dedifferentiation in the oldest-old.

                Causally relating the detailed structure and function of neural circuits to behavior requires the ability to precisely and simultaneously write-in and read-out neural activity. All optical systems that combine two photon (2p) calcium imaging and targeted photostimulation provide such an approach, but require co-expression of an activity indicator, such as GCaMP, and an optogenetic actuator, ideally a potent soma-targeted opsin. In the mammalian brain, such co-expression has so far been achieved by viral transduction, which is invasive and can produce variable, focal, and sometimes toxic overexpression. To overcome this challenge, we developed and validated a Cre-reporter mouse ("Ai203") that conditionally expresses a soma-targeted opsin, ChroME, fused to GCaMP7s. 1p or 2p illumination of expressing neurons in vitro and in vivo produces powerful, precise activation comparable to viral expression of ChroME. The soma-targeted GCaMP7s provides sensitive activity measurements for tracking physiological activity, and the soma-targeted ChroME provides powerful control over neural ensemble activity with holographic optogenetics. We further demonstrate the use of the Ai203 reporter line in 1p optogenetic manipulation of performance on a cortex-dependent visual task and in 2p synaptic connectivity mapping. This new transgenic line could thus greatly facilitate the study of neural circuits by providing a flexible, convenient, and stable tool for all-optical access to large, cell-type specific neural populations throughout the nervous system.

                Background Smokers vary in their motives for tobacco seeking, suggesting that they could benefit from personalized treatments. However, these variations have received little attention in animal models for the study of tobacco dependence. In the most classically used model, ie. intravenous self-administration of nicotine in the rat, seeking behaviour is reinforced by the combination of intravenous nicotine with a discrete stimulus (eg. discrete cue light). In both human and animals, two types of psychopharmacological interactions between nicotine and environmental stimuli have been evidenced. Whether these two types of interactions contribute equally to nicotine seeking in all individuals is unknown. Methods We combined behavioural pharmacology and clustering analysis. In an outbred male rat population, we tested whether nicotine and the discrete nicotine-associated cue light contributed equally to self-administration in all individuals. Two clusters of rats were identified, in which we further studied the nature of the psychopharmacological interaction between nicotine and the cue, as well as the response to the cessation aid varenicline when nicotine was withdrawn. Results Notably, withdrawing nicotine produced drastic opposed effects on seeking behavior in the two identified clusters of rats; a 50% increase vs a 18% decrease, respectively. The first cluster of rats sought for the primary reinforcing effects of nicotine and the discrete cue light that has gained nicotine-like secondary reinforcing properties. The second cluster sought nicotine for its ability to enhance the primary reinforcing effects of the discrete cue light. Critically, the approved cessation aid Varenicline counteracted the absence of nicotine in both, but eventually decreasing seeking in the former but increasing it in the latter. Conclusions Classical rodent models for the study of the reinforcing and addictive effects of nicotine hide individual variations in the psychopharmacological motives supporting seeking behavior. These variations may be a decisive asset for improving their predictive validity in the perspective of precision medicine for smoking cessation.

                The ability to decide swiftly and accurately in an urgent scenario is crucial for an organism's survival. The neural mechanisms underlying the perceptual decision and trade-off between speed and accuracy have been extensively studied in the past few decades. Among several theoretical models, the attractor neural network model has successfully captured both behavioral and neuronal data observed in many decision experiments. However, a recent experimental study revealed additional details that were not considered in the original attractor model. In particular, the study shows that the inhibitory neurons in the posterior parietal cortex of mice are as selective to decision making results as the excitatory neurons, whereas the original attractor model assumes the inhibitory neurons to be unselective. In this study, we investigate a more general attractor model with selective inhibition, and analyze in detail how the computational ability of the network changes with selectivity. We proposed a reduced model for the selective model, and showed that selectivity adds a time-varying component to the energy landscape. This time dependence of the energy landscape allows the selective model to integrate information carefully in initial stages, then quickly converge to an attractor once the choice is clear. This results in the selective model having a more efficient speed-accuracy trade-off that is unreachable by unselective models.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes, are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as ‘hums’ to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor (VMN) nuclei that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in non-humming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA, PAG) and temporal structure (VPP, VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

                Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) involves the attachment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike proteins to the ACE2 receptors on the peripheral membrane of host cells. Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD...

                Rotavirus genomes are distributed between 11 distinct RNA molecules, all of which must be selectively copackaged during virus assembly. This likely occurs through sequence-specific RNA interactions facilitated by the RNA chaperone NSP2. Here, we report that NSP2 autoregulates its chaperone activity through its C-terminal region (CTR) that promotes RNA–RNA interactions...
