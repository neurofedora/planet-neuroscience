              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-597/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Metastatic Duodenal Neuroendocrine Tumor: A Rare Cause of Humoral Hypercalcemia of Malignancy [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome commonly associated with solid organ and hematological malignancies. Its occurrence in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is rare, with majority cases in pancreatic NETs. Here, we describe an extremely rare case of a metastatic duodenal NET presenting with severe hypercalcemia due to the secretion of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP). This case features an exceptionally high PTHrP level, making it one of the most severe reported cases of NET-associated HHM. Case Presentation: A 70-year-old Indian male with hypertension and diabetes mellitus was found to have a well-differentiated Duodenal NET (grade 2, Ki67 index: 18.2%; T2N1M0). He underwent distal gastrectomy with D1 duodenal resection. Subsequent disease progression with hepatic and peripancreatic nodal metastases was managed with octreotide injections, Everolimus and Lutetium177 DOTATATE PRRT (Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy). Six months later, he presented with acute unresponsiveness and severe hypercalcemia (corrected calcium: 14.06 mg/dL) with suppressed iPTH levels (Intact Parathyroid Hormone) and markedly elevated PTHrP levels of 252 pmol/L (Parathyroid Hormone related Peptide), thereby confirming HHM. Multiple myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis were excluded. Despite management with intravenous fluids, calcitonin, ibandronate, and multiple hemodialysis sessions, the patient succumbed to hypoxic brain injury. Discussion: We report a rare case of metastatic duodenal NET causing severe hypercalcemia due to excessive PTHrP production. With a remarkably elevated PTHrP level, this case is one amongst the most severe documented cases. The relationship between tumour grade and PTHrP production along with the refractory nature of the hypercalcemia, highlights the complex pathophysiology of this condition. Conclusion: PTHrP-mediated humoral hypercalcemia is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of duodenal NETs and is associated with adverse outcomes. Early recognition of this paraneoplastic syndrome, prompt metabolic correction, and timely escalation of NET-directed therapies, including consideration of PRRT, are crucial to improving clinical outcomes in patients with aggressive, receptor-positive disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-252/v1?src=rss">Experimental Investigation of H-Pile Performance in Layered Soils [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents an experimental study on the behavior of H-piles buried in a stratified soil section, considering variations in the position and depth of a weakly clay layer. Tests were conducted in a specially fabricated steel enclosure attached to a rigid load-bearing frame to impose a uniform stress and minimize boundary effects. The clay layer was placed at three depths: L1(top layer near the surface), L2 (middle layer, mid-depth of pile), and L3 (at the bottom, beneath the pile) and tested under four different textures: solid clay (SCL), semi-solid clay (SSCL), semi-liquid clay (SLCL), and liquid clay (LCL). Axial loading tests were carried out using a laboratory loading apparatus that adopted the general principles of ASTM D1143 in the method of applying the load and measuring the settlement, with some modifications made as needed to suit the tests of scale models. The test results indicated that the ultimate bearing capacity and overall load-bearing strength of the piles were strongly affected by the position and texture of the clay layer. A clay that is solid enhances resistance to piles, particularly in situations where the layer is near the surface and is supported by sand that is under the surface. However, liquid clay led to a significant reduction in the load-carrying capacity of the piles. Overall, the objective of the current research is to determine the combined effect of soil hardness, depth, and the soils surrounding the piles on the H-response of the piles in stratified soils in order to make certain recommendations that are somewhat practical for designing a foundation in soils with various subsurface characteristics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11478">Defining causal mechanism in dual process theory and two types of feedback control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental events are considered to supervene on physical events. A supervenient event does not change without a corresponding change in the underlying subvenient physical events. Since wholes and their parts exhibit the same supervenience-subvenience relations, inter-level causation has been expected to serve as a model for mental causation. We proposed an inter-level causation mechanism to construct a model of consciousness and an agent's self-determination. However, a significant gap exists between this mechanism and cognitive functions. Here, we demonstrate how to integrate the inter-level causation mechanism with the widely known dual-process theories. We assume that the supervenience level is composed of multiple supervenient functions (i.e., neural networks), and we argue that inter-level causation can be achieved by controlling the feedback error defined through changing algebraic expressions combining these functions. Using inter-level causation allows for a dual laws model in which each level possesses its own distinct dynamics. In this framework, the feedback error is determined independently by two processes: (1) the selection of equations combining supervenient functions, and (2) the negative feedback error reduction to satisfy the equations through adjustments of neurons and synapses. We interpret these two independent feedback controls as Type 1 and Type 2 processes in the dual process theories. As a result, theories of consciousness, agency, and dual process theory are unified into a single framework, and the characteristic features of Type 1 and Type 2 processes are naturally derived.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11956">TAVAE: A VAE with Adaptable Priors Explains Contextual Modulation in the Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain interprets visual information through learned regularities, a computation formalized as probabilistic inference under a prior. The visual cortex establishes priors for this inference, some delivered through established top-down connections that inform low-level cortices about statistics represented at higher levels in the cortical hierarchy. While evidence shows that adaptation leads to priors reflecting the structure of natural images, it remains unclear whether similar priors can be flexibly acquired when learning a specific task. To investigate this, we built a generative model of V1 optimized for a simple discrimination task and analyzed it together with large-scale recordings from mice performing an analogous task. In line with recent approaches, we assumed that neuronal activity in V1 corresponds to latent posteriors in the generative model, enabling investigation of task-related priors in neuronal responses. To obtain a flexible test bed, we extended the VAE formalism so that a task can be acquired efficiently by reusing previously learned representations. Task-specific priors learned by this Task-Amortized VAE were used to investigate biases in mice and model when presenting stimuli that violated trained task statistics. Mismatch between learned task statistics and incoming sensory evidence produced signatures of uncertainty in stimulus category in the TAVAE posterior, reflecting properties of bimodal response profiles in V1 recordings. The task-optimized generative model accounted for key characteristics of V1 population activity, including within-day updates to population responses. Our results confirm that flexible task-specific contextual priors can be learned on demand by the visual system and deployed as early as the entry level of visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11206">UltraLIF: Fully Differentiable Spiking Neural Networks via Ultradiscretization and Max-Plus Algebra</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient, biologically plausible computation but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, necessitating reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients. This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\eps \to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. An optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11234">Learning Glioblastoma Tumor Heterogeneity Using Brain Inspired Topological Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17525">When a Man Says He Is Pregnant: Event-related Potential Evidence for a Rational Account of Speaker-contextualized Language Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken language is often, if not always, understood in a context formed by the identity of the speaker. For example, we can easily make sense of an utterance such as "I'm going to have a manicure this weekend" or "The first time I got pregnant I had a hard time" when spoken by a woman, but it would be harder to understand when it is spoken by a man. Previous ERP studies have shown mixed results regarding the neurophysiological responses to such speaker-content mismatches, with some reporting an N400 effect and others a P600 effect. In an EEG experiment involving 64 participants, we used social and biological mismatches as test cases to demonstrate how these distinct ERP patterns reflect different aspects of rational inference. We showed that when the mismatch involves social stereotypes (e.g., men getting a manicure), listeners can arrive at a "literal" interpretation by integrating the content with their social knowledge, though this integration requires additional effort due to stereotype violations-resulting in an N400 effect. In contrast, when the mismatch involves biological knowledge (e.g., men getting pregnant), a "literal" interpretation becomes highly implausible or impossible, leading listeners to treat the input as potentially containing errors and engage in correction processes-resulting in a P600 effect. Supporting this rational inference framework, we found that the social N400 effect decreased as a function of the listener's personality trait of openness (as more open-minded individuals maintain more flexible social expectations), while the biological P600 effect remained robust (as biological constraints are recognized regardless of individual personalities). Our findings help to reconcile empirical inconsistencies and reveal how rational inference shapes speaker-contextualized language comprehension.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03247">A sub-Riemannian model of neural states in the primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a neurogeometric model for the arm area of motor cortex, which encodes complex motor primitives, ranging from simple movement features like movement direction, to short hand trajectories, termed fragments, and ultimately to more complex patterns known as neural states (Georgopoulos, Hatsopoulos, Kadmon-Harpaz et al). Based on the sub-riemannian framework introduced in 2023, we model the space of fragments as a set of short curves defined by kinematic parameters. We then introduce a geometric kernel that serves as a model for cortical connectivity and use it in a differential equation to describe cortical activity. By applying a grouping algorithm to this cortical activity model, we successfully recover the neural states observed in Kadmon-Harpaz et al, which were based on measured cortical activity. This confirms that the choice of kinematic variables and the distance metric used here are sufficient to explain the phenomena of neural state formation. The modularity of our model reflects the brain's hierarchical structure, where initial groupings in the kinematic space $\mathcal{M}$ lead to more abstract representations. This approach mimics how the brain processes stimuli at different scales, extracting both local and global properties.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18314">BrainSymphony: A parameter-efficient multimodal foundation model for brain dynamics with limited data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.18314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are transforming neuroscience but are often prohibitively large, data-hungry, and difficult to deploy. Here, we introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight and parameter-efficient foundation model with plug-and-play integration of fMRI time series and diffusion-derived structural connectivity, allowing unimodal or multimodal training and deployment without architectural changes while requiring substantially less data compared to the state-of-the-art. The model processes fMRI time series through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, distilled into compact embeddings by a Perceiver module, while a novel signed graph transformer encodes anatomical connectivity from diffusion MRI. These complementary representations are then combined through an adaptive fusion mechanism. Despite its compact design, BrainSymphony consistently outperforms larger models on benchmarks spanning prediction, classification, and unsupervised network discovery. Highlighting the model's generalizability and interpretability, attention maps reveal drug-induced context-dependent reorganization of cortical hierarchies in an independent psilocybin neuroimaging dataset. BrainSymphony delivers accessible, interpretable, and clinically meaningful results and demonstrates that architecturally informed, multimodal models can surpass much larger counterparts and advance applications of AI in neuroscience.

                arXiv:2602.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological neural networks (BNNs) are increasingly explored for their rich dynamics, parallelism, and adaptive behavior. Beyond understanding their function as a scientific endeavour, a key focus has been using these biological systems as a novel computing substrate. However, BNNs can only function as reliable information-processing systems if inputs are delivered in a temporally and structurally consistent manner. In practice, this requires stimulation with precisely controlled structure, microsecond-scale timing, multi-channel synchronization, and the ability to observe and respond to neural activity in real-time. Existing approaches to interacting with BNNs face a fundamental trade-off: they either depend on low-level hardware mechanisms, imposing prohibitive complexity for rapid iteration, or they sacrifice temporal and structural control, undermining consistency and reproducibility - particularly in closed-loop experiments. The Cortical Labs Application Programming Interface (CL API) enables real-time, sub-millisecond closed-loop interactions with BNNs. Taking a contract-based API design approach, the CL API provides users with precise stimulation semantics, transactional admission, deterministic ordering, and explicit synchronization guarantees. This contract is presented through a declarative Python interface, enabling non-expert programmers to express complex stimulation and closed-loop behavior without managing low-level scheduling or hardware details. Ultimately, the CL API provides an accessible and reproducible foundation for real-time experimentation with BNNs, supporting both fundamental biological research and emerging neurocomputing applications.

                arXiv:2602.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary search is well suited for large-scale biophysical brain modeling, where many parameters with nonlinear interactions and no tractable gradients need to be optimized. Standard evolutionary approaches achieve an excellent fit to MRI data; however, among many possible such solutions, it finds ones that overfit to individual subjects and provide limited predictive power. This paper investigates whether guiding evolution with biological knowledge can help. Focusing on whole-brain Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) models, a baseline where 20 parameters were shared across the brain was compared against a heterogeneous formulation where different sets of 20 parameters were used for the seven canonical brain regions. The heterogeneous model was optimized using four strategies: optimizing all parameters at once, a curricular approach following the hierarchy of brain networks (HICO), a reversed curricular approach, and a randomly shuffled curricular approach. While all heterogeneous strategies fit the data well, only curricular approaches generalized to new subjects. Most importantly, only HICO made it possible to use the parameter sets to predict the subjects' behavioral abilities as well. Thus, by guiding evolution with biological knowledge about the hierarchy of brain regions, HICO demonstrated how domain knowledge can be harnessed to serve the purpose of optimization in real-world domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12236">Energy-Aware Spike Budgeting for Continual Learning in Spiking Neural Networks for Neuromorphic Vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic vision systems based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer ultra-low-power perception for event-based and frame-based cameras, yet catastrophic forgetting remains a critical barrier to deployment in continually evolving environments. Existing continual learning methods, developed primarily for artificial neural networks, seldom jointly optimize accuracy and energy efficiency, with particularly limited exploration on event-based datasets. We propose an energy-aware spike budgeting framework for continual SNN learning that integrates experience replay, learnable leaky integrate-and-fire neuron parameters, and an adaptive spike scheduler to enforce dataset-specific energy constraints during training. Our approach exhibits modality-dependent behavior: on frame-based datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10), spike budgeting acts as a sparsity-inducing regularizer, improving accuracy while reducing spike rates by up to 47\%; on event-based datasets (DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10-DVS), controlled budget relaxation enables accuracy gains up to 17.45 percentage points with minimal computational overhead. Across five benchmarks spanning both modalities, our method demonstrates consistent performance improvements while minimizing dynamic power consumption, advancing the practical viability of continual learning in neuromorphic vision systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11322">Predictive Associative Memory: Retrieval Beyond Similarity Through Temporal Co-occurrence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to memory in neural systems rely on similarity-based retrieval: given a query, find the most representationally similar stored state. This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds. All results are stable across seeds (SD < 0.006) and query selections (SD $\leq$ 0.012).

                arXiv:2601.00668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are dynamical systems that operate on spatiotemporal data, yet their learnable parameters are often limited to synaptic weights, contributing little to temporal pattern recognition. Learnable parameters that delay spike times can improve classification performance in temporal tasks, but existing methods rely on large networks and offline learning, making them unsuitable for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce synaptic and axonal delays to leaky integrate and fire (LIF)-based feedforward and recurrent SNNs, and propose three-factor learning rules to simultaneously learn delay parameters online. We employ a smooth Gaussian surrogate to approximate spike derivatives exclusively for the eligibility trace calculation, and together with a top-down error signal determine parameter updates. Our experiments show that incorporating delays improves accuracy by up to 20% over a weights-only baseline, and for networks with similar parameter counts, jointly learning weights and delays yields up to 14% higher accuracy. On the SHD speech recognition dataset, our method achieves similar accuracy to offline backpropagation-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it reduces model size by 6.6x and inference latency by 67%, with only a 2.4% drop in classification accuracy. Our findings benefit the design of power and area-constrained neuromorphic processors by enabling on-device learning and lowering memory requirements.

                arXiv:2602.10763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work utilized a non-sequential simulation-based inference algorithm to provide an amortized neural density estimator, which approximates the posterior distribution for seven parameters of the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron model of the analog neuromorphic BrainScaleS-2 substrate. We constrained the large parameter space by training a binary classifier to predict parameter combinations yielding observations in regimes of interest, i.e. moderate spike counts. We compared two neural density estimators: one using handcrafted summary statistics and one using a summary network trained in combination with the neural density estimator. The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics. The posteriors showed signs of bias and miscalibration but were still able to yield posterior predictive samples that were close to the target observations on which the posteriors were constrained. Our results validate amortized simulation-based inference as a tool for parameterizing analog neuron circuits.

                arXiv:2601.07348v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.

                <p>by Abhisha Thayambath, Julio M. Belmonte</p>

Planar cell polarity (PCP) is an important patterning mechanism in both vertebrates and invertebrates by which cells coherently polarize along the apical surface of the epithelium. This patterning mechanism acts upstream of many developmental processes, such as oriented growth, division, cell movements and orientation of body hairs. While various models have been proposed to explain PCP patterning, all rely on persistent global cues/gradients to obtain global orientation of large tissues. However, recent experimental work has shown that this process can happen independently of such global cues, challenging the current paradigm. In this work, we developed a new model for PCP using the Cellular Potts modelling framework to investigate the conditions under which global tissue orientation can be achieved without a tissue spanning morphogen. We found that a combination of a local boundary signal, a small initial tissue size and uniform proliferation can effectively establish long-range polarity without the need for global cues. We also investigated the impact of cell division planes and growth rates on final patterning. Finally, we compared the cell-autonomous and cell non-autonomous versions of our PCP model, as found in flies and mice, and found that the latter offers more robust patterning outcomes in the absence of gradients.

Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators.
Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.

                <p>by David Angulo-Garcia, Alessandro Torcini</p>

Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external input currents in order to sustain finite firing rates, thus raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of strong external driving. Using accurate numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a densely connected recurrent network made up of <i>N</i> rate-neuron models encompassing STD. Depending on the synaptic strength <i>J</i><sub>0</sub>, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small <i>J</i><sub>0</sub>, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large <i>J</i><sub>0</sub> <i>Rate Chaos</i> emerges. For finite networks, we observe a <i>transition region</i> at intermediate <i>J</i><sub>0</sub>, where the system passes from the homogeneous fixed point to Rate Chaos following several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. Furthermore, we show that the width of the transition region shrinks for increasing <i>N</i> and eventually vanishes in the thermodynamic limit (N→∞). The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime has been performed by means of Dynamical Mean Field (DMF) approaches. This analysis has revealed on one side that the novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side that balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the correlations in the synaptic input currents induced by the dense connectivity. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic strong external currents. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.

Synapses are the connections that transform neurons from simple electrically charged cells into complex circuits that support perception, cognition and action. Recent advances in single-punctum synapse mapping in mice make studying synapse diversity and differential expression possible. How do diverse synapses relate to the spatial patterning of whole-brain dynamics? Here we map the spatial distribution of multiple synapse types to >6 000 time-series features from fMRI recordings in awake mice to understand the comprehensive dynamical phenotype of multiple synapse types. We find that specific synapse types are associated with specific features of haemodynamics, including high-amplitude events and signal stationarity. These variations in synapse types and dynamics are associated with the structural and functional network embedding of brain regions. Finally, using two additional fMRI datasets in anaesthetized mice, we show that synaptic protein lifetime reflects differential synaptic engagement across behavioural states. Collectively, this work suggests that the spatial organization of microscale synapse types may shape whole-brain dynamics.

Little is known about how sex and diet interact at the level of chromatin organization. A comprehensive analysis of diet-induced chromatin dynamics can reveal how the liver mounts a rapid adaptive response to environmental cues and uncover mechanisms underlying sex differences. Here, we employed an integrative strategy to construct a nucleosome accessibility atlas of the mouse liver under different dietary conditions. Stringent analysis revealed a largely preserved hepatic chromatin landscape across feeding states, with sex being the critical factor driving changes in chromatin accessibility. Notably, lipid-rich diet preferentially enriched CCAAT-binding motifs in females, while nutrient-sensing nuclear receptor motifs were more strongly enriched in males. Furthermore, using the Four Core Genotypes model (XX ovaries / XY testes / XX testes / XY ovaries), we disentangled the effects of gonadal and chromosomal sex on diet-induced gene regulation. By leveraging this framework with multiple mouse models and molecular approaches, we identified a suppressive role of testosterone in regulating the sex-dimorphic GWAS gene <i>PNPLA3</i>. Overall, we establish an unbiased transcriptomic resource that revealed chromatin dynamics and identified gene clusters associated with distinct sex-related factors.

Systematic identification of global epileptic reorganization and critical seizure-controlling circuits is essential for comprehending epilepsy pathophysiology and for developing network-guided targeted therapies. The piriform cortex (PC) is a recognized epileptogenic region, but how its hyperactivity reshapes whole-brain dynamics and which specific circuits mediate seizures remains unclear. Through multimodal integration of optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, neural tracing, and circuit-specific manipulation, we mapped the whole-brain dynamics following optogenetic stimulation of PC and identified the fundamental circuit governing piriform seizures. We observed pronounced generalized seizures in mice via repeated optogenetic stimulation of PC <i>Vglut1</i>+ neurons. Optogenetic kindling of PC<sup>Vglut1</sup> induced widespread blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal hyperactivation and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) alterations, notably sustained hyperactivation in the lateral entorhinal cortex (Lent) and enhanced PC-Lent rsFC. Chronic elimination of Lent neurons receiving PC projections significantly decreased the Lent-dentate gyrus (DG) rsFC. Disruption of the PC-Lent or Lent-DG circuit effectively suppressed PC-stimulation-triggered seizures and brain-wide hyperactivation. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of the PC<sup>Vglut1</sup>-Lent<sup>glut</sup>-DG circuit in mediating piriform seizures and driving their resulting brain-wide functional reorganization, offering new insights for targeted epilepsy treatments.

                <p>by Pil Jung Kang, Hana Mazak, Sung Sik Lee, Hay-Oak Park</p>

Cdc42, a small GTPase essential for cell polarity, often becomes hyperactive with age and promotes senescence in yeast and animal cells. Yet, the mechanisms driving its age-related upregulation remain unclear. Here, we show that in budding yeast, Cdc42 accumulates over successive cell divisions and that reducing its levels extends life span. Using microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging and genetic analysis, we found that Cdc42 is distributed unevenly between mother and daughter cells during division. Daughter cells inherit lower Cdc42 levels, which likely help them remain young. This asymmetric distribution depends on Cdc42’s association with and/or release from endomembranes and likely involves Ydj1, a farnesylated Hsp40/DnaJ chaperone anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum. Ydj1 interacts with Cdc42, promoting its stability and proper partitioning during cell division. We propose that ER-bound Ydj1 facilitates the asymmetric distribution of Cdc42, thereby restricting aging to mother cells.

                Background Research has shown consistent excess all-cause mortality since the COVID-19 pandemic, but without a clear explanation. In parallel, research has shown side effects from COVID-19 vaccination and increased deaths. Therefore, one cannot rule out COVID-19 vaccination as an explanation for the excess mortality. Methods US county-level data were used to model 2022 and 2023 all-cause excess mortality as dependent variables and per capita COVID-19 vaccine uptake at the end of 2021 and 2022 as independent variables. I included lagged dependent variables as controls. The data include over 3,000 US counties. Results A one-unit increase in per-capita vaccination uptake was significantly associated with a .042 (95% CI: .030–.055) increase in 2022 all-cause excess mortality, and significantly associated with a.030 (95% CI: .024–.036) increase in 2023. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine uptake was significantly positively associated with all-cause excess mortality. Given the time asymmetry between vaccine uptake and all-cause excess mortality, the inclusion of lagged dependent variables as controls, and the large number of observations, the study has strong internal validity.

<p>Optogenetic manipulation of Purkinje cells in zebrafish revealed that their inhibition increases seizure-like activity and reduces locomotion, whereas activation transiently enhances movement and suppresses seizures under hyperexcitable conditions. These findings identify cerebellar Purkinje cells as key modulators of both motor coordination and epileptic network dynamics.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Purkinje cells (PCs), the principal output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are classically implicated in motor coordination via inhibitory projections to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Emerging evidence suggests their influence extends to seizure susceptibility, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the functional role of PCs in locomotion and seizure-like activity in zebrafish larvae. Using the UAS/Gal4 system, we selectively expressed light-sensitive ion channels in PCs: Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to activate, and Anion ChannelRhodopsin-2 (ACR2) to inhibit neuronal activity. Behavioral assays at 5 days post-fertilization assessed locomotor output, while local field potential recordings monitored seizure-like events under baseline conditions and following administration of a proconvulsant agent. Optogenetic activation of PCs transiently increased locomotion and significantly reduced the duration and power of seizure-like events under hyperexcitable conditions, without affecting baseline activity. Conversely, inhibition of PCs was sufficient to induce seizure-like activity even in the absence of convulsant stimuli. These results reveal a dual role for PCs: they suppress pathological hyperexcitability during proconvulsant states, yet their inhibition can trigger seizures. This work highlights the cerebellum as a critical regulator of excitation-inhibition balance, linking motor control and seizure susceptibility, and suggests that cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to both motor and epileptic phenotypes observed in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to improve the field of implementation science by supporting key activities such as evidence synthesis, contextual analysis, and decision-making to promote the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices. This living scoping review aims to: (1) map applications of AI in implementation research and practice; (2) identify evaluation approaches, reported outcomes, and potential risks; and (3) synthesize reported research gaps and opportunities for advancing the use of AI in implementation science. Methods This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Cochrane guidance for living systematic reviews. A living scoping review is warranted to keep up with the rapid changes in AI and its growing use in implementation science. We will include empirical studies, systematic reviews, grey literature, and policy documents that describe or evaluate applications of AI to support implementation science across the steps of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Model. AI methods and models of interest include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, and related technologies and approaches. A search strategy will be applied to bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science), relevant journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data on AI characteristics, specific implementation task according to the KTA Model, evaluation methods, outcome domains, risks, and research gaps. Extracted data will be analyzed descriptively and synthesized narratively using a mapping approach aligned with the KTA Model. Discussion This living review will consolidate the evidence base on how AI is applied across the spectrum of implementation science. It will inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to harness AI to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, while identifying areas for methodological advancement and risk mitigation.

<p>Frailty is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in neurology, influencing disease susceptibility, progression, and outcomes. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of sex and gender in shaping frailty trajectories across major neurological disorders, including stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia, and multiple sclerosis. This systematic review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between frailty and neurological disease, with a focus on sex-specific patterns. Recognizing sex- and gender-related differences in frailty expression is critical to advancing a more personalized and equitable model of neurological care, and reducing disparities in a growing population affected by age-related neurological conditions.

                <p>We report the first human use of intranasal seletracetam (SEL) to prevent reflex seizures. A patient with epilepsy with reading-induced seizures on levetiracetam (3,000 mg/day) continued to experience reading-induced focal seizures with preserved consciousness. Detectable in serum within 2 minutes of intranasal administration, 30 mg seletracetam delayed seizure onset from 1:56 (placebo) to 4:17 minutes post-stimulus onset. A second 30 mg dose fully prevented seizures during 25 minutes of reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spike-frequency declined dose-dependently (3.1/min at placebo to 1.6/min after second dose), with reduced spike-propagation on magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our findings support SEL as a promising non-benzodiazepine acute seizure prevention and provide insight into reflex seizure dynamics. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:535–539</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess whether their combination improves diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively analyzed 293 ALS patients, 85 neurodegenerative disease controls, and 29 healthy controls. A validation cohort of 501 ALS patients was analyzed to confirm reproducibility of the results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for sNfL, cTnT, and their combination, and the area under the curve (AUC) was compared across groups. An ALS-specific cTnT cut-off of 8.35ng/L was determined using the Youden index and applied in subgroup analyses, in which “biomarker-negative” ALS patients were compared to “biomarker-positive” patients regarding disease duration and progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sNfL showed excellent performance in discriminating ALS patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.94), but only moderate performance in discriminating neurodegenerative disease controls (AUC = 0.82). Combining sNfL and cTnT improved diagnostic accuracy for ALS over neurodegenerative controls, with an AUC of 0.90, whereas cTnT alone showed an AUC of 0.77. The validation cohort showed similar AUCs. “Biomarker-negative” ALS patients had a longer disease duration (73.0 vs 18.0 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0003) and a lower progression rate (0.19 vs 0.70 points per months, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than “biomarker-positive” patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although sNfL alone performs well in distinguishing ALS from healthy controls, repurposing cTnT for ALS provides additional value in discriminating ALS from disease controls. The combination of sNfL and cTnT improves diagnostic accuracy and may help identify prognostically distinct ALS subgroups. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:408–417</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>An enduring puzzle in many inherited neurological disorders is the late onset of symptoms despite expression of function-impairing mutant protein early in life. We examined the basis for onset of impairment in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), a canonical late-onset neurodegenerative ataxia which results from a polyglutamine expansion in the voltage gated calcium channel, Cav2.1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed serial transcriptome analysis with weighted gene correlation network analysis to investigate mechanisms for resilience in SCA6 mice that prevent onset of symptoms. We examined changes in membrane excitability that result in cerebellar Purkinje neuron spiking abnormalities through patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje neurons in acute brain slices.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Using unbiased transcriptome analysis, we identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as a driver of disease. Using spatial transcriptome analysis, we identified Purkinje neuron specific changes in unfolded protein response (UPR) related pathways. Novel activation of a store-operated calcium current due to ER stress is the cause for Purkinje neuron spiking abnormalities in SCA6 mice. The impairments in Purkinje neuron spiking are unrelated to Cav2.1 ion-flux function. Redundant pathways of the UPR act through a HSP90-dependent mechanism to mitigate this ER stress.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our studies support a model whereby proteotoxicity from misfolded mutant Cav2.1 is mitigated by a HSP90-dependent UPR, and age-related breakdown of this response causes motor dysfunction and aberrant Purkinje neuron spiking. These studies elucidate a mechanism of resilience connecting aberrant proteostasis and calcium-dependent intrinsic membrane hyperexcitability to explain delayed disease onset more widely in age-dependent neurodegenerative disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The growing demand for personalized treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS) highlights the need for more precise biomarkers that can outperform magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessment in patient stratification. Advances in multiplex proteomic technologies suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis at MS onset may not only improve diagnostic accuracy, but also offer prognostic and staging information, as well as insight into molecular therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study retrospectively analyzed cryopreserved CSF samples from 160 individuals undergoing diagnostic evaluation for possible neuroimmunological disorder, and among these, followed a cohort of 96 people with confirmed MS for at least 3 years. The goal was to externally validate previously published CSF-based diagnostic and prognostic classifiers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Upon unblinding, the CSF-based molecular diagnostic test distinguished 96 people with confirmed MS from 30 individuals with other inflammatory neurological diseases, and 34 individuals with non-inflammatory neurological diseases, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 (<i>p</i> = 4.7 × 10<sup>−21</sup>). The test also differentiated 65 individuals with relapsing–remitting MS from 31 individuals with progressive MS, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (<i>p</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The prognostic classifier predicted prospectively measured Expanded Disability Status Scale scores at follow up (rho = 0.43, <i>p</i> = 2.54 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This multicenter external validation study demonstrates that CSF-based molecular tests can robustly distinguish MS from other neurological conditions, stratify MS subtypes, and predict future disability progression in real-world settings. These results lay the groundwork for development of next-generation molecular tools to personalize care in MS. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:328–340</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel plus aspirin for acute mild stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) stratified by the status of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) or extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ECAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was a subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial. Participants with mild ischemic stroke or TIA were assigned to receive either clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin monotherapy. Participants were categorized into 4 groups by the status of symptomatic ICAS or ECAS: ICAS + ECAS group, only ECAS group, only ICAS group, and no stenosis group. The primary efficacy end point was any new stroke and the primary safety end point was moderate-to-severe bleeding within 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study enrolled 5,664 patients. Compared with other groups, the ICAS + ECAS group had a higher risk of recurrent stroke within 90 days (no stenosis = 5.7%; only ICAS = 7.2%; only ECAS = 10.3%; and ICAS + ECAS = 13.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Although clopidogrel plus aspirin showed a numerically lower recurrence risk versus aspirin alone, no significant treatment effect difference emerged across the 4 groups. No significant interaction between antiplatelet therapy and the status of symptomatic ICAS or ECAS for recurrent stroke and moderate-to-severe bleeding was identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For acute mild ischemic stroke or TIA, although patients with both symptomatic ICAS and ECAS exhibited an elevated risk of recurrent stroke than other patients, no interaction effect between antiplatelet therapy and the status of symptomatic ICAS or ECAS for the risk of new stroke and moderate-to-severe bleeding was observed.

<p>rhNRGβ1-Replacement-Therapy: Under physiological conditions, NRGβ1 is expressed on axons (in orange), where it activates ERBB2 receptors, facilitating successful nerve regeneration following injury. However, loss of NF2 leads to a reduction in NRGβ1-expression and increased ErbB2 levels on Schwann cells (in green), which contributes to schwannoma formation, particularly in conditions like NF2-related schwannomatosis. The replacement of NRGβ1-signaling using recombinant human Neuregulin1-β1 (rhNRGβ1) represents a new strategy for schwannoma treatment. This approach reduces schwannoma growth by promoting Schwann cell differentiation and maturation.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells of the nerve sheath, and their management presents a significant clinical challenge, particularly in genetic conditions like NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN). Although current treatments, including surgery, radiation, and repurposed pharmacological agents, can be effective, they are often limited by issues such as tumor recurrence and the risk of nerve function impairment. This study aims to evaluate the potential of recombinant human Neuregulin1 beta 1 (rhNRGβ1) to inhibit schwannoma growth and promote Schwann cell differentiation in preclinical models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic potential of rhNRGβ1, a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of Neuregulin1 beta 1, as a growth-inhibitory agent for schwannomas. Two distinct mouse models were used to assess its efficacy, with both histological and functional endpoints analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both systemic and local administration of rhNRGβ1 resulted in a significant reduction in schwannoma tumor growth. Mechanistically, rhNRGβ1 not only inhibited tumor proliferation, but also promoted the differentiation of both proliferative and de-differentiated Schwann cells, suggesting a dual action of growth inhibition and cellular maturation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of rhNRG1-β1 in managing schwannomas, not only by reducing tumor growth, but also by promoting the maturation and functional restoration of Schwann cells. This dual effect provides a promising avenue for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing both the growth and cellular differentiation challenges associated with schwannomas in NF2-SWN and other related conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78056?af=R">Primary Lateral Sclerosis Natural History Study: Primary Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale and Other Outcomes Assessment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) consensus diagnostic criteria and functional rating scale (PLSFRS) were recently established to facilitate and optimize future PLS clinical trials. We examined the trajectory of the PLSFRS and other functional outcome measures and biomarkers in the PLS Natural History Study (PLS NHS) to understand their performance in this prospective cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The PLS NHS is a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study of people living with PLS in different diagnostic categories: early (disease duration &lt;2 years); probable (2–4 years); and definite PLS (4–15 years). PLSFRS scores and other functional outcome measures were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Baseline characteristics were compared between the groups. The slopes of the PLSFRS and other functional outcome measures over 12 months were examined in the overall cohort and subgroups using linear mixed-effect models. The associations between baseline characteristics and the rate of PLSFRS decline were analyzed with linear regression models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 76 participants were included: early (n = 6); probable (n = 26); and definite (n = 44) PLS. Baseline PLSFRS total scores were highest in the early PLS group, followed by the probable and definite PLS groups. In the overall cohort, the PLSFRS total score declined by 0.33 points/month (95% confidence interval [0.27–0.39], adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The rate of decline was steepest in the early PLS group, followed by the probable and definite PLS groups. Baseline neurofilament light chain level was associated with the rate of PLSFRS decline over 1 year (<i>p</i> = 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In PLS, the rate of functional decline, as measured by the PLSFRS total score, is faster during the early phase of the disease. Neurofilament light might serve as a prognostic biomarker in PLS. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:418–428</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78064?af=R">Polygenic Vulnerability to Intracranial Hypertension, Hemorrhage Progression, and Outcome in Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Growing evidence underscores the importance of host-response/secondary-injury—likely influenced by genetics—in outcome variability post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial hypertension and hemorrhage progression are critical secondary injuries in severe TBI; these are mediated by the SUR1-TRPM4 channel (a target in clinical trials). We aimed to deconstruct the complex network surrounding SUR1-TRPM4 and define the cumulative impact of key genetic variants on mechanistically connected secondary injuries/outcomes after severe TBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This exploratory study analyzed 492 prospectively enrolled patients with severe TBI. A network of regulators, mediators, and effectors upstream/downstream of SUR1-TRPM4 was bioinformatically constructed. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were evaluated for multivariable model association with intracranial pressure, intraparenchymal hemorrhage progression, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Weighted/unweighted polygenic-risk scores (PRS) were constructed and interrogated. Spatial modeling and functional predictions were determined. Single-cell cortical transcriptomic differences were assessed in a parallel murine TBI model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ninety-seven genes (625 SNVs) were analyzed. Nineteen genes contained variants associated with all outcomes (intracranial pressure, hemorrhage progression, and GOS score; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-two genes (42 SNVs) retained significance for ≥ 1 outcome, with overlap across outcomes. Functions included Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport/signaling, glutamate-clearance, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Single-cell analyses revealed cell-specific gene-expression differences. SNVs were brain-specific cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTLs)/missense/frameshift mutations suggesting high likelihood of biological impact. PRSs were associated with all outcomes with large effects, and markedly improved model explanatory power/performance (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>, receiver operating characteristic [ROC]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Polygenic variability in key nodes linked to SUR1-TRPM4 were associated with mechanistically related secondary injuries and outcome after severe TBI; findings suggest a major role of heritability. Functional implications indicate biological plausibility and identify novel targets. The data, whereas requiring validation, support a shift toward incorporating biologically relevant genetics in advancing precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:459–477</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78075?af=R">Association between Human Leukocyte Antigen Alleles and Neuropathological Outcomes in Lewy Body Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Lewy body disease (LBD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in the brain. Neuroinflammation has long been implicated in LBD pathogenesis, and recent genetic studies in Parkinson's disease (a clinical manifestation of LBD) have shown consistent association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene complex. Here, we assessed whether variation in HLA alleles influences neuropathological burden in a neuropathologically-defined series of LBD cases.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis of HLA allelic variants in a cohort of 539 LBD cases of European descent from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. High-resolution whole-genome sequencing was used, and the HLA alleles of each sample were called using the HLA*LA tool and assessed for association with neuropathological outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis identified 1 significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 3.43 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) and 4 suggestive (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) associations between certain HLA alleles and specific neuropathological outcomes in LBD, suggesting a potential role for HLA-mediated immune mechanisms in disease progression and subtype differentiation. Specifically, <i>HLA-DPB1*06:01</i> was significantly associated with lower Lewy body counts in the parahippocampal gyrus (<i>P</i> = 3.30 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), with weaker and suggestive associations observed in the middle frontal (<i>P</i> = 1.80 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) and inferior parietal gyrus (<i>P</i> = 6.33 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Additionally, although only suggestive, <i>HLA-DRB1*11:01</i> correlated with a lower Thal amyloid phase (<i>P</i> = 1.56 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), and <i>HLA-B*15:01</i> correlated with an increased risk of diffuse LBD (<i>P</i> = 7.58 x 10<sup>−4</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides a detailed evaluation of the relationship between HLA alleles and LBD pathology, highlighting the importance of immune-related genetic factors in the etiology of LBD. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:492–501</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78077?af=R">Sensorimotor Cortex High Frequency Oscillations Characterize Motor Symptom Severity during Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery for Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implant in the subthalamic nucleus and its associated “microlesion” effect impacts oscillatory activity in the hand area of motor cortex.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined cortical local field potentials in 31 patients before and after subthalamic nucleus lead implant at rest and during repetitive voluntary and passive contralateral upper limb movements. We computed continuous wavelet transforms of the signals and correlated (1) baseline spectral power and motor symptom severity and (2) changes in spectral power and contralateral motor symptoms related to microlesion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline motor symptom severity correlated with high-frequency broadband power in primary motor cortex during voluntary movements (200–300Hz: Pearson's r = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.15, 0.75]; and 300–500Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.038, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.70]). Motor improvements from lead implant correlated with decreases in high gamma power in primary sensory cortex during voluntary movements (70–200Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.035, 95% CI: [−0.07, 0.62]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>How motor parkinsonism alters electrophysiology in cerebral cortex is unclear. Our findings suggest that both the severity of parkinsonism and its improvement from the microlesion effect are associated most closely with changes in high-frequency oscillatory activity in primary sensorimotor cortex. Better understanding the cortical dynamics of movement disorders could guide novel paradigms for adaptive DBS. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:480–491</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78078?af=R">Incidence and Prevalence of Congenital Myopathies ‐ A Population‐Based Study From Western Sweden</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Congenital myopathies are a group of rare genetic muscle disorders. Previous studies have estimated point prevalences which only include surviving individuals. Our aim was to perform an epidemiological study with strict inclusion criteria, using modern diagnostic technology to present both incidences and prevalences, and to describe the genetic and muscle pathological characteristics of these disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective, population-based epidemiological study was conducted in western Sweden between 1985 and 2022. All patients diagnosed with congenital myopathies during this period were included.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 104 patients were identified whereas 25 died during the follow-up. The total birth prevalence (estimated lifetime risk) was 14.9 per 100,000 live births, whereas the total cumulative incidence by age 35 years was 12.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, and the total point prevalence was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. The most common histopathological type was congenital myopathy with nonspecific changes (birth prevalence 4.1 per 100,000 live births), followed by core myopathy and centronuclear myopathy (2.1 per 100,000). The most common causative genes were <i>MYH2</i> (3.9 per 100,000) and <i>RYR1</i> (2.0 per 100,000). Despite using next-generation sequencing, 1 in 5 cases lacked a genetic diagnosis. Among those without a genetic cause, 4 of 5 had nonspecific histopathological changes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>By including all patients identified, both alive and deceased, our estimated incidence figures are considerably higher than estimates of point prevalence, which only includes living patients. As the mortality in these diseases is significant, incidence figures better reflect the occurrence in the population and are important for evidence-based health care planning and resource allocation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spin refers to reporting strategies that highlight the benefits of an experimental treatment or divert attention from nonsignificant primary outcomes. To assess spin in randomized clinic trials (RCTs) on pharmaceutical efficacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) and explore associated factors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A systematic literature search was conducted in MedLine (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane using database-specific thesauri (“Multiple Sclerosis” and “Drug Therapy”) to identify relevant studies. We included multiple sclerosis phase 3 and 4 randomized controlled trials with parallel, superiority designs that were published between 2013 and 2024 reporting nonsignificant primary outcomes. Spin was assessed in title, abstract conclusion, results, discussion, and conclusions. A descriptive analysis was followed by exploratory bivariate logistic regression. Independent variables included trial phase, sample size, drug type, comparison, follow-up time, registration, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) mention, risk of bias (RoB2), journal quartile, first author affiliation, and conflict of interest.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty articles met inclusion criteria. Spin appeared in at least one section in 25 articles (62.5%) and in 3 or more in 19 articles (47.5%). The most frequent locations were abstract conclusions, discussion, and conclusions. Spin was significantly associated with smaller sample size (odds ratio [OR] = 7.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–37.91, <i>p</i> = 0.024), non-Q1 journals (OR = 4.38, 95% CI = 1.03–18.63, <i>p</i> = 0.046), and first author affiliation outside Europe or the United States (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 1.15–22.62, <i>p</i> = 0.032).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Spin is common in MS randomized controlled trials with nonsignificant primary outcomes and may mislead clinical decisions. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:316–327</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To establish a framework for validating candidate biomarkers of cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) associated with cognitive impairment and characterize individuals enrolled by the MarkVCID2 consortium under this framework.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants age 60 to 90 years were enrolled across 17 MarkVCID2 sites. Recruitment was targeted to enrich in cognitive symptoms (mild dementia, mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive decline), defined risk factors (diabetes mellitus, advanced hypertension), and Black/African American, White, and Hispanic/Latino subgroups. Enrolled participants underwent baseline visits that included cognitive testing, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biofluid collection. Provisional risk for SVD-related cognitive decline was estimated primarily by baseline cognitive symptoms plus SVD risk factors. Adjudicated risk status was estimated by cognitive symptoms plus presence of moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, or lacunes on baseline MRI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MarkVCID2 enrolled 1883 individuals age 73.4 ± 7.5 years, 65.0% female, 24.2% Hispanic, and 27.1% non-Hispanic Black. Among enrollees, 44.8% were provisionally designated high-risk. After baseline MRI, 48.5% were categorized as adjudicated high-risk status, with substantial recategorization both from low- to high-risk (primarily because of MRI lesions without SVD risk factors) and high- to low-risk (primarily suspected cognitive impairment at screening not confirmed by baseline testing).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MarkVCID2 baseline data indicate successful enrollment of diverse individuals enriched in factors associated with SVD-related cognitive decline. Changes over 3 years of longitudinal follow-up will be analyzed to validate the candidate biomarkers for 2 projected contexts of use: subject selection (identifying likelihood of future SVD progression) and study outcome (efficiently measuring SVD progression).

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) onset risk factors include Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) indices (including host response), lower serum 25-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, low sun exposure, and <i>HLA-DRB1*1501</i>. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we examined mediation through differential DNA methylation (DNAm) to better understand possible epigenetic programming.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two case-control studies (Ausimmune Study, Australia = 206 cases + 348 controls; and Epidemiologic Investigations of MS [EIMS], Sweden = 140 cases + 139 controls). DNAm was measured using Illumina arrays. Dimension-reduction methods generated MS-associated DNAm modules. Pathway enrichment analyses were used to describe DNAm modules’ system-level biological characteristics. Individual and joint associations with MS risk were assessed using logistic regression. DNAm module mediation of risk factor-outcome associations were assessed using mediation analysis. A range of temporality analyses were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EBV indices (infectious mononucleosis history and anti-EBNA IgG titer), lower 25(OH)D, low sun exposure, and <i>HLA-DRB1*1501</i> risk variant were individually and jointly associated with MS risk. In each study, 2 DNAm modules were found which mediated multiple exposure-MS associations. Proportions mediated ranged from 21 to 47% in Ausimmune and 25 to 53% in EIMS. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Top-ranked genomewide association study (GWAS) MS risk-associated genes were over-represented in both Ausimmune DNAm modules, A1 3.5-fold (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and A2 3-fold (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Reactome pathways enriched for DNAm had cross-study overlap – 45% of pathways enriched in Ausimmune DNAm modules were also enriched in EIMS (4.82-fold, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EBV, lower vitamin D, low sun exposure, and <i>HLA-DRB1*1501</i> risk variant act in concert and through common epigenetic pathways to impact MS onset risk. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:341–355</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To review the microneurography findings of long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) patients who presented to the clinic with multisystem involvement affecting neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, pulmonary, and immunological domains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 36 consecutive long COVID patients using microneurography. We evaluated abnormalities in C nociceptors, including spontaneous activity, peripheral sensitization, multiple spikes, conduction failure, and alterations in activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity. Sympathetic nerve fiber function was assessed using the recovery cycle of excitability. Results were compared with a large normative database.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean age was 40.9 ± 9.2 years (range 17–60 years), with a female predominance (30/36, 83.3%). Patients were seen from 15 to 61 months after onset of symptoms (35.7 ± 11.3 months). All patients presented with neuropathic symptoms, mainly pain and orthostatic intolerance. A total of 32 patients (88.9%) had objective electrophysiological abnormalities in peripheral C fibers, including spontaneous nociceptor activity (61.1%), peripheral sensitization (27.8%), and multiple spikes (11.1%). Long COVID patients also showed a significant shift in C nociceptor populations, with a higher prevalence of type 1B mechano-insensitive C nociceptors compared with healthy controls. Changes in activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity differed in opposite directions between mechano-sensitive and mechano-insensitive C nociceptors. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers also showed abnormal recovery cycles with a lack of supernormality, suggesting impaired neuronal homeostasis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides novel electrophysiological evidence linking small nerve fiber dysfunction to long COVID. These findings align with previous histological evidence of small nerve fiber loss, reinforcing the hypothesis that peripheral nerve dysfunction contributes to the multisystem symptoms of long COVID.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Biomarkers with clear contexts of use are important tools for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapy development. Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. Slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05), with 25 showing &gt;40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, whereas ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (eg, PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11) or decrease (eg, ANTXR2, ART3, and MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11, and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. Moreover, tissue-specific signature enrichment suggests a significant contribution of muscle as a source of these biomarkers. Plasma KCNIP3 was elevated by ~60% in those on riluzole. Immunoassays provided orthogonal validation of plasma TNNT2 and CSF GPNMB.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified an array of novel biomarkers with the potential to serve as response biomarkers to aid therapy development, as well as to shed light on the underlying biology of disease. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:393–407</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to test if blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, detected using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging, would predict progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) over the subsequent year in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study included patients with a history of stroke and at least early confluence of WMH. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed at baseline (&gt; 3 months from stroke) and again 1 year later were segmented to calculate the WMH volume expressed as a fraction of the total brain volume. Change in WMH volume between the 2 timepoints and progression of WMH were the outcome measures. BBB disruption was measured using DSC imaging on the baseline MRI. WMH masks were dilated by 3 mm to create a mask of the adjacent normal appearing white matter (penumbra). BBB disruption was averaged within the WMH and the penumbra.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifty patients were included; median age was 69 years, and 46% were women. The mean WMH fraction was 1.25% at baseline and 1.36% at 1 year. The mean baseline BBB disruption was 0.20% in the WMH and 0.22% in the penumbra. More severe BBB disruption was associated with greater WMH progression when measured in the WMH (<i>ß</i> = 0.95, confidence interval [CI] = 0.39–1.51, <i>r</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and in the penumbra (<i>ß</i> = 0.81, CI = 0.10–1.53, <i>r</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.027). The best predictor of progression was BBB disruption in the penumbra with an odds ratio (OR) of 2 (OR = 2, CI = 1.01–3.96, <i>p</i> = 0.046) for each 0.1% increase in BBB disruption.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>More severe BBB disruption was predictive of greater WMH progression in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:437–448</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate timing of occurrence of peri-ictal MRI abnormalities – a potential risk biomarker of status epilepticus-related cerebral injury (t2).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective study enrolled adult patients with status epilepticus and acute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); patients with peri-ictal MRI abnormalities underwent follow-up MRI 4 weeks later. Predictive model, using logistic regression, integrated clinical factors (duration, semiology, and etiology of status epilepticus and the patients’ level of consciousness) to prognosticate occurrence of peri-ictal MRI abnormalities. Cerebral injury due to status epilepticus was assessed by comparative volumetric analysis of acute and follow-up MRIs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 256 patients, 137 (53%) had peri-ictal MRI abnormalities. The likelihood of their occurrence increased over time under the influence of semiology and etiology of status epilepticus as well as the patients’ level of consciousness: it was highest in non-convulsive status epilepticus caused by acute primary or secondary etiologies at 10 minutes after onset in patients with stupor/coma (81–85%); it increased at 24 hours to 92%; and at 48 hours to 95%. Conversely, in alert/somnolent patients with prominent motor symptoms and acute triggering factors associated with epilepsy, the possibility of developing peri-ictal MRI abnormalities at 24 hours was 4 to 5% and at 48 hours it was 6 to 11%. In 28 of 45 (62%) of follow-up MRIs, structural long-term consequences of status epilepticus were observed in the form of either cortical and hippocampal atrophy or global cerebral volume loss.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this novel multimodal approach based on MRI data, the patients’ level of consciousness, etiology, and duration of status epilepticus offers insights into the risk of possible brain injury in status epilepticus. ANN NEUROL 2026;99:523–534</p>

<p>Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and punicalagin (PU) alleviate Alzheimer's disease–like pathology in adult zebrafish by reducing Aβ aggregation, neuroinflammation, and amyloidogenic signaling while promoting neuronal recovery and neurogenesis. These molecular and cellular effects translate into improved anxiety- and aggression-like behaviors, supporting EGCG + PU as a potential neuroprotective therapeutic approach.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioral alterations. The pathogenesis of AD involves the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and the hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, which disrupt neuronal function and trigger neuroinflammation. This study explores the therapeutic potential of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and punicalagin (PU) in mitigating Aβ-induced toxicity using an adult zebrafish model of AD. Our results demonstrate that the EGCG + PU combination significantly reduces Aβ accumulation, protects against cellular damage, suppresses acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and normalizes the expression of amyloidogenic and AD-related genes. Additionally, EGCG + PU treatment alleviates neuroinflammation by suppressing glial activation, including reductions in L-plastin and proinflammatory cytokine expression, while promoting neuronal recovery through mechanisms of neurogenesis and neuroprotection. Notably, the combination treatment restored neuronal density and improved behavioral outcomes by alleviating anxiety- and aggression-like behaviors associated with Aβ toxicity. These results underscore the synergistic neuroprotective effects of EGCG + PU, highlighting their potential as a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating the pathological, behavioral, and inflammatory aspects of AD.</p>

                Background In the context of accelerating digital transformation, the alignment between digital transformation initiatives and sustainable supply chain finance has become an important issue for firms seeking to improve operational coordination and financial efficiency. This alignment, however, is influenced not only by technological adoption but also by organizational and contextual conditions such as governance structures, strategic orientation, and resource availability. Existing studies have not sufficiently examined how these contextual factors jointly shape the integration of digital transformation and supply chain finance. Methods This study adopts a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis based on survey data with qualitative insights. A multidimensional analytical framework is developed to examine the contextual factors affecting the integration between digital transformation and sustainable supply chain finance. The framework includes leadership vision, strategic orientation, information-sharing mechanisms, supplier collaboration, organizational resources, process readiness, and access to financial and credit resources. Results The findings indicate that these contextual factors collectively influence the degree of alignment between digital transformation initiatives and sustainable supply chain financial models. Leadership vision and clear strategic orientation play a central role in guiding coordination among supply chain actors. Effective information-sharing mechanisms support collaboration and transparency across partners. In addition, organizational resources and process readiness significantly affect the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing digital solutions linked to supply chain finance. Access to financial and credit resources also conditions firms’ ability to operationalize such initiatives. Conclusion The study provides empirical evidence on how organizational and contextual conditions shape the integration of digital transformation with sustainable supply chain finance. The results suggest that alignment depends on a combination of strategic direction, internal capabilities, and coordination mechanisms, offering useful implications for firms seeking to design digital transformation initiatives that are consistent with their organizational capacities and operational contexts.

                Background The detection of malware in network traffic remains a critical cybersecurity challenge. Traditional signature-based intrusion detection demonstrates a high level of familiarity with issues that have been recorded in the database; but show significantly lower effectiveness when it comes to polymorphic or zero-day attacks. Conversely, anomaly-based approaches are also endowed with the ability to detect new incursions, but often have a high false-positive rate. Methods This study proposes a combined malware-detection framework which makes use of RNA encoding network-flow attributes alongside Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers. The framework has three functionalities: a Signature-CNN, which is trained on RNA-encoded representation of known malicious flows; an Anomaly-CNN, which is developed to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic without any signature prior knowledge; and a Hybrid-CNN, which combines both paradigms in a two-stage detection pipeline. Results Experiments conducted on the Malicious Network Dataset show that the Signature-CNN achieves 91% accuracy with strong precision on known threats, the Anomaly-CNN achieves 93% detection rate on unknown malware, and the Hybrid-CNN achieves the best overall performance with 95% detection rate and 94.5% F1 score. Conclusions The results demonstrate that RNA encoding combined with CNN classifiers offers a robust and scalable solution for malware detection in networked environments.

                Background School attendance monitoring is an essential component of educational management in public schools, especially at secondary schools. In Peruvian rural regions such as Imperial-Cañete, attendance is registered manually, generating inefficiencies, human error, and lack of immediate traceability. This situation is amplified by digital divide: only 18.5% of rural houses have stable internet access, limiting the implementation platforms that depend on constant connectivity. Methods The study was realized using agile methodology (Scrum) with five phases to develop a web-based attendance system. Phase one involved analyzing requirements for the attendance system based on needs of school employees and parents. Phase two involved prioritizing requirements and defining tasks with deadlines. Implementation used modern web technologies (Next.js, Node.js, WebSockets) and hybrid data architecture (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Google Drive) to ensure efficient and reliable operation. Finally, after completing previous phases, developed software was implemented and additional testing to ensure correct functionality. Results After implementation of the web platform, we identified significant improvements: complete automation of attendance registration using QR codes, which drastically reduced registration times and errors associated with manual methods; successful implementation of real-time parental monitoring, allowing parents access to their children’s daily and monthly attendance registers; integration of automatic email notifications to tutors and administrators in cases of consecutive absences or tardiness; and differentiated role-based access for school employees (assistants, teachers, and directors). The use of information technology ensured operational consistency even under poor connectivity conditions through local caching (IndexedDB) and synchronization. Conclusions This research focuses specifically on optimizing attendance management in rural secondary schools using information technology. The study is characterized by its personalized web platform designed to support the specific needs of educational institutions with limited connections. The results demonstrated the efficiency of this robust approach and its positive impact on school attendance management.

                Goode et al. show that prodynorphin (Pdyn)-expressing neurons of the dorsolateral septum (DLS) receive substantial dorsal hippocampal (DHPC) input and inhibit lateral hypothalamic (LHA) GABAergic neurons. DLS(Pdyn) activity is changed by training for food, is context-sensitive, and its disruption by optogenetics (or Pdyn deletion) in DHPC-DLS(Pdyn)-LHA circuits impairs conditioned feeding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106342">BICC1 interacts with PKD1 and PKD2 to drive cystogenesis in ADPKD</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is primarily of adult-onset and caused by pathogenic variants in <i>PKD1</i> or <i>PKD2</i>. Yet, disease expression is highly variable and includes very early-onset PKD presentations in utero or infancy. In animal models, the RNA-binding molecule Bicc1 has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PKD. To study the interaction between BICC1, PKD1, and PKD2, we combined biochemical approaches, knockout studies in mice and <i>Xenopus,</i> genetic engineered human kidney cells carrying <i>BICC1</i> variants, as well as genetic studies in a large ADPKD cohort. We first demonstrated that BICC1 physically binds to the proteins Polycystin-1 and -2 encoded by <i>PKD1</i> and <i>PKD2</i> via distinct protein domains. Furthermore, PKD was aggravated in loss-of-function studies in <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse models, resulting in more severe disease when <i>Bicc1</i> was depleted in conjunction with <i>Pkd1 or Pkd2</i>. Finally, in a large human patient cohort, we identified a sibling pair with a homozygous <i>BICC1</i> variant and patients with very early onset PKD (VEO-PKD) that exhibited compound heterozygosity of <i>BICC1</i> in conjunction with <i>PKD1 and PKD2</i> variants. Genome editing demonstrated that these <i>BICC1</i> variants were hypomorphic in nature and impacted disease-relevant signaling pathways. These findings support the hypothesis that BICC1 cooperates functionally with PKD1 and PKD2, and that <i>BICC1</i> variants may aggravate PKD severity, highlighting RNA metabolism as an important new concept for disease modification in ADPKD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106503">Ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I is subject to premature termination of transcription</a></h4>

              
                The RNA polymerase I (Pol I) enzyme that synthesizes large rRNA precursors exhibits a high rate of pauses during elongation, indicative of a discontinuous process. We show here that premature termination of transcription (PTT) by Pol I in yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is a critical regulatory step limiting rRNA production in vivo. The Pol I mutant, SuperPol (RPA135-F301S), produces 1.5-fold more rRNA than the wild type (WT). Combined CRAC and rRNA analysis link increased rRNA production in SuperPol to reduced PTT, resulting in shifting polymerase distribution toward the 3’ end of rDNA genes. In vitro, SuperPol shows reduced nascent transcript cleavage, associated with more efficient transcript elongation after pauses, to the detriment of transcriptional fidelity. Notably, SuperPol is resistant to BMH-21, a drug impairing Pol I elongation and inducing proteasome-mediated degradation of Pol I subunits. Compared to WT, SuperPol maintains subunit stability and sustains high transcription levels upon BMH-21 treatment. These comparative results show that PTT is alleviated in SuperPol while it is stimulated by BMH-21 in WT Pol I.

">Validating Neurite EXchange Imaging (NEXI) using diffusion Monte Carlo simulations in realistic numerical gray matter substrates</a></h4>

              
                NEXI is a gray matter (GM) microstructural model designed to probe brain tissue microstructure in vivo using diffusion MRI. NEXI describes GM as two exchanging Gaussian compartments - neurites, modeled as randomly oriented, infinitely long sticks, and the extracellular space - allowing the estimation of biophysically interpretable parameters related to neurite microstructure and intercompartmental exchange. While modeling cell processes as sticks and each compartment as Gaussian are common assumptions for brain biophysical models of diffusion, neurite structural irregularities and the presence of somas, particularly in GM, may violate them and bias NEXI parameter estimates. Furthermore, the barrier-limited exchange assumed in the Karger model that underlies NEXI may also be violated in realistic conditions. Therefore, in this work, we evaluate NEXI's accuracy in numerical substrates that incorporate realistic GM features and membrane permeability. To this end, we generated several GM-like substrates with neurite beading, undulation, orientation dispersion, and somas across a range of membrane permeabilities. Diffusion signals were generated with Monte Carlo simulations of water diffusion and subsequently fitted with NEXI. Overall, NEXI accurately recovered exchange times across permeability levels and successfully disentangled exchange effects from other microstructural features, showing only minor bias in estimates from the realistic geometries. These results support its potential for in vivo GM microstructure mapping and studies of brain disorders.

">Invisible flashes bias spatial coding in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                Information integration is widely considered fundamental for human consciousness. Combining spatial ventriloquism and dynamic continuous flash suppression, this psychophysics-EEG study investigated how invisible flashes influence spatial perception of sounds. We show that invisible flashes, even when mislocalized by observers, bias observers' perceived sound location. EEG multivariate pattern analyses unravelled that the locations of invisible flashes are encoded in early (150-250ms) neural activity. Crucially, even though this visuospatial information rapidly dissipates for invisible mislocalized flashes, being no longer decodable from neural activity after 300 ms, it progressively biases neural encoding of sound location (300-600ms), thereby ultimately inducing a perceptual ventriloquist illusion. Our results demonstrate that subjective awareness is not a prerequisite for integrating information across the senses. Spatial information that dissipates from the visual system and evades awareness biases neural encoding and perception of sound location. These results pose challenges for leading theories of consciousness as a unified all-or-none phenomenon.

">What and where manifolds emerge and align with perception in deep neural network models of sound localization</a></h4>

              
                Whether the auditory cortex has parallel pathways for sound identification ("what") and localization ("where"), and whether it contains a map of auditory space, is debated. Here, we examined the low-dimensional structure (manifold) of "what" and "where" representations in deep neural network models of sound localization. Unexpectedly, models trained for "where" learned untangled "what" manifolds, including voice type, reverberation, and spectral detail. The distribution of "what" manifolds was not random, but geometrically organized by spectral similarity. The separability and distance of both "what" and "where" manifolds were aligned with human behavior. "What" also determined whether "where" manifolds organized into a map: maps emerged when "what" contained localization cues that were topographically organized. However, forming a spatial map reduced localization accuracy in both models and human listeners. Together, object manifolds reveal learned task-irrelevant attributes of object that are ignored when measuring task performance alone, and task-optimized neural networks can provide insights into brain and behavior, not just replicate them.

">Repressed mTORC1 signaling and transient dendritic pruning support axonal regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Dendrite degeneration is an early pathological feature following axonal damage, yet its role during successful axonal regeneration remains poorly understood. Using sparse labeling of retinal ganglion cells in adult zebrafish, we show that axonal regeneration is accompanied by a transient phase of dendritic pruning following optic nerve crush. Dendritic pruning occurs during axon elongation and is reversed after brain reinnervation. Although insulin-mTOR signaling is rapidly upregulated immediately after injury, it is subsequently suppressed, coinciding with dendritic pruning and sustained axonal growth. Prolonging mTOR activation through insulin treatment or direct pathway stimulation reduces dendritic pruning in an mTORC1-dependent manner but severely delays axonal regrowth. Together, these findings identify dendritic remodeling as a key temporally regulated component of successful axonal regeneration and reveal a functional trade-off between dendritic preservation and axon regrowth. This balance may represent a critical constraint for promoting CNS repair in mammals.

">Brief, repeated isoflurane anaesthesia elicits sex-dependent behavioural, cerebrovascular, and microglial alterations in mice</a></h4>

              
                General anaesthetics are indispensable tools in biomedical research, yet growing evidence shows that their effects on brain function extend beyond the transient loss of consciousness for which they are used. Although numerous preclinical studies have examined the impact of a single anaesthetic exposure, far less is known about the cumulative consequences of repeated administration protocols, despite their widespread use in longitudinal imaging, behavioural testing, and disease model studies. Here, we show that brief, repeated isoflurane exposures induce alterations in behaviour, cerebrovascular patterns, and microglial phenotype in adult CD1 mice, with several responses exhibiting pronounced sex specificity. Repeated anaesthesia suppressed locomotor activity selectively in females and impaired ethologically important maintenance behaviours, including nesting and burrowing, in both sexes. These behavioural effects were accompanied by sex-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow dynamics, with females displaying elevated cerebrovascular flow, yet males showing higher reactivity to isoflurane exposure. At the molecular level, repeated isoflurane exposure altered endothelial marker expression without modifying capillary density and shifted microglia toward a hyporeactive state. Together, these data reveal that even short, routine anaesthetic events produce biologically meaningful and sex-dependent effects on neural, vascular, and immune systems. These results indicate that the anaesthetic regimen is an often overlooked but influential factor that deserves careful consideration in pre-clinical neuroscience.

">Functional characterization of the lateral septal calbindin neurons in maternal care</a></h4>

              
                The ventral subdivision of the lateral septum (LSv) is a forebrain region linked to maternal care with a high density of calbindin-containing (Cb+) neurons whose properties, connections and functions remain unknown. In the present study, it was established that the majority of pup-activated neurons are inhibitory Cb+ in the LSv and the density of activated neurons in the LSv is close to that of the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a central brain area in maternal care regulation. Electrophysiological recordings of LSvCb+ and LSvCb- neurons revealed that LSvCb+ neurons exhibited higher membrane resistance, lower spike amplitude and rise slope compared to LSvCb- neurons. The chemogenetic inhibition of LSvCb+ neurons led to reduction in pup-licking behavior without affecting other maternal behavior or eliciting anxiety- or depression-like behavior. To regulate licking behavior, LSvCb+ neurons connect with other maternally involved brain areas. Anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing revealed that two-thirds of the MPOA-projecting LSv neurons are Cb+. A subset of neurons within the posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIL) in the lateral thalamus, a proposed relay nucleus of tactile and auditory information from the pups, express a maternally induced neuropeptide, the parathyroid hormone 2 (PTH2). Their fibers closely apposed Cb+ neurons in the LSv. Using double labeling, we also identified PTH2 receptors on LSvCb+ neurons, which are presumably activated by PTH2 released from nearby terminals. Using electron microscopy, we confirmed synaptic connection between PTH2+ fibers and inhibitory neurons in the LSv. The results provide evidence that Cb+ neurons of the LSv are components of the maternal circuitry.

">A cortical basis for perception of internal gut sensations</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the sensing of internal bodily signals, is essential for brain-body interactions and shapes emotion, cognition, and behavior1-5. Subconscious internal signals, including heartbeats or stomach fullness, can rise to conscious awareness, and this process can improve with practice, as seen in meditation, mindful eating, or toilet training in early infancy. Conversely, disrupted interoception is emerging as a common deficit in diverse psychiatric disorders1,3,6,7. Nevertheless, we still lack a fundamental understanding of the neurobiological basis of perception and conscious reporting of internal sensations. Here, we combine genetic and ultra-sensitive optogenetic tools in mice to establish a quantitative framework for studying internal perception. We developed a behavioral task in which mice report detecting non-invasive optogenetic activation of gut mechanosensory neurons, establishing 'interoceptive psychophysics'. We combine this approach with cellular-resolution imaging and manipulations to reveal the neuronal basis for perception of these internal gut sensations in the interoceptive insular cortex. While representations of sensory stimuli were consistently observed in insular cortex across different tasks, we found that perceptual reports were only encoded during a more difficult psychophysics task, but not during basic detection. Accordingly, manipulation of insular cortex activity affected behavioral reports only in the psychophysics task. These findings reveal a neural basis for perception of internal gut sensations and provide a blueprint for future quantitative exploration of other interoceptive modalities.

">The effect of EEG lead configuration on early TMS-EEG artifacts</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has strong potential for recording cortical reactivity and connectivity. However, this promise is hampered by TMS-induced EEG artifacts. Here, we examine the origins of these artifacts with phantom TMS-EEG recordings and simulations. We focus on two major types of artifacts: (1) the TMS pulse artifact during each ~0.2 ms TMS pulse and (2) the decay artifact that may last tens of milliseconds. We examine how these artifacts change as a function of the relative position between TMS coil windings and EEG electrode leads. We also examine the hypothesis that certain EEG lead configurations may reduce or even cancel out these artifacts. In experimental results across 23 different TMS coil / EEG lead configurations, the amplitudes between the TMS pulse artifact and the decay artifact were highly correlated (Spearman {rho} = 0.86, p < 0.001), suggesting that the decay artifact is caused by the TMS pulse artifact. As predicted, in certain EEG lead configurations, both the TMS pulse and decay artifacts were minimized. The simulations confirmed that the TMS pulse artifacts depended on the electromagnetic induction from the TMS coil windings to the EEG leads. These results illuminate the generator mechanisms of--and possible means to reduce--both artifacts.

">Hierarchy in neuronal representations of multiple tasks in prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to perform multiple tasks is one of the fundamental hallmarks of general intelligence in the brain. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. We trained macaque monkeys to perform four tasks with identical spatial layouts but different cognitive demands, and recorded activities of thousands of prefrontal neurons using two-photon calcium imaging. Within the same neuronal population, we identified a multitask neural geometry composed of multiple lowdimensional subtask spaces, each encoding spatial information within a specific subtask. These subtask spaces shared a ring-like representational structure, forming a generalized spatial code across different subtasks. Task separation arose from separable bases and offsets of subtask spaces, modulated primarily by meta-task features. Thus, the neural geometry is organized by a three-level hierarchical structure: location codes are nested within subtask spaces, which are grouped as different meta-tasks. This hierarchy supported generalization across both locations and tasks, and explained monkeys' error behaviors. Together, the hierarchically organized neural geometry underlies flexible multitask behavior.

">The variability of reflex amplitude estimates in motor unit pools depends on the phenotype distribution and discharge statistics</a></h4>

              
                Motor unit (MU) activity during electrically or mechanically evoked reflexes is used to examine the relationship between neural inputs and MU properties. However, variations in single-MU reflex amplitudes are not fully understood and limit their reliability in determining the input-output relation of motor neurons (MNs). Using experiments and computer simulations, we investigated (i) whether MN discharge statistics and muscle activation explain the variability of reflex amplitude estimates and (ii) whether these variations are reflected differently across distinct reflex amplitude estimation methods. We analyzed MU spike trains extracted from isometric contractions of the tibialis anterior muscle at 10% and 20% MVC (maximum voluntary contraction). Estimating reflex amplitudes based on the peristimulus frequencygram (PSF) at 10% MVC, the linear regression between discharge rate (DR) and reflex amplitude was always positive, with p < 0.05 in 3 out of 6 subjects; however, the linear correlation was inconsistent at 20% MVC. We thereby observed that inter-subject variability was associated with the coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals. Furthermore, the linear correlation between DR and peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) based reflex amplitudes was inconsistent for both contraction forces. To obtain further insights into the influence of MN properties, we simulated reflexes in a heterogeneous MN population using electrical circuit models and varied MN inputs. The simulations indicate that, besides mean input current and membrane noise, MN properties also contribute to the variability of reflex amplitude estimates. The MN heterogeneity is well captured by PSF-based reflex estimates but not by PSTH-based ones. These results show that variations in amplitude estimates of individual MU reflexes are due to complex interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. As PSF-based reflex amplitude estimates reflect the MN size distribution, tracking PSF-based reflex amplitudes at fixed MVC levels across individual subjects could serve as a marker for investigating spinal adaptations under (patho)physiological conditions.

">Characterizing the SASP-Dependent Paracrine Spreading of Senescence Between Human Brain Cell Types</a></h4>

              
                One of the defining phenotypes of a senescent cell is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can propagate senescence in neighboring cells both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this paracrine spreading of senescence can act in a cell non-autonomous manner, influencing neighboring cell populations and contributing to immune cell recruitment. As cellular senescence has recently been linked to both age-related neurodegenerative phenotypes and local inflammation and is more clearly defined across brain cell types in a cell-type-dependent manner, an urgent question remains regarding how a cell-type-specific paracrine spreading of senescence occurs in the brain. Here, we set out to profile the cell-type-specific features of the SASP and characterize the directionality of paracrine senescence-spreading between major brain cell types. Through this analysis, we identified key SASP ligand-receptor pairs involved in this paracrine dissemination. Targeting these factors with specific inhibitors, we prevented the paracrine spreading of senescence in a brain cell-type-dependent manner. Taken together, we identified specific SASP targets for therapeutic intervention in the context of human brain cells and thereby informed the SASP-dependent reaction of immune cells and age-related tissue dysfunction across both normal aging and models of neurodegenerative disease.

">Sex differences in neural circuits driving binge drinking: A female-specific role for an amygdalo-striatal pathway</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rates of binge drinking have converged significantly between the sexes over recent decades, driven by increased rates of alcohol misuse in women. However, understanding of fundamental circuitry and neurobiology driving alcohol use in females, or how this may differ from male subjects remains underexplored. Methods: We quantified c-Fos expression across 40 brain regions in alcohol naive, alcohol anticipating and binge drinking male and female mice. In vivo fiber photometry examined sex differences in basolateral amygdala (BLA) activity changes to alcohol intake. Chemogenetic BLA inhibition investigated a functional role in binge drinking. We then assessed sex differences in BLA efferent projection activation following binge drinking. Finally, we functionally interrogated the BLA to nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) projection in binge drinking. Results: Binge drinking reduced network modularity (number of communities with similar activation patterns) in both sexes relative to alcohol naive and anticipating same-sex counterparts. Female binge drinking mice had increased BLA c-Fos expression compared to female naive and male binge drinking counterparts. In vivo fiber photometry revealed greater and more prolonged BLA responsivity at the onset of alcohol intake in females. Global BLA inhibition reduced reward intake in both sexes. However, the BLA to AcbC projection was preferentially activated in female binge drinking mice, and inhibition of this pathway reduced binge alcohol intake exclusively in females. Conclusions: We identified sex differences in the neural circuits engaged in binge drinking, highlighting the BLA to AcbC projection may in part underpin sex differences in alcohol misuse. This provides further evidence of distinct neurobiological drivers of alcohol-related behaviors between the sexes.

">Shared somatosensory-motor neural population dynamics track motor recovery after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Although somatosensation is known to be important for precise hand control, how coordinated activity across sensory and motor cortical areas supports hand movements and object interactions is unclear. We simultaneously recorded neural activity from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and Area 2 of the primary somatosensory cortex in three rhesus macaques performing a reach-to-grasp task during recovery from a primary motor cortex (M1) lesion. Using dual-area latent factor analysis, we decomposed population activity into cross-area factors (CFs) shared between PMd and Area 2 and within-area factors (WFs) local to each region. Shared CFs tracked hand kinematics closely despite explaining less overall variance. Strikingly, the emergence of long-timescale, stereotyped sensory-motor cross-area dynamics was correlated with recovery of prehension and object grasping, whereas changes in within-area dynamics were not correlated with recovery. These findings suggest that restoration of coordinated sensory-motor population dynamics is important for recovery of skilled hand function after injury.

">Prefrontal-medullary circuitry is necessary for sex-specific responses to metabolic stress in rats</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress increases risk for metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus. Additionally, projections from the infralimbic cortex (IL) to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate endocrine stress responses. However, the neurobiological basis for chronic stress effects on glucose homeostasis has not been identified. The current study tests the hypothesis that the IL-RVLM circuit is necessary to prevent glucose intolerance. Accordingly, male and female rats with Cre-dependent expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC) to inhibit neurotransmitter release from RVLM-projecting IL neurons were subject to chronic variable stress (CVS) or remained as No CVS controls. Animals were then acutely challenged with a fasted intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT). Endocrine metabolic function was evaluated during GTT via time courses of glucose, insulin, glucagon, and corticosterone. In No CVS females expressing TeLC, inhibition of IL-RVLM circuit signaling impaired glucose tolerance characterized by elevated glucose and decreased insulin sensitivity. Following chronic stress, females had impaired glucoregulation characterized by decreased glucose clearance and elevated corticosterone. When combined with TeLC, chronically-stressed females showed shifts in the ratio of insulin to glucagon compared to CVS GFP females, suggesting circuit function impacts the pancreatic mechanisms mediating glucose homeostasis during chronic stress. In No CVS males, TeLC increased glucagon only. However, CVS TeLC males had impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin sensitivity, and decreased corticosterone. These data indicate that the IL-RVLM circuit mediates glucoregulation in a manner dependent on both sex and stress history. Collectively, the IL-RVLM circuit is necessary for the sex-specific maintenance of glucose homeostasis following chronic stress.

">PRECISE TBI Model Catalog: Increasing Accessibility and Reproducibility in TBI research</a></h4>

              
                Preclinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) research relies on experimental models that vary by mechanism, parameters, surgical procedures, species, strains, and ages, to name a few. While these models are crucial for understanding injury mechanisms and testing therapies, the progress in translating this knowledge to the clinic has been limited. This is in part due to fragmented resources and inconsistent reporting of critical variables. Here, we introduce the PRECISE-TBI model catalog, a centralized, queryable resource that consolidates metadata from published studies. The catalog integrates curated annotations from more than 450 papers, including details such as age, sex, strain, model type, device, and injury parameters. Where available, entries are also linked to protocols and datasets to enhance transparency and reproducibility. The Model Catalog serves as a living resource that enables cross-study comparison, identifies gaps in reporting, and connects the literature to datasets, protocols, device information, and other relevant resources. Analysis of the initial catalog entries revealed gaps in the reporting of device, age, and weight. In contrast, the reporting of sex improved over time, with over 90% of recent studies within the catalog papers reporting sex. Strain was also reported in most studies, with consistent reporting of specificity, especially for the C57 mice substrain. We expect the Model Catalog to serve as a valuable tool to enhance study design and reproducibility in preclinical TBI research while advancing FAIR data principles in the TBI field.

">Mutant ATXN1 impacts human and mouse microglia and contributes to cognitive, mood, and motor deficits in SCA1 mice</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, resident immune cells of the brain, are important players in neurodegeneration. While microglial activation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, the specific role of microglia intrinsic factors in microglial activation and disease pathogenesis remains unknown. Spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1) is an inherited autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe neuronal loss and early microglial activation in the cerebellum. SCA1 is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ubiquitously expressed ATAXIN1 (ATXN1) gene. Using human microglia differentiated from SCA1 patient derived iPSCs, we found that mutant ATXN1 is sufficient to alter morphology, gene and protein expression in human microglia in a cell-autonomous manner. Moreover, compared to controls, human SCA1 microglia exhibited increased phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, indicating an immune priming. To determine the extent to which mutant ATXN1 in microglia contributes to SCA1 pathogenesis and behavioral symptoms, we removed mutant ATXN1 from microglia and macrophages in a novel conditional SCA1 mouse model, f-ATXN1146Q/2Q mice. Microglial mutant ATXN1 reduction led to a marked correction in microglia phenotype, in particular in the transcriptomic signature of interferon type 1 mediated immune response, reduced microglial density and resulted in smaller microglia with reduced branching in the cerebellum. Pathology of Purkinje neurons and cerebellar astrogliosis were also ameliorated. Utilizing a battery of behavioral tests, we found that microglia and macrophage mutant ATXN1 reduction ameliorated cognitive, mood, and motor deficits in SCA1 mice. Together, these results indicate that mutant ATXN1 directly impacts microglial phenotype in SCA1, contributing to SCA1 pathology and behavioral deficits.

">Reproducible and predictable reorganization of place fields driven by grid subfield rate changes</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain constructs stable yet flexible maps of space remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Place cells in the hippocampus fire at specific locations in a given environment, but reorganize completely upon introduction to another environment in a process called remapping. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) provides a major cortical input to the hippocampus, and the spatially periodic firing patterns of its grid cells are thought to contribute to place field formation. We previously showed that chemogenetic depolarization of MEC layer II stellate cells selectively altered firing rates within individual grid cell subfields, impaired spatial memory, and induced a form of reversible place cell remapping that we called artificial remapping. However, it remains unclear whether artificial remapping reflects a reproducible and stable mapping from entorhinal inputs to place cell outputs or a random reorganization of place fields. To explore the transfer of information between MEC and hippocampus, we repeated this chemogenetic manipulation on consecutive days and found that stimulating the same stellate cells produced similar changes in both grid subfield rates and place field locations. Using both experimental and simulated data, we show that baseline place cell activity patterns could be used to predict place field locations following the manipulation. These findings provide direct evidence for consistent input-output relationships in the entorhinal-hippocampal system and point to a central role for grid subfield rate changes in the reorganization of hippocampal spatial representations.

">AAV-only targeting of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons for optical self-stimulation studies in mice</a></h4>

              
                Studies employing optogenetic approaches in rodent models have highlighted the important contribution of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons to reward, learning, and motivation. Selective manipulation of VTA DA neurons is generally achieved in these studies using transgenic mouse or rat lines that express Cre recombinase under the control of a promoter active in DA neurons, combined with intra-VTA infusion of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors harboring Cre recombinase-dependent expression cassettes. Reliance on transgenic Cre driver lines is expensive and decreases study efficiency, and available driver lines have unique limitations. Here, we report the development of an AAV-only approach that permits genetic access to VTA DA neurons and can support optogenetic self-stimulation in mice. We used a 2.5 kb fragment of the mouse tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (mTH) to drive Cre expression in VTA DA neurons. Intra-VTA co-infusion of AAV8-mTH-Cre with an AAV vector harboring a Cre-dependent yellow fluorescent protein expression cassette yielded high efficiency (82%) and high fidelity (73%) targeting of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive VTA neurons in C57BL/6J mice. Co-infusion of AAV8-mTH-Cre with a vector harboring a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin (ChR2) expression cassette permitted optical regulation of VTA neurons with electrophysiological features consistent with VTA DA neurons. Moreover, C57BL/6J mice expressing ChR2 in VTA DA neurons rapidly acquired optical self-stimulation behavior. Thus, this AAV-only approach should facilitate investigation of VTA DA neuron contributions to reward-related behaviors and permit comparative assessments in reward circuit function in inbred and mutant mouse strains.

">Cellular Aging Signatures in the Plasma Proteome Record Human Health and Disease</a></h4>

              
                Aging is asynchronous across cells and organs, but whether plasma proteins can capture cell type-specific aging and predict disease and mortality remains unknown. We developed machine learning models to estimate the biological age of more than 40 distinct cell types spanning neuronal, immune, glial, endocrine, epithelial, and musculoskeletal origins using over 7,000 plasma proteins measured in 60,000 individuals across three cohorts, comprising the largest human plasma proteomics aging study to date. Individuals showed heterogeneous aging profiles, with 20-25% exhibiting accelerated aging in a single cell type and 1-3% across ten or more cell types. APOE genotype showed antagonistic aging effects in different cell types: APOE4 carriers exhibited older astrocytes but younger macrophages, while APOE2 carriers showed the inverse. Cellular aging signatures were uniquely associated with disease status and predicted incident disease and mortality over 15 years of follow-up. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showed the strongest association with skeletal myocyte aging (hazard ratio = 12.7 for extreme accelerated versus youthful aging). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), prevalent cases showed accelerated aging across multiple neural and peripheral cell types, with extreme astrocyte aging conferring AD risk comparable to APOE4 carrier status. Moreover, extreme astrocyte aging increased AD risk in APOE4/4 carriers threefold, while youthful astrocytes strikingly reduced risk. Beyond neurodegeneration, respiratory cell aging identified smokers at 58% higher lung cancer risk, and myeloid aging identified normoglycemic individuals at higher diabetes risk. Both specific cellular vulnerabilities and cumulative aging burden influenced survival, wherein youthful immune or neuronal profiles were protective. A polycellular aging risk score provided robust mortality risk stratification across platforms and cohorts. These findings establish a framework for quantifying biological aging at the cellular resolution using plasma proteomics, revealing heterogeneity in aging trajectories and their impact on disease susceptibility and resilience.

">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation enhances long-term retention after 5 days of lower-limb motor skill learning</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) holds the potential to affect behavior by modulating ongoing neural activity, and tDCS paired with hand motor practice can enhance motor learning. While augmenting the behavioral benefits of motor practice is relevant for neurorehabilitation following central and peripheral lesions to the motor system, as well as in sports, the short- and long-term effects of tDCS targeting the mesial motor cortex (M1-Leg) during lower-limb motor skill practice remain unexplored. We tested whether five days of anodal tDCS over M1-Leg during training of a sequential visuomotor tracking task improves within- and between-session learning and one-week retention. Participants were randomized to skill practice with active tDCS, skill practice with sham stimulation, or volume-matched non-skilled ankle movements with sham stimulation. Changes in corticospinal excitability accompanying skill and nonskill motor practice with real and sham tDCS, were assessed as motor evoked potential amplitudes recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle at rest. Compared to non-skill practice, motor skill practice yielded robust sequence-specific performance gains, which were transferred to the untrained leg and persisted for at least one week after practice ended. Concurrent tDCS did not increase learning within or between training sessions, but it did lead to improved one-week retention compared to sham stimulation. Corticospinal excitability did not increase after practice and was unaffected by tDCS. These findings suggest that combining lower-limb motor skill practice with tDCS over M1-Leg can strengthen retention of skill learning without measurable changes in resting corticospinal excitability. This is relevant for motor practice scheduling in neurorehabilitation.

">LLM-Evolved Regularization Schedules Prevent Posterior Collapse in Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems</a></h4>

              
                Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS) is a powerful variational autoencoder for inferring neural population dynamics from spike train data. However, LFADS suffers from posterior collapse, where the learned posterior collapses to the prior, eliminating meaningful latent representations. Current solutions require computationally expensive Population-Based Training (PBT) to dynamically tune regularization hyperparameters. Here, we demonstrate that Large Language Model (LLM)-based program evolution can discover regularization schedules that prevent posterior collapse without PBT. Using FunSearch, an evolutionary algorithm that uses LLMs to generate and refine Python functions, we evolved adaptive regularization schedules that respond to training dynamics. Our best evolved schedule prevents posterior collapse across all tested conditions, maintaining KL divergence 6.5x higher than baseline schedules at 50 epochs (n=10 seeds each, p < 0.001) and stable above 0.09 through 500 epochs across three Neural Latents Benchmark datasets, while preserving reconstruction quality. This work represents the first application of LLM-based program synthesis to variational autoencoder hyperparameter scheduling, offering a computationally efficient alternative to population-based optimization.

                <p>Cognitive flexibility, a mental process crucial for adaptive behavior, involves multiscale functioning across several neuronal organization levels. While its neural underpinnings have been studied for decades, limited knowledge exists about the structure and age-related differentiation of the white matter (WM) subserving brain regions implicated in cognitive flexibility. This study investigated the population-level relationship between cognitive flexibility and WM properties across two periods of human adulthood, aiming to discern how these associations vary over different life stages and brain tracts among men and women. We propose a novel framework to study age effects in brain structure&ndash;function associations. First, a meta-analysis was conducted to identify neural regions associated with cognitive flexibility. Next, projections of these neural regions were traced through the Human Connectome Project tractography template to identify the subserving WM associated with cognitive flexibility. Then, a cohort analysis was performed to characterize myelin-related macromolecular features using a subset of the UK Biobank magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which has a companion functional/behavioral dataset. We found that (1) the wiring of cognitive flexibility is defined by a subset of brain tracts, which present undifferentiated features early in adulthood and significantly differentiated types in later life. (2) These MRI-derived properties are correlated with individual subprocesses of cognition closely related to cognitive flexibility. (3) In late life, homogeneity of specific WM tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility declines with age, a phenomenon not observed in early life. Our findings support the age-related differentiation of WM implicated in cognitive flexibility as a natural substrate of adaptive cognitive function.</p>

                <p>Natural environments contain behaviorally relevant information along many stimulus dimensions, each of which sensory systems must encode in order to guide behaviors. For example, the mammalian visual cortex encodes features of visual scenes such as spatial information related to object identity and temporal information about the motion of those objects in space. In order to reliably encode these behaviorally relevant visual features, neural representations should be robust to changes in environmental conditions. Further, information about changes in environmental conditions, such as the luminance changes that occur over the course of a day, is also important for guiding behaviors. In this study, we asked whether mouse primary visual cortex (V1) jointly represents the spatial properties of visual stimuli along with changes in the mean luminance of the visual scene. We find that while V1 neurons, in mice of either sex, encode spatial aspects of visual information in an invariant manner across luminance conditions, the V1 population response also contains a robust representation of luminance. Importantly, V1 populations encode changes in stimulus orientation and mean luminance along orthogonal axes in the neural response space, such that a change in one stimulus variable is encoded independently from the other.</p>

                <p>Neurexins (Nrxns) are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules essential for synapse development and function. Of the many neurexin isoforms, only &beta;-Nrxns contain the histidine-rich domain (HRD). While the HRD has been implicated in several pathological contexts, its normal physiological role remains unclear. To address this, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 method to generate a new mouse line expressing in-frame truncated Nrxn1&beta; lacking the HRD. We found that HRD deletion did not affect mouse viability, gross brain development, or general behavior of either sex. However, loss of the HRD significantly altered neuroligin-1-dependent excitatory, but not inhibitory, presynaptic differentiation in primary cultured neurons. Moreover, this deletion affected presynaptic short-term plasticity, but not basal synaptic transmission, at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-&gt;CA1 synapses. These findings identify the Nrxn1&beta; HRD as a potential contributor to excitatory presynaptic organization and function, providing new insight into the molecular diversity and specialization of Nrxns.</p>

                <p>Social cognition, central to emotional and cognitive well-being, is particularly vulnerable to aging, where impairments can lead to isolation and functional decline. Despite compelling evidence that altered social behavior is associated with cognitive decline and dementia risk, experimental strategies for testing causative links remain scarce. To address this gap, we aimed to establish a rat model for research on social neurocognitive aging. We conducted a large-scale behavioral study in 169 male young (6&nbsp;months) and aged (24&ndash;25&nbsp;months) Long&ndash;Evans rats. In order to explore potential relationships among aging outcomes, we first documented individual differences in a widely validated water maze test of hippocampal learning and memory. Sociability and social novelty were then evaluated in the same subjects using the three-chamber social interaction test. Aging induced a selective shift in social novelty preference, marked by a striking familiarity bias in a substantial subpopulation of old rats, while sociability remained entirely normal. Changes in social novelty preference were completely independent of individual differences in spatial memory and unrelated to anxiety or sensorimotor function. Notably, neuromodulation via TMS enhanced social novelty preference selectively in aged rats that exhibited a social introversion phenotype before treatment, consistent with the possibility that this aging condition reflects a distinct and modifiable neural network state. Together, the results establish a valuable preclinical framework for developing a comprehensive neurobiology of social cognition in aging.</p>

                Background Rapid advances in general-purpose artificial intelligence are compressing automation timelines: around 40–50% of tasks in advanced economies are technically automatable, and a quarter of total hours could be migrated to machines before 2030. Fears of large-scale displacement from artificial-intelligence (AI) adoption have prompted calls for either mass reskilling or unconditional cash transfers. Another option, the emergence of a “supervisory economy” in which humans specialise in overseeing AI systems, remains empirically under-examined. Methods Using a balanced panel of 12 economies observed annually from 2014 to 2023, we construct a sector-weighted AI-exposure index and match it to labour-force data on unemployment, supervisory employment, public transfers, R&D, and GDP per capita. Two-way fixed-effects regressions are estimated, first linearly and then with a quadratic AI term to capture non-linearity in technology shocks. Robustness checks include lagged covariates, alternative normalisations and clustered standard errors. Results The preferred quadratic specification reveals an inverted-U relationship between aggregate AI exposure and unemployment: joblessness rises at low-to-moderate exposure but falls once adoption surpasses approximately 1.7 standard deviations above the mean. Supervisory depth—measured as the share of senior- and middle-management roles—has no significant standalone effect and does not significantly moderate AI’s impact. Higher real income consistently dampens unemployment, while public transfers and contemporaneous R&D outlays show limited short-run cushioning. Conclusions National labour markets appear to follow a concave AI trajectory: modest automation initially displaces routine labour, but at high penetration, complementary demand offsets job losses. However, simply expanding managerial layers is insufficient to buffer early shocks; effective resilience likely hinges on coupling oversight capacity with targeted technical upskilling and productivity-enhancing growth. Policy mixes that rely primarily on cash transfers or untargeted innovation spending risk delaying, rather than mitigating, employment re-equilibration in the age of AI.

                Background Multicultural education plays a crucial role in the era of globalization; however, the influence of gender and certification status on teachers’ online multicultural teaching competency (OMTC) remain underexplored. This study aims to analyze the impact of gender and certification status on teachers’ OMTC, focusing on skills, knowledge, and overall multicultural competence. Method A mixed method approach (explanatory sequential design) was employed, involving 106 elementary school teachers from West Java Province, Indonesia (M±SD age = 37.44±9.17; teaching experience = 10.17±9.18), including 41 males (38.68%) and 65 females (61.32%), selected through a simple random sampling. Quantitative data were collected using the Multicultural Teaching Competency Scale (MTCS), and qualitative data were gathered through structured interviews. The quantitative were analyzed using an independent samples-test, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The quantitative results indicate that gender had no significant effect on OMTC. However, certification status significantly influenced multicultural teaching skills, though it not affect multicultural teaching knowledge or the overall OMTC score. The qualitative findings identified key thematic factors contributing to these differences, including conceptual understanding, lesson planning, integration of minority cultures, empathy and reflection, and community collaboration. Certified teachers were found to be more proficient in designing inclusive learning experience and fostering empathy. However, conceptual understanding remained varied, and community collaboration was limited. Conclusions The study concludes that certification is more effective in enhancing technical competencies, rather than conceptual or affective aspects. These finding suggest that teacher training should adopt a transformative, reflective, and contextually grounded approach to comprehensively enhance teachers’ OMTC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-237/v1?src=rss">The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviours in children and young people: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective The COVID-19 pandemic brought global disruption, increased mortality, and concern about mental health impacts. Although children and young people (CYP) generally experienced less severe physical symptoms, public health measures such as school closures and restricted social interactions likely had adverse effects. Concerns were raised that risks of suicide and self-harm could increase during and after the pandemic. This review examined the extent to which these concerns were reflected in published evidence. Design A systematic search of databases was conducted for quantitative observational studies reporting suicide deaths, self-harm (including non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts), or suicidal ideation in individuals aged 24 years and under. Studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2022 were included. Quality was assessed using National Institutes of Health tools. Due to methodological heterogeneity, findings were synthesised narratively. Results Eighty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 23 reported on suicide, 53 on self-harm, and 27 on suicidal ideation. Two were not peer-reviewed; all were observational. Most were conducted in healthcare settings and presented pre- and post-pandemic data. Half were rated low quality. Suicide data, largely from high-income countries, showed little or no overall change, though some studies reported increases among males. Moderate- or high-quality studies of self-harm indicated increases, especially from late 2020 into 2021/2022, and more pronounced among females. Increases in suicidal ideation were also reported, mainly in cohort or healthcare-based studies, though most were low quality. Conclusions The pandemic appeared to have minimal immediate impact on suicide rates in CYP. There was limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries, ethnic minorities, low-income households, and marginalised groups. Evidence of increased self-harm, particularly among females, highlights the need for age- and gender-specific policies, care pathways, and prevention strategies that are adaptable during future public health crises and ensure timely access to effective support.

                Background The present study is concerned with the challenges facing international trade in the agricultural sector, which are related to diversification, competitiveness and sustainability. In this regard, it is imperative for agricultural export companies dealing in lima beans to develop effective export strategies in order to strengthen their commercial performance. This research aims to determine the extent of the effectiveness of export strategies in export companies in the agricultural sector, based on a bibliometric analysis of scientific literature. Methods The PRISMA 2020 methodology was applied, processing 8,578 records from Scopus, Dimensions and Web of Science, using Bibliometrix (RStudio) and VOSviewer tools for the analysis and visualisation of thematic networks, of which 44 articles between 1976 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria. The final corpus included 44 articles published between 1976 and 2024. Results The results identify four thematic blocks: (i) product and market diversification strategy, (ii) associativity strategy, (iii) quality and sustainability strategy, and (iv) international marketing strategy, where scientific production is concentrated in China, the United Kingdom and the United States, with little participation from Latin America. Conclusions As demonstrated by the study, the integration of export strategies is a pivotal factor contributing to the enhancement of companies’ commercial performance in international markets. This phenomenon has been shown to consolidate and balance the sustainability and competitiveness of agro-export chains in the agricultural sector.

                Introduction Indonesia is located along the “Thalassemia Belt,” a hotspot region for hemoglobinopathies, including beta thalassemia, with approximately 3–10% of the Indonesian population diagnosed with this disease. Thalassemia was diagnosed using the Hb analysis results. However, the single nucleotide variant (SNVs) database for the Indonesian population, which leads to β-thalassemia disease, has not been extensively studied. This study aimed to profile the genetic variations in Indonesian β-thalassemia patients and conduct in silico characterization of their functional effects. Methods Twenty thalassemia patients were recruited for this study. The sample collected from the respondents was whole blood in EDTA tubes, with a minimum collection time of 14 days after blood transfusion. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a commercial kit, directly amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with specific primers for β-globin and sequenced using Sanger Sequencing. All variants located in exon regions were analyzed using FinchTV, BioEdit, and Biovia Discovery Studio to determine their functional impact. Results Ten reported pathogenic variants were observed along with one rare variant. Genetic variations found according to its common name and nomenclature based on Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) are IVS1nt.1 (HGVS: c.92+1G>A), IVS1nt.1 (HGVS: c.92+1G>T), IVS1nt.2 (HGVS: c.92+2G>T), IVS1nt.5 (HGVS: c.92+5G>C), IVS2nt.654 (HGVS: c.316-197C>T), Cd15 (HGVS: c.47G>A), Cd26 (HGVS: c.79G>A), Cd30 (HGVS: c.92G>C), Cd41/42 (c.126_129delCTTT), and Cd35 (HGVS: c.110delC). Analysis of amino acid interactions revealed that disease-causing mutations were clinically relevant in each subject. Conclusions This study has bioinformatically proven the effect of genetic mutations and predicted their effect on amino acid interactions. These findings contribute to the study of Indonesian thalassemia and require further research.

                <p>by Chenfei Zhang, Edmund T. Rolls, Jianfeng Feng</p>

How transform-invariant visual representations of objects and faces are learned in the ventral visual cortical pathway is a massive computational problem. Here we describe key advances towards a biologically plausible four-layer network that performs these computations from the primary visual cortex to the inferior temporal visual cortex. The architecture is a four-layer competitive network with layer-to-layer convergence using a short-term memory trace local synaptic learning rule to associate transforming inputs from an object during natural viewing. The key advances towards biological plausibility include: (1) a synaptic modification rule including long-term depression dependent on synaptic strength instead of artificial synaptic weight normalization; (2) limiting the strength of synapses promotes distributed weights, improving transform-invariant learning; (3) reducing the ability of low firing rate neurons to participate in learning analogous to the NMDA receptor non-linearity can increase the storage capacity; (4) demonstrated network scalability towards high capacity. These advances have many implications for better understanding of cortical computations. These advances in biological plausibility of this approach are compared with artificial networks of the same ventral cortical processing stream that do not use a local synaptic learning rule and are less biologically plausible, and implications for AI models are described.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides unprecedented insights into gene expression patterns while retaining spatial context, making it a valuable tool for understanding complex tissue architectures, such as those found in cancers. Seurat, by far the most popular tool for analyzing ST data, uses the Wilcoxon rank-sum test by default for differential expression analysis. However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GEE-based tests with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and <i>z</i>-test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GEE test with robust standard error, referred to as the Independent GEE, demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed poor calibration of the p-values and potential false positive findings from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Our comparative study based on simulations and real data applications suggests that the Independent GEE test is well-suited for ST data, offering more accurate identification of biologically relevant gene expression changes and complementing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We have implemented the proposed method in R package “SpatialGEE”, available on GitHub.

                <p>by Mahboubeh Ahmadipour, Federico Fattorini, Nicolò Meneghetti, Alberto Mazzoni</p>

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), the beta band (12–30 Hz) component of basal ganglia activity is pathologically high. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment to suppress symptoms of PD and is known to suppress pathological beta activity. However, the mechanism underlying this effect is not completely understood. Here, we tested the circuital effects of DBS in a computational model of the basal ganglia network in dopamine-depleted condition mimicking PD. Our model reproduces suppression of beta pathological oscillations in the basal ganglia network induced by subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. Crucially, this occurs for realistic levels of DBS intensity only if we incorporate short-term plasticity in projections from STN, increasing the DBS intensity required for suppression of pathological beta oscillations. STN stimulation hampers beta oscillations in the subthalamo-pallidal beta loop. This induces a progressive dephasing between this loop and the striato-pallidal beta loop, which leads in turn to a network-wide suppression of beta oscillations. This is also reflected in a restoration of the balance between D1 and D2 firing rates, which was altered by dopamine depletion. Moreover, the model also reproduces the DBS-induced gamma activity associated with symptom recovery. Finally, we explored the circuital effects of a broad range of DBS parameters in suppressing beta oscillations, focusing on the clinically relevant range of 60–150 Hz stimulation. The model suggests that 60–80 Hz stimulation frequencies might achieve beta desynchronization for an intensity even lower than the one needed at the standard 130 Hz frequency. Overall, our model lays the ground for in-silico tests of a broad spectrum of stimulation patterns.

Recent developments in DNA synthesis and sequencing allowed the construction of comprehensive gene variant libraries and their functional analysis. Achieving high-replication and thorough mutation characterization remains technically and financially challenging for long genes. Here, we developed an efficient, affordable, and scalable library construction approach that relies on low-cost DNA synthesis and standard cloning technologies, which will increase accessibility to mutational studies and help advance the field of protein science. Each degenerate codon variant is physically associated with multiple DNA barcodes during synthesis, which overcomes the need for long-read sequencing for linking variants to barcodes. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by constructing a complete library for <i>PDR1</i>, a 3.2 kb multidrug resistance gene encoding a pleiotropic transcription factor in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We demonstrate a near-perfect correspondence in the measurement of amino acid variants impact when assessed by barcode sequencing and direct sequencing of the mutated coding sequence.

                Background Although digital workplaces are increasingly being adopted across academic institutions, many universities still perceive them merely as technological tools rather than as integrated socio-organizational systems that foster productive organizational energy. This study addresses this gap by examining the effect of digital workplace dimensions—digital space, aesthetics, capabilities, and intelligence—on productive organizational energy at the University of Fallujah. Methods Using a descriptive-analytical approach, data from 290 respondents were analyzed using SPSS v.28 and Smart PLS v.4, employing confirmatory factor analysis and multiple regression. Results The overall digital workplace demonstrated a strong positive influence on productive organizational energy (β = 0.892, R2 = 0.75, F = 865.962, P < 0.001). Among these dimensions, digital intelligence exerted the highest impact (β = 0.819, R2 = 0.69), followed by digital capabilities (β = 0.775, R2 = 0.67), digital space (β = 0.651, R2 = 0.59), and digital aesthetics (β = 0.665, R2 = 0.48). These findings confirm that smart technologies and analytics significantly enhance emotional, cognitive, and behavioral energy across staff, thereby improving motivation and efficiency. Conclusions Theoretically, this research extends the digital transformation literature by linking digital workplace constructs to organizational energy, underscoring the necessity of strengthening digital intelligence and employee capabilities to advance institutional performance.
