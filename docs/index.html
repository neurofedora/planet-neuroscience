                Recently, there has been increased interest in the role of the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In order to better understand the pathophysiological role of the cerebellum in ASD, it is necessary to have a variety of mouse models that have face validity for cerebellar disruption in humans. Here, we add to the literature on the cerebellum transgenic and induced mouse models of autism with the characterization of the cerebellum in the BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) inbred mouse strain, which has behavioral phenotypes that are suggestive of ASD in patients. When we examined both male and female adult BTBR mice in comparison to C57BL/6J (C57) controls, we noted that both mice showed motor coordination deficits characteristic of cerebellar function, but only the male mice showed differences in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent learning task that is also disrupted in ASD patients. Both male and female BTBR mice showed considerable expansion of and abnormal foliation in the cerebellum vermis--including significant expansion of specific lobules in the anterior cerebellum. In addition, we found a slight but significant decrease in Purkinje cell density in both male and female BTBR mice, irrespective of lobule. Furthermore, there was a marked reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic spines density in both male and female BTBR mice. These findings suggest that, for the most part, the BTBR mouse model successfully phenocopies many of the characteristics of the subpopulation of ASD patients that have a hypertrophic cerebellum. We discuss the significance of sex differences--revealed for the first time in BTBR mice, and present in only a small number of cerebellum studies--and the importance of concordance on other metrics between male and female BTBR mice.

	<p>Gasdermin D-executing pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3 inflammasomes has been recognized as a key pathogenesis during stroke. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could protect CNS against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced neuroinflammation, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The study applied the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model to investigate how the brain and the retinal injuries were alleviated in sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS)-treated rats. The rats were assigned to four groups and received an intraperitoneal injection of 50 &amp;amp;mu;mol/kg NaHS or NaCl 15 min after surgery. Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurologic severity score. The quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD were determined by ELISA and Western blot. Cortical and retinal neurodegeneration and cell pyroptosis were determined by histopathologic examination. Results showed that NaHS rescued post-stroke neurological deficits and infarct progression, improved retina injury, and attenuated neuroinflammation in the brain cortexes and the retinae. NaHS administration inhibits inflammation by blocking the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway and further suppressing neuronal pyroptosis. This is supported by the fact that it reversed the high-level of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD following I/R. Our findings suggest that compounds with the ability to donate H2S could constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.</p>

     alt="Characterization of the expression of gastrin-releasing peptide and its receptor in the trigeminal and spinal somatosensory systems of Japanese macaque monkeys: Insight into humans"/>
<p>This study shows for the first time that itch mediator gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is expressed in both trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is expressed in both the dorsal horn of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and spinal cord of primates, Japanese macaque monkeys, similar to rodents and Eulipotyphla.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR) have been identified as itch mediators in the spinal and trigeminal somatosensory systems in rodents. In primates, there are few reports of GRP/GRPR expression or function in the spinal sensory system and virtually nothing is known in the trigeminal system. The aim of the present study was to characterize GRP and GRPR in the trigeminal and spinal somatosensory system of Japanese macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>). cDNA encoding <i>GRP</i> was isolated from the macaque dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and exhibited an amino acid sequence that was highly conserved among mammals and especially in primates. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRP was expressed mainly in the small-sized trigeminal ganglion and DRG in adult macaque monkeys. Densely stained GRP-immunoreactive (ir) fibers were observed in superficial layers of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and the spinal cord. In contrast, GRP-ir fibers were rarely observed in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and oral and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. cDNA cloning, in situ hybridization, and Western blot revealed substantial expression of <i>GRPR</i> mRNA and GRPR protein in the macaque spinal dorsal horn and Sp5C. Our Western ligand blot and ligand derivative stain for GRPR revealed that GRP directly bound in the macaque Sp5C and spinal dorsal horn as reported in rodents. Finally, GRP-ir fibers were also detected in the human spinal dorsal horn. The spinal and trigeminal itch neural circuits labeled with GRP and GRPR appear to function also in primates.</p>

<p>In addition to their auditory nerve inputs, we show that T-stellate cells within a given isofrequency lamina provide a second modulatable monosynaptic excitatory input to other T-stellate cells as well as to inhibitory L- and D-stellate cells. This circuit may play a significant role in acoustic information processing. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>T-stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are known to have local axon collaterals that terminate in the vicinity of their dendrites and cell bodies within the same isofrequency lamina in parallel with the auditory nerve fibers that innervate them. Excitatory synaptic connections between stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina are hypothesized to be involved in the nitric oxide-mediated upregulation of T-stellate responses to their auditory input. This could serve as a mechanism of variable gain control in the enhancement of responses to vowel spectral peaks. Previous studies have provided indirect evidence for these possible synaptic interconnections between T-stellate cells, but unequivocal identification has yet to be established. Here, we used retrograde neuronal tracing with adeno-associated viral vector or biotinylated dextran amine injected into the inferior colliculus (IC) to detect the postsynaptic target of T-stellate cells within the VCN. We show that backfilled T-stellate cell axons make monosynapatic connections on the labeled cell bodies and dendrites of other labeled T-stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina. Electron microscopy revealed that T-stellate terminals can also make synapses on structures not retrogradely labeled from the IC. Glycine antibodies combined with the viral labeling indicated that these nonbackfilled structures that the labeled T-stellate terminals were synapsing on are most likely the cell bodies and dendrites of two size categories of glycinergic VCN cells, whose sizes and relative numbers indicated they are the D- and L-stellate cells. These cells are known to provide inhibitory inputs back onto T-stellate cells. Our data indicate that, in addition to their auditory nerve input, T-stellate cells provide a second modulatable excitatory input to both inhibitory and excitatory cells in a VCN isofrequency lamina and may play a significant role in acoustic information processing.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The LXRs agonist GW3965 ameliorates chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors. LXRs agonist treatment can inhibit hippocampal neuroinflammation of CUS model mice, reverse the increase in the number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampal subregions, inhibit the activation of microglia in hippocampal CA2/3 and DG regions, and significantly increase the branch length and endpoints of microglia in the DG of CUS model mice. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Liver X receptors (LXRs) have recently been reported to be novel and potential targets for the reversal of depressive-like behaviors, but the mechanism remains unclear. Hippocampal neuroinflammation and impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia are closely associated with depression. To investigate the effects of LXRs agonist (GW3965) on neuroinflammation and microglia in the hippocampal formation of mice with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral tests, hippocampal LXRs gene expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR, the protein expression levels of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappa B, and cluster of differentiation 206 were estimated by western blotting, modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of microglia in each hippocampal subregion, and immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of activated microglia and the morphology of microglia. We found that GW3965 alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by CUS, reversed the decrease in hippocampal LXRα and LXRβ induced by CUS, increased the protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and decreased the protein expression of antiinflammatory factors induced by CUS. Moreover, CUS intervention significantly increased the number of microglia in the CA1 region, CA2/3 region, and dentate gyrus and the density of activated microglia in the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus and significantly decreased the endpoints of microglial branches and process length of microglia in the dentate gyrus, while 4 weeks of injections with GW3965 reversed these changes. These findings suggest that regulating the number, activated state, and morphology of microglia in hippocampal subregions might be an important basis for the antidepressant effects of LXRs.</p>

     alt="Oxytocin receptors are widely distributed in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) brain: Relation to social behavior, genetic polymorphisms, and the dopamine system"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, we comprehensively mapped oxytocin receptor mRNA throughout the prairie vole brain. A comparison of mRNA and protein localization revealed localized mismatches suggesting both pre- and postsynaptic functions for oxytocin receptors (OXTRs). Coexpression of Oxtr mRNA with D1/D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens was also examined.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oxytocin regulates social behavior via direct modulation of neurons, regulation of neural network activity, and interaction with other neurotransmitter systems. The behavioral effects of oxytocin signaling are determined by the species-specific distribution of brain oxytocin receptors. The socially monogamous prairie vole has been a useful model organism for elucidating the role of oxytocin in social behaviors, including pair bonding, response to social loss, and consoling. However, there has been no comprehensive mapping of oxytocin receptor-expressing cells throughout the prairie vole brain. Here, we employed a highly sensitive in situ hybridization, RNAscope, to construct an exhaustive, brain-wide map of oxytocin receptor mRNA-expressing cells. We found that oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was widespread and diffused throughout the brain, with specific areas displaying a particularly robust expression. Comparing receptor binding with mRNA revealed that regions of the hippocampus and substantia nigra contained oxytocin receptor protein but lacked mRNA, indicating that oxytocin receptors can be transported to distal neuronal processes, consistent with presynaptic oxytocin receptor functions. In the nucleus accumbens, a region involved in oxytocin-dependent social bonding, oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was detected in both the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing subtypes of cells. Furthermore, natural genetic polymorphisms robustly influenced oxytocin receptor expression in both D1 and D2 receptor cell types in the nucleus accumbens. Collectively, our findings further elucidate the extent to which oxytocin signaling is capable of influencing brain-wide neural activity, responses to social stimuli, and social behavior.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA is diffusely expressed throughout the brain, with strong expression concentrated in certain areas involved in social behavior.</p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression and protein localization are misaligned in some areas, indicating that the receptor protein may be transported to distal processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Organization of neural systems expressing melanocortin‐3 receptors in the mouse brain: Evidence for sexual dimorphism</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central melanocortin system is fundamentally important for controlling food intake and energy homeostasis. Melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is one of two major receptors of the melanocortin system found in the brain. In contrast to the well-characterized melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), little is known regarding the organization of MC3R-expressing neural circuits. To increase our understanding of the intrinsic organization of MC3R neural circuits, identify specific differences between males and females, and gain a neural systems level perspective of this circuitry, we conducted a brain-wide mapping of neurons labeled for MC3R and characterized the distribution of their projections. Analysis revealed MC3R neuronal and terminal labeling in multiple brain regions that control a diverse range of physiological functions and behavioral processes. Notably, dense labeling was observed in the hypothalamus, as well as areas that share considerable connections with the hypothalamus, including the cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and brainstem. Additionally, MC3R neuronal labeling was sexually dimorphic in several areas, including the anteroventral periventricular area, arcuate nucleus, principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and ventral premammillary region. Altogether, anatomical evidence reported here suggests that MC3R has the potential to influence several different classes of motivated behavior that are essential for survival, including ingestive, reproductive, defensive, and arousal behaviors, and is likely to modulate these behaviors differently in males and females.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The comb-shaped pectines in scorpions are intriguing chemo- and mechanosensory organs. By using neuronal tracer and immunohistochemistry, we focused on the projection areas of mechanosensory pecten hair sensillae afferents in two species, <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. We identified an extensive neuronal pathway, which includes distinct ventral neuropils, multisegmental ascending tracts, contralateral branches, and direct innervation of the third and fourth walking leg neuromeres. These results support the hypothesis that pecten hair sensillae function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Scorpions’ sensory abilities are intriguing, especially the rather enigmatic ventral comb-like chemo- and mechanosensory organs, the so-called pectines. Attached ventrally to the second mesosomal segment just posterior to the coxae of the fourth walking leg pair, the pectines consist of the lamellae, the fulcra, and a variable number of pecten teeth. The latter contain the bimodal peg sensillae, used for probing the substrate with regard to chemo- and mechanosensory cues simultaneously. In addition, the lamellae, the fulcra and the pecten teeth are equipped with pecten hair sensillae (PHS) to gather mechanosensory information. Previously, we have analyzed the neuronal pathway associated with the peg sensillae unraveling their somatotopic projection pattern in dedicated pecten neuropils. Little is known, however, regarding the projections of PHS within the scorpion nervous system. Behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed involvement of PHS in reflexive responses but how the information is integrated remains unresolved. Here, we unravel the innervation pattern of the mechanosensory pecten hair afferents in <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. By using immunofluorescent labeling and injection of Neurobiotin tracer, we identify extensive arborizations of afferents, including (i) ventral neuropils, (ii) somatotopically organized multisegmental sensory tracts, (iii) contralateral branches via commissures, and (iv) direct ipsilateral innervation of walking leg neuromeres 3 and 4. Our results suggest that PHS function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance, mediating accurate pecten teeth alignment to guarantee functionality of pectines, which are involved in fundamental capacities like mating or navigation.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The localization of neurons producing the gaseous transmitter nitric oxide are described throughout the brain and retina of the African cichlid <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>. Widespread <i>nnos</i> expression in the brain-, and sex- and status-specific differences in sensory tissues suggests diverse functional roles for nitrergic signaling in this social teleost fish.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase serves as an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that is involved in reproductive regulation, learning, sensory processing, and other forms of neural plasticity. Here, we map the distribution of <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells in the brain and retina of the cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> using in situ hybridization. In the brain, <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells are found from the olfactory bulbs to the hindbrain, including within specific nuclei involved in decision-making, sensory processing, neuroendocrine regulation, and the expression of social behaviors. In the retina, <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells are found in the inner nuclear layer, presumably in amacrine cells. We also used quantitative PCR to test for differences in <i>nnos</i> expression within the eye and olfactory bulbs of males and females of different reproductive states and social statuses. In the eye, males express more <i>nnos</i> than females, and socially dominant males express more <i>nnos</i> than subordinate males, but expression did not differ among female reproductive states. In the olfactory bulbs, dominant males had greater <i>nnos</i> expression than subordinate males. These results suggest a status-specific function for NO signaling in the visual and olfactory systems that may be important for sensory perception related to mating or territorial interactions to maintain the social hierarchy. The widespread distribution of <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells throughout the cichlid brain is similar to that in other teleosts, with some conserved localization patterns across vertebrates, suggesting diverse functions for this important neurotransmitter system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Uncoupling axon guidance and neuronal migration in Robo3‐deficient inferior olivary neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Inferior olivary (IO) neurons are born in the dorsal hindbrain and migrate tangentially toward the ventral midline. During their dorsoventral migration, IO neurons extend long leading processes that cross the midline, transform into axons, and project into the contralateral cerebellum. In absence of the axon guidance receptor Robo3, IO axons fail to cross the midline and project to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Remarkably, the IO cell bodies still reach the midline where they form a nucleus of abnormal cytoarchitecture. The mechanisms underlying the migration of Robo3-deficient IO neurons are unknown. Here, we used three-dimensional imaging and transgenic mice to label subsets of IO neurons and study their migratory behavior in Robo3 knockout. We show that IO migration is delayed in absence of Robo3. Strikingly, Robo3-deficient IO neurons progress toward the midline in a direction opposite to their axons. This occurs through a change of polarity and the generation of a second leading process at the rear of the cell. These results suggest that Robo3 receptor controls the establishment of neuronal polarity and the coupling of axonogenesis and cell body migration in IO neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Drosophila Homolog of the Human Carpenter Syndrome Linked Gene, MEGF8, Is Required for Synapse Development and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>Drosophila</I> multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 8 (dMegf8) is a homolog of human <I>MEGF8</I>. <I>MEGF8</I> encodes a multidomain transmembrane protein which is highly conserved across species. In humans, <I>MEGF8</I> mutations cause a rare genetic disorder called Carpenter syndrome, which is frequently associated with abnormal left-right patterning, cardiac defects, and learning disabilities. <I>MEGF8</I> is also associated with psychiatric disorders. Despite its clinical relevance, <I>MEGF8</I> remains poorly characterized; and although it is highly conserved, studies on animal models of Megf8 are also very limited. The presence of intellectual disabilities in Carpenter syndrome patients and association of <I>MEGF8</I> with psychiatric disorders indicate that mutations in <I>MEGF8</I> cause underlying defects in synaptic structure and functions. In this study, we investigated the role of <I>Drosophila</I> dMegf8 in glutamatergic synapses of the larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) in both males and females. We show that dMegf8 localizes to NMJ synapses and is required for proper synaptic growth. <I>dMegf8</I> mutant larvae and adults show severe motor coordination deficits. At the NMJ, <I>dMegf8</I> mutants show altered localization of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, defects in synaptic ultrastructure, and neurotransmission. Interestingly, <I>dMegf8</I> mutants have reduced levels of the Type II BMP receptor Wishful thinking (<I>Wit</I>). <I>dMegf8</I> displays genetic interactions with <I>neurexin-1</I> (<I>dnrx</I>) and <I>wit</I>, and in association with Dnrx and Wit plays an essential role in synapse organization. Our studies provide insights into human MEGF8 functions and potentially into mechanisms that may underlie intellectual disabilities observed in Carpenter syndrome as well as MEGF8-related synaptic structural and/or functional deficits in psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Carpenter syndrome, known for over a century now, is a genetic disorder linked to mutations in <I>Multiple Epidermal Growth Factor-like Domains 8</I> (<I>MEGF8</I>) gene and associated with intellectual disabilities among other symptoms. <I>MEGF8</I> is also associated with psychiatric disorders. Despite the high genetic conservation and clinical relevance, the functions of <I>MEGF8</I> remain largely uncharacterized. Patients with intellectual disabilities and psychiatric diseases often have an underlying defect in synaptic structure and function. This work defines the role of the fly homolog of human <I>MEGF8</I>, <I>dMegf8</I>, in glutamatergic synapse growth, organization, and function and provide insights into potential functions of <I>MEGF8</I> in human central synapses and synaptic mechanisms that may underlie psychiatric disorders and intellectual disabilities seen in Carpenter syndrome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Cooperation of {alpha}-Synuclein and Tau Is Essential for Proper Corticogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alpha-synuclein (&alpha;Syn) and tau are abundant multifunctional neuronal proteins, and their intracellular deposits have been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite the disease relevance, their physiological roles remain elusive, as mice with knock-out of either of these genes do not exhibit overt phenotypes. To reveal functional cooperation, we generated &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> double-knock-out mice and characterized the functional cross talk between these proteins during brain development. Intriguingly, deletion of &alpha;Syn and tau reduced Notch signaling and accelerated interkinetic nuclear migration of G2 phase at early embryonic stage. This significantly altered the balance between the proliferative and neurogenic divisions of progenitor cells, resulting in an overproduction of early born neurons and enhanced neurogenesis, by which the brain size was enlarged during the embryonic stage in both sexes. On the other hand, a reduction in the number of neural progenitor cells in the middle stage of corticogenesis diminished subsequent gliogenesis in the &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cortex. Additionally, the expansion and maturation of macroglial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) were suppressed in the &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> postnatal brain, which in turn reduced the male &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain size and cortical thickness to less than the control values. Our study identifies important functional cooperation of &alpha;Syn and tau during corticogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Correct understanding of the physiological functions of &alpha;Syn and tau in CNS is critical to elucidate pathogenesis involved in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We show here that &alpha;Syn and tau are cooperatively involved in brain development via maintenance of progenitor cells. &alpha;Syn and tau double-knock-out mice exhibited an overproduction of early born neurons and accelerated neurogenesis at early corticogenesis. Furthermore, loss of &alpha;Syn and tau also perturbed gliogenesis at later embryonic stage, as well as the subsequent glial expansion and maturation at postnatal brain. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights and extend therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases caused by aberrant &alpha;Syn and tau.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics and Mechanisms of Contrast-Dependent Modulation of Spatial-Frequency Tuning in the Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spatial-frequency (SF) tuning of neurons in the early visual cortex is adjusted for stimulus contrast. As the contrast increases, SF tuning is modulated so that the transmission of fine features is facilitated. A variety of mechanisms are involved in shaping SF tunings, but those responsible for the contrast-dependent modulations are unclear. To address this, we measured the time course of SF tunings of area 17 neurons in male cats under different contrasts with a reverse correlation. After response onset, the optimal SF continuously shifted to a higher SF over time, with a larger shift for higher contrast. At high contrast, whereas neurons with a large shift of optimal SF exhibited a large bandwidth decrease, those with a negligible shift increased the bandwidth over time. Between these two extremes, the degree of SF shift and bandwidth change continuously varied. At low contrast, bandwidth generally decreased over time. These dynamic effects enhanced the processing of high-frequency range under a high-contrast condition and allowed time-average SF tuning curves to show contrast-dependent modulation, like that of steady-state SF tuning curves reported previously. Combinations of two mechanisms, one that decreases bandwidth and shifts optimal SF, and another that increases bandwidth without shifting optimal SF, would explain the full range of SF tuning dynamics. Our results indicate that one of the essential roles of tuning dynamics of area 17 neurons, which have been observed for various visual features, is to adjust tunings depending on contrast.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The spatial scales of features transmitted by cortical neurons are adjusted depending on stimulus contrast. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We measured the time course of spatial frequency tunings of cat area 17 neurons under different contrast conditions and observed a variety of dynamic effects that contributed to spatial-scale adjustment, allowing neurons to adjust their spatial frequency tuning range depending on contrast. Our results suggest that one of the essential roles of tuning dynamics of area 17 neurons, which have been observed for various visual features, is to adjust tunings depending on contrast.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Crossed Corticostriatal Projections in the Macaque Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>In nonhuman primates, major input to the striatum originates from ipsilateral cortex and thalamus. The striatum is a target also of crossed corticostriatal (CSt) projections from the contralateral hemisphere, which have been so far somewhat neglected. In the present study, based on neural tracer injections in different parts of the striatum in macaques of either sex, we analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution of labeled CSt cells in the two hemispheres. The results showed that crossed CSt projections to the caudate and the putamen can be relatively robust (up to 30% of total labeled cells). The origin of the direct and the crossed CSt projections was not symmetrical as the crossed ones originated almost exclusively from motor, prefrontal, and cingulate areas and not from parietal and temporal areas. Furthermore, there were several cases in which the contribution of contralateral areas tended to equal that of the ipsilateral ones. The present study is the first detailed description of this anatomic pathway of the macaque brain and provides the substrate for bilateral distribution of motor, motivational, and cognitive signals for reinforcement learning and selection of actions or action sequences, and for learning compensatory motor strategies after cortical stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In nonhuman primates the striatum is a target of projections originating from the contralateral hemisphere (crossed CSt projections), which have been so far poorly investigated. The present study analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in the macaque brain the origin of the crossed CSt projections compared with those originating from the ipsilateral hemisphere. The results showed that crossed CSt projections originate mostly from frontal and rostral cingulate areas and in some cases their contribution tended to equal that from ipsilateral areas. These projections could provide the substrate for bilateral distribution of motor, motivational, and cognitive signals for reinforcement learning and action selection, and for learning compensatory motor strategies after cortical stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adult Born Dentate Granule Cell Mediated Upregulation of Feedback Inhibition in a Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) and behavioral comorbidities frequently develop after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Aberrant neurogenesis of dentate granule cells (DGCs) after TBI may contribute to the synaptic reorganization that occurs in PTE, but how neurogenesis at different times relative to the injury contributes to feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus is unknown. Thus, we examined whether DGCs born at different postnatal ages differentially participate in feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI. Both sexes of transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in postnatally born DGCs were used for optogenetic activation of three DGC cohorts: postnatally early born DGCs, or those born just before or after CCI. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ChR2-negative, mature DGCs and parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PVBCs) in hippocampal slices to determine whether optogenetic activation of postnatally born DGCs increases feedback inhibition and/or recurrent excitation in mice 8-10 weeks after CCI and whether PVBCs are targets of ChR2-positive DGCs. In the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to CCI, activation of ChR2-expressing DGCs born before CCI produced increased feedback inhibition in ChR2-negative DGCs and increased excitation in PVBCs compared with those from sham controls. This upregulated feedback inhibition was less prominent in DGCs born early in life or after CCI. Surprisingly, ChR2-positive DGC activation rarely evoked recurrent excitation in mature DGCs from any cohort. These results support that DGC birth date-related increased feedback inhibition in of DGCs may contribute to altered excitability after TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dentate granule cells (DGCs) control excitability of the dentate gyrus through synaptic interactions with inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Persistent changes in DGC synaptic connectivity develop after traumatic brain injury, contributing to hyperexcitability in post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). However, the impact of DGC neurogenesis on synaptic reorganization, especially on inhibitory circuits, after brain injury is not adequately described. Here, upregulation of feedback inhibition in mature DGCs from male and female mice was associated with increased excitation of parvalbumin-expressing basket cells by postnatally born DGCs, providing novel insights into underlying mechanisms of altered excitability after brain injury. A better understanding of these inhibitory circuit changes can help formulate hypotheses for development of novel, evidence-based treatments for post-traumatic epilepsy by targeting birth date-specific subsets of DGCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{beta} Bursting in the Retrosplenial Cortex Is a Neurophysiological Correlate of Environmental Novelty Which Is Disrupted in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a significant role in spatial learning and memory and is functionally disrupted in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to investigate neurophysiological correlates of spatial learning and memory in this region we employed <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in awake and freely moving male mice, comparing neural activity between wild-type and J20 mice, a transgenic model of AD-associated amyloidopathy. To determine the response of the RSC to environmental novelty local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded while mice explored novel and familiar recording arenas. In familiar environments we detected short, phasic bursts of &beta; (20&ndash;30 Hz) oscillations (&beta; bursts), which arose at a low but steady rate. Exposure to a novel environment rapidly initiated a dramatic increase in the rate, size and duration of &beta; bursts. Additionally, -&alpha;/&beta; cross-frequency coupling was significantly higher during novelty, and spiking of neurons in the RSC was significantly enhanced during &beta; bursts. Finally, excessive &beta; bursting was seen in J20 mice, including increased &beta; bursting during novelty and familiarity, yet a loss of coupling between &beta; bursts and spiking activity. These findings support the concept that &beta; bursting may be responsible for the activation and reactivation of neuronal ensembles underpinning the formation and maintenance of cortical representations, and that disruptions to this activity in J20 mice may underlie cognitive impairments seen in these animals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is thought to be involved in the formation, recall and consolidation of contextual memory. The discovery of bursts of &beta; oscillations in this region, which are associated with increased neuronal spiking and strongly upregulated while mice explore novel environments, provides a potential mechanism for the activation of neuronal ensembles, which may underlie the formation of cortical representations of context. Excessive &beta; bursting in the RSC of J20 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), alongside the disassociation of &beta; bursting from neuronal spiking, may underlie spatial memory impairments previously shown in these mice. These findings introduce a novel neurophysiological correlate of spatial learning and memory, and a potentially new form of AD-related cortical dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Common Neural Mechanisms Control Attention and Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although previous studies point to qualitative similarities between working memory (WM) and attention, the degree to which these two constructs rely on shared neural mechanisms remains unknown. Focusing on one such potentially shared mechanism, we tested the hypothesis that selecting an item within WM utilizes similar neural mechanisms as selecting a visible item via a shift of attention. We used fMRI and machine learning to decode both the selection among items visually available and the selection among items stored in WM in human subjects (both sexes). Patterns of activity in visual, parietal, and to a lesser extent frontal cortex predicted the locations of the selected items. Critically, these patterns were strikingly interchangeable; classifiers trained on data during attentional selection predicted selection from WM, and classifiers trained on data during selection from memory predicted attentional selection. Using models of voxel receptive fields, we visualized topographic population activity that revealed gain enhancements at the locations of the externally and internally selected items. Our results suggest that selecting among perceived items and selecting among items in WM share a common mechanism. This common mechanism, analogous to a shift of spatial attention, controls the relative gains of neural populations that encode behaviorally relevant information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How we allocate our attention to external stimuli that we see and to internal representations of stimuli stored in memory might rely on a common mechanism. Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that not only could patterns of human brain activity predict which items were selected during perception and memory, but that these patterns were interchangeable during external and internal selection. Additionally, this generalized selection mechanism operates by changes in the gains of the neural populations both encoding attended sensory representations and storing relevant memory representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Distributed Network for Multimodal Experiential Representation of Concepts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychophysical evidence indicate that concept retrieval selectively engages specific sensory and motor brain systems involved in the acquisition of the retrieved concept. However, it remains unclear which supramodal cortical regions contribute to this process and what kind of information they represent. Here, we used representational similarity analysis of two large fMRI datasets with a searchlight approach to generate a detailed map of human brain regions where the semantic similarity structure across individual lexical concepts can be reliably detected. We hypothesized that heteromodal cortical areas typically associated with the default mode network encode multimodal experiential information about concepts, consistent with their proposed role as cortical integration hubs. In two studies involving different sets of concepts and different participants (both sexes), we found a distributed, bihemispheric network engaged in concept representation, composed of high-level association areas in the anterior, lateral, and ventral temporal lobe; inferior parietal lobule; posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus; and medial, dorsal, ventrolateral, and orbital prefrontal cortex. In both studies, a multimodal model combining sensory, motor, affective, and other types of experiential information explained significant variance in the neural similarity structure observed in these regions that was not explained by unimodal experiential models or by distributional semantics (i.e., word2vec similarity). These results indicate that during concept retrieval, lexical concepts are represented across a vast expanse of high-level cortical regions, especially in the areas that make up the default mode network, and that these regions encode multimodal experiential information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Conceptual knowledge includes information acquired through various modalities of experience, such as visual, auditory, tactile, and emotional information. We investigated which brain regions encode mental representations that combine information from multiple modalities when participants think about the meaning of a word. We found that such representations are encoded across a widely distributed network of cortical areas in both hemispheres, including temporal, parietal, limbic, and prefrontal association areas. Several areas not traditionally associated with semantic cognition were also implicated. Our results indicate that the retrieval of conceptual knowledge during word comprehension relies on a much larger portion of the cerebral cortex than previously thought and that multimodal experiential information is represented throughout the entire network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Causal Inference of Body Ownership in the Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do we come to sense that a hand in view belongs to our own body or not? Previous studies have suggested that the integration of vision and somatosensation in the frontoparietal areas plays a critical role in the sense of body ownership (i.e., the multisensory perception of limbs and body parts as our own). However, little is known about how these areas implement the multisensory integration process at the computational level and whether activity predicts illusion elicitation in individual participants on a trial-by-trial basis. To address these questions, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a rubber hand illusion-detection task and fitted the registered neural responses to a Bayesian causal inference model of body ownership. Thirty healthy human participants (male and female) performed 12 s trials with varying degrees of asynchronously delivered visual and tactile stimuli of a rubber hand (in view) and a (hidden) real hand. After the 12 s period, participants had to judge whether the rubber hand felt like their own. As hypothesized, activity in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices was related to illusion elicitation at the level of individual participants and trials. Importantly, activity in the posterior parietal cortex fit the predicted probability of illusion emergence of the Bayesian causal inference model based on each participant's behavioral response profile. Our findings suggest an important role for the posterior parietal cortex in implementing Bayesian causal inference of body ownership and reveal how trial-by-trial variations in neural signatures of multisensory integration relate to the elicitation of the rubber hand illusion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain create a coherent perceptual experience of one's own body based on information from the different senses? We examined how the likelihood of eliciting a classical bodily illusion that depends on vision and touch&mdash;the rubber hand illusion&mdash;is related to neural activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that trial-by-trial variations in the neural signal in the posterior parietal cortex, a well known center for sensory integration, fitted a statistical function that describes how likely it is that the brain infers that a rubber hand is one's own given the available visual and tactile evidence. Thus, probabilistic analysis of sensory information in the parietal lobe underlies our unitary sense of bodily self.</p>

                <p>Research into the nature of 1/<I>f</I>-like, nonoscillatory electrophysiological activity has grown exponentially in recent years in cognitive neuroscience. The shape of this activity has been linked to the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits, which is thought to be important for information processing. However, to date, it is not known whether the presentation of a stimulus induces changes in the parameters of 1/<I>f</I> activity in scalp recordings, separable from event-related potentials (ERPs). Here, we analyzed event-related broadband changes in human EEG both before and after removing ERPs to demonstrate their confounding effect, and to establish whether there are genuine stimulus-induced changes in 1/<I>f</I>. Using data from a passive and an active auditory task (<I>n</I> = 23, 61% female), we found that the shape of the post-event spectra between 2 and 25 Hz differed significantly from the pre-event spectra even after removing the frequency-content of ERPs. Further, a significant portion of this difference could be accounted for by a rotational shift in 1/<I>f</I> activity, manifesting as an increase in low and a decrease in high frequencies. Importantly, the magnitude of this rotational shift was related to the attentional demands of the task. This change in 1/<I>f</I> is consistent with increased inhibition following stimulus onset, and likely reflects a disruption of ongoing excitatory activity proportional to processing demands. Finally, these findings contradict the central assumption of baseline normalization strategies in time-frequency analyses, namely, that background EEG activity is stationary across time. As such, they have far-reaching consequences relevant for several subfields of neuroscience.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interest in the functional role of the 1/<I>f</I>-like background brain activity has been growing exponentially in neuroscience. Yet, no study to date has demonstrated a clear relationship between information processing and 1/<I>f</I> activity by investigating event-related effects on its parameters in noninvasive recordings of neural activity. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that stimuli induce rotational changes in 1/<I>f</I> activity, detectable at lower frequencies and independent from the occurrence of event-related potentials. These findings suggest the presence of large-scale inhibition following stimulus onset, largest when the stimulus is novel, and indicate that the assumption of stationary background activity in the analysis of neural oscillations is untenable. These results have far-reaching consequences that cut across several subfields of neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Peroxisome Injury in Multiple Sclerosis: Protective Effects of 4-Phenylbutyrate in CNS-Associated Macrophages</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive and inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. Peroxisomes perform critical functions that contribute to CNS homeostasis. We investigated peroxisome injury and mitigating effects of peroxisome-restorative therapy on inflammatory demyelination in models of MS. Human autopsied CNS tissues (male and female), human cell cultures, and cuprizone-mediated demyelination mice (female) were examined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunolabeling. The therapeutic peroxisome proliferator, 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) was investigated <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. White matter from MS patients showed reduced peroxisomal transcript and protein levels, including PMP70, compared with non-MS controls. Cultured human neural cells revealed that human microglia contained abundant peroxisomal proteins. TNF-&alpha;-exposed microglia displayed reduced immunolabeling of peroxisomal proteins, PMP70 and PEX11&beta;, which was prevented with 4-PBA. In human myeloid cells exposed to TNF-&alpha; or nigericin, suppression of PEX11&beta; and catalase protein levels were observed to be dependent on NLRP3 expression. Hindbrains from cuprizone-exposed mice showed reduced <I>Abcd1</I>, <I>Cat</I>, and <I>Pex5l</I> transcript levels, with concurrent increased <I>Nlrp3</I> and <I>Il1b</I> transcript levels, which was abrogated by 4-PBA. In the central corpus callosum, Iba-1 in CNS-associated macrophages and peroxisomal thiolase immunostaining after cuprizone exposure was increased by 4-PBA. 4-PBA prevented decreased myelin basic protein and neurofilament heavy chain immunoreactivity caused by cuprizone exposure. Cuprizone-induced neurobehavioral deficits were improved by 4-PBA treatment. Peroxisome injury in CNS-associated macrophages contributed to neuroinflammation and demyelination that was prevented by 4-PBA treatment. A peroxisome-targeted therapy might be valuable for treating inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration in MS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common and disabling disorder of the CNS with no curative therapies for its progressive form. The present studies implicate peroxisome impairment in CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs), which include resident microglia and blood-derived macrophages, as an important contributor to inflammatory demyelination and neuroaxonal injury in MS. We also show that the inflammasome molecule NLRP3 is associated with peroxisome injury <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>, especially in CAMs. Treatment with the peroxisome proliferator 4-phenylbutyrate exerted protective effects with improved molecular, morphologic, and neurobehavioral outcomes that were associated with a neuroprotective CAM phenotype. These findings offer novel insights into the contribution of peroxisome injury in MS together with preclinical testing of a rational therapy for MS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Shared and Distinct Functional Effects of Patient-Specific Tbr1 Mutations on Cortical Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>T-Box Brain Transcription Factor 1 (TBR1) plays essential roles in brain development, mediating neuronal migration, fate specification, and axon tract formation. While heterozygous loss-of-function and missense <I>TBR1</I> mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, the effects of these heterogeneous mutations on brain development have yet to be fully explored. We characterized multiple mouse lines carrying <I>Tbr1</I> mutations differing by type and exonic location, including the previously generated <I>Tbr1</I> exon 2-3 knock-out (KO) line, and we analyzed male and female mice at neonatal and adult stages. The frameshift patient mutation A136PfsX80 (A136fs) caused reduced TBR1 protein in cortex similar to <I>Tbr1</I> KO, while the missense patient mutation K228E caused significant TBR1 upregulation. Analysis of cortical layer formation found similar defects between KO and A136fs homozygotes in their CUX1<sup>+</sup> and CTIP2<sup>+</sup> layer positions, while K228E homozygosity produced layering defects distinct from these mutants. Meanwhile, the examination of cortical apoptosis found extensive cell death in KO homozygotes but limited cell death in A136fs or K228E homozygotes. Despite their discordant cortical phenotypes, these <I>Tbr1</I> mutations produced several congruent phenotypes, including anterior commissure reduction in heterozygotes, which was previously observed in humans with <I>TBR1</I> mutations. These results indicate that patient-specific <I>Tbr1</I> mutant mice will be valuable translational models for pinpointing shared and distinct etiologies among patients with <I>TBR1</I>-related developmental conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mutations of the <I>TBR1</I> gene increase the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions such as intellectual disability and autism. Therefore, the study of <I>TBR1</I> can offer insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these conditions, which affect millions worldwide. To improve the modeling of <I>TBR1</I>-related conditions over current <I>Tbr1</I> knock-out mice, we created mouse lines carrying <I>Tbr1</I> mutations identical to those found in human patients. Mice with one mutant <I>Tbr1</I> copy show reduced amygdalar connections regardless of mutation type, suggesting a core biomarker for <I>TBR1</I>-related disorders. In mice with two mutant <I>Tbr1</I> copies, brain phenotypes diverge by mutation type, suggesting differences in <I>Tbr1</I> gene functionality in different patients. These mouse models will serve as valuable tools for understanding genotype&ndash;phenotype relationships among patients with neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Fast Event-Related Mapping of Population Fingertip Tuning Properties in Human Sensorimotor Cortex at 7T</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>fMRI studies that investigate somatotopic tactile representations in the human cortex typically use either block or phase-encoded stimulation designs. Event-related (ER) designs allow for more flexible and unpredictable stimulation sequences than the other methods, but they are less efficient. Here, we compared an efficiency-optimized fast ER design (2.8-s average intertrial interval; ITI) to a conventional slow ER design (8-s average ITI) for mapping voxelwise fingertip tactile tuning properties in the sensorimotor cortex of six participants at 7 Tesla. The fast ER design yielded more reliable responses compared with the slow ER design, but with otherwise similar tuning properties. Concatenating the fast and slow ER data, we demonstrate in each individual brain the existence of two separate somatotopically-organized tactile representations of the fingertips, one in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) on the postcentral gyrus, and the other shared across the motor and premotor cortices on the precentral gyrus. In both S1 and motor representations, fingertip selectivity decreased progressively, from narrowly-tuned Brodmann area (BA) 3b and BA4a, respectively, toward associative parietal and frontal regions that responded equally to all fingertips, suggesting increasing information integration along these two pathways. In addition, fingertip selectivity in S1 decreased from the cortical representation of the thumb to that of the pinky.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Molecular Markers of Mechanosensation in Glycinergic Neurons in the Avian Lumbosacral Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <p>Birds are exceptionally adept at controlling their body position. For example, they can coordinate rapid movements of their body while stabilizing their head. Intriguingly, this ability may rely in part on a mechanosensory organ in the avian lower spinal cord called the lumbosacral organ (LSO). However, molecular mechanotransduction mechanisms have not been identified in the avian spinal cord. Here, we report the presence of glycinergic neurons in the LSO that exhibit immunoreactivity for myosin7a and espin, molecules essential for function and maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. Specifically, we find glycinergic cell bodies near the central canal and processes that extend laterally to the accessory lobes and spinal ligaments. These LSO neurons are reminiscent of glycinergic neurons in a recently-described lateral spinal proprioceptive organ in zebrafish that detects spinal bending. The avian LSO, however, is located inside a series of fused vertebrae called the synsacrum, which constrains spinal bending. We suggest the LSO may be a modification and elaboration of a preexisting mechanosensory spinal network in vertebrates. A mechanistic understanding of its function may be an important clue to understanding the evolution and development of avian locomotion.</p>

                Introduction: Fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS) remains a rare disease. The noninvasive forms are hard to diagnose. The management protocols remain controversial. We aim to describe the clinical, radiological and pathological features of noninvasive FRS and present our management protocol and follow-up results. Patients and methods: This descriptive study was conducted in the ear-nose-throat department of the university hospital, Taher Sfar in Mahdia, Tunisia. All patients who responded to the definition of noninvasive FRS (fungal balls and allergic fungal sinusitis) were included. The study was conducted over a three year period (May 2017 – April 2021). Results: Eleven patients were included in this study: four cases of fungal balls and seven cases of allergic fungal sinusitis. Patients presented with symptoms of chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis with no response to conventional treatments. Computed tomodensitometry scan showed opacification of the paranasal sinuses in all patients. Other signs were heterogeneous opacities, local calcifications and thinning of the bony walls of the sinuses. Histopathological findings were inflammatory polyps in all cases of allergic FRS with the presence of fungal hyphae in 42.8% of the cases. All patients underwent surgery after a median delay of 12 [6–24] months of the symptom’s onset. The used procedures were endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy for all patients, ethmoidectomy (81.8%) and sphenoidotomy (36.4%). None received systemic antifungals or corticosteroids with a favorable outcome in all cases. Conclusion: Symptoms of noninvasive FRS are nonspecific. The scan images contribute to the diagnosis, but the perioperative findings and the histopathological results remain crucial.  The management is mainly surgical.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Testing microbiome associations with survival times at both the community and individual taxon levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yingtian Hu, Yunxiao Li, Glen A. Satten, Yi-Juan Hu</p>
Background <p>Finding microbiome associations with possibly censored survival times is an important problem, especially as specific taxa could serve as biomarkers for disease prognosis or as targets for therapeutic interventions. The two existing methods for survival outcomes, MiRKAT-S and OMiSA, are restricted to testing associations at the community level and do not provide results at the individual taxon level. An ad hoc approach testing each taxon with a survival outcome using the Cox proportional hazard model may not perform well in the microbiome setting with sparse count data and small sample sizes.</p> Methods <p>We have previously developed the linear decomposition model (LDM) for testing continuous or discrete outcomes that unifies community-level and taxon-level tests into one framework. Here we extend the LDM to test survival outcomes. We propose to use the Martingale residuals or the deviance residuals obtained from the Cox model as continuous covariates in the LDM. We further construct tests that combine the results of analyzing each set of residuals separately. Finally, we extend PERMANOVA, the most commonly used distance-based method for testing community-level hypotheses, to handle survival outcomes in a similar manner.</p> Results <p>Using simulated data, we showed that the LDM-based tests preserved the false discovery rate for testing individual taxa and had good sensitivity. The LDM-based community-level tests and PERMANOVA-based tests had comparable or better power than MiRKAT-S and OMiSA. An analysis of data on the association of the gut microbiome and the time to acute graft-versus-host disease revealed several dozen associated taxa that would not have been achievable by any community-level test, as well as improved community-level tests by the LDM and PERMANOVA over those obtained using MiRKAT-S and OMiSA.</p> Conclusions <p>Unlike existing methods, our new methods are capable of discovering individual taxa that are associated with survival times, which could be of important use in clinical settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Distinguishing shadows from surface boundaries using local achromatic cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher DiMattina, Josiah J. Burnham, Betul N. Guner, Haley B. Yerxa</p>

In order to accurately parse the visual scene into distinct surfaces, it is essential to determine whether a local luminance edge is caused by a boundary between two surfaces or a shadow cast across a single surface. Previous studies have demonstrated that local chromatic cues may help to distinguish edges caused by shadows from those caused by surface boundaries, but the information potentially available in local <i>achromatic</i> cues like contrast, texture, and penumbral blur remains poorly understood. In this study, we develop and analyze a large database of hand-labeled achromatic shadow edges to better understand what image properties distinguish them from occlusion edges. We find that both the highest contrast as well as the lowest contrast edges are more likely to be occlusions than shadows, extending previous observations based on a more limited image set. We also find that contrast cues alone can reliably distinguish the two edge categories with nearly 70% accuracy at 40x40 resolution. Logistic regression on a Gabor Filter bank (GFB) modeling a population of V1 simple cells separates the categories with nearly 80% accuracy, and furthermore exhibits tuning to penumbral blur. A Filter-Rectify Filter (FRF) style neural network extending the GFB model performed at better than 80% accuracy, and exhibited blur tuning and greater sensitivity to texture differences. We compare human performance on our edge classification task to that of the FRF and GFB models, finding the best human observers attaining the same performance as the machine classifiers. Several analyses demonstrate both classifiers exhibit significant positive correlation with human behavior, although we find a slightly better agreement on an image-by-image basis between human performance and the FRF model than the GFB model, suggesting an important role for texture.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A normative model of peripersonal space encoding as performing impact prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zdenek Straka, Jean-Paul Noel, Matej Hoffmann</p>

Accurately predicting contact between our bodies and environmental objects is paramount to our evolutionary survival. It has been hypothesized that multisensory neurons responding both to touch on the body, and to auditory or visual stimuli occurring near them—thus delineating our peripersonal space (PPS)—may be a critical player in this computation. However, we lack a normative account (i.e., a model specifying how we <i>ought to</i> compute) linking impact prediction and PPS encoding. Here, we leverage Bayesian Decision Theory to develop such a model and show that it recapitulates many of the characteristics of PPS. Namely, a normative model of impact prediction (i) delineates a graded boundary between near and far space, (ii) demonstrates an enlargement of PPS as the speed of incoming stimuli increases, (iii) shows stronger contact prediction for looming than receding stimuli—but critically is still present for receding stimuli when observation uncertainty is non-zero—, (iv) scales with the value we attribute to environmental objects, and finally (v) can account for the differing sizes of PPS for different body parts. Together, these modeling results support the conjecture that PPS reflects the computation of impact prediction, and make a number of testable predictions for future empirical studies.

                Background: This brief report presents an action research project that was conducted in 2020 to contribute to approaches to ensure adherence to COVID-19 health protocols by children in Ghana. The research was on the basis that when adults allow children to share the burden of finding effective measures to the adherence of COVID-19 health protocols, the spread of the virus will be contained, which would also ensure the safety of children. Method: The action research was designed to be socially engaging, therefore a qualitative approach using Arts-Based-Research was adopted. Arts, as a socio-pedagogical method, was used as a tool to engage 189 children, between the ages of 4 and 15 years, in art workshops in Kumasi, Ghana’s second-largest city. The children, from different socioeconomic backgrounds, were aided by Art Assistants to handle the different art materials. Results: The different artistic depiction of children on COVID-19 suggests that the awareness created had reached many children irrespective of their socioeconomic background. However, how it was portrayed by the child participants introduced a fun aspect enabling the art materials to be used for advocacy. Conclusion: The medium, children’s art, used was innovative and caught the attention of children and adults alike, hence the art materials were effective advocacy materials. Also, the flexibility of the project design enabled the researchers to adapt the outputs to suit the rapidly evolving COVID-19 issues in the country to make the project more effective.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors Associated with National Health Insurance Coverage in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The National Health Insurance (NHI) program is the Indonesian government's national health program. However, health insurance coverage has not been maximized. This study aims to analyze the factors associated with health insurance coverage in Indonesia.   Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional data were obtained from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey 2017. A total of 39,580 respondents were selected using two-stage stratified cluster sampling. The data come from the DHS Questionnaire Phase 7. In this study, we explored age, education level, wealth quintiles, residence, the number of children who are alive, marital status, current employment status, earnings, and health insurance status in relation to health insurance coverage. Then, we analyzed the data using chi-squared and binary logistic analyses.   Results: The prevalence of health insurance coverage in the Indonesian population is 62.3%. Respondent aged 15-24 years [AOR=0.88; 95% CI=0.77-1.00], secondary education level [AOR=0.44; 95% CI=0.41-0.47], poorer wealth index [AOR=0.76; 95% CI=0.71-0.82], live in rural area [AOR=0.78; 95% CI=0.75-0.82], divorced [AOR=0.72; 95% CI=0.63-0.83] were less likelihood to have health insurance. Conversely, the respondent who received earnings [AOR=1.25; 95% CI=1.18-1.32] was more likely to have health insurance.  Conclusion: This finding pointed to education level, economic status, and demographic area such as respondents who lived in rural areas should more pay attention to NHI. Intervention through the provision of appropriate information about NHI should be promoted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality assessment of systematic literature on uterine fibroids: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a research methodology that examines data and findings of other authors relative to specified research questions (RQ), collects multiple research studies, and summarises them to answer a research question using rigorous methods. Many SLRs have been published on uterine fibroids (UFs) in the last two decades but there is a dearth of knowledge on assessment of the quality to determine the reliability of results. Methods: This study employed the SLR method to identify available SLRs published on UFs. Dybå and Dingsøyr quality standards and dichotomous grading scales were employed to determine the quality of primary studies. On February 3rd, 2022, an auto search was conducted twice over Citeseer, EBSCO, ACM, Springer Link, IEE Computer society digital library, and Scopus using 17 search strings. Two teams independently screened papers and compared notes with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 11 criterial were adapted to evaluate the quality of the SLR’s. Results: 33 SLRs were subjected to data extraction after inclusion/exclusion criteria. Answers to our primary research question was positive as the aims and contexts of the SLRs are generally clear and the methodologies employed are all inclusive. The research outputs of the primary studies are valid and justifiable as their research statements were clear and findings unambiguous. Although some studies failed some quality criteria, answers to all RQs were affirmative as the percentage scores of the studies on each of the quality conditions is favourably high. Conclusions: The auto search may be incomplete because some qualified SLRs may have been missed as the choice of search strings was limited and may have omitted terminologies. Notwithstanding, with average quality scores of 83% in reporting, 81.2% in rigour, and 79% in credibility, this study concludes that majority of the meta-analysis published so far on UF are valid and reliable.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Different modalities of the treatment of Rasmussen encephalitis: A systematic review of case reports of a rare disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rasmussen’s encephalitis (RE) is a rare chronic neurological disorder that presents with progressive neurological and cognitive deterioration, and intractable seizures that lacks definitive management. We aimed to identify case reports of RE in the literature to assess the treatment based on the symptoms and outcomes after the treatment. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library from 1990 to 22nd February 2022 in order to review the case reports that included the treatment options and clinical outcomes of RE. A pre-established protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (ID: CRD42021261999). Results: The mean age of onset of seizure was 31.44 and 6.87 years in adult onset RE and children (below 15 years of age) with RE respectively. A total of four (44.44%) out of nine adult patients and 81 (66.39%) out of 122 children underwent surgery. Tacrolimus was used in 17 (13.93%) and steroid therapy was used in 11 (9.01%) of the children. Conclusions: Large scale-controlled trials are needed to study the beneficial effect of tacrolimus, IV Ig, and plasma therapy. Hemispherectomy should be opted as a treatment modality by assessing the impairment of patients’ motor or language functions following the treatment procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Observational study: determinants for vegetable consumption among elementary school students in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The prevalence of obesity in school children has been increasing worldwide, including in developing countries such as Indonesia. Childhood obesity is associated with an unbalanced diet, especially the lack of fruit and vegetable consumption. This study aimed to determine the factors that influence vegetable consumption behavior in school children in Indonesia. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted in eight public elementary schools in a suburban area of Bogor Regency involving 433 students from the fifth grade. Data collection was conducted from November to December 2018. Data on the students’ characteristics, knowledge, and attitude as well as availability of vegetables at home and at school were collected using a structured questionnaire. While, a 24-hour food recall was utilized to obtain information on vegetable consumption and overall diet. Data analysis was done using Chi-squared test and logistic regression. Results: The average daily intake of vegetables was 47.11 g, far below the recommend amount (250 g). Female students had significantly better vegetables intake compared with their male counterparts. The availability of vegetables at home and students’ positive attitude toward vegetables were also significantly associated with better vegetable intake. Logistic regression analysis showed that availability of vegetables at home almost tripled the likelihood of better vegetable consumption (OR 2.822, 95% CI  1.822–4.372). Additionally, availability of vegetables at school and positive attitude toward vegetables doubled the odd for better vegetable consumption, OR 2.2 and 2.1 respectively (p<0.005). Conclusions: Vegetable consumption among schoolchildren was very low compared with the recommended portion. Better vegetable consumption was significantly associated with sex, availability, and students’ attitudes. Vegetable availability at home was the strongest determinant influencing vegetable consumption among elementary school students involved in the study. Hence, parental support or home food environment is key in improving their diet quality to prevent obesity.

                Innate immune training of macrophages can impart long-term modulation. John et al. show that Syk inhibition and rutaecarpine treatment can impart similarly long-term modulatory effects in macrophages. Using a treatment/resting regime, Syk inhibitor reduces susceptibility to viruses, including SARS CoV2, while rutaecarpine reverses LPS tolerance and beta-glucan induced training.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogenic variants of sphingomyelin synthase SMS2 disrupt lipid landscapes in the secretory pathway</a></h4>

              
                Sphingomyelin is a dominant sphingolipid in mammalian cells. Its production in the <i>trans-</i>Golgi traps cholesterol synthesized in the ER to promote formation of a sphingomyelin/sterol gradient along the secretory pathway. This gradient marks a fundamental transition in physical membrane properties that help specify organelle identify and function. We previously identified mutations in sphingomyelin synthase SMS2 that cause osteoporosis and skeletal dysplasia. Here we show that SMS2 variants linked to the most severe bone phenotypes retain full enzymatic activity but fail to leave the ER owing to a defective autonomous ER export signal. Cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate sphingomyelin in the ER and display a disrupted transbilayer sphingomyelin asymmetry. These aberrant sphingomyelin distributions also occur in patient-derived fibroblasts and are accompanied by imbalances in cholesterol organization, glycerophospholipid profiles and lipid order in the secretory pathway. We postulate that pathogenic SMS2 variants undermine the capacity of osteogenic cells to uphold nonrandom lipid distributions that are critical for their bone forming activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental evidence that chronic outgroup conflict reduces reproductive success in a cooperatively breeding fish</a></h4>

              
                Conflicts with conspecific outsiders are common in group-living species, from ants to primates, and are argued to be an important selective force in social evolution. However, whilst an extensive empirical literature exists on the behaviour exhibited during and immediately after interactions with rivals, only very few observational studies have considered the cumulative fitness consequences of outgroup conflict. Using a cooperatively breeding fish, the daffodil cichlid (<i>Neolamprologus pulcher</i>), we conducted the first experimental test of the effects of chronic outgroup conflict on reproductive investment and output. ‘Intruded’ groups received long-term simulated territorial intrusions by neighbours that generated consistent group-defence behaviour; matched ‘Control’ groups (each the same size and with the same neighbours as an Intruded group) received no intrusions in the same period. Intruded groups had longer inter-clutch intervals and produced eggs with increasingly less protein than Control groups. Despite the lower egg investment, Intruded groups provided more parental care and achieved similar hatching success to Control groups. Ultimately, however, Intruded groups had fewer and smaller surviving offspring than Control groups at 1-month post-hatching. We therefore provide experimental evidence that outgroup conflict can decrease fitness via cumulative effects on reproductive success, confirming the selective potential of this empirically neglected aspect of sociality.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning of probabilistic punishment as a model of anxiety produces changes in action but not punisher encoding in the dmPFC and VTA</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we developed a novel model for anxiety during motivated behavior by training rats to perform a task where actions executed to obtain a reward were probabilistically punished and observed that after learning, neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) represent the relationship between action and punishment risk (Park & Moghaddam, 2017). Here we used male and female rats to expand on the previous work by focusing on neural changes in the dmPFC and VTA that were associated with the learning of probabilistic punishment, and anxiolytic treatment with diazepam after learning. We find that adaptive neural responses of dmPFC and VTA during the learning of anxiogenic contingencies are independent from the punisher experience and occur primarily during the peri-action and reward period. Our results also identify peri-action ramping of VTA neural calcium activity, and VTA-dmPFC correlated activity, as potential markers for the anxiolytic properties of diazepam.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meggie - easy-to-use graphical user interface for M/EEG analysis based on MNE-python</a></h4>

              
                In the last decades, electrophysiological imaging methodology has seen many advances and the computational power in the neuroscience laboratories has steadily increased. Still, the new methodologies are unavailable for many. There is a need for more versatile analysis approaches for neuroscience specialists without a programming background. Using a software which provides standard pipelines, provides good default values for parameters, has a good multi-subject support, and stores the used analysis steps with the parameters in one place for reporting, is efficient and fast. In addition to enabling analysis for people without background in programming, it enables analysis for people with background in programming but a limited background in neuroscience. When constructed with care, the GUI may guide the researcher to apply analysis steps in correct order with reasonable default parameters. Two existing software, EEGLAB and Brainstorm, both provide an easy-to-use graphical user interface for end-to-end analysis for multiple subjects. The key difference to work presented here is the choice of language. The scientific community is moving en masse towards the python programming language, thus making it an ideal platform for extendable software. Another problem with Matlab is that it is not free - both from the perspective of open source and concrete monetary resources. Within the current trend towards increasing open science, covering data, analysis and reporting, the need for open source software is imperative. Meggie is an open source software for running MEG and EEG analysis with easy-to-use graphical user interface. It is written in Python 3, runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, and uses the MNE-python library under the hood to do heavy lifting. It is designed to allow end-to-end analysis of MEG and EEG datasets from multiple subjects with common sensor-level analysis steps such as preprocessing, epoching and averaging, spectral analysis and time-frequency analysis. Most of the analysis steps can be run for all the subjects in one go, and combining the results across subjects is made possible with grand averages. We have emphasized the extendibility of Meggie by implementing most of the Meggie itself as plugins, thus ensuring that new plugins have access to all necessary core features. Meggie answers the demand for easy-to-use and extendable python-based graphical user interface that provides an end-to-end analysis environment for M/EEG data analysis. It is freely available at https://github.com/cibr-jyu/meggie under the BSD license. Installation instructions, documentation and tutorials are found on that website.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Representations of Post-Decision Choice Confidence and Reward Expectation in the Caudate Nucleus and Frontal Eye Field</a></h4>

              
                Performance monitoring that supports ongoing behavioral adjustments is often examined in the context of either choice confidence for perceptual decisions (i.e., "did I get it right?") or reward expectation for reward-based decisions (i.e., "what reward will I receive?"). However, our understanding of how the brain encodes these distinct evaluative signals remains limited because they are easily conflated, particularly in commonly used two-alternative tasks with symmetric rewards for correct choices. Previously we reported behavioral and neural results related to decision formation by monkeys performing a visual motion discrimination task with asymmetric rewards (Doi et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020). Here we leveraged this task design to partially decouple trial-by-trial estimates of choice confidence and reward expectation and examine their impacts on behavior and their representations in the caudate nucleus (part of the striatum in the basal ganglia) and the frontal eye field (FEF, in prefrontal cortex). We found that these evaluative signals had infrequent, but consistent, effects on the behavior of well-trained monkeys. We also identified distinguishable representations of the two types of signals in FEF and caudate neurons, including different distribution patterns, time courses, and relationships to behavior in the two brain areas. These results suggest that the cortico-striatal decision network may use diverse evaluative signals for performance monitoring and add to our understanding of the different roles of the FEF and caudate nucleus in decision-related computations.

                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can noninvasively modulate behavior, cognition, and brain functions depending on polarity and dose of the stimulation as well as electrode montage. Concurrent tDCS-fMRI presents a novel way to explore the parameter space of non-invasive brain stimulation and to inform if a targeted brain region or a network of spatially distributed brain regions are engaged. In this study, a multi-electrode montage targeting nodal regions of the Arcuate Fasciculus Network (AFN) was compared to a single electrode montage and a no-stimulation control condition. Machine learning methods were applied to classify rs-fMRI data with the help of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) values into three different categories achieving an overall accuracy of 92% with the highest obtained for multi-electrode condition. The top 5 ROI pairs contributing towards the classification were identified using model performance parameters and were mainly within the right AFN. A proof-of-concept real-time feedback system to identify AFN engagement using DFC values to predict accuracy of stimulation electrode placement is proposed.

                Dravet Syndrome (DS) is mostly caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A (Nav1.1), thought to result in severe epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment due to reduced interneuron excitability. Recent studies in mouse models suggest that an interneuronopathy alone does not completely explain all the cellular and network impairments seen in DS. Here, we investigated the development of the intrinsic, synaptic, and network properties of CA1 pyramidal cells in a DS model prior to the appearance of overt seizures. We report that CA1 pyramidal cell development is disrupted by loss of Scn1a, and propose that this is explained by a period of reduced intrinsic excitability in early postnatal life, during which Scn1a is normally expressed in hippocampal pyramidal cells. We also use a novel ex vivo model of homeostatic plasticity to show an instability in homeostatic response during DS epileptogenesis. This study provides evidence for an important role of Scn1a haploinsufficiency in pyramidal cells in the pathophysiology of DS.

                Animals' choice behavior is characterized by two main tendencies: taking actions that led to rewards and repeating past actions. Theory suggests these strategies may be reinforced by different types of dopaminergic teaching signals: reward prediction error (RPE) to reinforce value-based associations and movement-based action prediction errors to reinforce value-free repetitive associations. Here we use an auditory-discrimination task in mice to show that movement-related dopamine activity in the tail of the striatum encodes the hypothesized action prediction error signal. Causal manipulations reveal that this prediction error serves as a value-free teaching signal that supports learning by reinforcing repeated associations. Computational modeling and experiments demonstrate that action prediction errors cannot support reward-guided learning but when paired with the RPE circuity they serve to consolidate stable sound-action associations in a value-free manner. Together we show that there are two types of dopaminergic prediction errors that work in tandem to support learning.

                The study of human brain connectivity, including structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC), provides insights into the neurophysiological mechanism of brain function and its relationship to human behavior and cognition. Both types of connectivity measurements provide crucial yet complementary information. However, integrating these two modalities into a single framework remains a challenge, because of the differences in their quantitative interdependencies as well as their anatomical representations due to distinctive imaging mechanisms. In this study, we introduced a new method, joint cmICA (connectivity matrix ICA), which provides a data-driven parcellation and automated-linking of SC and FC information simultaneously using a joint analysis of functional MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI data. We showed that these two connectivity modalities produce common cortical segregation, though with various degrees of (dis)similarity. Moreover, we show conjoint functional connectivity networks and structural white matter tracts that directly link these cortical parcellations/sources, within one analysis. Overall, data driven joint cmICA provides a new approach for integrating or fusing structural connectivity and functional connectivity systematically and conveniently, and provides an effective tool for connectivity-based multimodal data fusion in brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of human lateral prefrontal sulcal morphology and its relation to reasoning performance</a></h4>

              
                Previous findings show that the morphology of folds (sulci) of the human cerebral cortex flatten during postnatal development. However, previous studies did not consider the relationship between sulcal morphology and cognitive development in individual participants. Here, we fill this gap in knowledge by leveraging cross-sectional morphological neuroimaging data in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) from individual human participants (6-36 years old, males and females; N = 108; 3672 sulci), as well as longitudinal morphological and behavioral data from a subset of child and adolescent participants scanned at two timepoints (6-18 years old; N = 44; 2992 sulci). Manually defining thousands of sulci revealed that LPFC sulcal morphology (depth, surface area, gray matter thickness, and local gyrification index) differed between children (6-11 years old)/adolescents (11-18 years old) and young adults (22-36 years old) cross-sectionally, but only cortical thickness showed both cross-sectional differences between children and adolescents and presented longitudinal changes during childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, a data-driven approach relating morphology and cognition identified that longitudinal changes in cortical thickness of four rostral LPFC sulci predicted longitudinal changes in reasoning performance, a higher-level cognitive ability that relies on LPFC. Contrary to previous findings, these results suggest that sulci may flatten either after this time frame or over a longer longitudinal period of time than previously presented. Crucially, these results also suggest that longitudinal changes in the cortex within specific LPFC sulci are behaviorally meaningful, providing targeted structures, and areas of the cortex, for future neuroimaging studies examining the development of cognitive abilities.

Here we examined SRGAP2 protein-interaction network in developing synapses and identified catenin delta-2 (CTNND2) as a binding partner of human-specific SRGAP2C. CTNND2 is a cadherin-binding protein implicated in intellectual disability in the Cri-du-Chat syndrome, severe autism and epilepsy. Using sparse manipulations in upper layer cortical pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate that CTNND2 is an activity-limiting protein that coordinates synaptic excitation and inhibition and controls intrinsic excitability in juvenile mice. Later in adults, CTNND2 is required for long-term maintenance of dendritic spines. CTNND2 enrichment at excitatory synapses is enhanced by human-specific SRGAP2C. Thus, while loss of CTNND2 function accelerates synaptic development, causes overexcitation and homeostatic failure, its upregulation by SRGAP2C may contribute to synaptic neoteny in humans and protect against precocious synapse loss during aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vowel and formant representation in human auditory speech cortex</a></h4>

              
                Vowel sounds are a fundamental component of human speech across all languages. Vowels are cued acoustically by formants, the resonance frequencies determined by the shape of the vocal tract during speaking. An outstanding question in neurolinguistics is how the human brain processes vowel formants during speech perception. We used high-density intracranial recordings from the human speech cortex on the superior temporal gyrus (STG) while participants listened to natural continuous speech to address this question. We derived two-dimensional receptive fields based on the first and second formants to characterize tuning to vowel sounds. We found that neural activity at single STG sites was highly selective for particular zones in the formant space. Furthermore, this formant tuning shifted dynamically to adjust for speaker-specific spectral context. Despite this formant selectivity, local cortical responses were not sufficient to reliably discriminate between vowel categories. Instead, vowel category representations could be accurately decoded when using the entire population of formant encoding electrodes. Together, our results reveal that vowels are locally encoded in STG with complex acoustic tuning in two-dimensional formant space. As a population code this gives rise to phonological vowel perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-distance linguistic dependencies in Chinese and English brains</a></h4>

              
                Words can occur arbitrarily far away from where they contribute their meaning in a sentence. Two examples are WH-questions (WHQs), which begin with a WH-word like what and object-extracted relative clauses (ORCs), in which a noun is modified by a sentence-like grammatical unit. While these long-distance dependencies have been extensively studied, never before have their brain bases been examined from a multi-lingual, naturalistic perspective. This study fills this gap by analyzing WHQs and ORCs in fMRI data collected while 35 Chinese participants (15 females) and 49 English participants (30 females) listen to translation-equivalent stories. These languages exhibit radical typological differences in word order in these constructions. It remains unknown whether the brain basis for comprehension in these languages is similar or different. Separate general linear model analyses were performed and voxel-level intersections were calculated between the results to identify common regions of selectively increased activation during the comprehension of these linguistic constructions. Further Bayesian region of interest analyses probed whether common increases were truly similar. We found remarkable cross-linguistic commonality for both constructions. WHQs were associated with increased activation in the left middle and superior temporal lobe, left temporoparietal junction, left inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal lobe. ORCs were associated with increased activation in the left middle temporal lobe, left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral angular gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate, bilateral precuneus, and left medial frontal lobe. These results support the hypothesis that, regardless of form, the brain bases of higher-level language processing are uniform across languages.

	<p>The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (IA) leads to life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhage. Aside from well-established risk factors, recently published genome-wide association studies of IA revealed the strong association of a common variant near the endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) gene with IA risk. However, the role of EDNRA in the pathogenesis of IA remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a genetic modification within the EDNRA gene on IA pathogenesis in a novel in vivo model. Adult wild-type Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats (WT rats) and genetically modified rats (EDNRA rats) were used for the induction of IA using arterial hypertension (HT). Animals were stratified into four groups: WT rats without (WT_CTL) and with induction of HT (WT + HT), as well as EDNRA rats without (EDNRA_CTL) and with induction of HT (EDNRA + HT). Blood pressure (BP) was observed for 12 weeks. After the observation period, cerebral arteries were analyzed for morphological (i.e., aneurysmal) changes as well as histological and functional changes by immunofluorescence and functional investigation. In the groups of rats with induction of HT, BP was higher in EDNRA + HT compared with that in WT + HT. No IAs were observed in WT_CTL and EDNRA_CTL but were found in WT + HT and EDNRA + HT. There was no histological difference in the immunofluorescence of EDNRA between all groups. Contractility and potency of endothelin-1 differed between the groups in functional investigation. In summary, we created a new model that is suitable for further studies for better understanding of the role of EDNRA in IA pathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Neurofeedback (NF) is a type of biofeedback in which an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain activity is measured and presented to them to support self-regulation of ongoing brain oscillations and achieve specific behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. NF training induces changes in neurophysiological circuits that are associated with behavioral changes. Recent evidence suggests that the NF technique can be used to train electrical brain activity and facilitate learning among children with learning disorders. Toward this aim, this review first presents a generalized model for NF systems, and then studies involving NF training for children with disorders such as dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other specific learning disorders such as dyscalculia and dysgraphia are reviewed. The discussion elaborates on the potential for translational applications of NF in educational and learning settings with details. This review also addresses some issues concerning the role of NF in education, and it concludes with some solutions and future directions. In order to provide the best learning environment for children with ADHD and other learning disorders, it is critical to better understand the role of NF in educational settings. The review provides the potential challenges of the current systems to aid in highlighting the issues undermining the efficacy of current systems and identifying solutions to address them. The review focuses on the use of NF technology in education for the development of adaptive teaching methods and the best learning environment for children with learning disabilities.</p>

	<p>Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR), a postoperative complication that occurs in elderly patients, still lacks effective treatment. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) has been proved to modulate neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity, among other effects, but the role of IL-33 in dNCR is not clear. We established a dNCR model in aged mice by laparotomy under sevoflurane anesthesia. Cognition was evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) and fear conditioning test (FCT). Immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of IL-33 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) co-localization, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) co-localization in the hippocampus. IL-33, GFAP, vGlut1 and PSD95 were tested by Western blotting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;) and IL-10. Surgery/anesthesia reduced the level of IL-33 in the hippocampus. Intraperitoneal injection of 200 ng IL-33 per mouse significantly decreased the latency to the platform and increased the number of platform crossings and the target quadrant dwell time in MWM, while increasing the freezing time in the context test of FCT. Furthermore, IL-33 inhibited microglial activation and the release of TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; while upregulating the markers of excitatory synapses vGlut1 and PSD95. Our findings indicated that IL-33 improved cognition by inhibiting the hippocampal inflammatory response and upregulating the number of excitatory synapses. Therefore, IL-33 is a potential drug for the treatment of dNCR.</p>

	<p>Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method of noninvasive and painless stimulation of the nervous system, which is based on Faraday&amp;amp;rsquo;s law of electromagnetic induction. Over the past twenty years, the TMS technique has been deployed as a tool for the diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in the treatment of mental disorders (e.g., depression). Methods: We tested the inhibitory effects of repetitive TMS (rTMS) on reaction times to militarily relevant visual stimuli amidst distractors and on accompanying blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 20 healthy people. rTMS was applied over the visual cortices, V1, on both hemispheres with the inhibitory theta burst paradigm with the intensity of 70% of the active motor threshold fMRI in 20 healthy people. Results: Analysis of the reaction time to visual stimuli after using TMS to the V1 visual cortex revealed an increase in the number of incorrect recognitions, and the reaction time was from 843 to 910 ms. In the subgroup of participants (n = 15), after the stimulation, there were significant reductions of BOLD signal in blood flow within V1 cortices. Conclusions: The studies of reaction times after the rTMS revealed the inhibitory effect of rTMS on the reaction times and recognition performance of significant (military) objects in the visual field.</p>

	<p>Animal models play a central role in all areas of biomedical research. The similarities in anatomical structure and physiological characteristics shared by non-human primates (NHPs) and humans make NHPs ideal models with which to study human disorders, such as cerebral palsy (CP). However, the methodologies for systematically evaluating NHP models of CP have rarely been assessed, despite the long history of using NHP models to understand CP. Such models should be evaluated using multidisciplinary approaches prior to being used to research the diagnosis and treatment of CP. In this study, we evaluated rhesus macaque CP models established by partial resection of the motor cortex and intrathecal injection of bilirubin. Abnormal posture, motor dysfunction, gross and fine motor behavior, and muscular tension were evaluated, and changes in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia were observed using 9.4 T magnetic resonance imaging. The results clearly demonstrated the utility of the established evaluation methodology for assessing CP models. This model evaluation methodology may guide researchers through the model building process.</p>

	<p>Background: Anti-tumor immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors induces several immune-related adverse events. Camrelizumab-related isolate abducens neuritis is rare. Case presentation: We report on a 67-year-old man with esophageal cancer who presented with acute-onset isolated right abducens cranial nerve palsy after ten cycles of Camrelizumab treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed thickening and post-contrast enhancement at the cisternal segment of the right abducens nerve. The diagnosis was immune-related abducens neuritis caused by Camrelizumab. We put him on oral taper corticoids (methylprednisone) for neuritis treatment without Camrelizumab suspension. One month after treatment, he recovered completely. At the last follow-up, one year after the onset of diplopia, the patient was in good condition without neurological symptom recurrence. Conclusion: Abducens neuritis is a rare immune-related adverse outcome of Camrelizumab. The present case proves the efficacy and safety of using corticoids in the treatment of abducens neuritis.</p>

	<p>The elderly have an elevated risk of clinical depression because of isolation from family and friends and a reticence to report their emotional states. The present study explored whether data from a commercial neuroscience platform could predict low mood and low energy in members of a retirement community. Neurophysiologic data were collected continuously for three weeks at 1Hz and averaged into hourly and daily measures, while mood and energy were captured with self-reports. Two neurophysiologic measures averaged over a day predicted low mood and low energy with 68% and 75% accuracy. Principal components analysis showed that neurologic variables were statistically associated with mood and energy two days in advance. Applying machine learning to hourly data classified low mood and low energy with 99% and 98% accuracy. Two-day lagged hourly neurophysiologic data predicted low mood and low energy with 98% and 96% accuracy. This study demonstrates that continuous measurement of neurophysiologic variables may be an effective way to reduce the incidence of mood disorders in vulnerable people by identifying when interventions are needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medication-related burden among Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronically progressing inflammatory disease having articular, extra-articular, and systemic manifestations of unclear origin. Medication-related burden (MRB) is a novel concept that focuses on unpleasant feelings associated with the therapeutic process. The purpose of this research was to examine MRB among Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the patient's viewpoint. Methods: The present research was a cross-sectional study conducted on patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had previously been diagnosed and visited Baghdad Teaching Hospital/Medical City/Rheumatology department between December 2021 through March 2022. The Living with Medicines Questionnaire was used to assess MRB (LMQ). Results: The study recruited 250 RA patients. The average age of the patients was 47.29± 12.72 years. The vast majority were women, 80.8%. The mean LMQ score was 113.78± 13.95. Most participants experienced a moderate degree of burden of 72.0%, followed by a minimum commitment of 24.4%, a high burden of 2.8%, and no burden of 0.8%, with no patient experiencing a high burden of 0 %. Women had significantly higher medication-related burdens (total LMQ). RA patients with more than five chronic medications had substantially higher MRB than those with fewer scheduled medications. Patients with chronic diseases (other than RA) had significantly higher MRB than those without other chronic diseases. The total LMQ score had a significant positive correlation with the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) value. In other words, when disease severity increases, the MRB increases. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the RA patients involved in the current study have experienced MRB. Female sex, polypharmacy, comorbidities, and more severe disease are associated with more MRB.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acute effects of cigarette smoke on Endothelial Nitric Oxide synthase, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and aortic intima media thickness [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background. Cigarette smoking could induce endothelial dysfunction and the increase of circulating markers of inflammation by activation of monocytes. This can lead to increased intima media thickness (IMT) of entire blood vessels and result in acceleration of the atherosclerosis process. However, to our knowledge, little is known about the role of cigarette smoking in this atherosclerotic inflammatory process. The aim of this study is to explore the link between cigarette smoking and its effect on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Methods. An experimental study with a post-test only controlled group design was used. We used 18 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) randomly subdivided into two groups: group K (-) were not exposed to tobacco smoke, whereas group K (+) were exposed to smoke equivalent of more than 40 cigarettes for 28 days daily. After 28 days, samples were analyzed for e-NOS, VCAM-1 and aortic IMT. Results. Our results indicate that tobacco smoke can enhance the expression of VCAM-1 on rat cardiac vascular endothelial cells, resulting in a decreased expression of e-NOS level and increase of aortic IMT. Linear regression model found that eNOS level negatively correlated wiith aortic IMT (r2 = 0.584, β = -0.764, p < 0.001), whereas VCAM-1 expression did not correlate with aortic IMT (r2 = 0.197, p = 0.065). Conclusion. Low e-NOS level and high VCAM-1 level observed  after cigarette smoke exposure which may increase aortic IMT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Sarcoidosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease with multisystem involvement and can present with vague symptoms, so the degree of suspicion should be high. Sarcoidosis has a wide range of clinical symptoms, owing to its multisystem involvement. The lungs, peripheral lymphatics, skin, liver, eye, spleen, bone, salivary glands, joints, and heart are the most commonly involved organ systems pathologically. Sarcoidosis often manifests in the fourth decade of life, but it might occasionally manifest in later years. We present a case of 69-year-old woman who initially complained of generalized weakness, fatigue, and joint pain which later progressed to pulmonary and cutaneous symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and skin nodules. Examination revealed right cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral basal crackles in lungs, non-tender nodules over the dorsum of bilateral forearm and hand along with erythema nodosum on bilateral legs. Chest radiograph and computed tomography scans were typical of sarcoidosis. Biopsy of the lymph node revealed noncaseating granuloma and serum angiotensinogen converting enzyme level was raised. Treatment was started with 40 mg prednisolone daily and tapered over a year. The patient had clinical and radiological improvement over the duration of therapy and was on regular follow-up with routine investigations. Clinically, the patient is doing well at follow-up. A high degree of suspicion, familiarity with imaging features, and prompt treatment in selected cases may help in diagnosing, evaluating the extent of disease, and guiding optimal health care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours about gender equality: a cross-sectional survey of adolescents from rural India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gender equality is a fundamental human right and vital to accelerate global progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adolescents’ involvement is essential to achieve such equality and SDGs to develop peaceful sustainable societies. However, there are limited data especially from developing countries such as India to plan gender equality related programmes targeted at adolescents. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess gender equality related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours among 16 to 19 year-old adolescents from sixty villages of the Maharashtra state of India. Results: Data from 1306 respondents (667 females and 639 males) showed a mean score of 30 out of 44, suggesting an overall moderate gender equality score in rural adolescents. The majority of girls (68.3%) were in the high scoring group, whereas the majority of boys were in the moderate group (60.3%). Regression analysis showed that responses from boys were associated with lower scores compared to responses from girls by five points (adjusted β-coefficient: -4.99, 95%CI: -5.85 to -4.12, p<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need to involve adolescents with a major focus on boys to improve gender equality in rural areas of Maharashtra. This will help introduce concepts of equality from an early age to educate boys, empower girls, and address gender-based discrimination and violence against girls and women.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Excitatory and inhibitory effects of HCN channel modulation on excitability of layer V pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tuomo Mäki-Marttunen, Verónica Mäki-Marttunen</p>

Dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells are densely populated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, a.k.a. <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels. <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels are targeted by multiple neuromodulatory pathways, and thus are one of the key ion-channel populations regulating the pyramidal cell activity. Previous observations and theories attribute opposing effects of the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels on neuronal excitability due to their mildly hyperpolarized reversal potential. These effects are difficult to measure experimentally due to the fine spatiotemporal landscape of the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> activity in the dendrites, but computational models provide an efficient tool for studying this question in a reduced but generalizable setting. In this work, we build upon existing biophysically detailed models of thick-tufted layer V pyramidal cells and model the effects of over- and under-expression of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels as well as their neuromodulation. We show that <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels facilitate the action potentials of layer V pyramidal cells in response to proximal dendritic stimulus while they hinder the action potentials in response to distal dendritic stimulus at the apical dendrite. We also show that the inhibitory action of the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels in layer V pyramidal cells is due to the interactions between <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels and a hot zone of low voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the apical dendrite. Our simulations suggest that a combination of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-enhancing neuromodulation at the proximal part of the apical dendrite and <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-inhibiting modulation at the distal part of the apical dendrite can increase the layer V pyramidal excitability more than either of the two alone. Our analyses uncover the effects of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-channel neuromodulation of layer V pyramidal cells at a single-cell level and shed light on how these neurons integrate information and enable higher-order functions of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In the Body’s Eye: The computational anatomy of interoceptive inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Micah Allen, Andrew Levy, Thomas Parr, Karl J. Friston</p>

A growing body of evidence highlights the intricate linkage of exteroceptive perception to the rhythmic activity of the visceral body. In parallel, interoceptive inference theories of affective perception and self-consciousness are on the rise in cognitive science. However, thus far no formal theory has emerged to integrate these twin domains; instead, most extant work is conceptual in nature. Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and uncertainty. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to affective behaviour. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt affective expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate biases in perceptual uncertainty. Through synthetic heart-rate variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal-priors and visceral prediction errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers a roadmap for computationally phenotyping disordered brain-body interaction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An integrative systems biology approach to overcome venetoclax resistance in acute myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle Przedborski, David Sharon, Severine Cathelin, Steven Chan, Mohammad Kohandel</p>

The over-expression of the Bcl-2 protein is a common feature of many solid cancers and hematological malignancies, and it is typically associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Bcl-2-specific inhibitors, such as venetoclax, have recently been approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma, and they are showing promise in clinical trials as a targeted therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, successful treatment of AML with Bcl-2-specific inhibitors is often followed by the rapid development of drug resistance. An emerging paradigm for overcoming drug resistance in cancer treatment is through the targeting of mitochondrial energetics and metabolism. In AML in particular, it was recently observed that inhibition of mitochondrial translation via administration of the antibiotic tedizolid significantly affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, activating the integrated stress response (ISR) and subsequently sensitizing drug-resistant AML cells to venetoclax. Here we develop an integrative systems biology approach to acquire a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this process, and in particular, of the specific role of the ISR in the commitment of cells to apoptosis. Our multi-scale mathematical model couples the ISR to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in venetoclax-resistant AML cells, includes the metabolic effects of treatment, and integrates RNA, protein level, and cellular viability data. Using the mathematical model, we identify the dominant mechanisms by which ISR activation helps to overcome venetoclax resistance, and we study the temporal sequencing of combination treatment to determine the most efficient and robust combination treatment protocol.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Strong evidence for the adaptive walk model of gene evolution in Drosophila and Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana Filipa Moutinho, Adam Eyre-Walker, Julien Y. Dutheil</p>

Understanding the dynamics of species adaptation to their environments has long been a central focus of the study of evolution. Theories of adaptation propose that populations evolve by “walking” in a fitness landscape. This “adaptive walk” is characterised by a pattern of diminishing returns, where populations further away from their fitness optimum take larger steps than those closer to their optimal conditions. Hence, we expect young genes to evolve faster and experience mutations with stronger fitness effects than older genes because they are further away from their fitness optimum. Testing this hypothesis, however, constitutes an arduous task. Young genes are small, encode proteins with a higher degree of intrinsic disorder, are expressed at lower levels, and are involved in species-specific adaptations. Since all these factors lead to increased protein evolutionary rates, they could be masking the effect of gene age. While controlling for these factors, we used population genomic data sets of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Drosophila</i> and estimated the rate of adaptive substitutions across genes from different phylostrata. We found that a gene’s evolutionary age significantly impacts the molecular rate of adaptation. Moreover, we observed that substitutions in young genes tend to have larger physicochemical effects. Our study, therefore, provides strong evidence that molecular evolution follows an adaptive walk model across a large evolutionary timescale.

                <p>by Vira Kravets, JaeAnn M. Dwulet, Wolfgang E. Schleicher, David J. Hodson, Anna M. Davis, Laura Pyle, Robert A. Piscopio, Maura Sticco-Ivins, Richard K. P. Benninger</p>

Insulin-secreting β-cells are functionally heterogeneous. Whether there exist cells driving the first-phase calcium response in individual islets, has not been examined. We examine “first responder” cells, defined by the earliest [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] response during first-phase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevation, distinct from previously identified “hub” and “leader” cells. We used islets isolated from Mip-Cre<sup>ER</sup>; Rosa-Stop-Lox-Stop-GCamP6s mice (β-GCamP6s) that show β-cell-specific GCamP6s expression following tamoxifen-induced CreER-mediated recombination. First responder cells showed characteristics of high membrane excitability and lower electrical coupling to their neighbors. The first-phase response time of β-cells in the islet was spatially organized, dependent on the cell’s distance to the first responder cell, and consistent over time up to approximately 24 h. When first responder cells were laser ablated, the first-phase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was slowed down, diminished, and discoordinated compared to random cell ablation. Cells that were next earliest to respond often took over the role of the first responder upon ablation. In summary, we discover and characterize a distinct first responder β-cell state, critical for the islet first-phase response to glucose.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ACE2-containing defensosomes serve as decoys to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Krystal L. Ching, Maren de Vries, Juan Gago, Kristen Dancel-Manning, Joseph Sall, William J. Rice, Clea Barnett, Alireza Khodadadi-Jamayran, Aristotelis Tsirigos, Feng-Xia Liang, Lorna E. Thorpe, Bo Shopsin, Leopoldo N. Segal, Meike Dittmann, Victor J. Torres, Ken Cadwell</p>

Extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, exosomes, mediate intercellular communication by transporting substrates with a variety of functions related to tissue homeostasis and disease. Their diagnostic and therapeutic potential has been recognized for diseases such as cancer in which signaling defects are prominent. However, it is unclear to what extent exosomes and their cargo inform the progression of infectious diseases. We recently defined a subset of exosomes termed defensosomes that are mobilized during bacterial infection in a manner dependent on autophagy proteins. Through incorporating protein receptors on their surface, defensosomes mediated host defense by binding and inhibiting pore-forming toxins secreted by bacterial pathogens. Given this capacity to serve as decoys that interfere with surface protein interactions, we investigated the role of defensosomes during infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consistent with a protective function, exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor ACE2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with reduced intensive care unit (ICU) and hospitalization times. We found ACE2+ exosomes were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of viral sensors in cell culture, which required the autophagy protein ATG16L1, defining these as defensosomes. We further demonstrate that ACE2+ defensosomes directly bind and block viral entry. These findings suggest that defensosomes may contribute to the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 and expand our knowledge on the regulation and effects of extracellular vesicles during infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cytoskeletal vimentin regulates cell size and autophagy through mTORC1 signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ponnuswamy Mohanasundaram, Leila S. Coelho-Rato, Mayank Kumar Modi, Marta Urbanska, Franziska Lautenschläger, Fang Cheng, John E. Eriksson</p>

The nutrient-activated mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1) signaling pathway determines cell size by controlling mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Here, we show that vimentin, a cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein that we have known to be important for wound healing and cancer progression, determines cell size through mTORC1 signaling, an effect that is also manifested at the organism level in mice. This vimentin-mediated regulation is manifested at all levels of mTOR downstream target activation and protein synthesis. We found that vimentin maintains normal cell size by supporting mTORC1 translocation and activation by regulating the activity of amino acid sensing Rag GTPase. We also show that vimentin inhibits the autophagic flux in the absence of growth factors and/or critical nutrients, demonstrating growth factor-independent inhibition of autophagy at the level of mTORC1. Our findings establish that vimentin couples cell size and autophagy through modulating Rag GTPase activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Preservation of heritage buildings in Alexandria, Egypt: an application of heritage digitisation process phases and new documentation methods [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Throughout the history of the city, the architecture of Alexandria, Egypt, has been in contact with world cultures, especially those of the Mediterranean sphere. Alexandria is rich with cultural features dating back seven thousand years. In Alexandria, the heritage value of the city has decreased because there is no suitable documentation system for these more recent assets. The development of a new technique for preserving heritage buildings is required. For example, image- based techniques can gather data using photography, panoramic photography, and close-range photogrammetry. In this research, we primarily seek to implement Heritage Digitisation Process Phases (HDPP) and establish new documentation methods in architectural conservation and built-heritage preservation, i.e., Virtual Reality (VR) and Website Heritage Documentation (WHD). Methods: The methodology is designed to preserve and manage cultural heritage using HDPP for the promotion of heritage building preservation in Alexandria. Results: The results show that the application of HDPP has led to the creation of a digital database about the Société Immobilière building, which was chosen as a case study for this research. Conclusions: Implementation of HDPP and usage of new documentation methods i.e., VR and WHD create a digital path to help strengthen its image and connect the place to users, recreational areas are created to communicate and explore the city’s architectural history.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The use of consultation on Incontinence Questioner – Nocturia (ICIQ-N) in Indonesian population: an affirmation study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nocturia is a urological condition in which individuals urinate more frequently than usual at night and it affects both genders. The clinician frequently uses questionnaires to diagnose nocturia however, some validated questions were in English. This study evaluated the validity of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire – Nocturia (ICIQ-N) in Indonesian patients. Methods: Two certified bilinguals (English-Indonesian) translated the ICIQ-N questionnaire from English to Indonesian. The reverse translation was done by two certified bilingual (Indonesian-English) translators, and the writers reviewed all of the translations leading to the final Indonesian translation. Instead of a linguistic translation, this technique ensured a thorough and unambiguous intellectual translation. The translated ICIQ-N was presented twice to the subjects, two weeks apart, to verify the questionnaire. The responses' validity and reliability were then investigated. Pearson and Cronbach’s alpha analysis were used to determine validity and reliability. Results: The r-Pearson correlation values ranged from 0.933 to 1 (p:0.001). The translated ICIQ-N questioner items were found to be reliable with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.994 (>0.6). Conclusions: The ICIQ-N Indonesian version generated for this study is valid and reliable. As a result, it may be utilized as a diagnostic tool in Indonesian population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ENA Source Attribute Helper: An Application Programming Interface to facilitate accurate reference to biological source data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metadata attributes of sequences that accurately reference their biological sources, as specimens or other materials of origin, and link with natural history collections, are essential to facilitate the connections between different fields in life sciences and promote reusability of data. However, metadata used to reference the biological source of sequences available within the molecular data repositories are not always well structured or comprehensive. Methods: Within the scope of the Horizon 2020 project Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge Library (BiCIKL), we have developed a tool, the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) Source Attribute Helper Application Programming Interface (API), to help users accurately report biological source-related sequence and sample attributes. This tool currently focuses on the attributes in which specimens, cultures or other materials are identified, from which the sequence data were derived, and uses curated data to obtain the unique codes for the institutions and collections holding the vouchers. The API's main functions include the presentation of metadata associated with queried institutions or collections, validation of institution and collection codes in the attribute strings provided by the user, and the construction of an attribute string based on user-entered data. The API does not however support the search of voucher specimen codes, as these need to be obtained directly from the voucher institutions. We describe the API and discuss use cases for its different endpoints. The API is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/sah/api/. Conclusions: We expect the API to promote and support the initial submission and any subsequent curation of biological source attributes, and hereby contribute to better links between sequence data and natural history collections, and hence on to taxonomy and biodiversity research, towards increasing the discoverability, reusability and impact of data.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuroprotection of Low Frequency Repetitive TMS after Ischemic Stroke in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. Effective early treatments with reasonable therapeutic windows remain critically important to improve the outcomes of stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an established non-invasive technique that has been applied clinically and in animal research for multiple brain disorders, but few studies examined acute neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. The present investigation tested the novel approach of low frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) as an acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adult male rats received a focal ischemic surgery through occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 60 min. The rats received either rTMS or sham treatment with 1.5, 3, 4, or 7 hrs delay after the onset of stroke. Low frequency and low intensity rTMS was applied to the rat brain for two 30-min episodes separated by 1-hr interval.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three days after stroke, compared to stroke controls, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5 hr-delay showed a 35% reduction of infarct volume. Protective effects were also seen with 3- or 4-hr delayed treatments by rTMS, shown as reduced infarct volume and cell death. RTMS treatment upregulated the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and downregulated the pro-apoptotic caspase-3 cleavage, expressions of Bax and MMP-9. In sensorimotor functional assessments 3-21 days after stroke, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5- or 3-hr delay showed significantly better performance compared to stroke controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the inference that low frequency rTMS may be feasible as a neuroprotective acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mimicry of embryonic circulation enhances the hoxa hemogenic niche and human blood development</a></h4>

              
                The manufacturing of transplantable hematopoietic stem cells from human pluripotent stem cell lines for clinical therapies remains elusive. Li et al. show that a microfluidic device mimicking embryonic circulation or orbital-shaker-culture-enhanced formation of the HOXA hemogenic niche, which gives rise to aortic and multipotent hematopoietic precursor cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Megasatellite formation and evolution in vertebrate genes</a></h4>

              
                Descorps-Declère and Richard perform a genome-wide analysis of megasatellites in 58 vertebrate genomes. They find that they are enriched in subtelomeric regions and frequently encode proteins involved in cell wall homeostasis. Accumulation of mutations within intronic regions partially erases old megasatellites that can only be detected in exons.

                Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) has become a standard non-invasive technique to induce offline changes in cortical excitability in human volunteers. Yet, TBS suffers from a high variability across subjects. A better knowledge about how TBS affects neural activity in vivo could uncover its mechanisms of action and ultimately allow its mainstream use in basic science and clinical applications. To address this issue, we applied continuous TBS (cTBS, 300 pulses) in awake behaving rhesus monkeys and quantified its after-effects on neuronal activity. Overall, we observed a pronounced, long-lasting, and highly reproducible reduction in neuronal excitability after cTBS in individual parietal neurons, with some neurons also exhibiting periods of hyperexcitability during the recovery phase. These results provide the first experimental evidence of the effects of cTBS on single neurons in awake behaving monkeys, shedding new light on the reasons underlying cTBS variability.

                <i>Plasmodium falciparum,</i> the causative agent of malaria, remains a global health threat as parasites continue to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs used throughout the world. Accordingly, drugs with novel modes of action are desperately required to combat malaria. <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites infect human red blood cells where they digest the host’s main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase <i>Pf</i>A-M17 is one of several aminopeptidases that have been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway. Here, we use both reverse genetics and a compound specifically designed to inhibit the activity of <i>Pf</i>A-M17 to show that <i>Pf</i>A-M17 is essential for <i>P. falciparum</i> survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are highly likely to originate from hemoglobin. We further show that loss of <i>Pf</i>A-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage. In contrast to other hemoglobin-degrading proteases that have overlapping redundant functions, we validate <i>Pf</i>A-M17 as a potential novel drug target.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Controllability boosts neural and cognitive signatures of changes-of-mind in uncertain environments</a></h4>

              
                In uncertain environments, seeking information about alternative choice options is essential for adaptive learning and decision-making. However, information seeking is usually confounded with changes-of-mind about the reliability of the preferred option. Here, we exploited the fact that information seeking requires control over which option to sample to isolate its behavioral and neurophysiological signatures. We found that changes-of-mind occurring with control require more evidence against the current option, are associated with reduced confidence, but are nevertheless more likely to be confirmed on the next decision. Multimodal neurophysiological recordings showed that these changes-of-mind are preceded by stronger activation of the dorsal attention network in magnetoencephalography, and followed by increased pupil-linked arousal during the presentation of decision outcomes. Together, these findings indicate that information seeking increases the saliency of evidence perceived as the direct consequence of one’s own actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid transgenerational adaptation in response to intercropping reduces competition</a></h4>

              
                By capitalising on positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, intercropping provides opportunities to improve agricultural sustainability. Intercropping is generally implemented using commercial seeds that were bred for maximal productivity in monocultures, thereby ignoring the ability of plants to adapt over generations to the surrounding neighbourhood, notably through increased complementarity, i.e. reduced competition or increased facilitation. This is why using monoculture-adapted seeds for intercropping might limit the benefits of crop diversity on yield. However, the adaptation potential of crops and the corresponding changes in complementarity have not been explored in annual crop systems. Here we show that plant-plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations. Total yield did not respond to this common coexistence history, but in fertilized conditions, we observed increased overyielding in mixtures with a common coexistence history. Surprisingly, we observed character convergence between species sharing the same coexistence history for two generations, in monocultures but also in mixtures: the six crop species tested converged towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content. This study provides the first empirical evidence for the potential of parental diversity affecting plant-plant interactions, species complementarity and therefore potentially ecosystem functioning of the following generations in annual cropping systems. Although further studies are required to assess the context-dependence of these results, our findings may still have important implications for diversified agriculture as they illustrate the potential of targeted cultivars to increase complementarity of species in intercropping, which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BRCA2 BRC missense variants disrupt RAD51-dependent DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene predispose to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and other cancers. BRCA2 maintains genome stability through homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication fork protection. Nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to truncation of the BRCA2 protein are typically considered pathogenic, however, missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions can be challenging to functionally interpret. The majority of missense mutations in BRCA2 have been classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) with unknown functional consequences. In this study, we identified three BRCA2 VUS located within the BRC repeat region to determine their impact on canonical HDR and fork protection functions. We provide evidence that S1221P and T1980I, which map to conserved residues in the BRC2 and BRC7 repeats, compromise the cellular response to chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation, and display deficits in fork protection. We further demonstrate biochemically that S1221P and T1980I disrupt RAD51 binding and diminish the ability of BRCA2 to stabilize RAD51-ssDNA complexes. The third variant, T1346I, located within the spacer region between BRC2 and BRC3 repeats, is fully functional. We conclude that T1346I is a benign allele whereas S1221P and T1980I are hypomorphic disrupting the ability of BRCA2 to fully engage and stabilize RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Our results underscore the importance of correctly classifying BRCA2 VUS as pathogenic variants can impact both future cancer risk and guide therapy selection during cancer treatment.

                Physician-scientists have epitomized the blending of deep, rigorous impactful curiosity with broad attention to human health for centuries. While we aspire to prepare all physicians with an appreciation for these skills, those who apply them to push the understanding of the boundaries of human physiology and disease, to advance treatments, and to increase our knowledge base in the arena of human health can fulfill an essential space for our society, economies, and overall well-being. Working arm in arm with basic and translational scientists as well as expert clinicians, as peers in both groups, this career additionally serves as a bridge to facilitate the pace and direction of research that ultimately impacts health. Globally, there are remarkable similarities in challenges in this career path, and in the approaches employed to overcome them. Herein, we review how different countries train physician-scientists and suggest strategies to further bolster this career path.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Isometric spiracular scaling in scarab beetles: implications for diffusive and advective oxygen transport</a></h4>

              
                The scaling of respiratory structures has been hypothesized to be a major driving factor in the evolution of many aspects of animal physiology. Here we provide the first assessment of the scaling of the spiracles in insects using ten scarab beetle species differing 180x in mass, including some of the most massive extant insect species. Using X-ray microtomography, we measured the cross-sectional area and depth of all eight spiracles, enabling the calculation of their diffusive and advective capacities. Each of these metrics scaled with geometric isometry. Because diffusive capacities scale with lower slopes than metabolic rates, the largest beetles measured require 10-fold higher PO2 gradients across the spiracles to sustain metabolism by diffusion compared to the smallest species. Large beetles can exchange sufficient oxygen for resting metabolism by diffusion across the spiracles, but not during flight. In contrast, spiracular advective capacities scale similarly or more steeply than metabolic rates, so spiracular advective capacities should match or exceed respiratory demands in the largest beetles. These data illustrate a general principle of gas exchange: scaling of respiratory transport structures with geometric isometry diminishes the potential for diffusive gas exchange but enhances advective capacities; combining such structural scaling with muscle-driven ventilation allows larger animals to achieve high metabolic rates when active.

                Gap-junctional signaling mediates myriad cellular interactions in metazoans. Yet, how gap junctions control the positioning of cells in organs is not well understood. Innexins compose gap junctions in invertebrates and affect organ architecture. Here, we investigate the roles of gap-junctions in controlling distal somatic gonad architecture and its relationship to underlying germline stem cells in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that a reduction of soma–germline gap-junctional activity causes displacement of distal sheath cells (Sh1) towards the distal end of the gonad. We confirm, by live imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and antibody staining, that bare regions—lacking somatic gonadal cell coverage of germ cells—are present between the distal tip cell (DTC) and Sh1, and we show that an innexin fusion protein used in a prior study encodes an antimorphic gap junction subunit that mispositions Sh1. We determine that, contrary to the model put forth in the prior study based on this fusion protein, Sh1 mispositioning does not markedly alter the position of the borders of the stem cell pool nor of the progenitor cell pool. Together, these results demonstrate that gap junctions can control the position of Sh1, but that Sh1 position is neither relevant for GLP-1/Notch signaling nor for the exit of germ cells from the stem cell pool.

                The rapid development of new imaging approaches is generating larger and more complex datasets, revealing the time evolution of individual cells and biomolecules. Single-molecule techniques, in particular, provide access to rare intermediates in complex, multistage molecular pathways. However, few standards exist for processing these information-rich datasets, posing challenges for wider dissemination. Here, we present Mars, an open-source platform for storing and processing image-derived properties of biomolecules. Mars provides Fiji/ImageJ2 commands written in Java for common single-molecule analysis tasks using a Molecule Archive architecture that is easily adapted to complex, multistep analysis workflows. Three diverse workflows involving molecule tracking, multichannel fluorescence imaging, and force spectroscopy, demonstrate the range of analysis applications. A comprehensive graphical user interface written in JavaFX enhances biomolecule feature exploration by providing charting, tagging, region highlighting, scriptable dashboards, and interactive image views. The interoperability of ImageJ2 ensures Molecule Archives can easily be opened in multiple environments, including those written in Python using PyImageJ, for interactive scripting and visualization. Mars provides a flexible solution for reproducible analysis of image-derived properties, facilitating the discovery and quantitative classification of new biological phenomena with an open data format accessible to everyone.

                Low complexity regions (LCRs) play a role in a variety of important biological processes, yet we lack a unified view of their sequences, features, relationships, and functions. Here, we use dotplots and dimensionality reduction to systematically define LCR type/copy relationships and create a map of LCR sequence space capable of integrating LCR features and functions. By defining LCR relationships across the proteome, we provide insight into how LCR type and copy number contribute to higher order assemblies, such as the importance of K-rich LCR copy number for assembly of the nucleolar protein RPA43 in vivo and in vitro. With LCR maps, we reveal the underlying structure of LCR sequence space, and relate differential occupancy in this space to the conservation and emergence of higher order assemblies, including the metazoan extracellular matrix and plant cell wall. Together, LCR relationships and maps uncover and identify scaffold-client relationships among E-rich LCR-containing proteins in the nucleolus, and revealed previously undescribed regions of LCR sequence space with signatures of higher order assemblies, including a teleost-specific T/H-rich sequence space. Thus, this unified view of LCRs enables discovery of how LCRs encode higher order assemblies of organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of anterior insular cortex inputs to dorsolateral striatum in binge alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                How does binge drinking alcohol change synaptic function, and do these changes maintain binge consumption? The anterior insular cortex (AIC) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are brain regions implicated in alcohol use disorder. In male, but not female mice, we found that binge drinking alcohol produced glutamatergic synaptic adaptations selective to AIC inputs within the DLS. Photoexciting AIC→DLS circuitry in male mice during binge drinking decreased alcohol, but not water consumption and altered alcohol drinking mechanics. Further, drinking mechanics alone from drinking session data predicted alcohol-related circuit changes. AIC→DLS manipulation did not alter operant, valence, or anxiety-related behaviors. These findings suggest that alcohol-mediated changes at AIC inputs govern behavioral sequences that maintain binge drinking and may serve as a circuit-based biomarker for the development of alcohol use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the HOPS tethering complex, a lysosomal membrane fusion machinery</a></h4>

              
                Lysosomes are essential for cellular recycling, nutrient signaling, autophagy, and pathogenic bacteria and viruses invasion. Lysosomal fusion is fundamental to cell survival and requires HOPS, a conserved heterohexameric tethering complex. On the membranes to be fused, HOPS binds small membrane-associated GTPases and assembles SNAREs for fusion, but how the complex fulfills its function remained speculative. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of HOPS. Unlike previously reported, significant flexibility of HOPS is confined to its extremities, where GTPase binding occurs. The SNARE-binding module is firmly attached to the core, therefore, ideally positioned between the membranes to catalyze fusion. Our data suggest a model for how HOPS fulfills its dual functionality of tethering and fusion and indicate why it is an essential part of the membrane fusion machinery.

                The evolution of multicellular life cycles is a central process in the course of the emergence of multicellularity. The simplest multicellular life cycle is comprised of the growth of the propagule into a colony and its fragmentation to give rise to new propagules. The majority of theoretical models assume selection among life cycles to be driven by internal properties of multicellular groups, resulting in growth competition. At the same time, the influence of interactions between groups on the evolution of life cycles is rarely even considered. Here, we present a model of colonial life cycle evolution taking into account group interactions. Our work shows that the outcome of evolution could be coexistence between multiple life cycles or that the outcome may depend on the initial state of the population – scenarios impossible without group interactions. At the same time, we found that some results of these simpler models remain relevant: evolutionary stable strategies in our model are restricted to binary fragmentation – the same class of life cycles that contains all evolutionarily optimal life cycles in the model without interactions. Our results demonstrate that while models neglecting interactions can capture short-term dynamics, they fall short in predicting the population-scale picture of evolution.

                Here we follow the call to target measurement reliability as a key prerequisite for individual-level predictions in translational neuroscience by investigating i) longitudinal reliability at the individual and ii) group level, iii) internal consistency and iv) response predictability across experimental phases. 120 individuals performed a fear conditioning paradigm twice six months apart. Analyses of skin conductance responses, fear ratings and BOLD-fMRI with different data transformations and included numbers of trials were conducted. While longitudinal reliability was rather limited at the individual level, it was comparatively higher for acquisition but not extinction at the group-level. Internal consistency was satisfactory. Higher responding in preceding phases predicted higher responding in subsequent experimental phases at a weak to moderate level depending on data specifications. In sum, the results suggest that while individual-level predictions are meaningful for (very) short time frames, they also call for more attention to measurement properties in the field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of oligodendrocyte lineage development by VAMP2/3 in the developing mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                In the developing and adult CNS, new oligodendrocytes (OLs) are generated from a population of cells known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). As they begin to differentiate, OPCs undergo a series of highly regulated changes to morphology, gene expression, and membrane organization. This stage represents a critical bottleneck in oligodendrogenesis, and the regulatory program that guides it is still not fully understood. Here we show that in vivo toxin-mediated cleavage of the vesicle associated SNARE proteins VAMP2/3 in the OL lineage of both male and female mice impairs the ability of early OLs to mature into functional, myelinating OLs. In the developing mouse spinal cord, many VAMP2/3-deficient OLs appeared to stall in the premyelinating, early OL stage, resulting in an overall loss of both myelin density and OL number. The Src kinase Fyn, a key regulator of oligodendrogenesis and myelination, is highly expressed among premyelinating OLs, but its expression decreases as OLs mature. We found that OLs lacking VAMP2/3 in the spinal cord white matter showed significantly higher expression of Fyn compared to neighboring control cells, potentially due to an extended premyelinating stage. Overall, our results show that functional VAMP2/3 in OL lineage cells is essential for proper myelin formation and plays a major role in controlling the maturation and terminal differentiation of premyelinating OLs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-resolved dynamic computational modeling of human EEG recordings reveals gradients of generative mechanisms for the MMN response</a></h4>

              
                Despite attempts to unify the different theoretical accounts of the mismatch negativity (MMN), there is still an ongoing debate on the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this complex brain response. On one hand, neuronal adaptation to recurrent stimuli is able to explain many of the observed properties of the MMN, such as its sensitivity to controlled experimental parameters. On the other hand, several modeling studies reported evidence in favor of Bayesian learning models for explaining the trial-to-trial dynamics of the human MMN. However, direct comparisons of these two main hypotheses are scarce, and previous modeling studies suffered from methodological limitations. Based on reports indicating spatial and temporal dissociation of physiological mechanisms within the timecourse of mismatch responses in animals, we hypothesized that different computational models would best fit different temporal phases of the human MMN. Using electroencephalographic data from two independent studies of a simple auditory oddball task (n = 82), we compared adaptation and Bayesian learning models ability to explain the sequential dynamics of auditory deviance detection in a time-resolved fashion. We first ran simulations to evaluate the capacity of our design to dissociate the tested models and found that they were sufficiently distinguishable above a certain level of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In subjects with a sufficient SNR, our time-resolved approach revealed a temporal dissociation between the two model families, with high evidence for adaptation during the early MMN window (from 90 to 150-190 ms post-stimulus depending on the dataset) and for Bayesian learning later in time (170-180 ms or 200-220ms). In addition, Bayesian model averaging of fixed-parameter models within the adaptation family revealed a gradient of adaptation rates, resembling the anatomical gradient in the auditory cortical hierarchy reported in animal studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential role of dopamine D3 receptor through balanced modulation of Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 activity in the reactivation of cocaine rewarding memories evoked by psychological versus physiological stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress is an important trigger of relapses in cocaine use. These relapses engage the activity of memory-related nuclei, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the dentate gyrus (DG). Further, preclinical research signals D3 receptor (D3R) antagonists as promising therapeutic tools to attenuate cocaine reward and relapse. Therefore, we assessed the effect of SB-277011-A, a D3R antagonist, in the activity of Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in these areas during the reinstatement of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) evoked by psychological (restraint) and physiological (tail pinch) stress. Both stimuli reactivated the extinguished cocaine-CPP, but only restrained animals decreased their locomotor activity during reinstatement. Moreover, p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-ERK1/2 activity in the BLA and DG of restrained animals decreased during the reactivation of cocaine memories, contrasting to tail-pinched mice. While D3R blockade prevented stress-induced CPP reactivation and plasmatic corticosterone enhancement, SB-277011-A distinctly modulated Akt, mTOR and ERK1/2 activities in the BLA and DG based on the stressor and the dose of antagonist. Corticosterone may be partially responsible for these variations as we found high correlations among its levels and mTOR and/or Akt activity in the BLA and DG of restrained animals receiving SB-277011-A. Besides, locomotor activity of animals receiving 48 mg/kg of the antagonist highly correlated with p-mTOR/mTOR and p-ERK1/2 /ERK1/2 in the BLA during restraint- and tail pinch-induced relapse in cocaine-CPP, respectively. Hence, our study endorses D3R antagonists as therapeutic tools to prevent stress-induced relapses in drug use through a complex balance of Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in memory-processing brain nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The perception of auditory motion in sighted and early blind individuals</a></h4>

              
                Motion detection is a fundamental property of the visual system that plays an important role across many of the human senses. In vision, motion processing is classically described using a motion energy model which assumes spatiotemporally selective (i.e., non-separable) filters that capture the smooth continuous change in spatial position over time afforded by moving objects. However, in the case of audition, it is still not clear whether or not the primary mechanisms underlying motion sensitivity are spatiotemporally selective. We used a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm, where participants discriminated the direction of a motion signal in the presence of spatiotemporal noise, to determine whether the filters underlying auditory motion discrimination were spatiotemporally separable or non-separable. We then examined whether these auditory motion filters were altered as a result of early blindness. We found that both sighted and early blind individuals have separable filters. However, early blind individuals show increased sensitivity to auditory motion, with reduced susceptibility to noise, with filters that were more accurate in detecting motion onsets/offsets. An ideal observer model suggested that the reliance on separable filters may be more optimal given the limited spatial resolution in auditory input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Practical scan-length considerations for mapping upper limb movements to the somatosensory/motor cortex at 7T</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between motor cortex (M1) and upper limb movements has been investigated extensively using functional MRI (fMRI). While most research has focused on applications, very few studies have focused on practical aspects related to developing the fMRI protocol. Thus, the effect of scan length on M1 activations during various upper limb movements remains unclear. Scan length constraints are important for conducting motor experiments within a 60- or 90-min scan session. We targeted this gap by studying 7T fMRI activations in a male participant while performing eight different upper limb movements (of the fingers, wrist, and elbow) across 16 task runs (8 with the left arm, 8 with the right arm, 88 mins total fMRI duration). Standard activation analyses were performed (Z>3.1, p<0.01, cluster thresholded) independently for 14 different cases (2 runs through 8 runs, left and right arm) and compared. We found diminishing returns with higher number of runs (activations gradually plateaued with runs). We observed two clusters of movements, one with generally higher activation (more activated voxels and higher Z-stats) and the other with lower activation. To achieve similar statistical power, movements with lower activation required longer scanning (more runs). Based on these observations, we propose a - one size does not fit all - practical protocol within a 60-, 75-, or 90- min scan session, wherein different number of runs are assigned for different movements. Our study could benefit researchers who are designing upper limb fMRI experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subtype-specific roles of ellipsoid body ring neurons in sleep regulation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ellipsoid body (EB) is a major structure of the central complex of the Drosophila melanogaster brain. 22 subtypes of EB ring neurons have been identified based on anatomical and morphological characteristics with light-level microscopy and EM connectomics. A few studies have associated ring neurons with the regulation of sleep homeostasis and structure. However, cell type-specific and population interactions in the regulation of sleep remain unclear. Employing a unbiased thermogenetic screen of collected EB drivers, we found: 1) multiple ring neurons are involved in the modulation of amount of sleep and structure in a synergistic manner; 2) analysis of data for {triangleup}P(doze)/ {triangleup}P(wake) using a mixed Gaussian model detected 5 clusters of GAL4 drivers which had similar effects on sleep pressure and/or depth: lines driving arousal contained R4m neurons, whereas lines that increased sleep pressure had R3m cells; 3) a general linear model analysis correlating ring cell subtype and activity-dependent changes in sleep parameters across all the lines identified several cell types significantly associated with specific sleep effects: R3p for daytime sleep promotion, and R4m for nighttime wake-promoting; and 4) another subclass, R3d cells present in 5HT7-GAL4+ neurons and in GAL4 lines from our screen which exclusively affect sleep structure, were found to contribute to fragmentation of sleep during both day and night. Thus, multiple subtypes of ring neurons distinctively control sleep amount and/or structure, and the unique highly interconnected structure of the EB and its connections with other regions of brain suggest a local-network model worth future investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two gustatory receptors involved in host plant recognition of silkworm larvae</a></h4>

              
                Herbivorous insects can identify their host plants by sensing plant secondary metabolites as chemical cues. We previously reported the two-factor host acceptance system of the silkworm Bombyx mori larvae. The chemosensory neurons in the maxillary palp (MP) of the larvae detect mulberry secondary metabolites, chlorogenic acid (CGA), and isoquercitrin (ISQ), with ultrahigh sensitivity, for host plant recognition and feeding initiation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the ultrasensitive sensing of these compounds remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that two gustatory receptors (Grs), BmGr6 and BmGr9, are responsible for sensing the mulberry compounds with attomolar sensitivity for host plant recognition by silkworm larvae. Calcium imaging assay using cultured cells expressing the silkworm putative sugar receptors (BmGr4-10) revealed that BmGr6 and BmGr9 serve as receptors for CGA and ISQ with attomolar sensitivity in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of BmGr6 and BmGr9 resulted in a low probability of making a test bite of the mulberry leaves, suggesting that they lost the ability to recognize host leaves specifically. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the loss of host recognition ability in the Gr-KO strains was due to a drastic decrease in MP sensitivity toward ISQ in BmGr6-KO larvae and toward CGA and ISQ in BmGr9-KO larvae. Our findings unraveled that the two Grs, which have been regarded as sugar receptors, are molecules responsible for detecting plant phenolics in host plant recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Roles of the 5-HT2C receptor on zebrafish sociality</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been implicated in social behavior in vertebrates. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been increasingly being used behavioral neuroscience to study the neurobiological correlates of behavior, including sociality. Nonetheless, the role of 5-HT2C receptors in different social functions were not yet studied in this species. Zebrafish were treated with the agonist MK-212 (2 mg/kg) or the antagonist RS-102221 (2 mg/kg) and tested in the social interaction and social novelty tests, conditional approach test, or mirror-induced aggressive displays. MK-212 increased preference for an unknown conspecific in the social investigation test, but also increased preference for the known conspecific in the social novelty test; RS-102221, on the other hand, decreased preference in the social investigation test but increased preference for the novel conspecific in the social novelty test. MK-212 also decreased predator inspection in the conditional approach test. While RS-102221 decreased time in the display zone in the mirror-induced aggressive display test, it increased display duration. Overall, these results demonstrate the complex role of 5-HT2C receptors in different social contexts in zebrafish, revealing a participation in social plasticity in vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methamphetamine Self-Administration Differential Effects on Mesolimbic Glutathione Levels, Mitochondrial Respiration, and Dopamine Neuron Firing Activity</a></h4>

              
                Acute and neurotoxic regimens of METH are known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), affect redox homeostasis, and lead to cellular damage in dopamine neurons. However, functional changes induced by long-term METH self-administration on mitochondrial respiratory metabolism and redox homeostasis are less known. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we implanted adult mice with a jugular catheter and trained them to nose poke for METH infusions in operant chambers. After completing several weeks of METH self-administration exposure, we collected samples of the ventral striatum (vSTR) and the ventral midbrain (vMB), containing the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), respectively. We used HPLC to determine the levels of the ROS scavenger glutathione in its reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms. Then, we used high-resolution respirometry to determine the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of mitochondrial complexes under several substrates and inhibitors. Finally, we used in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings to assess changes in dopamine neuron firing activity in the VTA. METH self-administration produces a progressive decrease of the GSH pool in vST, which correlates with METH lifetime intake. We observed increased mitochondrial respiration across the two mesolimbic regions, but only vMB OCR correlates with METH lifetime intake. We recorded an increased number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons with decreased firing rate and burst activity in the VTA. METH lifetime intake inversely correlates with firing rate, the percentage of spikes in a burst, and directly correlates with the number of neurons per track. We conclude that METH self-administration progressively decreased the antioxidant pool in sites of higher dopamine release and produced an increased mitochondrial metabolism in the mesolimbic areas, probably derived from the increased number of dopamine neurons actively firing. However, dopamine neuron firing activity is decreased by METH self-administration, reflecting a new basal level of dopamine neurotransmission in response to the prolonged effects of METH on dopamine release and circuitry feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The individual vulnerability to develop compulsive adjunctive behavior is associated with the recruitment of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) within the Locus Coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                Some compulsive disorders have been considered to stem from the loss of control over coping strategies, such as displacement. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in the acquisition of coping behaviors and their ensuing compulsive manifestation in vulnerable individuals have not been elucidated. Considering the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenaline dependent system in stress and related excessive behaviors, we hypothesised that neuroplastic changes in the LC may be involved in the acquisition of an adjunctive polydipsic water drinking, a prototypical displacement behavior, and the subsequent development of compulsion in vulnerable individuals. Thus, male Sprague Dawley rats were characterised for their tendency, or not, to develop compulsive polydipsic drinking in a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) procedure before their fresh brains were harvested. A new quantification tool for RNAscope assays revealed that the development of compulsive adjunctive behavior was associated with a low mRNA copy number of the plasticity marker Arc in the LC which appeared to be driven by specific adaptations in an ensemble of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+, zif268- neurons. This ensemble was specifically engaged by the expression of compulsive adjunctive behavior, not by stress, because its functional recruitment was not observed in individuals that no longer had access to the water bottle before sacrifice while it consistently correlated with the levels of polydipsic water drinking only when it had become compulsive. Together these findings suggest that downregulation of Arc mRNA levels in a population of a TH+zif268- LC neurons represents a signature of the tendency to develop compulsive coping behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subthreshold serotonin signals combined by the G proteins Gαq and Gαs activate the C. elegans egg-laying muscles</a></h4>

              
                Individual neuron or muscle cells express many G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It remains unclear how these cells integrate multiple GPCR signals that all must act through the same few G proteins. We investigated how two serotonin GPCRs, Gq-coupled SER-1 and Gs-coupled SER-7, function together on the C. elegans egg-laying muscles to promote contraction and thus cause eggs to be laid. Using receptor null mutations and cell-specific knockdowns, we found that serotonin signaling through either SER-1/Gq or SER-7/Gs alone does not induce egg laying, but these subthreshold signals can combine to promote egg laying. However, using designer receptors or optogenetics to artificially induce high levels of either Gq signaling or Gs signaling in the muscles was sufficient to induce egg laying. Conversely, knocking down both Gq and Gs in the egg-laying muscle cells induced egg-laying defects stronger than those of a ser-7 ser-1 double knockout. These results suggest that, in the egg-laying muscles, multiple GPCRs for serotonin and other signals each produce weak effects that individually do not result in strong behavioral outcomes. However, they can combine to produce sufficient levels of Gq and Gs signaling to promote muscle activity and egg laying.
