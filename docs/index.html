                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>After unilateral lesion of the medial forebrain bundle by 6-OHDA rats exhibit lateralized deficits in spontaneous behavior or apomorphine-induced rotations. We investigated whether such lateralization is attenuated by either deep brain stimulation (DBS) or glutamatergic neurotransmission in the inferior colliculus (IC) of Wistar rats. Intracollicular DBS did not affect spontaneous lateralization but attenuated apomorphine-induced rotations. Spontaneous lateralization disappeared after either the glutamatergic antagonist MK-801 or the agonist NMDA microinjections into the IC. Apomorphine-induced rotations were potentiated by MK-801 but were not affected by NMDA intracollicular microinjection. After injecting a bidirectional neural tract tracer into the IC, cell bodies and/or axonal fibers were found in the periaqueductal gray matter, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, cuneiform nucleus, and pedunculo-pontine tegmental nucleus, suggesting the involvement of these structures in the motor improvement after IC manipulation. Importantly, the side of the IC microinjection regarding the lesion (ipsilateral or contralateral) is particularly important, and this effect may not involve the neostriatum directly.</p>

Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a major high-density lipoprotein (HDL) protein, is associated with prevention of vascular damage. However, ApoA1&rsquo;s effects on damaged endothelium in ALS are unknown. This study aimed to determine therapeutic potential of ApoA1 for endothelial cell (EC) repair under a pathologic condition reminiscent of ALS. We performed <I>in vitro</I> studies using mouse brain ECs (mBECs) exposed to plasma from symptomatic G93A SOD1 mice. Dosage effects of ApoA1, including inhibition of the phosphoinoside 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and integration of ApoA1 into mBECs were examined. Also, human bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) and mBECs were co-cultured without cell contact to establish therapeutic mechanism of hBM-EPC transplantation. Results showed that ApoA1 significantly reduced mBEC death via the PI3K/Akt downstream signaling pathway. Also, ApoA1 was incorporated into mBECs as confirmed by blocked ApoA1 cellular integration. Co-culture system provided evidence that ApoA1 was secreted by hBM-EPCs and incorporated into injured mBECs. Thus, our study findings provide important evidence for ApoA1 as a potential novel therapeutic for endothelium protection in ALS. This <I>in vitro</I> study lays the groundwork for further <I>in vivo</I> research to fully determine therapeutic effects of ApoA1 in ALS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Gestational Buprenorphine Exposure Disrupts Dopamine Neuron Activity and Related Behaviors in Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid misuse among pregnant women is rapidly increasing in the United States. The number of maternal opioid-related diagnoses increased by 131% in the last 10 years, resulting in an increased number of infants exposed to opioids <I>in utero</I> and a subsequent increase in infants developing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The most prescribed treatment to combat maternal opioid use disorder is buprenorphine, a partial &mu;-opioid receptor agonist and -opioid receptor antagonist. Buprenorphine treatment effectively reduces NAS but has been associated with disrupted cortical development and neurodevelopmental consequences in childhood. Less is known about the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences following buprenorphine exposure <I>in utero</I>. Previous research has shown that gestational buprenorphine exposure can induce anxiety-like and depressive-like phenotypes in adult rats, suggesting that exposure to buprenorphine <I>in utero</I> may render individuals more susceptible to psychiatric illness in adulthood. A common pathology observed across multiple psychiatric illnesses is dopamine system dysfunction. Here, we administered the highly-abused opioid, oxycodone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or a therapeutic used to treat opioid use disorder, buprenorphine (1 mg/kg, i.p) to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats from gestational day 11 through 21, then examined neurophysiological alterations in the mesolimbic dopamine system and dopamine-dependent behaviors in adult offspring. We found that gestational exposure to buprenorphine or oxycodone increases dopamine neuron activity in adulthood. Moreover, prenatal buprenorphine exposure disrupts the afferent regulation of dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Taken together, we posit that gestational buprenorphine or oxycodone exposure can have profound effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system in adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Faculty readiness for online teaching at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University during the COVID-19 crisis: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education sector around the world. In order to control the spread of the virus, eLearning practice has been introduced in Saudi higher education. Such online communication has become an important tool to narrow the teaching practice gap. This study assessed the characteristics of eLearning and distance learning and the inclination of Imam Abdulrahman BinFaisal University (IAU) faculty members in terms of skills, and managing classes and tests using online learning tools. Methods: A QuestionPro questionnaire with 22 questions on eLearning experience, training experience, and skills and knowledge in the educational process of IAU teaching faculty was conducted through the online university e-mail domain. The questionnaire was sent to the IAUâs teaching faculty. The questionnaireâs reliability was studied using Cronbachâs a coefficient. The criterion value was statistically studied using the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and Bartlettâs test. The variables associated with the present survey model were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results: The study showed positive responses and readiness (skills and abilities) and the effectiveness of IAUâs faculty members to perform e-learning activities during COVID-19. IAU faculty received a strong positive response, and the respondents were also impressed with and agreed on trainer knowledge, session management, communication and expertise on training topics. Conclusions: The positive response indicates the readiness of IAU to provide the necessary support (tools, information and updates) required for a successful online educational process.

                We present a case report of a four-year-old girl with stiff skin syndrome associated with bone involvement at the femoral head. She presented with thickness of the skin of the trunk and limbs, noted from the age of one year. This was associated with hypertrichosis and reduced joint mobility of the left lower extremity. The patient received physiotherapeutic treatments and underwent orthopedic examinations. A diagnosis of stiff skin syndrome should be considered in infants and children with thick skin, particularly if there is associated hypertrichosis. Important differentials to rule out include generalized morphea and systemic sclerosis. In this piece, we share insight on how a young girl with stiff skin syndrome associated with bone involvement at the femoral head presented and was managed in a rural tertiary health facility despite resource constraints.

                The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the worldâs attention to the gendered impacts of health emergencies of women. This offers a critical opportunity to advance our understanding of the gendered impacts of healthcare and to improve health outcomes for women around the world. However, to do so we need to be mindful of five future challenges: 1. the continued impact of COVID-19; 2. attacks on womenâs health and the need for gender equality; 3. understanding womenâs health needs everyday, not just during emergencies; 4. not seeing female leadership as a quick fix; and 5. holding global institutions to account.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Binding mechanism of oseltamivir and influenza neuraminidase suggests perspectives for the design of new anti-influenza drugs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiaye Tao, Heping Wang, Wenjian Wang, Na Mi, Wei Zhang, Qiujia Wen, Jiajing Ouyang, Xinyun Liang, Min Chen, Wentao Guo, Guoming Li, Jun Liu, Hanning Zhao, Xin Wang, Xuemeng Li, Shengjun Feng, Xinguang Liu, Zhiwei He, Zuguo Zhao</p>

Oseltamivir is a widely used influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor that prevents the release of new virus particles from host cells. However, oseltamivir-resistant strains have emerged, but effective drugs against them have not yet been developed. Elucidating the binding mechanisms between NA and oseltamivir may provide valuable information for the design of new drugs against NA mutants resistant to oseltamivir. Here, we conducted large-scale (353.4 Î¼s) free-binding molecular dynamics simulations, together with a Markov State Model and an importance-sampling algorithm, to reveal the binding process of oseltamivir and NA. Ten metastable states and five major binding pathways were identified that validated and complemented previously discovered binding pathways, including the hypothesis that oseltamivir can be transferred from the secondary sialic acid binding site to the catalytic site. The discovery of multiple new metastable states, especially the stable bound state containing a water-mediated hydrogen bond between Arg118 and oseltamivir, may provide new insights into the improvement of NA inhibitors. We anticipated the findings presented here will facilitate the development of drugs capable of combating NA mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cheater suppression and stochastic clearance through quorum sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander S. Moffett, Peter J. Thomas, Michael Hinczewski, Andrew W. Eckford</p>

The evolutionary consequences of quorum sensing in regulating bacterial cooperation are not fully understood. In this study, we reveal unexpected effects of regulating public good production through quorum sensing on bacterial population dynamics, showing that quorum sensing can be a collectively harmful alternative to unregulated production. We analyze a birth-death model of bacterial population dynamics accounting for public good production and the presence of non-producing cheaters. Our model demonstrates that when demographic noise is a factor, the consequences of controlling public good production according to quorum sensing depend on the cost of public good production and the growth rate of populations in the absence of public goods. When public good production is inexpensive, quorum sensing is a destructive alternative to unconditional production, in terms of the mean population extinction time. When costs are higher, quorum sensing becomes a constructive strategy for the producing strain, both stabilizing cooperation and decreasing the risk of population extinction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Physiological characterization of electrodermal activity enables scalable near real-time autonomic nervous system activation inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rafiul Amin, Rose T. Faghih</p>

Electrodermal activities (EDA) are any electrical phxenomena observed on the skin. Skin conductance (SC), a measure of EDA, shows fluctuations due to autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation induced sweat secretion. Since it can capture psychophysiological information, there is a significant rise in the research work for tracking mental and physiological health with EDA. However, the current state-of-the-art lacks a physiologically motivated approach for real-time inference of ANS activation from EDA. Therefore, firstly, we propose a comprehensive model for the SC dynamics. The proposed model is a 3D state-space representation of the direct secretion of sweat via pore opening and diffusion followed by corresponding evaporation and reabsorption. As the input to the model, we consider a sparse signal representing the ANS activation that causes the sweat glands to produce sweat. Secondly, we derive a scalable fixed-interval smoother-based sparse recovery approach utilizing the proposed comprehensive model to infer the ANS activation enabling edge computation. We incorporate a generalized-cross-validation to tune the sparsity level. Finally, we propose an Expectation-Maximization based deconvolution approach for learning the model parameters during the ANS activation inference. For evaluation, we utilize a dataset with 26 participants, and the results show that our comprehensive state-space model can successfully describe the SC variations with high scalability, showing the feasibility of real-time applications. Results validate that our physiology-motivated state-space model can comprehensively explain the EDA and outperforms all previous approaches. Our findings introduce a whole new perspective and have a broader impact on the standard practices of EDA analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring the nature of linguistic computations in the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sanne Ten Oever, Karthikeya Kaushik, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Sentences contain structure that determines their meaning beyond that of individual words. An influential study by Ding and colleagues (2016) used frequency tagging of phrases and sentences to show that the human brain is sensitive to structure by finding peaks of neural power at the rate at which structures were presented. Since then, there has been a rich debate on how to best explain this pattern of results with profound impact on the language sciences. Models that use hierarchical structure building, as well as models based on associative sequence processing, can predict the neural response, creating an inferential impasse as to which class of models explains the nature of the linguistic computations reflected in the neural readout. In the current manuscript, we discuss pitfalls and common fallacies seen in the conclusions drawn in the literature illustrated by various simulations. We conclude that inferring the neural operations of sentence processing based on these neural data, and any like it, alone, is insufficient. We discuss how to best evaluate models and how to approach the modeling of neural readouts to sentence processing in a manner that remains faithful to cognitive, neural, and linguistic principles.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Genome-wide functional analysis reveals key roles for kinesins in the mammalian and mosquito stages of the malaria parasite life cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Zeeshan, Ravish Rashpa, David J. P. Ferguson, Steven Abel, Zeinab Chahine, Declan Brady, Sue Vaughan, Carolyn A. Moores, Karine G. Le Roch, Mathieu Brochet, Anthony A. Holder, Rita Tewari</p>

Kinesins are microtubule (MT)-based motors important in cell division, motility, polarity, and intracellular transport in many eukaryotes. However, they are poorly studied in the divergent eukaryotic pathogens <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agents of malaria, which manifest atypical aspects of cell division and plasticity of morphology throughout the life cycle in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. Here, we describe a genome-wide screen of <i>Plasmodium</i> kinesins, revealing diverse subcellular locations and functions in spindle assembly, axoneme formation, and cell morphology. Surprisingly, only kinesin-13 is essential for growth in the mammalian host while the other 8 kinesins are required during the proliferative and invasive stages of parasite transmission through the mosquito vector. In-depth analyses of kinesin-13 and kinesin-20 revealed functions in MT dynamics during apical cell polarity formation, spindle assembly, and axoneme biogenesis. These findings help us to understand the importance of MT motors and may be exploited to discover new therapeutic interventions against malaria.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural responses in human superior temporal cortex support coding of voice representations</a></h4>

The ability to recognize abstract features of voice during auditory perception is an intricate feat of human audition. For the listener, this occurs in near-automatic fashion to seamlessly extract complex cues from a highly variable auditory signal. Voice perception depends on specialized regions of auditory cortex, including superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, the nature of voice encoding at the cortical level remains poorly understood. We leverage intracerebral recordings across human auditory cortex during presentation of voice and nonvoice acoustic stimuli to examine voice encoding at the cortical level in 8 patient-participants undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation. We show that voice selectivity increases along the auditory hierarchy from supratemporal plane (STP) to the STG and STS. Results show accurate decoding of vocalizations from human auditory cortical activity even in the complete absence of linguistic content. These findings show an early, less-selective temporal window of neural activity in the STG and STS followed by a sustained, strongly voice-selective window. Encoding models demonstrate divergence in the encoding of acoustic features along the auditory hierarchy, wherein STG/STS responses are best explained by voice category and acoustics, as opposed to acoustic features of voice stimuli alone. This is in contrast to neural activity recorded from STP, in which responses were accounted for by acoustic features. These findings support a model of voice perception that engages categorical encoding mechanisms within STG and STS to facilitate feature extraction.

                The global market of a total 42.4 billion US dollars of ornamental plants owes its worth to the color and fragrance associated with these plants. A lot of work has been done to understand the physiological, biochemical, genetic, and environmental factors responsible for the development of color and fragrance in flowers. The aim of these studies about the floral biology was to achieve the desired characters by manipulating all these factors to fulfill the changing demand of the global market. While, modifying flower color and fragrance, scientists moved from the traditional breeding methods to the comparatively modern genetic engineering techniques, yet limitations in results always remained a big issue for researchers. However, genome editing tools look promising to achieve the desired level of efficiency to modify the color and fragrance in the flowers. This review gives insight into the significance of floral characters, molecular factors responsible for these characters and applications of modern genome editing technologies for desirable modification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in determining survival rates of lung cancer patients in the population of North Sumatra, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gaining a better understanding of molecular alterations in the pathogenesis of lung cancer reveals a significant change in approach to the management and prognosis of lung cancer. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been identified and have different roles related to survival rates in lung cancer patients. This study aims to determine the role of KRAS, EGFR, and TP53 mutations in the survival rate of lung cancer patients in the population of North Sumatra. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 108 subjects diagnosed with lung cancer from histopathology specimens. DNA extractions were performed using FFPE followed by PCR examinations for assessing the expressions of EGFR, RAS, and TP53 protein. Sequencing analysis was carried out to determine the mutations of EGFR exon 19 and 21, RAS protein exon 2, and TP53 exon 5-6 and 8-9. Data input and analysis were conducted using statistical analysis software for Windows. The survival rate analysis was presented with Kaplan Meier. Results: 52 subjects completed all procedures in this study. Most of the subjects are male (75%), above 60 years old (53.8%), heavy smokers (75%), and suffer from adenocarcinoma type of lung cancer (69.2%). No subjects showed KRAS exon 2 mutations. Overall survival rates increased in patients with EGFR mutations (15 months compared to 8 months; p=0.001) and decreased in patients with TP53 mutations (7 months compared to 9 months; p=0.148). Also, there was increasing Progression-Free Survival in patients with EGFR mutations (6 months compared to 3 months) (p=0.19) and decreasing PFS in patients with TP53 mutations (3 months compared to 6 months) (p=0.07). Conclusions: There were no KRAS mutations in this study. EGFR mutations showed a higher survival rate, while TP53 mutations showed a lower survival rate in overall survival and progression-free survival.

                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since late November 2021, the Omicron variant has emerged as the primary cause of COVID-19 and caused a huge increase in the reported incidence around the world. To date, 32-34 spike mutations have been reported to be present in the Omicron variant, 15 of which were located in the receptor-binding domain that interacts with the cell surface of the host cells, while the rest were located in the N-terminal domain and around the furin cleavage site. Recent studies have suggested that those mutations could have a major role in the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant. Additionally, some mutations might contribute to the change of viral tropism of this novel variant. Here, we aim to discuss the recent reports on the transmissibility and severity of the Omicron variant from both the genetic and clinical perspectives. Afterward, we also take the chance to deliver our personal view on the topic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The burden of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations among Vietnamese women and theirÂ associated factors: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: BReast CAncer gene (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are frequently provided genetic counselling. A precise estimation of the prevalence of BRCA gene mutations is essential to provide an appropriate risk prediction. However, the data in Vietnam is ambiguous and include unreliable risk factors from individual studies. Hence, the objective of this protocol is to provide a method to synthesize evidence pertaining to the proportion of BRCA mutations among Vietnamese women and their risk factors for cancer. Methods: PRISMA-P was followed in developing and reporting this protocol. From the databases' inception until June 2023, a comprehensive search will be undertaken in electronic PubMed and Scopus databases. In two stages, title/abstract screening and full-text screening, two independent authors will assess all retrieved articles for inclusion. This review includes papers providing the relevant results reflecting the prevalence of BRCA gene mutations in Vietnamese women who are at least 18 years old with or without cancer. Predefined selection criteria will be used to establish each publication's eligibility. Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, the quality of included studies will be assessed, and overall evidence quality will be appraised using the GRADE approach. All pertinent data from the included articles will be entered into an Excel spreadsheet for meta-analysis, which will be imported into Rstudio. Meta-analyses using random effects will be used to obtain the pooled percentages. The chi-squared test and I2 parameter will be used to evaluate heterogeneity. Publication bias will be investigated visually using funnel plots for asymmetry and Egger's statistical tests. Conclusions: Based on the prevalence of BRCA muations and its associated comprehensive and specific risk factors, we hope our findings will provide a reference for future strategies to build an effective treatment plan and manage the risk of cancer development. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340152; 30 June 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of different concentrations of reversine to enhance conversion of dedifferentiated fat cells into mature cardiomyocytes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is an essential need for cardiomyocyte regeneration among patients with heart failure. Transplantation of dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells may lead to an improvement of cardiomyocyte regeneration among heart failure patients. We believe that DFAT cells are promising candidate cell sources for cardiac regeneration. However, the pathway underlying how DFAT cells of the adipose lineage differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes isnât fully understood. Methods: We conducted an experimental laboratory study on isolated DFAT cells from adipose tissue of healthy adults. Then, we treated cells with different concentrations of reversine (10, 20 and 40 nM), and performed RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Next, we used a ceiling culture method based on the buoyancy properties of mature lipid-filled adipocytes. Stemness expression (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4], brachyury, Fetal liver kinase 1 [Flk-1]) was quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR, while cardiomyocyte expression (Transcription factor GATA-4 [GATA4] and cardiac troponin T [cTnT]) was quantified by immunocytochemistry. Results: ANOVA with Tukeyâs post-hoc found that 10 nM reversine increased greater Flk-1 expression compared to the control group (MD: 5.037 + 0.998; p < 0.001), but there were no significant changes among Oct4 (MD: 0.013 + 1.244; p = 0.99) and brachyury expression (MD: 0.157 + 0.084; p = 0.252). Kruskal-Wallis revealed that the expression of GATA4 (1.65 [0.41-1.98] to 0.015 [0.007-0.034]; p = 0.017) reduced significantly from day 7 until day 21 and cTnT (5.07 [6.62-8.91] to 8.22 [6.81-9.40]; p = 0.001) increased significantly from day 7 until day 21. Conclusions: Reversine could increase the expression of Flk-1, but it was unable to stimulate the expression of Oct4 and brachyury related to stem cell-ness. An optimal concentration of 10 nM reversine may have the greatest effect on enhancing the differentiation of DFAT cells into mature cardiomyocytes, as indicated by higher cTnT expression between cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus between the tonsillar fibrous capsule and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis, whereas bilateral peritonsillar abscess is rare. The incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess remains unknown but is estimated to be 4.9% of all peritonsillar abscess cases. Case report: A 20-year-old man came to the emergency room with bilateral peritonsillar abscess and complained of shortness of breath for two weeks. Physical examination showed muffled voice, 82% oxygen saturation, and inspiratory stridor. The isthmus faucium was narrow, with approximately 30% remaining. Peritonsillar puncture revealed pus mixed with blood. The treatment for this patient included bilateral peritonsillar incision and drainage and intravenous antibiotics of levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient came to the Ear, Nose, Throat, Head, and Neck (ENTHN) Outpatient Unit eight days after the procedure for a control checkup and was in good condition. Conclusion: We have reported a bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction, in which we performed incision and drainage. Prompt and appropriate management is needed to avoid unwanted morbidity and mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measurement of speech in individuals with selective mutism: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main characteristic of selective mutism (SM) is the failure to speak in specific social situations. Thus, assessing speech across social contexts is important for confirming a diagnosis of SM and for differentiating it from other disorders. The purpose of this review was to organize how the core symptom of SM, a lack of speech in specific social situations, has been assessed in previous studies. Methods: A systematic search of articles was conducted in three databases, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed and reviews of surveys or experimental studies that reported empirical data on individuals with SM were performed. We excluded review, qualitative, epidemiological, and intervention studies. The study summarized the diagnostic criteria, methods of confirming SM diagnosis, distinction of SM from other disorders, and methods of speech assessment. Results: A total of 447 articles were screened, where 60 articles were considered eligible. The results demonstrate that different interviews and questionnaires were used to establish the diagnosis of SM. However, the majority of interviews and questionnaires lacked validation. Only two (2/60) articles used validated methods of speech assessment to confirm SM diagnosis. Moreover, a consensus was lacking on the assessment method for differentiating SM from other disorders across studies. Specifically, 17 studies measured speech and are not intended for diagnosis. The majority of studies (16/17) used the questionnaire to assess the severity of the SM condition, and only one study conducted behavioral observation. Assessment methods based on the measurement of speech in real-life situations for individuals with SM were not established. Conclusion: We have the limitation that we did not review intervention studies. However, this systematic review revealed the problem that speech assessment methods for surveys or experimental studies of SM were not established. Future studies should establish methods of speech assessment across social situations to assess SM symptoms.

     alt="Interspecific variation in sex-specific gustatory organs in Drosophila"/><p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a popular model for investigating how sex-specific sensory information is translated into sex-specific behavior. To provide an evolutionary context for these studies, this report shows that different <i>Drosophila</i> species vary extensively in the presence, number, locations, and morphology of sex-specific gustatory bristles on their legs.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i> males use leg gustatory bristles to discriminate between male and female cuticular pheromones as an important part of courtship behavior. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, several male-specific gustatory bristles are present on the anterior surface of the first tarsal segment of the prothoracic leg, in addition to a larger set of gustatory bristles found in both sexes. These bristles are thought to be specialized for pheromone detection. Here, we report the number and location of sex-specific gustatory bristles in 27 other <i>Drosophila</i> species. Although some species have a pattern similar to <i>D. melanogaster</i>, others lack anterior male-specific bristles but have many dorsal male-specific gustatory bristles instead. Some species have both anterior and dorsal male-specific bristles, while others lack sexual dimorphism entirely. In several distantly related species, the number of gustatory bristles is much greater in males than in females due to a male-specific transformation of ancestrally mechanosensory bristles to a chemosensory identity. This variation in the extent and pattern of sexual dimorphism may affect the formation and function of neuronal circuits that control <i>Drosophila</i> courtship and contribute to the evolution of mating behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spider brain and central nervous system (CNS) have remained unexplored, due in part to the difficulty of observing these organs, usually only possible through histological preparations. Recently, internal anatomy studies have been supplemented by the inclusion of X- ray micro-CT. Unmineralized tissue such as the body of invertebrates requires a staining process to enhance tissue X-ray absorption and improve contrast during observation. Many current protocols are based on iodine staining requiring critical point drying (CPD) of the sample for optimal contrast. This process induces shrinking of the soft tissue generating artifacts in the morphology, volume, and even position of internal structures. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is an alternative staining agent recently used in marine invertebrate and plant studies. Here, we used several specimens of the common spider <i>Araneus diadematus</i> to visualize the spider brain and compare both contrast-enhancing ethanol-based solutions. We assessed a gradient of staining times, observed and tested the repercussions of CPD, and examined the use of vacuum to accelerate PTA diffusion. We show that PTA provides the best contrast on micro-CT scans in ethanol eliminating the need for CPD, and offering more realistic in situ visualizations of the internal organs. In combination with different scanning settings, PTA allowed observation of internal organs like the CNS, digestive system, muscles, and finer structures like the retina, visual nerves, and optic neuropiles. This fast and less invasive method could facilitate the proper documentation of the internal anatomy in the context of evolutionary, developmental and functional studies.</p>

     alt="Chemoarchitecture of area prostriata in adult and developing mice: Comparison with presubiculum and parasubiculum"/><p>The present study investigated the genoarchitecture of the mouse equivalent of area prostriata (Pro), which receives direct inputs from dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1). In both adult and postnatal mice, many genes are expressed in layers 2â3 (e.g., Fstl1) or layer 5 (e.g., Lypd1) or both (not shown) of the prostriata, while some other genes are differentially expressed in the dorsal (e.g., Col5a1) and ventral (e.g., Cdh24) subdivisions of the prostriata. These gene expression patterns make the prostriata distinguishable from adjoining regions such as the postsubiculum and V1.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial area 29e, which was a cortical region described mostly in earlier rodent literature, is often included in the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) or postsubiculum (PoS) in modern literature and commonly used brain atlases. Recent anatomical and molecular studies have revealed that retrosplenial area 29e belongs to the superficial layers of area prostriata, which in primates is found to be important in fast analysis of quickly moving objects in far peripheral visual field. As in primates, the prostriata in rodents adjoins area 29 (granular retrosplenial area), area 30 (agranular retrosplenial area), medial visual cortex, PrSd/PoS, parasubiculum (PaS), and postrhinal cortex (PoR). The present study aims to reveal the chemoarchitecture of the prostriata versus PrSd/PoS or PaS by means of a systematic survey of gene expression patterns in adult and developing mouse brains. First, we find many genes that display differential expression across the prostriata, PrSd/PoS, and PaS and that show obvious laminar expression patterns. Second, we reveal subsets of genes that selectively express in the dorsal or ventral parts of the prostriata, suggesting the existence of at least two subdivisions. Third, we detect some genes that shows differential expression in the prostriata of postnatal mouse brains from adjoining regions, thus enabling identification of the developing area prostriata. Fourth, gene expression difference of the prostriata from the medial primary visual cortex and PoR is also observed. Finally, molecular and connectional features of the prostriata in rodents and nonhuman primates are discussed and compared.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex (CX) in the brain of insects is a highly conserved group of midline-spanning neuropils consisting of the upper and lower division of the central body, the protocerebral bridge, and the paired noduli. These neuropils are the substrate for a number of behaviors, most prominently goal-oriented locomotion. Honeybees have been a model organism for sky-compass orientation for more than 70 years, but there is still very limited knowledge about the structure and function of their CX. To advance and facilitate research on this brain area, we created a high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee's CX and associated neuropils, including the posterior optic tubercles, the bulbs, and the anterior optic tubercles. To this end, we developed a modified version of the iterative shape averaging technique, which allowed us to achieve high volumetric accuracy of the neuropil models. For a finer definition of spatial locations within the central body, we defined layers based on immunostaining against the neuropeptides locustatachykinin, FMRFamide, gastrin/cholecystokinin, and allatostatin and included them into the atlas by elastic registration. Our honeybee CX atlas provides a platform for future neuroanatomical work.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that robust sex differences exist in the processing of acute and chronic pain in both rodents and humans. However, the underlying mechanism has not been well characterized. The dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord is the fundamental building block of ascending and descending pain pathways. It has been shown that numerous neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems in the spinal cord, including the endocannabinoid system and its main receptor, the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R), play vital roles in processing nociceptive information. Our previous findings have shown that <i>CB<sub>1</sub>R</i> mRNA is widely expressed in the brain in sex-dependent patterns. However, the sex-, lamina-, and cell-type-specific characteristics of CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in the spinal cord have not been fully described. In this study, the <i>CB<sub>1</sub>R-iCre-EGFP</i> mouse strain was generated to label and identify CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive (CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup>) cells. We reported no sex difference in CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord, but a dynamic distribution within superficial laminae II and III in female mice between estrus and nonestrus phases. Furthermore, the cell-type-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R expression pattern in the dorsal horn was similar in both sexes. Over 50% of CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup> cells were GABAergic neurons, and approximately 25% were glycinergic and 20â30% were glutamatergic neurons. The CB<sub>1</sub>R-expressing cells also represented a subset of spinal projection neurons. Overall, our work indicates a highly consistent distribution pattern of CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup> cells in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord in males and females.</p>

     alt="From retina to motoneurons: A substrate for visuomotor transformation in salamanders"/>
<p>We provide anatomical and physiological evidence of a retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway in salamanders. This pathway provides a substrate for the transformation of visual information into a motor command and is well positioned to control orienting behaviors when approaching a prey for instance.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing, we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labeled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labeled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.</p>

     alt="Calcium-binding proteins typify the dopaminergic neuronal subtypes in the ventral tegmental area of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Dopamine (DA) neurons residing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch demonstrate distinct differences in size and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir). The DA neurons in VTA were smaller than those in SN. Based on TH-ir, VTA neurons have been demarcated as subtype 1, 2, and 3. The further study probed the nature of the calcium binding proteins (CBPs), namely, Calbindin (CB)-, Calretinin (CR)-, Parvalbumin (PV)-, and Secretagogin (SCGN)-expressing DA neurons in the VTA and SN. CBPs mRNA and protein showed differential expression in VTA subdivisions and SN. While the subtype 1 TH neurons in the VTA were CB- or CR-negative, subtype 2 and 3 TH neurons co-expressed CB and CR, respectively. Neurons expressing SCGN were observed only in the VTA. All subtypes of TH neurons in the VTA co-expressed PV, and the PV and TH-ir showed reciprocal relationship.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) regulate neuronal function in midbrain dopamine (DA)-ergic neurons in mammals by buffering and sensing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and vesicular release. In birds, the equivalent set of neurons are important in song learning, directed singing, courtship, and energy balance, yet the status of CBPs in these neurons is unknown. Herein, for the first time, we probe the nature of CBPs, namely, Calbindin-, Calretinin-, Parvalbumin-, and Secretagogin-expressing DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch, <i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>. qRT-PCR analysis of ventral midbrain tissue fragment revealed higher Calbindin- and Calretinin-mRNA levels compared to Parvalbumin and Secretagogin. Application of immunofluorescence showed CBP-immunoreactive (-i) neurons in VTA (anterior [VTAa], mid [VTAm], caudal [VTAc]), SN (compacta [SNc], and reticulata [SNr]). Compared to VTAa, higher Calbindin- and Parvalbumin-immunoreactivity (-ir), and lower Calretinin-ir were observed in VTAm and VTAc. Secretagogin-ir was highly localized to VTAa. In SN, Calbindin- and Calretinin-ir were higher in SNc, SNr was Parvalbumin enriched, and Secretagogin-ir was not detected. Weak, moderate, and intense tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-i VTA neurons were demarcated as subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While subtype 1 TH-i neurons were neither Calbindin- nor Calretinin-i, â¼80 and â¼65% subtype 2 and â¼30 and â¼45% subtype 3 TH-i neurons co-expressed Calbindin and Calretinin, respectively. All TH-i neuronal subtypes co-expressed Parvalbumin with reciprocal relationship with TH-ir. We suggest that the CBPs may determine VTA DA neuronal heterogeneity and differentially regulate their activity in <i>T. guttata</i>.</p>

     alt="A versatile transcription factor: Multiple roles of orthopedia a (otpa) beyond its restricted localization in dopaminergic systems of developing and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) brains"/><p>The complete array of expression domains of the <i>orthopedia a</i> (<i>otpa</i>) gene is reported in the early adult zebrafish brain using immunohistochemistry and epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. Newly defined Otpa-positive neuroanatomical areas include the ventral and prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zones and various brainstem nuclei including the perilemniscal nucleus and nucleus lateralis valvulae. These data are summarized in the schematic drawing. Double-labeling with a tyrosine hydroxylase antibody confirms cellular colocalization exclusively in two posterior tubercular nuclei (TPp-m; PTN; a/a1-b/b1). Using <i>shh-</i> and <i>islet1</i>-related zebrafish transgenic lines, colocalization of <i>shh</i> and Otpa is shown in posterior tubercular dopaminergic cells (c) with ascending projections to the subpallium, and of <i>islet1</i> in the ventral hypothalamic zone (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many transcription factors boost neural development and differentiation in specific directions and serve for identifying similar or homologous structures across species. The expression of Orthopedia (Otp) is critical for the development of certain cell groups along the vertebrate neuraxis, for example, the medial amygdala or hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons. Therefore, the primary focus of the present study is the distribution of Orthopedia a (Otpa) in the larval and adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) brain. Since Otpa is also critical for the development of zebrafish basal diencephalic dopaminergic cells, colocalization of Otpa with the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is studied. Cellular colocalization of Otpa and dopamine is only seen in magnocellular neurons of the periventricular posterior tubercular nucleus and in the posterior tuberal nucleus. Otpa-positive cells occur in many additional structures along the zebrafish neuraxis, from the secondary prosencephalon down to the hindbrain. Furthermore, Otpa expression is studied in <i>shh</i>-GFP and <i>islet1</i>-GFP transgenic zebrafish. Otpa-positive cells only express <i>shh</i> in dopaminergic magnocellular periventricular posterior tubercular cells, and only colocalize with <i>islet1</i>-GFP in the ventral zone and prerecessÂ caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone and the perilemniscal nucleus. The scarcity of cellular colocalization of Otpa in <i>islet1</i>-GFP cells indicates that the Shh<i>-islet1</i> neurogenetic pathway is not active in most Otpa-expressing domains. Our analysis reveals detailed correspondences between mouse and zebrafish forebrain territories including the zebrafish intermediate nucleus of the ventral telencephalon and the mouse medial amygdala. The zebrafish preoptic Otpa-positive domain represents the neuropeptidergic supraopto-paraventricular region of all tetrapods. Otpa domains in the zebrafish basal plate hypothalamus suggest that the ventral periventricular hypothalamic zone corresponds to the <i>otp</i>-expressing basal hypothalamic tuberal field in the mouse. Furthermore, the mouse <i>otp</i> domain in the mammillary hypothalamus compares partly to our Otpa-positive domain in the prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone (Hc-a).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The giant mimivirus 1.2 Mb genome is elegantly organized into a 30 nm diameter helical protein shield</a></h4>

              
                Mimivirus is the prototype of the <i>Mimiviridae</i> family of giant dsDNA viruses. Little is known about the organization of the 1.2 Mb genome inside the membrane-limited nucleoid filling the ~0.5 Âµm icosahedral capsids. Cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography and proteomics revealed that it is encased into a ~30 nm diameter helical protein shell surprisingly composed of two GMC-type oxidoreductases, which also form the glycosylated fibrils decorating the capsid. The genome is arranged in 5- or 6-start left-handed super-helices, with each DNA-strand lining the central channel. This luminal channel of the nucleoprotein fiber is wide enough to accommodate oxidative stress proteins and RNA polymerase subunits identified by proteomics. Such elegant supramolecular organization would represent a remarkable evolutionary strategy for packaging and protecting the genome, in a state ready for immediate transcription upon unwinding in the host cytoplasm. The parsimonious use of the same protein in two unrelated substructures of the virion is unexpected for a giant virus with thousand genes at its disposal.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global analysis of cytosine and adenine DNA modifications across the tree of life</a></h4>

              
                Interpreting the function and metabolism of enzymatic DNA modifications requires both position-specific and global quantities. Sequencing-based techniques that deliver the former have become broadly accessible, but analytical methods for the global quantification of DNA modifications have thus far been applied mostly to individual problems. We established a mass spectrometric method for the sensitive and accurate quantification of multiple enzymatic DNA modifications. Then, we isolated DNA from 124 archean, bacterial, fungal, plant, and mammalian species, and several tissues and created a resource of global DNA modification quantities. Our dataset provides insights into the general nature of enzymatic DNA modifications, reveals unique biological cases, and provides complementary quantitative information to normalize and assess the accuracy of sequencing-based detection of DNA modifications. We report that only three of the studied DNA modifications, methylcytosine (5mdC), methyladenine (N6mdA) and hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmdC), were detected above a picomolar detection limit across species, and dominated in higher eukaryotes (5mdC), in bacteria (N6mdA), or the vertebrate central nervous systems (5hmdC). All three modifications were detected simultaneously in only one of the tested species, <i>Raphanus sativus</i>. In contrast, these modifications were either absent or detected only at trace quantities, across all yeasts and insect genomes studied. Further, we reveal interesting biological cases. For instance, in <i>Allium cepa</i>, <i>Helianthus annuus</i>, or <i>Andropogon gerardi</i>, more than 35% of cytosines were methylated. Additionally, next to the mammlian CNS, 5hmdC was also detected in plants like <i>Lepidium sativum</i> and was found on 8% of cytosines in the <i>Garra barreimiae</i> brain samples. Thus, identifying unexpected levels of DNA modifications in several wild species, our resource underscores the need to address biological diversity for studying DNA modifications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Large protein complex interfaces have evolved to promote cotranslational assembly</a></h4>

              
                Assembly pathways of protein complexes should be precise and efficient to minimise misfolding and unwanted interactions with other proteins in the cell. One way to achieve this efficiency is by seeding assembly pathways during translation via the cotranslational assembly of subunits. While recent evidence suggests that such cotranslational assembly is widespread, little is known about the properties of protein complexes associated with the phenomenon. Here, using a combination of proteome-specific protein complex structures and publicly available ribosome profiling data, we show that cotranslational assembly is particularly common between subunits that form large intermolecular interfaces. To test whether large interfaces have evolved to promote cotranslational assembly, as opposed to cotranslational assembly being a non-adaptive consequence of large interfaces, we compared the sizes of first and last translated interfaces of heteromeric subunits in bacterial, yeast, and human complexes. When considering all together, we observe the N-terminal interface to be larger than the C-terminal interface 54% of the time, increasing to 64% when we exclude subunits with only small interfaces, which are unlikely to cotranslationally assemble. This strongly suggests that large interfaces have evolved as a means to maximise the chance of successful cotranslational subunit binding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">3D single cell migration driven by temporal correlation between oscillating force dipoles</a></h4>

              
                Directional cell locomotion requires symmetry breaking between the front and rear of the cell. In some cells, symmetry breaking manifests itself in a directional flow of actin from the front to the rear of the cell. Many cells, especially in physiological 3D matrices do not show such coherent actin dynamics and present seemingly competing protrusion/retraction dynamics at their front and back. How symmetry breaking manifests itself for such cells is therefore elusive. We take inspiration from the scallop theorem proposed by Purcell for micro-swimmers in Newtonian fluids: self-propelled objects undergoing persistent motion at low Reynolds number must follow a cycle of shape changes that breaks temporal symmetry. We report similar observations for cells crawling in 3D. We quantified cell motion using a combination of 3D live cell imaging, visualization of the matrix displacement and a minimal model with multipolar expansion. We show that our cells embedded in a 3D matrix form myosin-driven force dipoles at both sides of the nucleus, that locally and periodically pinch the matrix. The existence of a phase shift between the two dipoles is required for directed cell motion which manifests itself as cycles with finite area in the dipole-quadrupole diagram, a formal equivalence to the Purcell cycle. We confirm this mechanism by triggering local dipolar contractions with a laser. This leads to directed motion. Our study reveals that these cells control their motility by synchronizing dipolar forces distributed at front and back. This result opens new strategies to externally control cell motion as well as for the design of micro-crawlers.

                Electrical stimulation with neural implants can restore lost sensory function by evoking patterns of activity in neural populations. However, stimulation with many electrodes generally combines nonlinearly to influence neural activity, and is thus difficult to control. To overcome this challenge, we propose a dynamic stimulation approach that exploits the slow time scales of downstream neural processing and the independence of distant electrodes by encoding a complex visual stimulus into a rapid, greedily chosen, temporally dithered and spatially multiplexed sequence of simple stimulation patterns. The approach was evaluated using a lab prototype of a retinal implant: large-scale, high-resolution multi-electrode stimulation and recording of primate retinal ganglion cells ex vivo. Greedy dithering and multiplexing provided a powerful framework for optimizing electrical stimulation, greatly enhancing expected performance compared to existing open loop approaches. The modular framework enabled parallel extensions to naturalistic and dynamic viewing conditions, optimization of perceptual similarity measures and efficient hardware implementation for retinal implants.

                There is mounting evidence for predictive coding theory from computational, neuroimaging, and psychological research. However there remains a lack of research exploring how predictive brain function develops across childhood. To address this gap, we used paediatric magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the evoked magnetic fields of 18 younger children (M = 4.1 years) and 19 older children (M = 6.2 years) as they listened to a 12-minute auditory oddball paradigm. For each child, we computed a MisMatch Field (MMF): an electrophysiological component that is widely interpreted as a neural signature of predictive coding. Consistent with our hypotheses, the older children showed significantly larger MMF amplitudes relative to the younger children. Furthermore, the older children showed a significantly larger MMF amplitude in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; 0.312 to 0.33 s) relative to the younger children, p < .05. These findings support the idea that predictive brain function develops during childhood, with increasing involvement of the frontal cortex in response to prediction errors. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the brain function underpinning child cognitive development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in oxycodone addiction-like behaviors in a large cohort of heterogeneous stock (HS) rats</a></h4>

              
                Family and twin studies demonstrate that genetic factors determine 20-60% of the vulnerability to opioid use disorder. However, the genes/alleles that mediate the risk of developing addiction-related behaviors, including the sensitivity to the analgesic efficacy of opioids, the development of tolerance, dependence, and escalation of oxycodone taking and seeking, have been ill-defined, thus hindering efforts to design pharmacological interventions to enable precision medicine strategies. Here we characterized oxycodone addiction-like behaviors in heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, that show high genetic diversity that mimics the high genetic variability in humans. HS rats were allowed to self-administer oxycodone for two h/daily for four days (ShA) and then moved to 12h/daily (LgA) for 14 days. Animals were screened for motivation to self-administer oxycodone using a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement and for the development of withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance to the analgesic effects of oxycodone using the von-Frey and tail immersion tests, respectively. To reduce cohort-specific effects, we used cohorts of 46-60 rats and normalized the response level within cohorts using a Z-score. To take advantage of the four opioid-related behaviors and further identify subjects that are consistently vulnerable vs. resilient to compulsive oxycodone use, we computed an Addiction Index by averaging normalized responding (Z-scores) for the four behavioral tests. Results showed high individual variability between vulnerable and resilient rats, likely to facilitate the detection of gene variants associated with vulnerable vs. resilient individuals. Such data will have considerable translational value for designing follow-up studies in humans.

                Brain size differs substantially between human males and females. This difference in total intracranial volume (TIV) can cause bias when employing machine-learning approaches for the investigation of sex differences in brain morphology. TIV-biased models will likely not capture actual qualitative sex differences in brain organization but rather learn to classify an individual's sex based on brain size differences, thus leading to spurious and misleading conclusions, for example when comparing brain morphology between cisgender- and transgender individuals. Here, TIV bias in sex classification models applied to cis- and transgender individuals was systematically investigated by controlling for brain size either through featurewise confound removal or by matching training samples for TIV. Our results provide evidence that non-TIV-biased models can classify the sex of both cis- and transgender individuals with high accuracy, highlighting the importance of appropriate modelling to avoid bias in automated decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals heterogeneity and a dynamic regenerative response of quiescent radial glia in adult zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                In zebrafish telencephalon, radial glial cells (RGs) show a remarkable ability to regenerate damaged neural tissue by re-initiating cell proliferation to produce neural precursors to rebuild the lost neural circuit. However, it is not fully understood how RGs respond to brain damage to initiate this regenerative response. Here we applied single-cell transcriptomics to RGs in adult zebrafish telencephalon and identified five RG subtypes, which are classified into four quiescent RGs (qRGs) and one proliferating RG (pRG). The four qRGs differentially express distinct subsets of qRG markers, suggesting heterogeneity of qRG in zebrafish adult brain. Interestingly, one qRG subtype shows high expression of ribosomal proteins, and its fraction increases in response to brain damage. Consistently, the mTOR pathway is activated in RGs near the injury site. It was reported that inflammatory responses of brain-resident immune cells, microglia, are required for inducing regenerative responses of RGs in zebrafish. Genetical elimination of microglia not only suppressed the damage-induced regenerative response of RGs, but also decreased the fraction of the ribosomal expression-enriched qRGs. Our pseudo-time analysis suggests that putative dormant RGs produce ribosomal expression-enriched qRGs through activation of ribosomal genesis, as well as suppression of cholesterol biogenesis, and pRGs through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Our findings reveal heterogeneity of qRGs in adult zebrafish brain and their dynamic regenerative response to brain damage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain structural covariances in the ageing brain in the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural covariances or pairwise correlations describe how morphologic properties of brain regions are related to one another across individuals. Although it is reported that brain structural covariance changes during brain development, it is not clear how structural covariance relates to the ageing process. Here we investigated the human brain structural covariances of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in the ageing brain and their associations with age, cognition, and longevity polygenic risk score (longevity-PRS) by using cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank (N = 42075, aged 45-83 years, M/F=19752 /22323). The sample of participants was divided into 84 non-overlapping groups based on their age. The older the age group, the greater the variability in the whole brain structural covariance. However, there was a differential rate of age-related increase of variance between males and females. The variance of females started lower than those of males and then increased with age with a greater gradient than that of males. There was a consistent and significant enrichment of pairwise correlations within the occipital lobe in ageing process. The cortical thickness and subcortical covariances in older groups were significantly different from those in the youngest group. Sixty-two of the total 528 pairs of cortical thickness correlations and 10 of the total 21 pairs of subcortical volume correlations were significantly associated with age after Bonferroni correction. Specifically, with an increasing age, most decreased cortical thickness correlations were found between the regions within the frontal lobe as well as between the frontal lobe regions and regions in other lobes, while pairwise correlations within occipital lobe regions were all strengthening. Most of these correlations were also associated with global cognition and weakly associated with longevity-PRS. These findings revealed that the structural covariance was not stable during ageing. Given the thinning of the cortex and the volumetric reduction of subcortical structures seen in the ageing process, an increased pairwise correlation between the brain regions in the older brain suggested a strengthened coordinated decline between the brain regions involved. However, some of the brain regions demonstrated a differentiated rate of decline which was shown as the inversed or reduced pairwise correlations between these regions.

                Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregation and loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Risk of PD arises due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which may interact, termed gene-environment (GxE) interactions. An inverse association between smoking and risk of PD is well-established, and a previous genome-wide GxE interaction study identified genetic variation in the synaptic-vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) locus as an important mediator of the degree to which smoking is inversely associated with PD. Objective: We sought to determine the mechanism of the smoking-SV2C interaction in a Drosophila model of PD. Methods: Flies expressing human alpha-synuclein in all neurons develop the hallmarks of PD, including motor dysfunction, loss of DA neurons, and formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions. We assessed the effects of increasing doses of nicotine on these parameters of neurodegeneration, in the presence or absence of SV2 knockdown. Results: alpha-synuclein-expressing flies treated with nicotine had improvement in locomotion, DA neuron counts, and in alpha-synuclein aggregation. However, in alpha-synuclein-expressing flies in which Drosophila orthologs of SV2 were knocked down, nicotine failed to rescue neurodegeneration. Conclusions: This work confirms a GxE interaction between nicotine and SV2, defines a role for this interaction in alpha-synuclein proteostasis, and suggests that future clinical trials on nicotine should consider genetic variation in SV2C. Further, this provides proof of concept that our model can be used for mechanistic study of GxE, paving the way for investigation of additional GxE interactions or identification of novel GxE.

                Background: Population-based neuroscience offers opportunities to examine important but understudied sociocultural factors, such as acculturation. Acculturation refers to the extent to which an individual retains their cultural heritage and/or adopts the receiving society's culture and is particularly salient among Hispanic/Latinx immigrants. Acculturation has been linked to vulnerability to substance use, depression, and suicide and is known to influence family dynamics between caregivers and their children. Methods: We investigated first- and second-generation Hispanic/Latinx caregivers in the ABCD Study and examined how caregivers' acculturative orientation impacts their mental health, as well as the mental health and brain function of their children. Neuroimaging analyses focused on regions associated with self- and affiliation-based social processing (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporoparietal junction). Results: We identified two profiles of caregiver acculturation: bicultural (retains heritage culture while adopting US culture) and detached (discards heritage culture and rejects US culture). Bicultural caregivers exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing problems compared to detached caregivers; further, youth exhibited similar internalizing effects across caregiver profiles. In addition, youth with bicultural caregivers displayed increased resting-state brain activity (i.e., fALFF and ReHo) in the left insula, which has been linked to psychopathology; however, differences in long-range functional connectivity were not significant. Conclusions: Caregiver acculturation is an important familial factor linked to significant differences in youth mental health and insula activity. Future work should examine sociocultural and neurodevelopmental changes across adolescence to assess long-term outcomes and determine whether localized, corticolimbic brain effects are ultimately translated into long-range connectivity differences.

                Visual word processing involves the automatic decoding of orthographic, phonological and semantic information. The mappings of these information in a writing system comprise an important feature of visual words: orthographic regularity and consistency. Recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies have investigated the automatic processing mechanism of orthographic regularity (i.e., words vs. pseudowords) among visual words. However, the automated mechanism and temporal dynamics of different types of orthographic consistency effects (e.g., orthographic positional consistency, orthography-to-phonology consistency vs. orthography-to-semantics consistency) have never been studied. This study explored automatic neural representation for orthographic consistency effects in visual words and its temporal dynamics through an oddball paradigm. Three types of oddball sequences were designed with Chinese characters as stimuli, including consistent Chinese characters as standard stimuli and three types of inconsistent characters (orthographic positional inconsistent, orthography-to-phonology inconsistent vs. orthography-to-semantics inconsistent) as deviant stimuli, respectively. Significant visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) activities were observed in all three types of inconsistent characters, which suggests automatic processing caused by orthographic consistency violations. Time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) further revealed that there are different temporal dynamics of automatic neural representations for the three types of consistency features. The representation of positional consistency emerged earlier within an independent time window, while the representation of phonetic and semantic consistency emerged later, and partially overlapped. These findings provide novel insights for the temporal gradient characteristics of automated representation structure of orthography consistency information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">System-level high-amplitude co-fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                Edge time series decompose interregional correlations (functional connectivity; FC) into their time-varying contributions. Previous studies have revealed that brief, high-amplitude, and globally-defined "events" contribute disproportionately to the time-averaged FC pattern. This whole-brain view prioritizes systems that occupy vast neocortical territory, possibly obscuring extremely high-amplitude co-fluctuations that are localized to smaller brain systems. Here, we investigate local events detected at the system level, assessing their independent contributions to global events and characterizing their repertoire during resting-state and movie-watching scans. We find that, as expected, global events are more likely to occur when large brain systems exhibit events. Next, we study the co-fluctuation patterns that coincide with system events--i.e. events detected locally based on the behavior of individual brain systems. We find that although each system exhibits a distinct co-fluctuation pattern that is dissimilar from those associated with global events, the patterns can nonetheless be grouped into two broad categories, corresponding to events that coincide with sensorimotor and attention systems and, separately, association systems. We then investigate system-level events during movie-watching, discovering that the timing of events in sensorimotor and attention systems decouple, yielding reductions in co-fluctuation amplitude. Next, we show that by associating each edge with its most similar system-averaged edge time series, we recover overlapping community structure, obviating the need for applying clustering algorithms to high-dimensional edge time series. Finally, we focus on cortical responses to system-level events in subcortical areas and the cerebellum. We show that these structures coincide with spatially distributed cortical co-fluctuations, centered on prefrontal and somatosensory systems. Collectively, the findings presented here help clarify the relative contributions of large and small systems to global events, as well as their independent behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct chaperonopathy in skeletal muscle associated with the dominant variant in DNAJB4</a></h4>

              
                DnaJ homolog, subfamily B, member 4, a member of the heat shock protein 40 chaperones encoded by DNAJB4, is highly expressed in myofibers. We identified a heterozygous c.270 T>A (p.F90L) variant in DNAJB4 in a family with a dominantly inherited distal myopathy, in which affected members have specific features on muscle pathology represented by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions and the accumulation of desmin, p62, HSP70 and DNAJB4 predominantly in type 1 fibers. Both Dnajb4-F90L knock-in and knockout mice developed muscle weakness and recapitulated the patient muscle pathology in the soleus muscle, where DNAJB4 has the highest expression. These data indicate that the identified variant is causative resulting in defective chaperone function and selective muscle degeneration in specific muscle fibers. This study demonstrates the importance of DNAJB4 in skeletal muscle proteostasis by identifying the associated chaperonopathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Model of Hippocampal Replay Driven by Experience and Environmental Structure Facilitates Spatial Learning</a></h4>

              
                Replay of neuronal sequences in the hippocampus during resting states and sleep play an important role in learning and memory consolidation. Consistent with these functions, replay sequences have been shown to obey current spatial constraints. Nevertheless, replay does not necessarily reflect previous behavior and can construct never-experienced sequences. Here we propose a stochastic replay mechanism that prioritizes experiences based on three variables: 1. Experience strength, 2. experience similarity, and 3. inhibition of return. Using this prioritized replay mechanism to train reinforcement learning agents leads to far better performance than using random replay. Its performance is close to the state-of-the-art, but biologically unrealistic, algorithm by Mattar & Daw (2018). Importantly, our model reproduces diverse types of replay because of the stochasticity of the replay mechanism and experience-dependent differences between the three variables. In conclusion, a unified replay mechanism generates diverse replay statistics and is efficient in driving spatial learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SorCS1 inhibits amyloid-Î² binding to neurexin and rescues amyloid-Î²-induced synaptic pathology</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), toxic peptide aggregates found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), cause synapse pathology. A{beta}Os interact with Neurexins (NRXs), key synaptic organizers, and this interaction dampens normal trafficking and function of NRXs. Axonal trafficking of NRX is in part regulated by its interaction with SorCS1, a protein sorting receptor, but the impact of SorCS1 regulation of NRXs in A{beta} pathology was previously unstudied. Here, we show competitive interaction of SorCS1 and A{beta}Os with {beta}-NRXs and rescue effects of SorCS1 on A{beta}O-induced synaptic pathology. Like A{beta}Os, SorCS1 binds to NRX1{beta} through the histidine-rich-domain (HRD) of NRX1{beta}, and SorCS1 and A{beta}Os compete for NRX1{beta} binding. In cultured hippocampal neurons, SorCS1 colocalizes with NRX1{beta} on the axon surface, and axonal expression of SorCS1 rescues A{beta}O-induced impairment of NRX-mediated presynaptic organization and presynaptic vesicle recycling as well as A{beta}O-induced structural defects in excitatory synapses. Thus, we reveal a role of SorCS1 in the rescue of A{beta}O-induced NRX dysfunction and synaptic pathology, providing the basis for a novel potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that interferes with multiple aspects of daily functioning. Malingering or feigning of symptoms can be a major challenge during ADHD assessment. Stimulant medication abuse, misuse and diversion may constitute another challenge during management. A literature search of the past 15 years on the topic continued to suggest that there are several reasons for malingering and faking ADHD symptoms. Some of the reasons include the intent to obtain prescriptions for stimulant medications for performance enhancement, to gain access to additional school services and accommodations, to use recreationally and to sell as a street drug. In some countries, patients may receive additional tax or student loan benefits. Several researchers suggested that self-report rating measures are easily simulated by patients without ADHD. They concluded that no questionnaire has proved sufficiently robust against false positives. Some clinical factors that may suggest malingering during the ADHD assessment are highlighted and some available tests to detect malingering are discussed.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: there is an ongoing debate about whether psychopathic traits increase or decrease cognitive empathy/Theory of Mind. (2) Methods: using a representative sample of 204 Spanish convicted inmates incarcerated at the Pereiro de Aguiar Penitentiary in Ourense, Spain, we investigated the relationship between two tools for the assessment of psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and the Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathic Personality (CAPP), and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), a well-known measure of cognitive empathy. (3) Results: The results showed no clear connection between the scores on the psychopathy assessment tools and RMET performance. This lack of association was stronger when the age variable was included in the multivariate analysis. (4) Conclusions: the results of this study failed to detect any clear link between psychopathy and cognitive empathy performance. Accordingly, our results indicate that psychopathy neither improves nor worsens cognitive empathy.</p>

	<p>Objective: The Ki-67 index is an indicator of the active proliferation and aggressive behavior of pituitary adenomas (PAs). Appropriate pre- and intra-operatives of the Ki-67 index can help surgeons develop better and more personalized treatment strategies for patients with PAs. This study aimed to investigate the influence factors for predicting the Ki-67 index in PAs. Methods: Data of 178 patients with PAs confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. According to the Ki-67 index, the patients were divided into the Ki-67 &amp;amp;lt; 3% and Ki-67 &amp;amp;ge; 3% cohorts. Patient data, including age, sex, postoperative immunohistochemical pituitary hormone positive index, Knosp grade, tumor breaking through the sellar floor, rich blood supply to the tumor, tumor located inside the sella, erosion of the dorsum sellae bone, and pituitary-specific transcription factor, were collected. A univariate logistic analysis was used to evaluate the influence factors for a high Ki-67 index. Multiple regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to analyze the factors with p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. The mutant status of Ki-67 index was predicted by nomogram. Results: Multivariate regression analysis showed that rich blood supply to the tumor and erosion of the dorsum sellae bone were independent risk factors for the Ki-67 proliferation index. The ROC curves demonstrated that age, rich blood supply to the tumor, and erosion of the dorsum sellae bone can predict the occurrence of a high Ki-67 index. Together, the three risk factors provide a stronger ability to predict the Ki-67 index. The nomogram was developed and validated. Conclusion: Age, rich blood supply to the tumor, and erosion of the dorsum sellae bone are influencing factors for predicting the Ki-67 index. Suitable nomogram prediction models were developed and validated, and there is potential for personalized treatment for PA patients.</p>

	<p>This systematic review aimed to investigate the methodological quality and the effects of fundamental motor skills and physical activity interventions on cognitive and academic skills in 3- to 7-year-old children with special educational needs. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) statement. A literature search was carried out in April 2020 (updated in January 2022) using seven electronic databases, including ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool. Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d effect sizes and post-hoc power analyses were conducted for the included studies. Altogether 22 studies (1883 children) met the inclusion criteria, representing children at-risk for learning difficulties, due to family background (nstudies = 8), children with learning difficulties (nstudies = 7), learning disabilities (nstudies = 5), and physical disabilities (nstudies = 2). Two of the included 22 studies displayed strong, one moderate, and 19 studies weak methodological quality. The intervention effects appeared to be somewhat dependent on the severity of the learning difficulty; in cognitive and language skills, the effects were largest in children at-risk due to family background, whereas in executive functions the effects were largest in children with learning disabilities. However, due to the vast heterogeneity of the included studies, and a rather low methodological quality, it is challenging to summarize the findings in a generalizable manner. Thus, additional high-quality research is required to determine the effectiveness of the interventions.</p>

	<p>Background: It is unclear whether miR-491-5p, miR-206, miR-21-5p or miR-3123 are associated with functional outcomes and hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between these four microRNAs and functional outcomes, as well as spontaneous HT after AIS; Methods: We included 215 AIS patients and retrospectively assayed for miR-21-5p, miR-206, miR-3123 and miR-491-5p levels in serum. Poor functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score &amp;amp;ge; 3. Spontaneous HT referred to hemorrhage detected in follow-up brain imaging but not on admission, without reperfusion therapies. Logistic regression, generalized additive model and 2-piecewise regression model were used to explore the independent, non-linear correlation between miRNA expression levels and outcomes; Results: We included 215 AIS patients. Higher miR-491-5p level independently reduced the risk of poor functional outcomes at 1 year (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82&amp;amp;ndash;0.98, corrected p value = 0.044). Higher miR-206 level significantly increased the risk of spontaneous HT (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.17&amp;amp;ndash;2.30, corrected p value = 0.016). There was a nonlinear correlation found between miR-491-5p level and 1 year outcome with an inflection point of 2.180, while an approximately linear correlation was observed with an inflection point of 2.037 between miR-206 level and spontaneous HT; Conclusions: Higher serum miR-491-5p level independently reduced risk of 1-year poor functional outcome of AIS patients. Higher serum miR-206 level independently increased the risk of spontaneous HT in AIS patients. These two miRNAs may be as the potential biomarkers for improving prognosis after AIS.</p>

	<p>Ischemic stroke is a life-threatening condition that also frequently results in long-term disability. Currently, intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy is the most popular treatment. However, the narrow time window and related complications limit the treatment benefits. Exosomes have recently emerged as ideal therapeutic candidates for ischemic stroke with the ability to pass through the blood_brain barrier and mediate intercellular communication, in addition, exosomes and their contents can be bioengineered to implement targeted delivery. In the last two decades, exosomes and exosomal noncoding RNAs have been found to be involved in the pathophysiological progression of ischemic stroke, including atherosclerosis, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurovascular remodeling. In this review, we describe the latest progress regarding the role of exosomal long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs in the occurrence, progression, and recovery of ischemic stroke. Exploration of exosomal noncoding RNAs and their correlated effects in ischemic stroke may facilitate accurate diagnosis, and they may serve as new therapeutic targets for the disease.</p>

	<p>Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder with high clinical heterogeneity manifested by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. The classification of the symptom dimensional subtypes is helpful for further exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the clinical heterogeneity of OCD. Washing and checking symptoms are the two major symptom subtypes in OCD, but the neural mechanisms of the different types of symptoms are not yet clearly understood. The purpose of this study was to compare regional and network functional alterations between washing and checking OCD based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Methods: In total, 90 subjects were included, including 15 patients in the washing group, 30 patients in the checking group, and 45 healthy controls (HCs). Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to compare the differences in regional spontaneous neural activity among the three groups, and local indicators were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as imaging markers for the prediction of the clinical subtypes of OCD. Furthermore, differently activated local brain areas, as regions of interest (ROIs), were used to explore differences in altered brain functioning between washing and checking OCD symptoms based on a functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Results: Extensive abnormalities in spontaneous brain activity involving frontal, temporal, and occipital regions were observed in the patients compared to the HCs. The differences in local brain functioning between checking and washing OCD were mainly concentrated in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, right angular gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the hyperactivation right middle frontal gyrus had a better discriminatory value for checking and washing OCD. Furthermore, the seed-based FC analysis revealed higher FC between the left medial superior frontal gyrus and right caudate nucleus compared to that in the healthy controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that extensive local differences exist in intrinsic spontaneous activity among the checking group, washing group, and HCs. The neural basis of checking OCD may be related to dysfunction in the frontal&amp;amp;ndash;striatal network, which distinguishes OCD from washing OCD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Duplex Labeling and Manipulation of Neuronal Proteins Using Sequential CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in methods enable the labeling of individual endogenous proteins to faithfully determine their spatiotemporal distribution in cells. However, reliable multiplexing of knock-in events in neurons remains challenging because of cross talk between editing events. To overcome this, we developed conditional activation of knock-in expression (CAKE), allowing efficient, flexible, and accurate multiplex genome editing. To diminish cross talk, CAKE is based on sequential, recombinase-driven guide RNA (gRNA) expression to control the timing of genomic integration of each donor sequence. We show that CAKE is broadly applicable in rat neurons to co-label various endogenous proteins, including cytoskeletal proteins, synaptic scaffolds, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptor subunits. To take full advantage of CAKE, we resolved the nanoscale co-distribution of endogenous synaptic proteins using super-resolution microscopy, demonstrating that their co-organization correlates with synapse size. Finally, we introduced inducible dimerization modules, providing acute control over synaptic receptor dynamics in living neurons. These experiments highlight the potential of CAKE to reveal new biological insight. Altogether, CAKE is a versatile method for multiplex protein labeling that enables the detection, localization, and manipulation of endogenous proteins in neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Polybasic Patches in Both C2 Domains of Synaptotagmin-1 Are Required for Evoked Neurotransmitter Release</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) is a vesicular calcium sensor required for synchronous neurotransmitter release, composed of a single-pass transmembrane domain linked to two C2 domains (C2A and C2B) that bind calcium, acidic lipids, and SNARE proteins that drive fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Despite its essential role, how Syt1 couples calcium entry to synchronous release is poorly understood. Calcium binding to C2B is critical for synchronous release, and C2B additionally binds the SNARE complex. The C2A domain is also required for Syt1 function, but it is not clear why. Here, we asked what critical feature of C2A may be responsible for its functional role and compared this to the analogous feature in C2B. We focused on highly conserved poly-lysine patches located on the sides of C2A (K189-192) and C2B (K324-327). We tested effects of charge-neutralization mutations in either region (Syt1<sup>K189-192A</sup> and Syt1<sup>K326-327A</sup>) side by side to determine their relative contributions to Syt1 function in cultured cortical neurons from mice of either sex and in single-molecule experiments. Combining electrophysiological recordings and optical tweezers measurements to probe dynamic single C2 domain&ndash;membrane interactions, we show that both C2A and C2B polybasic patches contribute to membrane binding, and both are required for evoked release. The size of the readily releasable vesicle pool and the rate of spontaneous release were unaffected, so both patches are likely required specifically for synchronization of release. We suggest these patches contribute to cooperative membrane binding, increasing the overall affinity of Syt1 for negatively charged membranes and facilitating evoked release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptotagmin-1 is a vesicular calcium sensor required for synchronous neurotransmitter release. Its tandem cytosolic C2 domains (C2A and C2B) bind calcium, acidic lipids, and SNARE proteins that drive fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. How calcium binding to Synaptotagmin-1 leads to release and the relative contributions of the C2 domains are unclear. Combining electrophysiological recordings from cultured neurons and optical tweezers measurements of single C2 domain&ndash;membrane interactions, we show that conserved polybasic regions in both domains contribute to membrane binding cooperatively, and both are required for evoked release, likely by increasing the overall affinity of Synaptotagmin-1 for acidic membranes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrins Bidirectionally Regulate the Efficacy of Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission and Control GABAergic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many decades, synaptic plasticity was believed to be restricted to excitatory transmission. However, in recent years, this view started to change, and now it is recognized that GABAergic synapses show distinct forms of activity-dependent long-term plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Herein, we asked whether signaling mediated by &beta;1 or &beta;3 subunit-containing integrins might be involved in regulating the efficacy of GABAergic synapses, including the NMDA receptor-dependent inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) in the hippocampus. We found that activation of &beta;3 integrin with fibrinogen induced a stable depression, whereas inhibition of &beta;1 integrin potentiated GABAergic synapses at CA1 pyramidal neurons in male mice. Additionally, compounds that interfere with the interaction of &beta;1 or &beta;3 integrins with extracellular matrix blocked the induction of NMDA-iLTP. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that integrins are key players in regulating the endogenous modulatory mechanisms of GABAergic inhibition and plasticity in the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy, schizophrenia, and anxiety are just a few medical conditions associated with dysfunctional inhibitory synaptic transmission. GABAergic synapses are known for their extraordinary susceptibility to modulation by endogenous factors and exogenous pharmacological agents. We describe here that integrins, adhesion proteins, play a key role in the modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Specifically, we show that interference with integrin-dependent adhesion results in a variety of effects on the amplitude and frequency of GABAergic mIPSCs. Activation of &beta;3 subunit-containing integrins induces inhibitory long-term depression, whereas the inhibition of &beta;1 subunit-containing integrins induces iLTP. Our results unveil an important mechanism controlling synaptic inhibition, which opens new avenues into the usage of integrin-aimed pharmaceuticals as modulators of GABAergic synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Corticotropin Releasing Factor Mediates KCa3.1 Inhibition, Hyperexcitability, and Seizures in Acquired Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common focal seizure disorder in adults, can be instigated in experimental animals by convulsant-induced status epilepticus (SE). Principal hippocampal neurons from SE-experienced epileptic male rats (post-SE neurons) display markedly augmented spike output compared with neurons from nonepileptic animals (non-SE neurons). This enhanced firing results from a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1, a subclass of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels generating the slow afterhyperpolarizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> current (<I>I</I><SUB>sAHP</SUB>). The inhibition of K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 in post-SE neurons leads to a marked reduction in amplitude of the <I>I</I><SUB>sAHP</SUB> that evolves during repetitive firing, as well as in amplitude of the associated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent component of the slow afterhyperpolarization potential (K<SUB>Ca</SUB>-sAHP). Here we show that K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 inhibition in post-SE neurons is induced by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) through its Type 1 receptor (CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R). Acute application of CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists restores K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 activity in post-SE neurons, normalizing K<SUB>Ca</SUB>-sAHP/<I>I</I><SUB>sAHP</SUB> amplitudes and neuronal spike output, without affecting these variables in non-SE neurons. Moreover, pharmacological antagonism of CRF<SUB>1</SUB>Rs <I>in vivo</I> reduces the frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures in post-SE chronically epileptic rats. These findings may provide a new vista for treating TLE.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy, a common neurologic disorder, often develops following a brain insult. Identifying key cellular mechanisms underlying acquired epilepsy is critical for developing effective antiepileptic therapies. In an experimental model of acquired epilepsy, principal hippocampal neurons manifest hyperexcitability because of downregulation of K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1, a subtype of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> ion channels. We show that K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 downregulation is mediated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) acting through its Type 1 receptor (CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R). Congruently, acute application of selective CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists restores K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 channel activity, leading to normalization of neuronal excitability. In the same model, injection of a CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonist to epileptic animals markedly decreases the frequency of electrographic seizures. Therefore, targeting CRF<SUB>1</SUB>Rs may provide a new strategy in the treatment of acquired epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">SECISBP2L-Mediated Selenoprotein Synthesis Is Essential for Autonomous Regulation of Oligodendrocyte Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thyroid hormone (TH) controls the timely differentiation of oligodendrocytes (OLs), and its deficiency can delay myelin development and cause mental retardation. Previous studies showed that the active TH T3 is converted from its prohormone T4 by the selenoprotein DIO2, whose mRNA is primarily expressed in astrocytes in the CNS. In the present study, we discovered that SECISBP2L is highly expressed in differentiating OLs and is required for DIO2 translation. Conditional knock-out (CKO) of Secisbp2l in OL lineage resulted in a decreased level of DIO2 and T3, accompanied by impaired OL differentiation, hypomyelination and motor deficits in both sexes of mice. Moreover, the defective differentiation of OLs in Secisbp2l mutants can be alleviated by T3 or its analog, but not the prohormone T4. The present study has provided strong evidence for the autonomous regulation of OL differentiation by its intrinsic T3 production mediated by the novel SECISBP2L-DIO2-T3 pathway during myelin development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Secisbp2l is specifically expressed in differentiating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and is essential for selenoprotein translation in OLs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Postsurgical Latent Pain Sensitization Is Driven by Descending Serotonergic Facilitation and Masked by {micro}-Opioid Receptor Constitutive Activity in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following tissue injury, latent sensitization (LS) of nociceptive signaling can persist indefinitely, kept in remission by compensatory &micro;-opioid receptor constitutive activity (MOR<SUB>CA</SUB>) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To demonstrate LS, we conducted plantar incision in mice and then waited 3&ndash;4 weeks for hypersensitivity to resolve. At this time (remission), systemic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist/inverse agonist naltrexone reinstated mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. We first tested the hypothesis that LS extends to serotonergic neurons in the rostral ventral medulla (RVM) that convey pronociceptive input to the spinal cord. We report that in male and female mice, hypersensitivity was accompanied by increased Fos expression in serotonergic neurons of the RVM, abolished on chemogenetic inhibition of RVM 5-HT neurons, and blocked by intrathecal injection of the 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB>R antagonist ondansetron; the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB>R antagonist MDL-11 939 had no effect. Second, to test for MOR<SUB>CA</SUB>, we microinjected the MOR inverse agonist <scp>d</scp>-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTAP) and/or neutral opioid receptor antagonist 6&beta;-naltrexol. Intra-RVM CTAP produced mechanical hypersensitivity at both hindpaws; 6&beta;-naltrexol had no effect by itself, but blocked CTAP-induced hypersensitivity. This indicates that MOR<SUB>CA</SUB>, rather than an opioid ligand-dependent mechanism, maintains LS in remission. We conclude that incision establishes LS in descending RVM 5-HT neurons that drives pronociceptive 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB>R signaling in the dorsal horn, and this LS is tonically opposed by MOR<SUB>CA</SUB> in the RVM. The 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptor is a promising therapeutic target for the development of drugs to prevent the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Surgery leads to latent pain sensitization and a compensatory state of endogenous pain control that is maintained long after tissue healing. Here, we show that either chemogenetic inhibition of serotonergic neuron activity in the RVM or pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptor signaling at the spinal cord blocks behavioral signs of postsurgical latent sensitization. We conclude that MOR<SUB>CA</SUB> in the RVM opposes descending serotonergic facilitation of LS and that the 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptor is a promising therapeutic target for the development of drugs to prevent the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Motion Perception Emerges from Dimensionality Reduction with Evolved Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity Rules</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nervous system is under tight energy constraints and must represent information efficiently. This is particularly relevant in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) in primates where neurons encode complex motion patterns to support a variety of behaviors. A sparse decomposition model based on a dimensionality reduction principle known as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was previously shown to account for a wide range of monkey MSTd visual response properties. This model resulted in sparse, parts-based representations that could be regarded as basis flow fields, a linear superposition of which accurately reconstructed the input stimuli. This model provided evidence that the seemingly complex response properties of MSTd may be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on their input. However, an open question is how a neural circuit could carry out this function. In the current study, we propose a spiking neural network (SNN) model of MSTd based on evolved spike-timing-dependent plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling (STDP-H) learning rules. We demonstrate that the SNN model learns compressed and efficient representations of the input patterns similar to the patterns that emerge from NMF, resulting in MSTd-like receptive fields observed in monkeys. This SNN model suggests that STDP-H observed in the nervous system may be performing a similar function as NMF with sparsity constraints, which provides a test bed for mechanistic theories of how MSTd may efficiently encode complex patterns of visual motion to support robust self-motion perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain may use dimensionality reduction and sparse coding to efficiently represent stimuli under metabolic constraints. Neurons in monkey area MSTd respond to complex optic flow patterns resulting from self-motion. We developed a spiking neural network model that showed MSTd-like response properties can emerge from evolving spike-timing-dependent plasticity with STDP-H parameters of the connections between then middle temporal area and MSTd. Simulated MSTd neurons formed a sparse, reduced population code capable of encoding perceptual variables important for self-motion perception. This model demonstrates that complex neuronal responses observed in MSTd may emerge from efficient coding and suggests that neurobiological plasticity, like STDP-H, may contribute to reducing the dimensions of input stimuli and allowing spiking neurons to learn sparse representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Caution Influences Avoidance and Approach Behaviors Differently</a></h4>

              
                <p>While conflict between incompatible goals has well-known effects on actions, in many situations the same action may produce harmful or beneficial consequences during different periods in a nonconflicting manner, e.g., crossing the street during a red or green light. To avoid harm, subjects must be cautious to inhibit the action specifically when it is punished, as in passive avoidance, but act when it is beneficial, as in active avoidance or active approach. In mice of both sexes performing a signaled action to avoid harm or obtain reward, we found that addition of a new rule that punishes the action when it occurs unsignaled delays the timing of the signaled action in an apparent sign of increased caution. Caution depended on task signaling, contingency, and reinforcement type. Interestingly, caution became persistent when the signaled action was avoidance motivated by danger but was only transient when it was approach motivated by reward. Although caution is represented by the activity of neurons in the midbrain, it developed independent of frontal cortex or basal ganglia output circuits. These results indicate that caution disrupts actions in different ways depending on the motivational state and may develop from unforeseen brain circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Actions, such as crossing the street at a light, can have benefits during one light signal (getting somewhere) but can be harmful during a different signal (being run over). Humans must be cautious to cross the street during the period marked by the appropriate signal. In mice performing a signaled action to avoid harm or obtain reward, we found that addition of a new rule that punishes the action when it occurs unsignaled, delays the timing of the signaled action in an apparent sign of increased caution. Caution became persistent when the signaled action was motivated by danger, but not when it was motivated by reward. Moreover, the development of caution did not depend on prototypical frontal cortex circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Assimilation of Novel Information into Schemata and Its Efficient Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Schemata enhance memory formation for related novel information. This is true even when this information is neutral with respect to schema-driven expectations. This assimilation of novel information into schemata has been attributed to more effective organizational processing that leads to more referential connections with the activated associative schema network. Animal data suggest that systems consolidation of novel assimilated information is also accelerated. In the current study, we used both multivariate and univariate fMRI analyses to provide further support for these proposals and to elucidate the neural underpinning of these processes. Twenty-eight participants (5 male) overlearned fictitious schemata for 7 weeks and then encoded novel related and control facts in the scanner. These facts were retrieved both immediately and 2 weeks later, also in the scanner. Our results conceptually replicate previous findings with respect to enhanced vmPFC&ndash;hippocampus coupling during encoding of novel related information and point to a prior knowledge effect that is distinct from situations where novel information is experienced as congruent or incongruent with a schema. Moreover, the combination of both multivariate and univariate results further specified the proposed contributions of the vmPFC, precuneus and angular gyrus network to the more efficient encoding of schema-related information. In addition, our data provide further evidence for more efficient systems consolidation of such novel schema-related and potentially assimilated information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our prior knowledge in a certain domain, often termed schema, heavily influences whether and how we form memories for novel information that can be related to them. The results of the current study show how a ventromedial prefrontal-precuneal-angular network contributes to the more efficient encoding of novel related information. Furthermore, the observed increase in prefrontal&ndash;hippocampal coupling during this process points to a critical distinction from the previously described mechanisms supporting the encoding of information that is experienced as congruent with schema-driven expectations. In addition, we find further support for the proposal based on animal data that prior knowledge enhances also the consolidation of schema-related information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin and the Punitive Hub--Dynamic Spread of Cooperation in Human Social Networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human society operates on large-scale cooperation. However, individual differences in cooperativeness and incentives to free ride on others' cooperation make large-scale cooperation fragile and can lead to reduced social welfare. Thus, how individual cooperation spreads through human social networks remains puzzling from ecological, evolutionary, and societal perspectives. Here, we identify oxytocin and costly punishment as biobehavioral mechanisms that facilitate the propagation of cooperation in social networks. In three laboratory experiments (<I>n</I> = 870 human participants: 373 males, 497 females), individuals were embedded in heterogeneous networks and made repeated decisions with feedback in games of trust (<I>n</I> = 342), ultimatum bargaining (<I>n</I> = 324), and prisoner's dilemma with punishment (<I>n</I> = 204). In each heterogeneous network, individuals at central positions (hub nodes) were given intranasal oxytocin (or placebo). Giving oxytocin (vs matching placebo) to central individuals increased their trust and enforcement of cooperation norms. Oxytocin-enhanced norm enforcement, but not elevated trust, explained the spreading of cooperation throughout the social network. Moreover, grounded in evolutionary game theory, we simulated computer agents that interacted in heterogeneous networks with central nodes varying in terms of cooperation and punishment levels. Simulation results confirmed that central cooperators' willingness to punish noncooperation allowed the permeation of the network and enabled the evolution of network cooperation. These results identify an oxytocin-initiated proximate mechanism explaining how individual cooperation facilitates network-wide cooperation in human society and shed light on the widespread phenomenon of heterogeneous composition and enforcement systems at all levels of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human society operates on large-scale cooperation. Yet because cooperation is exploitable by free riding, how cooperation in social networks emerges remains puzzling from evolutionary and societal perspectives. Here we identify oxytocin and altruistic punishment as key factors facilitating the propagation of cooperation in human social networks. Individuals played repeated economic games in heterogeneous networks where individuals at central positions were given oxytocin or placebo. Oxytocin-enhanced cooperative norm enforcement, but not elevated trust, explained cooperation spreading throughout the social network. Evolutionary simulations confirmed that central cooperators' willingness to punish noncooperation allowed the permeation of the network and enabled the evolution of cooperation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Exploring Information Flow from Posteromedial Cortex during Visuospatial Working Memory: A Magnetoencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>The posteromedial cortex (PMC) is a major hub of the brain's default mode network, and is implicated in a broad range of internally driven cognitions, including visuospatial working memory. However, its precise contribution to these cognitive processes remains unclear. Using MEG, we measured PMC activity in healthy human participants (young adults of both sexes) while they performed a visuospatial working memory task. Multivariate pattern classification analyses revealed stimulus-related information during encoding and retrieval in a set of <I>a priori</I> defined cortical ROIs, including prefrontal, occipital, and ventrotemporal cortices, in addition to PMC. We measured the extent to which this stimulus information was exchanged between areas in an information flow analysis, measuring Granger-causal relationships between areas over time. Consistent with the visual nature of the task, information from occipital cortex shaped other regions across most epochs. However, the PMC shaped object representations in occipital and prefrontal cortices during visuospatial working memory, influencing occipital cortex during retrieval and PFC across all task epochs. Our findings are consistent with a proposed role for the PMC in the representation of internal content, including remembered information, and in the comparison of external stimuli with remembered material.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain operates as a collection of highly interconnected regions. Mapping the function of this interconnectivity, as well as the specializations within different regions, is central to understanding the neural processes underlying cognition. The posteromedial cortex (PMC) is a highly connected cortical region, implicated in visuospatial working memory, although its precise contribution remains unclear. We measured the activity of PMC during a visuospatial working memory task, testing how different regions represented the stimuli, and whether these representations were driven by other cortical regions. We found that PMC influenced stimulus information in other regions across all task phases, suggesting that PMC plays a key role in shaping stimulus representations during visuospatial working memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contextual Expectations Shape Cortical Reinstatement of Sensory Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>When making a turn at a familiar intersection, we know what items and landmarks will come into view. These perceptual expectations, or predictions, come from our knowledge of the context; however, it is unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in cortex. To address this, human participants learned the spatial layout of animals positioned in a cross maze. During fMRI, participants of both sexes navigated between animals to reach a target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one-fourth of trials ended early, with a blank screen presented instead. Using multivariate pattern similarity analysis, we reveal that activity patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing the same item compared with different items. Further, item effects in posterior hippocampus were specific to the sequence context. Critically, activity patterns associated with seeing an item in visual cortex and posterior medial cortex, were also related to activity patterns when an item was expected, but omitted, suggesting sequence predictions were reinstated in these regions. Finally, multivariate connectivity showed that patterns in the posterior hippocampus at one position in the sequence were related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial cortex at a later position. Together, our results support the idea that hippocampal representations facilitate sensory processing by modulating visual cortical activity in anticipation of expected items.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our visual world is a series of connected events, where we can predict what we might see next based on our recent past. Understanding the neural circuitry and mechanisms of the perceptual and memory systems that support these expectations is fundamental to revealing how we perceive and act in our world. Using brain imaging, we studied what happens when we expect to see specific visual items, and how such expectations relate to top-down memory signals. We find both visual and memory systems reflect item predictions, and moreover, we show that hippocampal activity supports predictions of future expected items. This demonstrates that the hippocampus acts to predict upcoming items, and reinstates such predictions in cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modulating the Excitability of Olfactory Output Neurons Affects Whole-Body Metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metabolic state can alter olfactory sensitivity, but it is unknown whether the activity of the olfactory bulb (OB) may fine tune metabolic homeostasis. Our objective was to use CRISPR gene editing in male and female mice to enhance the excitability of mitral/tufted projection neurons (M/TCs) of the OB to test for improved metabolic health. <I>Ex vivo</I> slice recordings of MCs in CRISPR mice confirmed increased excitability due the targeted loss of Kv1.3 channels, which resulted in a less negative resting membrane potential (RMP), enhanced action potential (AP) firing, and insensitivity to the selective channel blocker margatoxin (MgTx). CRISPR mice exhibited enhanced odor discrimination using a habituation/dishabituation paradigm. CRISPR mice were challenged for 25 weeks with a moderately high-fat (MHF) diet, and compared with littermate controls, male mice were resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Female mice did not exhibit DIO. CRISPR male mice gained less body weight, accumulated less white adipose tissue, cleared a glucose challenge more quickly, and had less serum leptin and liver triglycerides. CRISPR male mice consumed equivalent calories as control littermates, and had unaltered energy expenditure (EE) and locomotor activity, but used more fats for metabolic substrate over that of carbohydrates. Counter to CRISPR-engineered mice, by using chemogenetics to decrease M/TC excitability in male mice, activation of inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) caused a decrease in odor discrimination, and resulted in a metabolic profile that was obesogenic, mice had reduced EE and oxygen consumption (VO<SUB>2</SUB>). We conclude that the activity of M/TC projection neurons canonically carries olfactory information and simultaneously can regulate whole-body metabolism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The olfactory system drives food choice, and olfactory sensitivity is strongly correlated to hunger and fullness. Olfactory function thereby influences nutritional balance and obesity outcomes. Obesity has become a health and financial crisis in America, shortening life expectancy and increasing the severity of associated illnesses. It is expected that 51% of Americans will be obese by the year 2030. Using CRISPR gene editing and chemogenetic approaches, we discovered that changing the excitability of output neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) affects metabolism and body weight stabilization in mice. Our results suggest that long-term therapeutic targeting of OB activity to higher processing centers may be a future clinical treatment of obesity or type II Diabetes.</p>

                The reverse order law for outer inverses and the Moore-Penrose inverse is discussed in the context of associative rings. A class of pairs of outer inverses that satisfy reverse order law is determined. The notions of left-star and right-star orders have been extended to the case of arbitrary associative rings with involution and many of their interesting properties are explored. The distinct behavior of projectors in association with the star, right-star, and left-star partial orders led to several equivalent conditions for the reverse order law for the Moore-Penrose inverse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Numerous tools have been developed to assess female sexual dysfunction. Several of them have also conducted validity tests. Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is one of these surveys that has been effectively translated into several different languages. The previous study on the translation and validation of the FSFI-6 questionnaire into Bahasa Indonesia used the original form (FSFI-19), which had many questions. Thus, this study was done to validate and translate a condensed version of the original questionnaire to make it more practicable for individuals to complete in a clinical context. Methods: FSFI-6 was translated into Bahasa Indonesia. Then the data were collected via questionnaires by 72 women in Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo (RSCM or Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital) during the data collection period (January 2018 until April 2018). The data obtained were processed for validity and reliability using the SPSS software program 20. The tests conducted on the data included a normality test, a validity test, descriptive analysis, and reliability testing. The r-value and the value of Cronbachâs Alpha were the parameters used to determine the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. Results: The r-value on each question in the translated FSFI-6 questionnaire was greater than 0.3, while the value of Cronbach's Alpha of the questionnaire FSFI-6 was greater than 0.6, equal to 0.831. Conclusions: The FSFI-6 questionnaire short version that has been translated into Bahasa Indonesia is valid and reliable.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review of retinoic acid in the journey of spermatogonium to spermatozoa: From basic to clinical application [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinoic acid plays an essential role in testicular development and functions, especially spermatogenesis. We have reviewed the role of retinoic acid from basic (molecular) to clinical application. Methods: A search was conducted in the online database including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus for English studies published in the last eight years about this issue. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in assessing the studies we are going to investigate. Results: Studies indicated that retinoic acid plays an essential role during pluripotent stem cell migration and lineage commitment, cell differentiation, apoptosis, stem cell number regulation, and maturation arrest in spermatogenic cells. Retinoic acid can also affect related protein expression and signaling pathways at different stages of spermatogenesis. Four studies have applied retinoic acid to humans, all of them in the single-arm observational study. The results look promising but need further research with more controlled study methods, randomization, and large samples. Conclusions: This current systematic review emphasizes a novel retinoic acid mechanism that has not been well described in the literature previously on its functions during the first seven days of spermatogenesis, leading to new directions or explanations of male infertility cause and treatments as a part of reproductive health care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Appraisal on patient compliance and factors influencing the daily regimen of anti-tubercular drugs in Mangalore city: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Globally, India is the country with the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden with respect to the number of new cases occurring each year. Annual incident cases of TB in India accounts for more than 25% of total TB morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several factors have been associated with the adherence of TB medication, which can be broadly classified as patient/personal, social, structural and health service. The aims of the present study were to determine the compliance to daily regimen of directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) therapy among TB patients registered at the Tuberculosis Unit (TU) of Mangalore and to identify the factors influencing non-compliance for treatment. Methods: A cross sectional study was performed. The study sample was drawn from the TUs, General Hospital, Mangalore, after taking permission from District TB Officer. The names and addresses of TB patients were collected from treatment cards. The TB patients were approached at their homes/DOTS centers/Primary Health Centreâs (PHCs) with the help of senior treatment supervisors. Results: It was found that patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were more likely to be non-adherent, which was statistically significant. Amongst the participants, 66 (33%) were diabetic and 28.8% of them were found to be non-adherent. The proportion of non-adherence was 27 times higher in those with poor patient provider relationships. Patients who reported to have side effects of TB medication were 5.23 times more likely to be non-adherent. Conclusions: Advice on routine consultation with the health care facility, adherence to treatment regimen and education about its benefits should be the prime focus of providing health education to all TB patients, both at the individual and community levels.

                Background: Vemurafenib (VEM) was a licensed drug for the treatment of skin melanoma and is available only in the market as oral tablets prescribed in huge doses (1920 mg/day). One reason for the high dose is vemurafenib's low oral bioavailability. Methods: VEM-lipid complex (DLC) was predicted based on Conquest and Mercury programs and prepared using the solvent evaporation method using the lipid (phosphatidylethanolamine). DLC was subjected to characterization (FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, P-XRD, and FESEM) to confirm complexation. Â DLC was used to prepare solid in oil nanodispersion (DLC-SON) and subjected to in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo evaluation in comparison to our recently prepared conventional SON (VEM-SON) and DLC-control. Results: Conquest and Mercury predict the availability of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between VEM and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). All characterization tests of DLC ensure the complexation of the drug with PE. Ex vivo studies showed that the drug in DLC-SON has significantly (P<0.05) higher skin permeation than DLC-control but lower drug permeation than conventional SON but it has a higher % skin deposition (P<0.05) than others. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the prepared DLC-SON is significantly high (P<0.05) in comparison to the conventional SON and pure VEM. In vivo permeation using confocal laser scanning microscopy (on the rat) results indicated that both conventional SON and DLC-SON can cross the SC and infiltrate the dermis and epidermis but DLC-SON has a higher luminance/gray value after 24 h in the dermis in comparison to the conventional SON. Conclusion: The novel lipid complex for VEM prepared using PE as a lipid and enclosed in SON showed higher anticancer activity and topical permeation as well as sustained delivery and good retention time in the dermis that localize the drug in a sufficient concentration to eliminate early diagnosed skin melanoma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Suprathreshold perceptual decisions constrain models of confidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shannon M. Locke, Michael S. Landy, Pascal Mamassian</p>

Perceptual confidence is an important internal signal about the certainty of our decisions and there is a substantial debate on how it is computed. We highlight three confidence metric types from the literature: observers either use 1) the full probability distribution to compute probability correct (Probability metrics), 2) point estimates from the perceptual decision process to estimate uncertainty (Evidence-Strength metrics), or 3) heuristic confidence from stimulus-based cues to uncertainty (Heuristic metrics). These metrics are rarely tested against one another, so we examined models of all three types on a suprathreshold spatial discrimination task. Observers were shown a cloud of dots sampled from a dot generating distribution and judged if the mean of the distribution was left or right of centre. In addition to varying the horizontal position of the mean, there were two sensory uncertainty manipulations: the number of dots sampled and the spread of the generating distribution. After every two perceptual decisions, observers made a confidence forced-choice judgement whether they were more confident in the first or second decision. Model results showed that the majority of observers were best-fit by either: 1) the Heuristic model, which used dot cloud position, spread, and number of dots as cues; or 2) an Evidence-Strength model, which computed the distance between the sensory measurement and discrimination criterion, scaled according to sensory uncertainty. An accidental repetition of some sessions also allowed for the measurement of confidence agreement for identical pairs of stimuli. This N-pass analysis revealed that human observers were more consistent than their best-fitting model would predict, indicating there are still aspects of confidence that are not captured by our modelling. As such, we propose confidence agreement as a useful technique for computational studies of confidence. Taken together, these findings highlight the idiosyncratic nature of confidence computations for complex decision contexts and the need to consider different potential metrics and transformations in the confidence computation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating microscale patchiness of motile microbes under turbulence in a simulated convective mixed layer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Kier Christensen, Matthew D. Piggott, Erik van Sebille, Maarten van Reeuwijk, Samraat Pawar</p>

Microbes play a primary role in aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Spatial patchiness is a critical factor underlying these activities, influencing biological productivity, nutrient cycling and dynamics across trophic levels. Incorporating spatial dynamics into microbial models is a long-standing challenge, particularly where small-scale turbulence is involved. Here, we combine a fully 3D direct numerical simulation of convective mixed layer turbulence, with an individual-based microbial model to test the key hypothesis that the coupling of gyrotactic motility and turbulence drives intense microscale patchiness. The fluid model simulates turbulent convection caused by heat loss through the fluid surface, for example during the night, during autumnal or winter cooling or during a cold-air outbreak. We find that under such conditions, turbulence-driven patchiness is depth-structured and requires high motility: Near the fluid surface, intense convective turbulence overpowers motility, homogenising motile and non-motile microbes approximately equally. At greater depth, in conditions analogous to a thermocline, highly motile microbes can be over twice as patch-concentrated as non-motile microbes, and can substantially amplify their swimming velocity by efficiently exploiting fast-moving packets of fluid. Our results substantiate the predictions of earlier studies, and demonstrate that turbulence-driven patchiness is not a ubiquitous consequence of motility but rather a delicate balance of motility and turbulent intensity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Expanded ACE2 dependencies of diverse SARS-like coronavirus receptor binding domains</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah M. Roelle, Nidhi Shukla, Anh T. Pham, Anna M. Bruchez, Kenneth A. Matreyek</p>

Viral spillover from animal reservoirs can trigger public health crises and cripple the world economy. Knowing which viruses are primed for zoonotic transmission can focus surveillance efforts and mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Successful engagement of receptor protein orthologs is necessary during cross-species transmission. The clade 1 sarbecoviruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via engagement of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), while the receptor for clade 2 and clade 3 remains largely uncharacterized. We developed a mixed cell pseudotyped virus infection assay to determine whether various clades 2 and 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins can enter HEK 293T cells expressing human or <i>Rhinolophus</i> horseshoe bat ACE2 proteins. The receptor binding domains from BtKY72 and Khosta-2 used human ACE2 for entry, while BtKY72 and Khosta-1 exhibited widespread use of diverse rhinolophid ACE2s. A lysine at ACE2 position 31 appeared to be a major determinant of the inability of these RBDs to use a certain ACE2 sequence. The ACE2 protein from <i>Rhinolophus alcyone</i> engaged all known clade 3 and clade 1 receptor binding domains. We observed little use of <i>Rhinolophus</i> ACE2 orthologs by the clade 2 viruses, supporting the likely use of a separate, unknown receptor. Our results suggest that clade 3 sarbecoviruses from Africa and Europe use <i>Rhinolophus</i> ACE2 for entry, and their spike proteins appear primed to contribute to zoonosis under the right conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mechanistic contribution of CaV3.2 calcium channels to trigeminal neuralgia pathophysiology not clarified [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare, yet debilitating trigeminal pain disorder, with jolts of supramaximal-debilitating pain in one or more of the three trigeminal branches. Familial TN is now recognized, with a recent report describing several human genetic polymorphisms. One affected gene is the voltage-gated calcium channel, CaV3.2 (CACNA1H), with 19 polymorphisms first described. A recent study in PAIN by Gambeta-et-al (DOI:10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002651) is entitled "CaV3.2 calcium channels contribute to trigeminal neuralgia ". Here, I call into question their claim. My main arguments are 1)-3):Â  1) Gambeta-et-al studied 4/19 mutations reported in heterologous cellular expression, with two mutations showing gain-of-function of CaV3.2, two mutations not showing gain-of-function. Therefore the exemplary picks of familial TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations do not show a uniform change of channel function, such as gain-of-function. Â 2) In Gambeta-et-al, one gain-of-function mutation, CaV3.2(G563R) was directed to mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, and their resulting hyperexcitability was demonstrated. A critical control of a non-gain-of-function channel was not included here, it was unclear whether neurons were separated by sex, and human sensory neurons were not used. Importantly, it is not clear that TG Â neurons are the critical cellular site of CaV3.2 mutations. 3) Gambeta-et-al used CaV3.2-/- pan-null knockout mice. Human TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations were not over-expressed. They used a infraorbital nerve constriction injury and measured facial heat hyperalgesia.Â  CaV3.2-/- show a pain phenotype similar to control, yet are not affected by a CaV3-inhibitory compound, Z944. My argument is that when starting with TN-associated human mutations, use of a trigeminal neuropathic pain model is of limited value, and that human mutations have to be expressed against a mouse null background. Re thermal cue, Gambeta-et-al failed to study cold-evoked pain which is a TN clinical hallmark. Thus, Gambeta-et-al's 2022 PAIN-paper offers little new mechanistic evidence why CaV3.2 polymorphisms are associated with trigeminal neuralgia.

                While writing this abstract I received an email, which I promptly answered. When I returned my attention to the abstract, I struggled to regain my flow of writing. In order to understand this deficit in performance associated with switching from one task to another, or "switch cost", cognitive neuroscientists use task switching paradigms to recreate similar experiences. However, many researchers may be familiar with the difficulties that accompany modifying an established paradigm to suit their experimental design, or even the challenge of creating a new, unvalidated paradigm to perturb a particular aspect of cognitive function. This software tool article introduces a novel task switching paradigm for use and adaptation in online and neuroimaging task switching studies. The paradigm was constructed with a flexible, easily-adapted framework that can accommodate a variety of designs. This paradigm utilizes three psychometrically opposed but visually similar tasks- the Digit Span, the Spatial Span, and the Spatial Rotation. In two Use Cases we demonstrate the reliable nature of overall task performance and the dependence of switch costs on certain task parameters. This task framework can be adapted for use across different experimental designs and environment, and we encourage researchers to modify the task switching game for their experiments.

                Background: Cannabis (Cannabis sativa, L.) is an archaic, most infamous plant with unique therapeutic characteristics, and great economic interest. The identification of its THCAS synthesizing enzyme was a great leap forward in Cannabis investigation. However, basic molecular biology for THCAS gene expression remains largely unstudied. Methods: In this paper, we explored the ability of bioinformatics resources in the design of molecular cloning protocol and prediction of three-dimensional structure of recombinant THCAS in Moroccan Cannabis sativa variety. We further described conventional experiments performed in vitro. We used specific markers to isolate the nucleotide sequence of THCAS from the leaves of Cannabis, without including the native signal sequence. Results: As a result, we found high sequence similarity with THCAS and the mRNA precursor of the same gene as previously reported. In addition, we predicted the structure of the recombinant THCAS using the organic crystal structure prediction method, the amino acid sequence reference, and the artificial intelligence technology. Conclusions: This study paves the way to successfully express recombinant THCAS enzyme in hosts like Pichia pastori.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pandemic Pedagogy: Perception of Nursing studentsâ: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic impacted across the globe disrupting all sectors including the higher education universities. Nursing institutions faced various challenges due to the pandemic restrictions, of which the abrupt shift of implementing the curriculum to online mode posed a major challenge to both the teachers and the students. To assess nursing students' perception of pandemic pedagogy and the challenges faced in remote teaching-learning, this cross-sectional survey was conducted among 982 undergraduate nursing students from three Deemed to be University nursing institutions of Southern India. Institutional Ethics Committee approval (IEC 444/2020), permission from the heads of the institutions and study participantâs consent was obtained. Data was collected using an online survey questionnaire which had three domains, including student-related (19 items), teacher-related(5 items), and physical learning environment-related factors (11 items).Â  The reliability was established using Cronbachâs Alpha (0.86). Explored the favouring, hindering factors and challenges faced during the emergency remote instruction with open-ended items. The overall mean score of perceptions on pandemic pedagogy was 89.03Â±10.03. Sixty-three percent of students had a total perception score above 87 which indicates that they preferred remote learning (synchronous) during the pandemic whereas 45% preferred face-to-face classes. There was a significant difference in the total perception scores and the years of study( F (3, 978) = 4.96, p = 0.002). The factors favouring remote learning were, an opportunity to view the recorded classes even after the live classesâ (n=165), and âmore time to spend for learning activitiesâ (n=152). Factors that hindered the learning or the challenges faced were poor network connectivity (n=451), and lack of opportunity for group studyÂ  (n=326). Students favoured remote learning during the pandemic; however, there were several challenges. The educational institutions need to prepare themselves to overcome this and focus on a blended learning curriculum.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sea grapes powder with the addition of tempe rich in collagen: An anti-aging functional food [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to determine the potential anti-aging effects of sea grapes and tempe (fermented soybeans) collagen particle size, by measuring the activities of anti-glycation, antioxidant, and tyrosinase inhibitors. Methods: Collagen was isolated from freeze-dried sea grapes and tempe powder and treated with different NaOH concentrations (0.10 M; 0.20 M; 0.30 M), and CH3COOH 1 M solution, separately. The collagen particle size was adjusted by stirring at 1000 rpm for 5 and 10 hours. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used to measure the antioxidant activity, and L-tyrosine and L-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) was used as a marker of tyrosine inhibition.Â Results: Â The collagen treated with 0.10 M NaOH produced the highest collagen yield (11.65%), and the largest particle size (2455 nm). Additionally, this collagen, when treated for 5 hours, exhibited 24.70% antioxidant activity, 62.60% anti-glycation, 8.97% L-tyrosine, and 26.77% L-Dopa inhibition activities. Meanwhile, the collagen treated for 10 hours had a 9.98% antioxidant activity, 41.48% anti-glycation, 7.89% L-tyrosine, and 2.67% L-Dopa inhibition activity.Â Conclusion: Sea grapes and tempe collagen powder treated with 0.10 M NaOH and stirred for 5 hours, possess the best potential anti-aging properties as a functional food.
