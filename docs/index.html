                arXiv:2503.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associative networks theory is increasingly providing tools to interpret update rules of artificial neural networks. At the same time, deriving neural learning rules from a solid theory remains a fundamental challenge. We make some steps in this direction by considering general energy-based associative networks of continuous neurons and synapses that evolve in multiple time scales. We use the separation of these timescales to recover a limit in which the activation of the neurons, the energy of the system and the neural dynamics can all be recovered from a generating function. By allowing the generating function to depend on memories, we recover the conventional Hebbian modeling choice for the interaction strength between neurons. Finally, we propose and discuss a dynamics of memories that enables us to include learning in this framework.

                arXiv:2503.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to investigate whether latent space representations of visual stimuli and fMRI data share common information. Decoding and reconstructing stimuli from fMRI data remains a challenge in AI and neuroscience, with significant implications for understanding neural representations and improving the interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this preliminary study, we investigate the feasibility of such reconstruction by examining the similarity between the latent spaces of one autoencoder (AE) and one vision transformer (ViT) trained on fMRI and image data, respectively. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that the latent spaces of the two domains appear different. However, these initial findings are inconclusive, and further research is needed to explore this relationship more thoroughly.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924">Human Brain State Analysis Unveils Complexity of Brain Dynamics: Insights from General Anesthesia and ADHD EEG signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system exhibiting rich dynamical behavior across various states, including those induced by anesthesia or neurological disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, our study investigates the underlying complexity and universal patterns in human brain dynamics across states induced by general anesthesia and neurological disorder of inattentive-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extract relative phase dynamics time series, $\beta(t)$, from EEG signals and compute permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity across the different states using the framework of ordinal patterns. Our results reveal several key findings. First, different brain states exhibit distinct PE values, indicating distinct signatures of information content across states. We find an inverse correlation between entropy and the level of consciousness during general anesthesia. Further, when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition, individual, or $\beta(t)$ time series, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics. Moreover, compared to well-known stochastic processes (linear underdamped Langevin dynamics, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and fractional Brownian motion), brain data consistently exhibits higher complexity for any given PE value. Multifractal analysis shows this enhanced complexity likely arises from greater multifractal scaling properties compared to stochastic processes. Our findings highlight the power of ordinal patterns in distinguishing various dynamic brain states and uncovering hidden universal patterns in brain dynamics. Our comprehensive characterization of human brain complexity across states offers valuable insights for future research into consciousness, attention disorders, and neural information processing.

                arXiv:2503.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure-based interventions rely on inhibitory learning, often studied through Pavlovian conditioning. While disgust conditioning is increasingly linked to psychiatric disorders, it has been less researched than fear conditioning. In this study, we applied a categorical Pavlovian disgust conditioning paradigm with two CS categories (animals and tools) and disgusting images as US (e.g., feces). During categorization, acquisition, and extinction phases, we measured eye movements and pupil responses in 44 participants. Consistent with previous results, subjective disgust and US expectancy increased from categorization to acquisition for CS+, along with greater pupil dilation for CS+ than CS-. Higher disgust sensitivity was associated with more generalized and longer lasting disgust experiences, as well as higher expectancy for disgusting images. Pupil response during acquisition and extinction depended on disgust sensitivity: Participants with lower disgust sensitivity showed greater pupil dilation. These findings suggest that individuals with high disgust sensitivity and prolonged expectancy may exhibit physiological differences from less sensitive individuals as early as the acquisition phase. This could inform contamination-based OCD treatments by integrating interventions which focus on attentional deployment or physiological reactions. To our knowledge, this is the first study using pupillometry and eye tracking in categorical disgust conditioning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20629">Tracking the topology of neural manifolds across populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural manifolds summarize the intrinsic structure of the information encoded by a population of neurons. Advances in experimental techniques have made simultaneous recordings from multiple brain regions increasingly commonplace, raising the possibility of studying how these manifolds relate across populations. However, when the manifolds are nonlinear and possibly code for multiple unknown variables, it is challenging to extract robust and falsifiable information about their relationships. We introduce a framework, called the method of analogous cycles, for matching topological features of neural manifolds using only observed dissimilarity matrices within and between neural populations. We demonstrate via analysis of simulations and \emph{in vivo} experimental data that this method can be used to correctly identify multiple shared circular coordinate systems across both stimuli and inferred neural manifolds. Conversely, the method rejects matching features that are not intrinsic to one of the systems. Further, as this method is deterministic and does not rely on dimensionality reduction or optimization methods, it is amenable to direct mathematical investigation and interpretation in terms of the underlying neural activity. We thus propose the method of analogous cycles as a suitable foundation for a theory of cross-population analysis via neural manifolds.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20708">Fluctuation-dissipation of the Kuramoto model on fruit-fly connectomes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distance from equilibrium using the Kuramoto model via the degree of fluctuation-dissipation violation as the consequence of different levels of edge weight anisotropies. This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 < d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The pharmacological treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) relies on a trial-and-error approach. We introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) model aiming to personalize treatment and improve outcomes, which was deployed in the Artificial Intelligence in Depression Medication Enhancement (AIDME) Study. OBJECTIVES: 1) Develop a model capable of predicting probabilities of remission across multiple pharmacological treatments for adults with at least moderate major depression. 2) Validate model predictions and examine them for amplification of harmful biases. METHODS: Data from previous clinical trials of antidepressant medications were standardized into a common framework and included 9,042 adults with moderate to severe major depression. Feature selection retained 25 clinical and demographic variables. Using Bayesian optimization, a deep learning model was trained on the training set, refined using the validation set, and tested once on the held-out test set. RESULTS: In the evaluation on the held-out test set, the model demonstrated achieved an AUC of 0.65. The model outperformed a null model on the test set (p = 0.01). The model demonstrated clinical utility, achieving an absolute improvement in population remission rate in hypothetical and actual improvement testing. While the model did identify one drug (escitalopram) as generally outperforming the other drugs (consistent with the input data), there was otherwise significant variation in drug rankings. On bias testing, the model did not amplify potentially harmful biases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the first model capable of predicting outcomes for 10 different treatment options for patients with MDD, intended to be used at or near the start of treatment to personalize treatment. The model was put into clinical practice during the AIDME randomized controlled trial whose results are reported separately.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05809">Two pathways to resolve relational inconsistencies</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When individuals encounter observations that violate their expectations, when will they adjust their expectations and when will they maintain them despite these observations? For example, when individuals expect objects of type A to be smaller than objects B, but observe the opposite, when will they adjust their expectation about the relationship between the two objects (to A being larger than B)? Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the greater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are extreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations rather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a similar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations would lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be resolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that bypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations. These results suggest that the experimentally-observed stability of prior expectations when facing large expectation violations is a natural consequence of learning dynamics and does not require any additional mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the effect of intermediate adaptation steps on this stability.

                arXiv:2408.00777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal neuroimaging analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain function and pathology, as it allows for the integration of different imaging techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of individual modalities. However, the high costs and limited availability of certain modalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for end-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous neuroimages are aligned into a latent space, achieving a unified representation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in neuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency Segmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the temporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic details of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrates that the framework improves the accuracy of brain activity state prediction by 9.13% (reaching 69.8%), enhances the diagnostic accuracy of brain disorders by 4.10% (reaching 99.55%), effectively identifies abnormal brain regions, enhancing the temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a latent representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as improving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain regions.

                arXiv:2408.16347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the final aim of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), that classifies as most epileptogenic those SEEG channels that show independent behavior during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. We test the proposed DI algorithm against the Epileptogenic Index (EI) algorithm on a clinical dataset of 11 patients, considering the neurophysiological evaluation of the EZ as the clinical ground truth. Our results denote that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.81 vs AUC=0.74) while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy of the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. This technique can lead to the definition of a new effective biomarker of the EZ, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving our understanding of the dynamics leading to the generation of seizures.

                arXiv:2502.13729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.

                arXiv:2503.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the \emph{tensorization} methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113\(\times\) compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

                arXiv:2503.20642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing autonomous robotic systems, such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles, is challenging due to their interaction with highly unpredictable environments. A common practice is to first conduct simulation-based testing, which, despite reducing real-world risks, remains time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the vast space of possible test scenarios. A number of search-based approaches were proposed to generate test scenarios more efficiently. A key aspect of any search-based test generation approach is the choice of representation used during the search process. However, existing methods for improving test scenario representation remain limited. We propose RILaST (Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search-Based Testing) approach, which enhances test representation by mapping it to the latent space of a variational autoencoder. We evaluate RILaST on two use cases, including autonomous drone and autonomous lane-keeping assist system. The obtained results show that RILaST allows finding between 3 to 4.6 times more failures than baseline approaches, achieving a high level of test diversity.

Abstract: In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.

                arXiv:2503.20018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss of plasticity is one of the main challenges in continual learning with deep neural networks, where neural networks trained via backpropagation gradually lose their ability to adapt to new tasks and perform significantly worse than their freshly initialized counterparts. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new hypothesis that experience replay addresses the loss of plasticity in continual learning. Here, experience replay is a form of memory. We provide supporting evidence for this hypothesis. In particular, we demonstrate in multiple different tasks, including regression, classification, and policy evaluation, that by simply adding an experience replay and processing the data in the experience replay with Transformers, the loss of plasticity disappears. Notably, we do not alter any standard components of deep learning. For example, we do not change backpropagation. We do not modify the activation functions. And we do not use any regularization. We conjecture that experience replay and Transformers can address the loss of plasticity because of the in-context learning phenomenon.

                arXiv:2502.10470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE's intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE's parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE's promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance. The source code of MetaDE is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/metade.

                arXiv:2503.10879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activation functions play a critical role in the performance and behaviour of neural networks, significantly impacting their ability to learn and generalise. Traditional activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, have been widely used with considerable success. However, these functions may not always provide optimal performance for all tasks and datasets. In this paper, we introduce Neuvo GEAF - an innovative approach leveraging grammatical evolution (GE) to automatically evolve novel activation functions tailored to specific neural network architectures and datasets. Experiments conducted on well-known binary classification datasets show statistically significant improvements in F1-score (between 2.4% and 9.4%) over ReLU using identical network architectures. Notably, these performance gains were achieved without increasing the network's parameter count, supporting the trend toward more efficient neural networks that can operate effectively on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper's findings suggest that evolved activation functions can provide significant performance improvements for compact networks while maintaining energy efficiency during both training and inference phases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02149">A General Framework for Interpretable Neural Learning based on Local Information-Theoretic Goal Functions</a></h4>

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of biological and artificial networks, an intuitive understanding of how their local learning dynamics contribute to network-level task solutions remains a challenge to this date. Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce 'infomorphic' neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17391">Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.17391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces. We use duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distribution of fluctuations of the trainable variables, using a toy model at learning equilibrium. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.

                arXiv:2503.16127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robotics holds transformative potential for enabling adaptive and adaptable systems in dynamic environments. However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.

     alt="Evidence for Auditory Stimulus-Specific Adaptation But Not Deviance Detection in Larval Zebrafish Brains"/>
<p>The mismatch negativity response is brain activity following an unexpected auditory stimulus in humans. We used whole-brain calcium imaging to characterize auditory responses to unexpected sounds in larval zebrafish. Auditory neuron responses decrease after repetition of specific frequencies without generalization between frequencies, evidence of stimulus-specific adaptation. However, we did not find evidence for deviance responses to unexpected sounds within a sequence or to the unexpected omission of sounds from a sequence.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals receive a constant stream of sensory input, and detecting changes in this sensory landscape is critical to their survival. One signature of change detection in humans is the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), a neural response to unexpected stimuli that deviate from a predictable sequence. This process requires the auditory system to adapt to specific repeated stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel input (stimulus-specific adaptation [SSA]). MMN was originally described in humans, and equivalent responses have been found in other mammals and birds, but it is not known to what extent this deviance detection circuitry is evolutionarily conserved. Here we present the first evidence for SSA in the brain of a teleost fish, using whole-brain calcium imaging of larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution with selective plane illumination microscopy. We found frequency-specific responses across the brain with variable response amplitudes for frequencies of the same volume and created a loudness curve to model this effect. We presented an auditory “oddball” stimulus in an otherwise predictable train of pure tone stimuli and did not find a population of neurons with specific responses to deviant tones that were not otherwise explained by SSA. Further, we observed no deviance responses to an unexpected omission of a sound in a repetitive sequence of white noise bursts. These findings extend the known scope of auditory adaptation and deviance responses across the evolutionary tree and lay groundwork for future studies to describe the circuitry underlying auditory adaptation at the level of individual neurons.</p>

                <p>Sensory perception relies on the flexible detection and interpretation of stimuli across variable contexts, conditions, and behavioral states. The basal forebrain (BF) is a hub for behavioral state regulation, supplying dense cholinergic and GABAergic projections to various brain regions involved in sensory processing. Of GABAergic neurons in the BF, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) subtypes serve opposing roles toward regulating behavioral states. To elucidate the role of BF circuits in sensory-guided behavior, we investigated GABAergic signaling dynamics during odor-guided decision-making in male and female mice. We used fiber photometry to record cell type-specific BF activity during an odor discrimination task and correlated temporal patterns of PV and SST neuronal activity with olfactory task performance. We found that while both PV-expressing and SST-expressing GABAergic neurons were excited during trial initiation, PV neurons were selectively suppressed by reward, whereas SST neurons were excited. Notably, chemogenetic inhibition of BF SST neurons modestly altered decision bias to favor reward seeking, while optogenetic inhibition of BF PV neurons during odor presentations improved discrimination accuracy. Together, these results suggest that the bidirectional activity of GABAergic BF neuron subtypes distinctly influence perception and decision-making during olfactory-guided behavior.</p>

                <p>We previously reported that ventral subiculum (vSub) activity is critical to incubation of oxycodone seeking after abstinence induced by adverse consequences of drug seeking. Here, we studied the role of claustrum, a key vSub input, in this incubation. We trained male and female rats to self-administer oxycodone for 2&nbsp;weeks and then induced abstinence by exposing them to an electric barrier for 2&nbsp;weeks. We used retrograde tracing (cholera toxin B subunit) plus the activity marker Fos to identify projections to vSub cactivated during "incubated" relapse (Abstinence Day 15). We then used pharmacological reversible inactivation to determine the causal role of claustrum in incubation and the behavioral and anatomical specificity of this role. We also used an anatomical disconnection procedure to determine the causal role of claustrum&ndash;vSub connections in incubation. Finally, we analyzed an existing functional MRI dataset to determine if functional connectivity changes in claustrum-related circuits predict incubation of oxycodone seeking. Claustrum neurons projecting to vSub were activated during relapse tests after electric barrier-induced abstinence. Inactivation of claustrum but not areas dorsolateral to claustrum decreased incubation of oxycodone seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence; claustrum inactivation had no effect on incubation after food choice-induced abstinence. Both ipsilateral and contralateral inactivation of claustrum&ndash;vSub projections decreased incubation after electric barrier-induced abstinence. Functional connectivity changes in claustrum&ndash;cortical circuits during electric barrier-induced abstinence predicted incubated oxycodone relapse. Our study identified a novel role of claustrum in relapse to opioid drugs after abstinence induced by adverse consequences of drug seeking.</p>

                <p>Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ is a transient developmental structure in the mouse cochlea that undergoes significant remodeling postnatally. Utilizing an epithelial-specific conditional deletion mouse model of <I>Prdm16</I> (marker and regulator of Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ), we show that <I>Prdm16</I> is required for interdental cell development, and thereby the development of the limbal domain of the tectorial membrane and its medial anchorage to the spiral limbus. Additionally, we show that Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ is involved in normal tectorial membrane collagen fibril development and maturation. Interestingly, mesenchymal cells of the spiral limbus underneath <I>Prdm16</I>-deficient Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ failed to produce interstitial matrix proteins, resulting in a hypoplastic and truncated spiral limbus, indicating a non-cell autonomous role of <I>Prdm16</I> in regulating spiral mesenchymal matrix development. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes in <I>Prdm16</I>-deficient Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ suggesting a role for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) downstream <I>Prdm16</I> in epithelial-mesenchymal signaling involved in spiral limbus matrix deposition. <I>Prdm16</I>-deficient mice showed a hearing deficit, as indicated by elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds at most frequencies, consistent with the cochlear structural defects. Both sexes were studied. This work establishes <I>Prdm16</I> as a deafness gene in mice through its role in regulating Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ development. Such understanding recognizes Ko&#x0308;lliker's organ as a developmental hub regulating multiple surrounding cochlear structures.</p>

One such motif is the inhibition of somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons. We studied the synaptic properties of layer (L) 2/3 VIP cells onto L4 SST cells in somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortices of mice of either sex using paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, followed by morphological reconstructions. We identified strong differences in the morphological features of L4 SST cells, wherein cells in S1 fell into the non-Martinotti cell (nMC) subclass, while in V1 presented with Martinotti cell (MC)-like features. Approximately 40&ndash;45% of tested SST cells were inhibited by VIP cells in both cortices. While unitary connectivity properties of the VIP-to-nMC and VIP-to-MC motifs were comparable, we observed stark differences in short-term plasticity. During high-frequency stimulation of both motifs, some connections showed short-term facilitation while others showed a stable response, with a fraction of VIP-to-nMC connections showing short-term depression. We thus provide evidence that VIP cells target morphological subclasses of SST cells differentially, forming cell-type&ndash;specific inhibitory motifs.</p>

                <p>Neurodegenerative diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system are characterized by selective neuronal vulnerability, i.e., pathology that affects particular types of neurons. While much of this cell type selectivity may be driven by intrinsic differences among the neuron subpopulations, neuron-extrinsic mechanisms such as the selective malfunction of glial support cells may also play a role. Recently, we identified a population of Schwann cells (SCs) expressing <I>Adamtsl1</I>, <I>Cldn14</I>, and <I>Pmp2</I> (a.k.a. PMP2+ SCs) that preferentially myelinate large-caliber motor axons. PMP2+ SCs are decreased in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice and ALS patient nerves. Thus, PMP2+ SC dysfunction could contribute to motor-selective neuropathies. We engineered a tamoxifen-inducible Pmp2-CreERT2 mouse and expressed diphtheria toxin in PMP2+ SCs to assess the consequences of ablating this SC subtype in male and female mice. Loss of PMP2+ SCs led to significant loss of large-caliber motor axons with concomitant behavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural defects. Subsequent withdrawal of tamoxifen restored both PMP2+ SCs and large-caliber motor axons and improved behavioral and electrophysiological readouts. Together, our findings highlight that the survival of large-caliber motor axons relies on PMP2+ SCs, demonstrating that malfunction of a specific SC subtype can lead to selective neuronal vulnerability.</p>

                <p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is crucial in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by triggering cellular apoptosis and exacerbating neuronal damage. This study elucidates the dynamics of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) translocation and its role in regulating neural fate during cerebral ischemia-induced ER stress, specifically in male mice. We found enhanced nuclear localization of TIGAR in neurons after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R) in male mice, as well as oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) and treatment with ER stress inducer (tunicamycin and thapsigargin) in neuronal cells. Conditional neuronal knockdown of <I>Tigar</I> aggravated the injury following ischemia-reperfusion, whereas overexpression of <I>Tigar</I> attenuated cerebral ischemic injury and ameliorated intraneuronal ER stress. Additionally, TIGAR overexpression reduced the elevation of ATF4 target genes and attenuated ER stress-induced cell death. Notably, TIGAR colocalized and interacted with ATF4 in the nucleus, inhibiting its downstream proapoptotic gene transcription, consequently protecting against ischemic injury. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that ATF4 overexpression reversed the protective effects of TIGAR against cerebral ischemic injury. Intriguingly, our study identified the Q141/K145 residues of TIGAR, crucial for its nuclear translocation and interaction with ATF4, highlighting a novel aspect of TIGAR's function distinct from its known phosphatase activity or mitochondrial localization domains. These findings reveal a novel neuroprotective mechanism of TIGAR in regulating ER stress through ATF4-mediated signaling pathways. These insights may guide targeted therapeutic strategies to protect neuronal function and alleviate the deleterious effects of cerebral ischemic injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/13/e1537242025?rss=1">Common and Unique Neurophysiological Processes That Support the Stopping and Revising of Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inhibitory control is a crucial cognitive-control ability for behavioral flexibility, which has been extensively investigated through action-stopping tasks. Multiple neurophysiological features have been proposed as "signatures" of inhibitory control during action-stopping, though the processes indexed by these signatures are still controversially discussed. The present study aimed to disentangle these processes by comparing simple stopping situations with those in which additional action revisions were needed. Three experiments in female and male humans were performed to characterize the neurophysiological dynamics involved in action-stopping and action-changing, with hypotheses derived from recently developed two-stage "pause-then-cancel" models of inhibitory control. Both stopping and revising an action triggered an early, broad "pause"-process, marked by frontal EEG &beta;-frequency bursting and nonselective suppression of corticospinal excitability. However, EMG showed that motor activity was only partially inhibited by this "pause" and that this activity could be modulated during action revision. In line with two-stage models of inhibitory control, subsequent frontocentral EEG activity after this initial "pause" selectively scaled depending on the required action revisions, with more activity observed for more complex revisions. This demonstrates the presence of a selective, effector-specific "retune" phase as the second process involved in action-stopping and action revision. Together, these findings show that inhibitory control is implemented over an extended period of time and in at least two phases. We are further able to align the most commonly proposed neurophysiological signatures to these phases and show that they are differentially modulated by the complexity of action revision.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/13/e1662242025?rss=1">Identification of a Novel Population of Neuromedin S Expressing Neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area That Promote Morphine-Elicited Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioid use disorder constitutes a major health and economic burden, but our limited understanding of the underlying neurobiology impedes better interventions. Alteration in the activity and output of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to drug effects, but the mechanisms underlying these changes remain relatively unexplored. We used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes in mouse VTA DA neurons following chronic morphine exposure. We found that expression of the neuropeptide neuromedin S (NMS) is robustly increased in VTA DA neurons by morphine. Using an NMS-iCre driver line, we confirmed that a subset of VTA neurons express NMS and that chemogenetic modulation of VTA NMS neuron activity altered morphine responses in male and female mice. Specifically, VTA NMS neuronal activation promoted morphine locomotor activity while inhibition reduced morphine locomotor activity and conditioned place preference. Interestingly, these effects appear specific to morphine, as modulation of VTA NMS activity did not affect cocaine behaviors, consistent with our data that cocaine administration does not increase VTA <I>Nms</I> expression. Chemogenetic manipulation of VTA neurons that express glucagon-like peptide, a transcript also robustly increased in VTA DA neurons by morphine, does not alter morphine-elicited behavior, further highlighting the functional relevance of VTA NMS-expressing neurons. Together, our current data suggest that NMS-expressing neurons represent a novel subset of VTA neurons that may be functionally relevant for morphine responses and support the utility of cell-type&ndash;specific analyses like TRAP to identify neuronal adaptations underlying substance use disorder.</p>

                <p>A dynamic interplay between fast synaptic signals and slower neuromodulatory signals controls the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance within neuronal circuits. The mechanisms by which neuropeptide signaling is regulated to maintain E/I balance remain uncertain. We designed a genetic screen to isolate genes involved in the peptidergic maintenance of the E/I balance in the <I>C. elegans</I> motor circuit. This screen identified the <I>C. elegans</I> orthologs of the presynaptic phosphoprotein synapsin (<I>snn-1</I>) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit PHACTR1 (<I>phac-1</I>). We demonstrate that both <I>phac-1</I> and <I>snn-1</I> alter the motor behavior of <I>C. elegans</I>, and genetic interactions suggest that SNN-1 contributes to PP1-PHAC-1 holoenzyme signaling. De novo variants of human PHACTR1, associated with early-onset epilepsies [developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 70 (DEE70)], when expressed in <I>C. elegans</I> resulted in constitutive PP1-PHAC-1 holoenzyme activity. Unregulated PP1-PHAC-1 signaling alters the synapsin and actin cytoskeleton and increases neuropeptide release by cholinergic motor neurons, which secondarily affects the presynaptic vesicle cycle. Together, these results clarify the dominant mechanisms of action of the DEE70 alleles and suggest that altered neuropeptide release may alter E/I balance in DEE70.</p>

                <p>Multiple studies suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with changes in neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. There are limited electrophysiological data, however, describing how parkinsonism impacts neuronal activity in the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), an area in the medial frontal cortex involved in movement planning and motor control. In this study, single unit activity was recorded in the pre-SMA of two female nonhuman primates during a visually cued reaching task in both the naive and parkinsonian state using the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of parkinsonism. In the naive state, neuronal discharge rates were dynamically modulated prior to the presentation of the instructional go-cue. In a subset of these modulated cells, the magnitude of modulation correlated linearly with reaction time (RT). In the parkinsonian state, however, modulation of discharge rates in the pre-SMA was disrupted, and the predictive encoding of RT was significantly diminished. These findings add to our understanding of the role of pre-SMA in motor behavior and suggest that disrupted encoding in this cortical region contributes to the alteration of early preparatory and premovement processes present in Parkinson's disease.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic brain areas are crucial for cognition and their dysregulation is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders typically treated with pharmacological interventions. These treatments often have side effects and variable effectiveness, underscoring the need for alternatives. We introduce the first demonstration of neurofeedback using local field potentials (LFP) from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This approach leverages the real-time temporal resolution of LFP and ability to target deep brain. In our study, two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) learned to regulate VTA beta power using a customized normalized metric to stably quantify VTA LFP signal modulation. The subjects demonstrated flexible and specific control with different strategies for specific frequency bands, revealing new insights into the plasticity of VTA neurons contributing to oscillatory activity that is functionally relevant to many aspects of cognition. Excitingly, the subjects showed transferable patterns, a key criterion for clinical applications beyond training settings. This work provides a foundation for neurofeedback-based treatments, which may be a promising alternative to conventional approaches and open new avenues for understanding and managing neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Voltage-gated potassium conductances <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> play a critical role not only in normal neural function, but also in many neurological disorders and related therapeutic interventions. In particular, in an important animal model of epileptic seizures, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) administration is thought to induce seizures by reducing <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> in cortex and other brain areas. Interestingly, 4-AP has also been useful in the treatment of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, where it is thought to improve action potential propagation in axonal fibers. Here, we examined <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> downmodulation in biophysical models of cortical networks that included different neuron types organized in layers, potassium diffusion in interstitial and larger extracellular spaces, and glial buffering. Our findings are fourfold. First, <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> downmodulation in pyramidal and fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons led to differential effects, making the latter much more likely to enter depolarization block. Second, both neuron types showed an increase in the duration and amplitude of action potentials, with more pronounced effects in pyramidal neurons. Third, a sufficiently strong <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> reduction dramatically increased network synchrony, resulting in seizure-like dynamics. Fourth, we hypothesized that broader action potentials were likely to not only improve their propagation, as in 4-AP therapeutic uses, but also to increase synaptic coupling. Notably, graded-synapses incorporating this effect further amplified network synchronization and seizure-like dynamics. Overall, our findings elucidate different effects that <I>g</I><SUB><I>K</I></SUB> downmodulation may have in cortical networks, explaining its potential role in both pathological neural dynamics and therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>Anticipating rewards is fundamental for decision-making. Animals often use cues to assess reward availability and to make predictions about future outcomes. The gustatory region of the insular cortex (IC), the so-called gustatory cortex, has a well-established role in the representation of predictive cues, such that IC neurons encode both a general form of outcome expectation and anticipatory outcome-specific knowledge. Here, we used pavlovian&ndash;instrumental transfer (PIT) in male rats to assess if the IC is also required for predictive cues to exert both a general and specific influence over instrumental actions. Chemogenetic inhibition of IC impaired the ability of a reward-predictive stimulus to energize instrumental responding for reward. This deficit in general transfer was evident whether the same or different outcomes were used in the pavlovian and instrumental conditioning phases. We observed a similar deficit in specific PIT, such that rats with IC inhibition failed to use a reward-predictive stimulus to guide choice toward actions that deliver the same food reward. Finally, we show that rats with IC inhibition also fail to show outcome-selective reinstatement. Together, these data suggest a crucial role for IC in the representation of appetitive outcomes and particularly in using this representation to guide instrumental action.</p>

                <p>Synaptically released zinc is a neuronal signaling system that arises from the actions of the presynaptic vesicular zinc transporter protein zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3). Mechanisms that regulate the actions of zinc at synapses are of great importance for many aspects of synaptic signaling in the brain. Here, we identify the astrocytic zinc transporter protein ZIP12 as a candidate mechanism that contributes to zinc clearance at cortical synapses. We identify small-molecule compounds that antagonize the function of ZIP12 in heterologous expression systems, and we use one of these compounds, ZIP12 modulator 8, to increase the concentration of ZnT3-dependent zinc at synapses in the brain of male and female mice to inhibit the activity of neuronal AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors. These results identify a cellular mechanism and provide a pharmacological toolbox to target the molecular machinery that supports the actions of synaptic zinc in the brain.</p>

                <p>Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels of the Kv2 family are highly expressed in brain and play dual roles in regulating neuronal excitability and in organizing endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. Studies in heterologous cells suggest that Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 co-assemble with "electrically silent" KvS subunits to form heterotetrameric channels with distinct biophysical properties, but the prevalence and localization of these channels in native neurons are unknown. Here, using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified five KvS subunits as components of native Kv2.1 channels immunopurified from mouse brain of both sexes, the most abundant being Kv5.1. We found that Kv5.1 co-immunoprecipitates with Kv2.1 and to a lesser extent with Kv2.2 from brain lysates and that Kv5.1 protein levels are decreased by 70% in Kv2.1 knock-out mice and 95% in Kv2.1/Kv2.2 double knock-out mice. RNAscope and immunolabeling revealed that Kv5.1 is prominently expressed in neocortex, where it is detected in a substantial fraction of Kv2.1/Kv2.2 positive neurons in layers 2/3, 5, and 6. At the subcellular level, Kv5.1 protein is coclustered with Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 at presumptive ER-PM junctions on the soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. Moreover, in addition to modifying channel conductance, we found that Kv2/Kv5.1 channels are less phosphorylated and insensitive to RY785, a potent and selective Kv2 channel inhibitor. Together, these findings demonstrate that KvS subunits create multiple Kv2 channel subtypes in brain. Most notably, Kv2/Kv5.1 channels are highly expressed in cortical neurons, where their unique properties likely modulate the critical conducting and nonconducting roles of Kv2 channels.</p>

                Background Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases worldwide. One of the most common therapy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), has a high failure rate. The failure rate can be significantly reduced by identifying the candidates most likely to benefit from ESWL, for example, by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Decision tree analysis (DTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) represent a few of the machine learning approaches employed to forecast the stone-free outcome following ESWL. Methods 219 studies were searched through six electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Proquest, SCOPUS). We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). To evaluate the potential bias in all the studies, we utilized the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results 41,484 patients from 11 studies were included. The ML models highlight varying levels of diagnostic precision, with sensitivity spanning from 35-96%, and specificity ranging from 63-98.4%, and area under the curve falling between 0.49-0.96. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of RF and DTA in predicting stone-free status is superior than ANN. Conclusion ML is a comparable predictive method to statistical analysis in predicting stone-free status. Random forest method and DTA are superior MLs compared to ANN. Stone size, density, and 3D texture analysis are the most important variables to be considered in the ML models and should be included in the models to ensure accuracy of stone-free status prediction.

                Parenting a preterm infant is highly challenging, considering the need to care for the infant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The parents or caregivers spend approximately 22.3 hours per day in the NICU caring for the infant through involvement in various activities not limited to feeding, medication administration, and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). These activities simultaneously involve the infant and the parent or caregiver, termed co-occupation. These co-occupation activities benefit the infants and parent dyads. The study aims to identify the existing literature that discusses occupational therapy interventions that promote or support co-occupation among infants and parents or caregivers. The scoping review will use the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, adhering to PRISMA for scoping review guidelines. The Person- Environment -Occupation (PEO) Model will also be used to report the results. The study will include searches across multiple databases and reference lists of relevant articles. The findings from this study may identify the gaps in occupational therapy practice in NICU from the perspective of co-occupations and the associated interventions provided. Further, these insights may help future studies explore strategies to enhance co-occupation, improving the outcomes for infants and parents or caregivers.

                Background The triple planetary crisis of climate change, environmental pollution, and biodiversity loss is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background The neglect of visual identity (VI) at the organizational level within higher education institutions (HEIs) has become a critical issue, while previous studies over the past decade has focused on HEI branding and reputation. This creates a potential gap in understanding HEI branding processes. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between VI and HEI reputation by integrating the Expressiveness Quotient (EQ) and experiential brand meaning at the organizational level. Method Using a qualitative case study approach, the study involves semi-structured interviews with 29 employees from five top-ranked universities in Indonesia. Furthermore, it analyzes the integration of experiential brand meaning across the stages of awareness, interpretation, appropriation, and communication, alongside the EQ framework to assess how visual identity impacts visibility, distinctiveness, transparency, authenticity, and consistency. Result The findings indicate that visual identity significantly influences perceptions of institutional identity and reputation. Effective management of visual identity elements enhances competitive advantage in academia and aligns internal stakeholder perceptions with external branding, which is essential for a cohesive organizational identity. Conclusion This study emphasizes the strategic importance of visual identity in enhancing institutional reputation and provides a model for universities aiming to strengthen their reputational power through effective visual identity management. The study also reveals strong awareness and acceptance of brand identity.

                <p>by Joseph D. Jones, Brandon L. Holder, Andrew C. Montgomery, Chloe V. McAdams, Emily He, Anna E. Burns, Kiran R. Eiken, Alex Vogt, Adriana I. Velarde, Alexandra J. Elder, Jennifer A. McEllin, Stephane Dissel</p>

Sleep is a behavior that is conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Yet, despite extensive studies in humans and animal models, the exact function or functions of sleep remain(s) unknown. A complicating factor in trying to elucidate the function of sleep is the complexity and multiplicity of neuronal circuits that are involved in sleep regulation. It is conceivable that distinct sleep-regulating circuits are only involved in specific aspects of sleep and may underlie different sleep functions. Thus, it would be beneficial to assess the contribution of individual circuits in sleep’s putative functions. The intricacy of the mammalian brain makes this task extremely difficult. However, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> with its simpler brain organization, available connectomics, and unparalleled genetics, offers the opportunity to interrogate individual sleep-regulating centers. In <i>Drosophila</i>, neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) have been proposed to be key regulators of sleep, particularly sleep homeostasis. We recently demonstrated that the most widely used genetic tool to manipulate dFB neurons, the 23E10-GAL4 driver, expresses in 2 sleep-regulating neurons (VNC-SP neurons) located in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), the fly analog of the vertebrate spinal cord. Since most data supporting a role for the dFB in sleep regulation have been obtained using 23E10-GAL4, it is unclear whether the sleep phenotypes reported in these studies are caused by dFB neurons or VNC-SP cells. A recent publication replicated our finding that 23E10-GAL4 contains sleep-promoting neurons in the VNC. However, it also proposed that the dFB is not involved in sleep regulation at all, but this suggestion was made using genetic tools that are not dFB-specific and a very mild sleep deprivation protocol. In this study, using a newly created dFB-specific genetic driver line, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of the majority of 23E10-GAL4 dFB neurons promotes sleep and that these neurons are involved in sleep homeostasis. We also show that dFB neurons require stronger stimulation than VNC-SP cells to promote sleep. In addition, we demonstrate that dFB-induced sleep can consolidate short-term memory (STM) into long-term memory (LTM), suggesting that the benefit of sleep on memory is not circuit-specific. Finally, we show that dFB neurons are neurochemically heterogeneous and can be divided in 3 populations. Most dFB neurons express both glutamate and acetylcholine, while a minority of cells expresses only one of these 2 neurotransmitters. Importantly, dFB neurons do not express GABA, as previously suggested. Using neurotransmitter-specific dFB tools, our data also points at cholinergic dFB neurons as particularly potent at regulating sleep and sleep homeostasis.

However, the comparative vasodilatory effects of femoropopliteal versus neuraxial blocks remain unclear. This pilot study aimed to evaluate these effects by measuring changes in tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) using noninvasive NIRS. Method This study was a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital from July to November 2024 of patients with PAD who underwent lower limb surgeries. Subjects were randomly assigned to either group F (Femoropopliteal block) or group S (Subarachnoid block). StO2 was measured at baseline (pre-block) also 5, 15, and 30 minutes after block using NIRS. The main outcome is the delta increase in the StO2 in each time point between groups. The difference was analyzed with General Linear Model (GLM) with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 16 patients took part in the study (8 in group F and 8 in group S), with a total of 24 observations (12 group F and 12 group S). Increased of StO2 was noticed as early as 5 minutes with mean delta StO2 of 1.4 ± 1.5 for the F group and 5.3 ± 5.2 for the S group (p=0.02). At minute 15, the values were 2.4 ± 1.2 for the F group and 6.6 ± 5.4 for the S group (p=0.02). At minute 30, the values were 2.9 ± 1.7 for the F group and 6.2 ± 4.4 for the S group (p=0.12). Conclusion Compared to subarachnoid block, increase of StO2 hence the vasodilatory effect of femoropopliteal block is modest. Clinical Trial Number The clinical trial number is NCT06702202

                Caccavano et al. examine opioid-mediated suppression of inhibition across cortical regions, species, and development. They report divergence in opioid-mediated disinhibitory motifs between hippocampus and neocortex. This regionally specialized opioid disinhibition is evolutionarily conserved, established in early post-natal development, and regulates immature hippocampal population activity.

                Wang et al. profile the brain’s metabolic uptake and release by comparing blood samples from the cerebral venous sinus and femoral artery. The study identifies key metabolites and lipids consumed or released by the brain. It also highlights age-related changes in metabolic processes.

                The success of many modern machine-learning systems rests on a computational mechanism known as key-value memory. Gershman et al. connect this mechanism to existing ideas about memory in the brain, indicating convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

                FANCA is a DNA repair gene that plays a tumor-suppressor role by maintaining genome stability in normal cells. Luo et al. report that instead of being a tumor suppressor, WT-FANCA demonstrates oncogenic properties in breast cancer by promoting cell proliferation, and it is targetable for breast cancer intervention.

                Fidelito et al. conducted lipid-metabolism-focused CRISPR screens and identified the dependency of prostate cancer on enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway. Further validation identified NUS1 as a dependency of prostate cancer cell lines, xenografts, and PDX-derived organoids.

                Wilson et al. develop a model of presynaptic spontaneous release rate based on the entropic force generated by the density of the recycling pool. They support this model experimentally using multiple approaches. They then use this model to show how β-amyloid mutations lead to an increasing spontaneous release rate.

Observation-based statistical models and climate models suggest that such jumps in ocean temperatures are unlikely to occur even with global warming but are almost impossible without it. In climate models, temperatures revert to the long-term warming trend in the years after such jumps.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98827">Induction of hepatitis B core protein aggregation targeting an unconventional binding site</a></h4>

              
                The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem, with chronic infection leading to liver complications and high death toll. Current treatments, such as nucleos(t)ide analogs and interferon-α, effectively suppress viral replication but rarely cure the infection. To address this, new antivirals targeting different components of the HBV molecular machinery are being developed. Here we investigated the hepatitis B core protein (HBc) that forms the viral capsids and plays a vital role in the HBV life cycle. We explored two distinct binding pockets on the HBV capsid: the central hydrophobic pocket of HBc-dimers and the pocket at the tips of capsid spikes. We synthesized a geranyl dimer that binds to the central pocket with micromolar affinity, and dimeric peptides that bind the spike-tip pocket with sub-micromolar affinity. Cryo-electron microscopy further confirmed the binding of peptide dimers to the capsid spike tips and their capsid-aggregating properties. Finally, we show that the peptide dimers induce HBc aggregation in vitro and in living cells. Our findings highlight two tractable sites within the HBV capsid and provide an alternative strategy to affect HBV capsids.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90750">Microphase separation produces interfacial environment within diblock biomolecular condensates</a></h4>

              
                The phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins is emerging as an important mechanism for cellular organization. However, efforts to connect protein sequences to the physical properties of condensates, that is, the molecular grammar, are hampered by a lack of effective approaches for probing high-resolution structural details. Using a combination of multiscale simulations and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy experiments, we systematically explored a series of systems consisting of diblock elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). The simulations succeeded in reproducing the variation of condensate stability upon amino acid substitution and revealed different microenvironments within a single condensate, which we verified with environmentally sensitive fluorophores. The interspersion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues and a lack of secondary structure formation result in an interfacial environment, which explains both the strong correlation between ELP condensate stability and interfacial hydrophobicity scales, as well as the prevalence of protein-water hydrogen bonds. Our study uncovers new mechanisms for condensate stability and organization that may be broadly applicable.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103159">AI-based discovery and cryoEM structural elucidation of a KATP channel pharmacochaperone</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking defects underlie congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) cases unresponsive to the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener diazoxide, the mainstay medical therapy for CHI. Current clinically used K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibitors have been shown to act as pharmacochaperones and restore surface expression of trafficking mutants; however, their therapeutic utility for K<sub>ATP</sub> trafficking-impaired CHI is hindered by high affinity binding, which limits functional recovery of rescued channels. Recent structural studies of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have revealed a promiscuous pocket where several known K<sub>ATP</sub> pharmacochaperones bind. The structural knowledge provides a framework for discovering K<sub>ATP</sub> channel pharmacochaperones with desired reversible inhibitory effects to permit functional recovery of rescued channels. Using an AI-based virtual screening technology AtomNet followed by functional validation, we identified a novel compound, termed Aekatperone, which exhibits chaperoning effects on K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking mutations. Aekatperone reversibly inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) ~9 μM. Mutant channels rescued to the cell surface by Aekatperone showed functional recovery upon washout of the compound. CryoEM structure of K<sub>ATP</sub> bound to Aekatperone revealed distinct binding features compared to known high affinity inhibitor pharmacochaperones. Our findings unveil a K<sub>ATP</sub> pharmacochaperone enabling functional recovery of rescued channels as a promising therapeutic for CHI caused by K<sub>ATP</sub> trafficking defects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100254">Reported transgenerational responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Caenorhabditis elegans are not robust</a></h4>

              
                We report our attempt to replicate reports of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Multiple laboratories report that <i>C. elegans</i> adults and their F1 embryos exposed to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> show pathogen aversion behavior and increased <i>daf-7/TGFβ</i> reporter gene expression. However, results from one group show persistence of both through the F4 generation. We failed to consistently detect either the avoidance response or elevated <i>daf-7</i> expression beyond the F1 generation. We confirmed that the dsRNA transport proteins SID-1 and SID-2 are required for intergenerational (F1) inheritance of pathogen avoidance, but not for the F1 inheritance of elevated <i>daf-7</i> expression. Reanalysis of RNA seq data provides additional evidence that this intergenerational inherited PA14 response may be mediated by small RNAs. The experimental methods are well-described, the source materials are readily available, including samples from the reporting laboratory, and we explored a variety of environmental conditions likely to account for lab-to-lab variability. None of these adjustments altered our results. We conclude that this example of transgenerational inheritance lacks robustness, confirm that the intergenerational avoidance response, but not the elevated <i>daf-7p::gfp</i> expression in F1 progeny, requires <i>sid-1</i> and <i>sid-2</i>, and identify candidate siRNAs and target genes that may mediate this intergenerational response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/78076">Network segregation is associated with processing speed in the cognitively healthy oldest-ol</a></h4>

              
                The brain is organized into systems and networks of interacting components. The functional connections among these components give insight into the brain's organization and may underlie some cognitive effects of aging. Examining the relationship between individual differences in brain organization and cognitive function in older adults who have reached oldest old ages with healthy cognition can help us understand how these networks support healthy cognitive aging. We investigated functional network segregation in 146 cognitively healthy participants aged 85+ in the McKnight Brain Aging Registry. We found that the segregation of the association system and the individual networks within the association system [the fronto-parietal network (FPN), cingulo-opercular network (CON) and default mode network (DMN)], has strong associations with overall cognition and processing speed. We also provide a healthy oldest-old (85+) cortical parcellation that can be used in future work in this age group. This study shows that network segregation of the oldest-old brain is closely linked to cognitive performance. This work adds to the growing body of knowledge about differentiation in the aged brain by demonstrating that cognitive ability is associated with differentiated functional networks in very old individuals representing successful cognitive aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90269">Auditory cortex anatomy reflects multilingual phonological experience</a></h4>

              
                This study examines whether auditory cortex anatomy reflects multilingual experience, specifically individuals’ phonological repertoire. Using data from over 200 participants exposed to 1–7 languages across 36 languages, we analyzed the role of language experience and typological distances between languages they spoke in shaping neural signatures of multilingualism. Our findings reveal a negative relationship between the thickness of the left and right second transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) and participants’ degree of multilingualism. Models incorporating phoneme-level information in the language experience index explained the most variance in TTG thickness, suggesting that a more extensive and more phonologically diverse language experience is associated with thinner cortices in the second TTG. This pattern, consistent across two datasets, supports the idea of experience-driven pruning and neural efficiency. Our findings indicate that experience with typologically distant languages appear to impact the brain differently than those with similar languages. Moreover, they suggest that early auditory regions seem to represent phoneme-level cross-linguistic information, contrary to the most established models of language processing in the brain, which suggest that phonological processing happens in more lateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS).

                Background: Basic science studies have reported remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) as neuroprotective in acute ischemic stroke, while clinical evidence remains conflicting. The TRICS BASIC study investigated the efficacy and safety of RIC in experimental ischemic stroke using a rigorous clinical trial methodology. Methods: Multi-center, multi-species, parallel group, randomized, controlled, preclinical trial of transient femoral artery clipping to induce RIC in female and male rats and mice subjected to transient endovascular occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Animals were randomized to receive RIC, or sham surgery, after reperfusion. The primary endpoint was good functional outcome at 48 hours, assessed using a composite functional neuroscore. Secondary endpoints was infarct volume at 48 hours and safety, assessed using a standardized health report at 24 and 48 hours. Pre-enrollment harmonization, centralized monitoring, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment and intention-to-treat analysis were applied. Results: The trial enrolled 164 rodents (82 mice and 82 rats) of both sexes (53% females), across seven laboratories. A greater proportion of RIC-treated rodents achieved a favorable functional outcome compared to controls, at 48 hours post-ischemia (55% versus 36%; OR 2.2, 95% CI [1.23-4.4], p=0.009). RIC was associated with a small reduction in infarct volume (standardized mean difference -0.38, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.05], p=0.024). Health monitoring indicated no major safety concerns, and post-operative analgesia requirements were lower in RIC-treated mice. Conclusions: Surgically-induced RIC provided a modest but evident neuroprotective effect in experimental ischemic stroke, underscoring the potential of this strategy as an adjunctive treatment in stroke care. The findings of the TRICS BASIC study highlighted the importance of multicenter preclinical trials in addressing variability and enhancing translational validity. Registration: registered at preclinicaltrials.eu, identifier PCTE0000177.

                Objective: To investigate the mechanistic link between large-scale {delta}-band (0.5-4 Hz) synchrony during sleep and local bistability of the {beta}-{gamma} band (15-200 Hz), a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. Methods: 7-9-hour stereo-EEG sleep recordings were obtained from 14 subjects (22.3 {+/-} 10.8 years old; 7 males) with sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. These recordings were segmented into 10-minute epochs of uninterrupted interictal N2 and N3 stages of NREM sleep. We assessed phase synchrony, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), and {beta}-{gamma} band (15-200 Hz) bistability. Canonical correlation analysis was used to explore whether PAC links {delta}-synchrony to {beta}-{gamma} band bistability. Results: Compared to non-epileptogenic regions (nEZ), the epileptogenic zone (EZ) exhibited stronger 15-200 Hz bistability and greater 2-8 Hz and 15-100 Hz phase synchrony. Compared to N3, N2 showed stronger PAC between 2-30 Hz phases in nEZ and 5-150 Hz amplitudes in EZ. Canonical correlations between direction-specific {delta}-modulated PAC and both bistability and synchrony were identified during N2 (r = 0.86 and 0.82) and N3 (r = 0.84 and 0.80), with the strongest contributors being 2-4 Hz synchrony and bistability in 2-4 Hz and 15-200 Hz bands. Correlations between interictal spikes and canonical covariates of bistability and PAC (r2 = 0.62 for N2 and 0.56 for N3) validated their relevance to epileptogenicity. Interpretation: {delta}-band synchrony and {beta}-{gamma} band bistability play a pivotal role in epileptogenic mechanisms, likely through the coupling of {delta} phases and {beta}-{gamma} amplitudes across large-scale networks--with a significant contribution from the nEZ tissues.

">TNF-α disrupts the malate-aspartate shuttle, driving metabolic rewiring in iPSC-derived enteric neural lineages from Parkinson's Disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction emerges years before motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), implicating the enteric nervous system (ENS) in early disease progression. However, the mechanisms linking the PD hallmark protein, -synuclein (-syn), to ENS dysfunction - and whether these mechanisms are influenced by inflammation - remains elusive. Using iPSC-derived enteric neural lineages from patients with -syn triplications, we reveal that TNF- increases mitochondrial--syn interactions, disrupts the malate-aspartate shuttle, and forces a metabolic shift toward glutamine oxidation. These alterations drive mitochondrial dysfunction, characterizing metabolic impairment under cytokine stress. Interestingly, targeting glutamate metabolism with Chicago Sky Blue 6B restores mitochondrial function, reversing TNF--driven metabolic disruption. Our findings position the ENS as a central player in PD pathogenesis, establishing a direct link between cytokines, -syn accumulation, metabolic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. By uncovering a previously unrecognized metabolic vulnerability in the ENS, we highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for early PD intervention.

">The gut microbiome in early age-related macular degeneration</a></h4>

              
                The gut microbiome is implicated in the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but no study has investigated microbial composition in early AMD nor controlled for important microbiome modulators such as diet and light. This is crucial as diet can change the microbiome rapidly as well as affects disease progression. In addition, the light signaling photoreceptors are dysfunctional in AMD. Here we determined the gut microbiota by conducting 16S DNA metagenomic sequencing of 40 fecal samples from 20 participants with and without early AMD. We normalized both groups to the same diet over 5 days and determined gut microbial composition before and after the diet. To control for light, we assessed habitual light exposure with actigraphy and the post-illumination pupil light response (PIPR) quantified photoreceptor signaling. Clostridium termitidis, Bacteroides gallinarum, and Bacteroides finegoldii were significantly abundant in early AMD compared to controls at both time points. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory species such as Sutterella were only significantly abundant in AMD before the diet. After the diet, the gut microbiome shifted to a significantly greater abundance of commensal bacteria in AMD. Controls and AMD patients had a similar ambient light exposure, however the PIPR was significantly reduced in AMD suggesting impaired light signaling. We are the first to show a distinct gut microbiome in early AMD and infer that dietary changes may positively affect the gut microbiome at early stage of the disease.

">iGABASnFR2: Improved genetically encoded protein sensors of GABA</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring GABAergic inhibition in the nervous system has been enabled by development of an intensiometric molecular sensor that directly detects GABA. However the first generation iGABASnFR exhibits low signal-to-noise and suboptimal kinetics, making in vivo experiments challenging. To improve sensor performance, we targeted several sites in the protein for near-saturation mutagenesis, and evaluated the resulting sensor variants in a high throughput screening system using evoked synaptic release in primary cultured neurons. This identified a sensor variant, iGABASnFR2, with 4.2-fold improved sensitivity and 20% faster kinetics, and binding affinity that remained in a range sensitive to changes in GABA concentration at synapses. We also identified sensors with an inverted response, decreasing fluorescence intensity upon GABA binding. We termed the best such negative-going sensor iGABASnFR2n, which can be used to corroborate observations with the positive-going sensor. These improvements yielded a qualitative enhancement of in vivo performance, enabling us to make the first measurements of direction selective GABA release in the retina and confirm a longstanding hypothesis for how sensitivity to motion arises in the visual system.

                Studying human motoneuron activity through electromyography (EMG) can yield insights into the operation of fundamental spinal cord microcircuits. Traditional surface and needle electromyography (EMG) methodologies have limited capacity to shed light on the diversity of motor unit (MU) control strategies that may be unique to each individual. Here, we employed high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) to sample multiple MUs per subject to investigate the dynamics of inhibitory spinal microcircuits in both upper and lower limb control. We characterised the net inhibition as a function of individual MU firing rates, revealing subject-specific relationships. In silico modelling replicated these experimental characteristics and suggested that properties of the inhibitory currents rather than motoneuron size are responsible for net functional inhibition. Our results show that HDsEMG can highlight distinct control strategies across circuits and motor pools, revealing subject-specific properties of inhibitory spinal microcircuits.

">Systematic bias in surface area asymmetry measurements from automatic cortical parcellations</a></h4>

              
                Anatomical asymmetry is a hallmark of the human brain and may reflect hemispheric differences in its functional organization. Widely used software like FreeSurfer can automate neuroanatomical measurements and facilitate studies of hemispheric asymmetry. However, patterns of surface area lateralization measured using FreeSurfer are curiously consistent across diverse samples. Here, we demonstrate systematic biases in these measurements obtained from the default processing pipeline. We compared surface area asymmetry measured from reconstructions of original brains vs. the same scans after flipping their left-right orientation. The default pipeline returned implausible asymmetry patterns between the original and flipped brains: Many structures were always left- or right-lateralized. Notably, these biases occur prominently in key speech and language regions. In contrast, manual labeling and curvature-based parcellations of key structures both yielded the expected reversals of left/right lateralization in flipped brains. We determined that these biases result from discrepancies in how regional labels are defined in the left vs. right hemisphere in the default cortical parcellation atlases. These biases are carried into individual parcellations because the FreeSurfer parcellation algorithm prioritizes vertex correspondence to the template atlas relative to individual neuroanatomical variation. We further demonstrate several straightforward, bias-free approaches to measuring surface area asymmetry, including using symmetric registration templates and parcellation atlases, vertex-wise analyses, and within-subject curvature-based parcellations. These results highlight theoretical concerns about using only the default processing stream to make nferences about population-level brain asymmetry and underscore the need for validating bias-free neuroanatomical measurements, particularly when studying regions where structural lateralization may underlie functional lateralization.

">Salient objects in a scene trigger enhanced perceptual selection and memory encoding</a></h4>

              
                Rapidly detecting salient objects from surrounding environments is crucial for survival. Our study demonstrates that salient objects in visual search arrays trigger von Restorff-like effects. In a search task, participants detected a tilted target bar among distractors with EEG recordings. The results revealed that salient objects elicited the largest and earliest N2pc component, reflecting early attentional selection, which enhanced multivariate decoding of target location. Importantly, early selection of highly salient targets (25{degrees} tilt) triggered a cascade of preferential processing downstream, marked by stronger P3b components, neural synchronization, and phase-amplitude coupling between low- and high-frequency activity, along with better recall performance of target orientation. The strength of memory-related activity on the current trial predicted the vigor of the next selection event, indicating that salience-driven learning influences future attentional control. Overall, object salience in spatial arrays drives a cascade of processing, facilitating rapid learning of object relevance while humans search their environment.

">Fruit flies actively restart their circadian clock by proactively shaping their environment</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are prevalent on Earth and are generally believed to provide adaptive advantage to organisms. Functional circadian clocks, and their synchronization with the outside world, has also been implicated to provide health benefits for humans. However, experimental evidence for the benefits of possessing a circadian clock is sparse and largely restricted to prokaryotic organisms. Here, we provide evidence for the benefits of circadian clocks and temporally organized life in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate that flies prefer and actively choose to live under circadian clock regulation: Exposure to constant light breaks down the circadian clock and leads to arrhythmic locomotor activity patterns. When given the choice to move between dark and illuminated areas in a constant light environment, flies were able to maintain, or even re-gain, rhythmic behavioural patterns. These rhythms were mirrored by regular positional changes between the two areas, demonstrating that flies actively contribute to creating an environment allowing circadian clock function and temporal organisation. The self-inflicted rhythms were accompanied by molecular rhythms in the majority of the clock neurons known to drive behavioural rhythms in flies, showing that they are indeed controlled by the circadian clock. Finally, behavioural rhythmicity was correlated with restoration of rhythmic sleep patterns and less-fragmented sleep compared to arrhythmic flies. While life is possible without a circadian clock, we show that if given the choice, animals prefer to live in a temporally organized manner and actively contribute to make this possible. This provides strong arguments for the benefits of possessing and using a circadian clock, for example by ensuring a better quality of sleep

">Human sensory neurons exhibit cell-type-specific, pain-associated differences in intrinsic excitability and expression of SCN9A and SCN10A</a></h4>

              
                Despite the prevalence of chronic pain, the approval of novel, non-opioid therapeutics has been slow. A major translational challenge in analgesic development is the difference in gene expression and functional properties between human and rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Extensive work in rodents suggests that sensitization of nociceptors in the DRG is essential for the pathogenesis and persistence of pain; however, direct evidence demonstrating similar physiological sensitization in humans is limited. Here, we examine whether pain history is associated with nociceptor hyperexcitability in human DRG (hDRG). We identified three electrophysiologically distinct clusters (E-types) of hDRG neurons based on firing properties and membrane excitability. Combining electrophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA-sequencing (''Patch-seq''), we linked these E-types to specific transcriptionally defined nociceptor subpopulations. Comparing hDRG neurons from donors with and without evident pain history revealed cluster-specific, pain history-associated differences in hDRG excitability. Finally, we found that hDRG from donors with pain history express higher levels of transcripts encoding voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) and 1.8 (NaV1.8) which specifically regulate nociceptor excitability. These findings suggest that donors with pain history exhibit distinct hDRG electrophysiological profiles compared to those without pain history and further validate NaV1.7 and 1.8 as targets for analgesic development.

">Enhancing Brain Age Prediction and Neurodegeneration Detection with Contrastive Learning on Regional Biomechanical Properties</a></h4>

              
                The aging process affects brain structure and function, yet its biomechanical properties remain underexplored. Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) provides a unique perspective by mapping brain tissue stiffness and damping ratio, observables that correlate with age and disease. Using a self-supervised contrastive regression framework, we demonstrate that MRE surpasses conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in sensitivity. Specifically, stiffness captures Alzheimer's disease (AD), while damping ratio detects subtle changes associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our regional analysis identifies deep brain structures, particularly the caudate and thalamus, as key biomarkers of aging. The greater age sensitivity of MRE translates to superior differentiation of AD and MCI from healthy individuals, pinpointing regions where significant biomechanical alterations occur, notably the thalamus in AD and hippocampus in MCI. Furthermore, our results reveal biomechanical alterations in cognitively healthy individuals whose aging profiles closely resemble patients with MCI and AD. These findings highlight MRE's potential as a biomarker for early neurodegenerative changes, aiding dementia risk detection and early intervention.

">Unraveling Temporal Dynamics of SPSD matrices viaRiemmanian Multi-Scale Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the temporal dynamics of high-dimensional, time-varying systems remains a fundamental challenge across scientific disciplines. In many real-world systems, the interactions between sensors are also time-varying, which presents an additional level of complexity in extracting a meaningful representation and subsequent modeling. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-resolution frame-work for analyzing the temporal dynamics of Symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (SPSD) matrices, such as correlation matrices. A key innovation of our framework is a difference operator that respects the symmetry of the Riemannian manifold. We apply this operator recursively and extract a hierarchical representation of the temporal dynamics of SPSD matrices with a fine frequency resolution. We employ spectral analysis to select informative frequency components and extract key structural patterns. Specifically, our approach reveals which sensors of the original signal drive the correlational dynamics, thus enhancing both denoising and the interoperability of SPSD matrix evolution over time. We validate our method using synthetic data and real neural recordings from mice trained to perform a motor task. Our results demonstrate its ability to extract meaningful structures from complex temporal datasets and provide deeper insights into evolving network connectivity.

">Temporal dynamics of proteome and phosphorproteome during neuronal differentiation in the reference KOLF2.1J iPSC line</a></h4>

              
                Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have emerged as a powerful model to investigate both neuronal development and neurodegenerative diseases. Although transcriptomics and imaging have been applied to characterize neuronal development signatures, comprehensive datasets of protein and post-translational modifications (PTMs) are not readily available. Here, we applied quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics to profile the differentiation of the KOLF2.1J iPSC line, the first reference line of the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) project. We developed an automated workflow enabling high-coverage enrichment of proteins and phosphoproteins. Our results revealed molecular signatures across proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscapes during differentiation of iPSC-derived neurons. Proteomic data highlighted distinct changes in mitochondrial pathways throughout the course of differentiation, while phosphoproteomics revealed specific regulatory dynamics in GTPase signaling pathways and microtubule proteins. Additionally, phosphosite dynamics exhibited discordant trends compared to protein expression, particularly in processes related to axon functions and RNA transport. Furthermore, we mapped the kinase dynamic changes that are critical for neuronal development and maturation. We developed an interactive Web app (https://niacard.shinyapps.io/Phosphoproteome/) to visualize temporal landscape dynamics of protein and phosphosite expression. By establishing baselines of proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles for neuronal differentiation, this dataset offers a valuable resource for future research into neuronal development and neurodegenerative diseases using this reference iPSC line.

">Lipidomics profiling identifies β-oxidation as a key process in noise-induced hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the second leading cause of hearing loss worldwide, and the most common cause in young adults. Despite this burden, the molecular mechanisms by which noise causes damage are poorly understood, and there are no pharmacologic therapies to prevent or reduce noise-induced damage to the inner ear. Here, using targeted and untargeted lipidomics, we show that noise exposure induces changes in fatty acid (FA) and acylcarnitine (CAR) species in the inner ear, a metabolic profile indicative of noise-induced increases in {beta}-oxidation. This conclusion is validated through treatment with Etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, the rate-limiting enzyme of long-chain {beta}-oxidation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that blocking {beta}-oxidation with Etomoxir does not affect hearing in a normal acoustic environment but reduces the extent of hearing loss induced by an intense noise exposure (2 hours, 112 dB SPL, 8-16kHz). Together, our findings provide insights into cochlear energy metabolism and suggest that its modulation could be targeted to reduce NIHL.

">Male and Female Mice Are Similarly Susceptible to Chronic Nondiscriminatory Social Defeat Stress Despite Differences in Attack Frequency from Aggressor</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Mood disorders are often precipitated by chronic stress and can result in an inability to adapt to the environment and increased vulnerability to challenging experiences. While diagnoses of mood disorders are diagnosed twice as frequently in women than in men, most preclinical chronic social defeat stress mouse models exclude females due to decreased aggression toward female intruders. Objectives: We previously reported that the chronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS) paradigm is effective in both sexes, allowing for comparisons between male and female mice. We aimed to improve the screening protocol to identify CD-1 aggressors for use in CNSDS and the method for determining susceptibility to CNSDS. Finally, we aimed to determine whether susceptibility to CNSDS correlated with impaired performance in a satiety-based outcome devaluation task. Methods: We analyzed CNSDS screening and social defeat sessions to determine appropriate parameters for selecting CD-1 aggressors and investigated aggressions toward male and female intruder mice. We also investigated CNSDS effects on a reward valuation task. Results: We observed that despite receiving fewer attacks, female mice are equally susceptible to CNSDS as males and that CNSDS abolished satiety-based outcome devaluation in susceptible male and female mice, but not in resilient male and female mice. Conclusions: These data suggest that CNSDS-defined susceptible and resilient phenotypes extend to reward behaviors.

">Cell-type specific sensory and motor activity in the cuneiform nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus in mice</a></h4>

              
                The activity of neurotransmitter-based cell types in the cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei during locomotion, non-locomotor behaviors, and following sensory stimulation is not fully understood. Using fiber photometry in mice, we found cell-type specific responses to sensory stimuli. Glutamatergic and GABAergic cells responded to sound, visual looming, and air puffs, except for pedunculopontine GABAergic cells, which did not respond to visual looming. Cholinergic cells responded to air puffs. When a stimulus triggered high-speed locomotion, activity increased in cuneiform glutamatergic neurons. Conversely, when low-speed locomotion was triggered, activity increased in pedunculopontine glutamatergic neurons. During spontaneous low-speed locomotion, activity increased in pedunculopontine glutamatergic cells. Activity also increased in a cell type-specific manner during grooming or rearing. Our study shows cell type-specific activity in the cuneiform or pedunculopontine nuclei during locomotion, non-locomotor behaviors, and following sensory stimulation. Sensory responsiveness likely has relevance in Parkinson's disease, where sensory circuits are increasingly targeted to improve walking.

">Long-term editing of brain circuits in mice using an engineered electrical synapse</a></h4>

              
                Electrical signaling across distinct populations of brain cells underpins cognitive and emotional function; however, approaches that selectively regulate electrical signaling between two cellular components of a mammalian neural circuit remain sparse. Here, we engineered an electrical synapse composed of two connexin proteins found in Morone americana (white perch fish), connexin34.7 and connexin35, to accomplish mammalian circuit modulation. By exploiting protein mutagenesis, devising a new in vitro system for assaying connexin hemichannel docking, and performing computational modeling of hemichannel interactions, we uncovered a structural motif that contributes to electrical synapse formation. Targeting these motifs, we designed connexin34.7 and connexin35 hemichannels that dock with each other to form an electrical synapse, but not with other major connexins expressed in the mammalian central nervous system. We validated this electrical synapse in vivo using C. elegans and mice, demonstrating that it can strengthen communication across neural circuits composed of pairs of distinct cell types and modify behavior accordingly. Thus, we establish Long-term integration of Circuits using connexins (LinCx) for precision circuit-editing in mammals.

">Autism spectrum disorder risk genes have convergent effects on transcription and neuronal firing patterns in primary neurons</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder with numerous genetic risk factors. Notably, a disproportionate number of risk genes encode transcription regulators including transcription factors and proteins that regulate chromatin. Here, we tested the function of nine such ASD-linked transcription regulators by depleting them in primary cultured neurons. We then defined the resulting gene expression disruptions using RNA-sequencing and tested effects on neuronal firing using multielectrode array recordings. We identified shared gene expression signatures across many ASD risk genes that converged on disruption of critical synaptic genes. Fitting with this, we detected drastic disruptions to neuronal firing throughout neuronal maturation. Together, these findings provide evidence that multiple ASD-linked transcriptional regulators disrupt transcription of synaptic genes and have convergent effects on neuronal firing that may contribute to enhanced ASD risk.

">Growth charts of infant visual neurodevelopment generalize across global contexts</a></h4>

              
                Normative brain growth charts in early life hold great promise for furthering basic and clinical science. We leverage the rapid, substantial development of visual cortex function that is indexed by visual-evoked potentials (VEP) in electroencephalography to create longitudinal normative growth curves of task-related brain function with 1374 observations contributed by 802 infants (57 to 579 days old) from South Africa, Brazil, and the United States. Site-specific models were cross-validated and showed excellent fits to other sites' samples, demonstrating functional growth curves generalize across contexts robustly. Deviations from the normative growth models associated with early environmental and behavioral measures such as prenatal exposures and postnatal cognition. These findings demonstrate the utility of using functional growth charts to understand and potentially act on individual neurodevelopmental trajectories. VEP brain function growth charts represent a new direction for EEG research to serve public health and early identification efforts to support healthy brain development globally.
