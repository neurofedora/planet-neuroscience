                arXiv:2411.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: This study examined whether currently existing clinical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) capabilities and board-certified radiologists' reports and interpretations can assist with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) diagnosis. Design: retrospective case series. Setting: this study assessed six patients with TES criteria recruited from the Sydney area, Australia Main outcomes: patients' clinical history and clinical presentation along TES diagnostic criteria, board-certified radiologist reports of structural MRI and 18FDG-PET. Results: one patient was classified as possible CTE, and the others were classified as probable CTE with significant RHI exposure history and a spectrum of cognitive deficits and other neuropsychiatric disturbances consistent with TES diagnostic criteria. Most common radiological features included atrophy of posterior superior parietal region and Evans Index > 0.25. FDG-PET's pattern of common regions of hypometabolism and differing hypometabolism across participants suggested that FDG-PET and structural MRI have the potential for stratifying different TES stages. Conclusions: this study highlights the potential of a combined clinical and radiological approach using solely current capabilities to improve TES diagnosis and suggests a larger study. Such expanded investigation is crucial for advancing the ante-mortem diagnosis and management of CTE.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04634">More variable circadian rhythms in epilepsy: a retrospective cross-sectional study using long-term heart rate recordings from wearable sensors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The circadian rhythm aligns physiology and behaviour with the 24-hour light-dark cycle, and its disruption is linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy. However, how to best quantify circadian disruption remains unclear, as it can manifest across various properties and timescales. A promising but under-explored approach is to assess the intra-individual variability in circadian rhythms over timescales of weeks to years. This is yet to be studied in epilepsy.
  Methods: We retrospectively used wearable smartwatch data (Fitbit) from 143 people with epilepsy (PWE) and 31 controls. For each participant, we extracted the circadian oscillation underlying their heart rate time series and analysed the intra-individual variability of three circadian properties: period, acrophase, and amplitude.
  Findings: We found increased intra-individual variability in period (77 min vs. 62 min, z=3.32, p<0.001) and acrophase (68 min vs. 54 min, z=2.97, p=0.003) for PWE compared to controls, but not in amplitude (1.98 bpm vs. 2.05 bpm, z=-0.66, p=0.51). For PWE, we did not find any correlations between seizure frequency and intra-individual variability in circadian properties, or any difference between weeks with and without seizures.
  Interpretation: This finding indicates that the circadian rhythm of heart rate is more variable for people with epilepsy and that this can be detected using a wearable device. However, we were unable to find any associations with seizure frequency or occurrence, suggesting intra-individual variability could be another manifestation of epilepsy aetiology. Future work should investigate the combined role of anti-seizure medications, demographics, co-morbidities, and health behaviours in driving the increased intra-individual variability of circadian properties in epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04568">Dynamic-Attention-based EEG State Transition Modeling for Emotion Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion decoding can objectively quantify people's emotional state and has broad application prospects in human-computer interaction and early detection of emotional disorders. Recently emerging deep learning architectures have significantly improved the performance of EEG emotion decoding. However, existing methods still fall short of fully capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of neural signals, which are crucial for representing emotion processing. This study proposes a Dynamic-Attention-based EEG State Transition (DAEST) modeling method to characterize EEG spatiotemporal dynamics. The model extracts spatiotemporal components of EEG that represent multiple parallel neural processes and estimates dynamic attention weights on these components to capture transitions in brain states. The model is optimized within a contrastive learning framework for cross-subject emotion recognition. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets: FACED, SEED, and SEED-V. It achieved 75.4% accuracy in the binary classification of positive and negative emotions and 59.3% in nine-class discrete emotion classification on the FACED dataset, 88.1% in the three-class classification of positive, negative, and neutral emotions on the SEED dataset, and 73.6% in five-class discrete emotion classification on the SEED-V dataset. The learned EEG spatiotemporal patterns and dynamic transition properties offer valuable insights into neural dynamics underlying emotion processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13501">Multiscale cortical morphometry reveals pronounced regional and scale-dependent variations across the lifespan</a></h4>

Abstract: Motivation: Characterising the changes in cortical morphology across the lifespan is fundamental for a range of research and clinical applications. Most studies to date have found a monotonic decrease in commonly used morphometrics, such as cortical thickness and volume, across the entire brain with increasing age. Any regional variations reported are subtle changes in the rate of decrease. However, these descriptions of morphological changes have been limited to a single length scale. Here, we delineate the morphological changes associated with the healthy lifespan in multiscale morphometrics.
  Methods: We applied multiscale morphometric analysis to structural MRI from subjects aged 6-88 years from NKI (n=833) and CamCAN (n=641). These multiscale morphometrics were obtained at both the cortical hemisphere and lobe level.
  Results: On the level of whole cortical hemispheres, lifespan trajectories show diverging and even opposing trends at different spatial scales, in contrast to the monotonic decreases of volume and thickness described so far. Importantly, larger scales displayed most dramatic changes across the lifespan (up to 60%). More pronounced lobal differences in lifespan trajectories also became apparent in scales over 0.7mm. In a proof-of-principle application in brain age prediction, we also demonstrate added information contributed by multiscale morphometrics.
  Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive multiscale description of lifespan effects on cortical morphology in an age range from 6-88~years. In future, this can form the foundations for a normative model to compare individuals or cohorts, hence identifying multiscale morphological abnormalities. Our results reveal the complementary information contained in different spatial scales, suggesting that morphometrics should not be considered on a single scale, but as functions of length scale.

Abstract: Scientists are increasingly leveraging advances in instruments, automation, and collaborative tools to scale up their experiments and research goals, leading to new bursts of discovery. Various scientific disciplines, including neuroscience, have adopted key technologies to enhance collaboration, reproducibility, and automation. Drawing inspiration from advancements in the software industry, we present a roadmap to enhance the reliability and scalability of scientific operations for diverse research teams tackling large and complex projects. We introduce a five-level Capability Maturity Model describing the principles of rigorous scientific operations in projects ranging from small-scale exploratory studies to large-scale, multi-disciplinary research endeavors. Achieving higher levels of operational maturity necessitates the adoption of new, technology-enabled methodologies, which we refer to as SciOps. This concept is derived from the DevOps methodologies that have revolutionized the software industry. SciOps involves digital research environments that seamlessly integrate computational, automation, and AI-driven efforts throughout the research cycle-from experimental design and data collection to analysis and dissemination, ultimately leading to closed-loop discovery. This maturity model offers a framework for assessing and improving operational practices in multidisciplinary research teams, guiding them towards greater efficiency and effectiveness in scientific inquiry.

                arXiv:2402.02520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which gives abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.

                arXiv:2406.12895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels

Abstract: The burgeoning field of brain health research increasingly leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret and analyze neurological data. This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

Abstract: According to the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, every sufficiently large neural network with randomly initialized weights contains a sub-network which - still with its random weights - already performs as well for a given task as the trained super-network. We present the first approach based on a genetic algorithm to find such strong lottery ticket sub-networks without training or otherwise computing any gradient. We show that, for smaller instances of binary classification tasks, our evolutionary approach even produces smaller and better-performing lottery ticket networks than the state-of-the-art approach using gradient information.

                arXiv:2411.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms (EMOAs) are widely employed to tackle problems with multiple conflicting objectives. Recent research indicates that not all objectives are equally important to the decision-maker (DM). In the context of interactive EMOAs, preference information elicited from the DM during the optimization process can be leveraged to identify and discard irrelevant objectives, a crucial step when objective evaluations are computationally expensive. However, much of the existing literature fails to account for the dynamic nature of DM preferences, which can evolve throughout the decision-making process and affect the relevance of objectives. This study addresses this limitation by simulating dynamic shifts in DM preferences within a ranking-based interactive algorithm. Additionally, we propose methods to discard outdated or conflicting preferences when such shifts occur. Building on prior research, we also introduce a mechanism to safeguard relevant objectives that may become trapped in local or global optima due to the diminished correlation with the DM-provided rankings. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively manage evolving preferences and significantly enhance the quality and desirability of the solutions produced by the algorithm.

                arXiv:2411.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have demonstrated that embedding a few bits of payload in each spike exchanged between the spiking neurons can further enhance inference accuracy. In a split computing architecture, where the SNN is divided across two separate devices, the device storing the first layers must share information about the spikes generated by the local output neurons with the other device. Consequently, the advantages of multi-level spikes must be balanced against the challenges of transmitting additional bits between the two devices.
  This paper addresses these challenges by investigating a wireless neuromorphic split computing architecture employing multi-level SNNs. For this system, we present the design of digital and analog modulation schemes optimized for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios provide insights into the performance gains of multi-level SNN models and the optimal payload size as a function of the quality of the connection between a transmitter and receiver.

                arXiv:2411.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle accelerator operation requires simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is particularly challenging due to trade-offs between the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), have been leveraged for many optimization problems, however, they do not apply to complex control problems by design. This paper demonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems using a Deep Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) algorithm in particle accelerators. We compare DDRL algorithm with Model Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), GA and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat load and trip rates in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual states and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraint for energy requirements of the beam. A physics-based surrogate model based on real data is developed. This surrogate model is differentiable and allows back-propagation of gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front for two objectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high dimensional problems.

                arXiv:2407.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation is controlled by at least two partially dissociable, concurrently developed systems in the brain. The cognitive map informs an organism of its location, bearing, and distances between environmental features, enabling shortcuts. Response-based navigation, on the other hand, the process of combining percept-action pairs into routes, is regarded as inaccurate and inflexible, ultimately subserving map-based representation. As such, navigation models tend to assume the primacy of maps, top-down constructed via predictive control and distance perception, while neglecting response-based strategies. Here we show the sufficiency of a minimal feedforward framework in a classic visual navigation task. Our agents, directly translating visual perception to movement, navigate to a hidden goal in an open field, an environment often assumed to require a map-based representation. While visual distance enables direct trajectories to the goal, two distinct algorithms develop to robustly navigate using visual angles alone. Each of the three confers unique contextual tradeoffs as well as aligns with movement behavior observed in rodents, insects, fish, and sperm cells, suggesting the widespread significance of response-based strategies. We advocate further study of navigation from the bottom-up without assuming online access to computationally expensive top-down representations, which may better explain behavior under energetic or attentional constraints.

	<p>Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as a self-reported perception of cognitive decline that occurs without clear objective signs of cognitive impairment. There is still uncertainty in the literature about the reliability of SCD as an accurate indicator of the early stages of major neurocognitive disorders. Furthermore, objectifying cognitive impairment in SCD is difficult, mainly due to the insensitivity of the assessment instruments. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential contribution of the face-name associative recognition test (FNART) to the objective identification of memory impairment in SCD. Method: A research sample of 69 adults with SCD and 69 healthy controls (HCs) recruited in the community were administered in the FNART, which included 32 photographs of neutral faces associated with 32 first names. Results: The total score of the HC group in the FNART was significantly better than that of the SCD group. Moreover, analyses based on the serial position of the stimuli showed that the SCD group performed significantly worse than the HC group only for the middle items (stimuli placed at the beginning or end of learning lists are more likely to be recalled than those presented in the middle), while no primacy and recency effects were found in the HCs. Conclusions: These findings indicate that associative episodic memory is more vulnerable in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) compared to those without cognitive complaints. Additionally, they suggest that the FNART may be effective in identifying cognitive decline in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In this narrative review, we have surveyed results obtained from a research program dealing with the role of semantic memory disorders as a predictor of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Objectives: In this research program, we have taken into account many different putative markers, provided of a different complexity in the study of the semantic network. These markers ranged from the number of words produced on a semantic fluency task to the following: (a) the discrepancy between scores obtained on semantic vs. phonemic word fluency tests; (b) the presence, at the single-word level, of features (such as a loss of low typical words on a category verbal fluency task) typical of a degraded semantic system; or (c) the presence of more complex phenomena (such as the semantic distance between consecutively produced word pairs) concerning the organization of the semantic network. In the present review, all these studies have been presented, providing separate subsections for (a) methods, (b) results, and (c) a short discussion. Some tentative general conclusions have been drawn at the end of the review. We found that at baseline all these markers are impaired in MCI patients who will later convert to AD, but also that they do not necessarily show a linear worsening during the progression to AD and allow one to make different predictions about the time of development of AD. Our conclusions were that, rather than searching for the best marker of conversion, we should use a range of different markers allowing us to obtain the information most appropriate to the goal of our investigation.</p>

	<p>Background: Helminth infections are associated with cognitive deficits, especially in school-age children. Deworming treatment in heavily infected children improves their short- and long-term memory recall. In mice, intraperitoneal helminth infection with Taenia crassiceps (T. crassiceps) shows sexual dimorphism in terms of the parasite load, immune response, hormone levels, and behavioral changes. We have previously shown poorer short-term memory performance and changes in the concentrations of cytokines and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, which were replicated in this study. The molecular changes in other brain structures, such as those related to reproduction, are unknown. Methods: Male and female Balb/cAnN mice were chronically infected with T. crassiceps larvae. We determined the peritoneal parasite load and established the presence of cytokines and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus. Results: The parasite load was higher in female than male infected mice, as expected. In the hippocampus, the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin increased in males but decreased in females. In contrast, in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, the neurotransmitters assessed showed no statistical differences. The cytokine profiles were different in each brain structure. The TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; levels in the olfactory bulb and the IL-4 levels in the hippocampus of infected mice were dimorphic; IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; was augmented in both male and female infected animals, although the increase was higher in infected males. Conclusions: The brain responds to peripheral infection with cytokine levels that vary from structure to structure. This could be a partial explanation for the dimorphic behavioral alterations associated with infection, it also demonstrates the synergic interaction between the immune, the endocrine, and the nervous systems.</p>

                Recent evidence suggests that the development of gut microbiota during infancy affects several metabolic, immune, and endocrine pathways in humans. An imbalance in gut microbiota diversity or function, also known as dysbiosis, not only affects early child growth and development, but is also linked with the development of chronic, non-communicable diseases in later life. The Child Health And Microbiome Development Study – Pakistan (CHAMP) study aimed to longitudinally assess gut microbiota development and associated factors (maternal, child, and demographic) during early childhood in populations residing in malnutrition-endemic communities in Pakistan. A prospective cohort of mother-infant pairs (n=70) will be recruited from District Swat, Pakistan, and followed for two years. Complete information about demographic characteristics, anti-natal and post-natal care, dietary intake, feeding practices, and child health will be collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference, and head circumference), dry blood spots, and fecal samples were also collected. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Khyber Medical University, Pakistan. The study is also registered on clincaltrial.gov (Ref no: NCT05793294). The study findings will help researchers understand gut microbiota development, associated factors, and their impact on longitudinal growth in infants during the first two years of life.

                Abstract Background F-keratin forms an evolutionary conserved nanocomposite which allows birds to fly. Structural models for F-keratin are all based on the pioneering X-ray diffraction studies on seagull F-keratin, first published in 1932, confirmed for other species and refined over the years. There is, however, no experimental proof because native F-keratin does not form a perfect molecular crystal as required for structure determination. Methods Peacock’s tail feathers were systematically re-investigated by taking diffraction patterns at different rotation angles. Using the recently developed AlphaFold algorithm, a collection of 3D models of arbitrarily truncated and multiplied Pavo cristatus F-keratin sequences was created. The shape, dimensions, density and interfacial exposure of functionally relevant amino acid side chains of the calculated 3D building blocks were used as the initial selection criteria for filamentous F-keratin precursors. Full reproducibility of in silico folding and agreement with previous results from mechanical testing, biochemical analyses and SAXS experiments was mandatory for suggesting the tentative structure for the novel F-keratin repeating unit. Results The filament of the F-keratin polymer is an alternating arrangement of two units called "N-block" and "C-block": Four strands AA 1–52 form a disulfide-stabilized twisted parallelepiped, with 89° internal rotation within eight levels of β-sandwiches. Four strands AA 81–100 form a two-level “β-sandwich” in which aromatic residues provide resilience, like vertebral discs in a spinal column. The pitch of an N+C-block octamer is 10 nm. Solidification may involve "C-blocks" to temporarily mold into "C-wedges" of 18° tilt, which align F-keratin into laterally amorphous fiber-reinforced composites of 9.5 nm axial periodicity. This experimentally significant distance corresponds to the fully stretched AA 53–80 matrix segment. The deformed “spinal column” unwinds under compression when F-keratin filaments perfectly align horizontally into stacked sheets in the solid state. Conclusions At present, the tentative structure presented here is without alternatives.

                <p>by J. Roadnight Sheehan, Astrid S. de Wijn, Thales Souza Freire, Ran Friedman</p>

Resistance to therapy is a major clinical obstacle to treatment of cancer and communicable diseases. Drug selection in treatment of patients where the disease is showing resistance to therapy is often guided by IC<sub>50</sub> or fold-IC<sub>50</sub> values. In this work, through a model of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), we contest using fold-IC<sub>50</sub> values as a guide for treatment selection. CML is a blood cancer that is treated with Abl1 inhibitors, and is often seen as a model for targeted therapy and drug resistance. Resistance to the first-line treatment occurs in approximately one in four patients. The most common cause of resistance is mutations in the Abl1 enzyme. Different mutant Abl1 enzymes show resistance to different Abl1 inhibitors and the mechanisms that lead to resistance for various mutation and inhibitor combinations are not fully known, making the selection of Abl1 inhibitors for treatment a difficult task. We developed a model based on information of catalysis, inhibition and pharmacokinetics, and applied it to study the effect of three Abl1 inhibitors on mutants of the Abl1 enzyme. From this model, we show that the relative decrease of product formation rate (defined in this work as “inhibitory reduction prowess”) is a better indicator of resistance than an examination of the size of the product formation rate or fold-IC<sub>50</sub> values for the mutant. We also examine current ideas and practices that guide treatment choice and suggest a new parameter for selecting treatments that could increase the efficacy and thus have a positive impact on patient outcomes.

Previous work shows that a host’s resident microbial community can provide resistance against an invading pathogen. However, this community is continuously changing over time due to adaptive mutations, and how these changes affect the invasion resistance of these communities remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we used an experimental evolution approach in synthetic communities of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium to investigate how the invasion resistance of this community against a bacterium expressing a virulent phenotype, i.e., colicin secretion, changes over time. We show that evolved communities accumulate mutations in genes involved in carbon metabolism and motility, while simultaneously becoming less resistant to invasion. By investigating two-species competitions and generating a three-species competition model, we show that this outcome is dependent on the strength of interspecies interactions. Our study demonstrates how adaptive changes in microbial communities can make them more prone to the detrimental effects of an invading species.

Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) methylate histone and non-histone proteins to regulate biological outcomes such as development and disease including viral infection. While PKMTs have been extensively studied for modulating the antiviral responses via host gene regulation, their role in methylation of proteins encoded by viruses and its impact on host–pathogen interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we discovered distinct nucleo-cytoplasmic form of euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1<sup>N/C</sup>), a PKMT, that phase separates into viral inclusion bodies (IBs) upon cytoplasmic RNA-virus infection (Sendai Virus). EHMT1<sup>N/C</sup> interacts with cytoplasmic EHMT2 and methylates SeV-Nucleoprotein upon infection. Elevated nucleoprotein methylation during infection correlated with coalescence of small IBs into large mature platforms for efficient replication. Inhibition of EHMT activity by pharmacological inhibitors or genetic depletion of EHMT1<sup>N/C</sup> reduced the size of IBs with a concomitant reduction in replication. Additionally, we also found that EHMT1 condensation is not restricted to SeV alone but was also seen upon pathogenic RNA viral infections caused by Chandipura and Dengue virus. Collectively, our work elucidates a new mechanism by which cytoplasmic EHMT1 acts as proviral host factor to regulate host–pathogen interaction.

Humans experience many influenza infections over their lives, resulting in complex and varied immunological histories. Although experimental and quantitative analyses have improved our understanding of the immunological processes defining an individual’s antibody repertoire, how these within-host processes are linked to population-level influenza epidemiology in humans remains unclear. Here, we used a multilevel mathematical model to jointly infer antibody dynamics and individual-level lifetime influenza A/H3N2 infection histories for 1,130 individuals in Guangzhou, China, using 67,683 haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay measurements against 20 A/H3N2 strains from repeat serum samples collected between 2009 and 2015. These estimated infection histories allowed us to reconstruct historical seasonal influenza patterns in humans and to investigate how influenza incidence varies over time, space, and age in this population. We estimated median annual influenza infection rates to be approximately 19% from 1968 to 2015, but with substantial variation between years; 88% of individuals were estimated to have been infected at least once during the study period (2009 to 2015), and 20% were estimated to have 3 or more infections in that time. We inferred decreasing infection rates with increasing age, and found that annual attack rates were highly correlated across all locations, regardless of their distance, suggesting that age has a stronger impact than fine-scale spatial effects in determining an individual’s antibody profile. Finally, we reconstructed each individual’s expected antibody profile over their lifetime and inferred an age-stratified relationship between probability of infection and HI titre. Our analyses show how multi-strain serological panels provide rich information on long-term epidemiological trends, within-host processes, and immunity when analysed using appropriate inference methods, and adds to our understanding of the life course epidemiology of influenza A/H3N2.

                <p>by Gulnara Tagirdzhanova, Paul Saary, Ellen S. Cameron, Carmen C. G. Allen, Arkadiy I. Garber, David Díaz Escandón, Andrew T. Cook, Spencer Goyette, Veera Tuovinen Nogerius, Alfredo Passo, Helmut Mayrhofer, Håkon Holien, Tor Tønsberg, Lisa Y. Stein, Robert D. Finn, Toby Spribille</p>

In lichen research, metagenomes are increasingly being used for evaluating symbiont composition and metabolic potential, but the overall content and limitations of these metagenomes have not been assessed. We reassembled over 400 publicly available metagenomes, generated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), constructed phylogenomic trees, and mapped MAG occurrence and frequency across the data set. Ninety-seven percent of the 1,000 recovered MAGs were bacterial or the fungal symbiont that provides most cellular mass. Our mapping of recovered MAGs provides the most detailed survey to date of bacteria in lichens and shows that 4 family-level lineages from 2 phyla accounted for as many bacterial occurrences in lichens as all other 71 families from 16 phyla combined. Annotation of highly complete bacterial, fungal, and algal MAGs reveals functional profiles that suggest interdigitated vitamin prototrophies and auxotrophies, with most lichen fungi auxotrophic for biotin, most bacteria auxotrophic for thiamine and the few annotated algae with partial or complete pathways for both, suggesting a novel dimension of microbial cross-feeding in lichen symbioses. Contrary to longstanding hypotheses, we found no annotations consistent with nitrogen fixation in bacteria other than known cyanobacterial symbionts. Core lichen symbionts such as algae were recovered as MAGs in only a fraction of the lichen symbioses in which they are known to occur. However, the presence of these and other microbes could be detected at high frequency using small subunit rRNA analysis, including in many lichens in which they are not otherwise recognized to occur. The rate of MAG recovery correlates with sequencing depth, but is almost certainly influenced by biological attributes of organisms that affect the likelihood of DNA extraction, sequencing and successful assembly, including cellular abundance, ploidy and strain co-occurrence. Our results suggest that, though metagenomes are a powerful tool for surveying microbial occurrence, they are of limited use in assessing absence, and their interpretation should be guided by an awareness of the interacting effects of microbial community complexity and sequencing depth.

                <p>by Patricia Garcia, Ruben Celador, Tomas Edreira, Yolanda Sanchez</p>

Cellular asymmetry begins with the selection of a discrete point on the cell surface that triggers Rho-GTPases activation and localized assembly of the cytoskeleton to establish new growth zones. The cylindrical shape of fission yeast is organized by microtubules (MT) that deliver the landmark Tea1–Tea4 complex at the cell tips to define the growth poles. However, only a few <i>tea1</i>Δ cells mistaken the direction of growth, indicating that they manage to detect their growth sites. Here, we show that Rgf1 (Rho1-GEF) and Tea4 are components of the same complex and that Rgf1 activity toward Rho1 is required for strengthen Tea4 at the cell tips. Moreover, in cells lacking Tea1, selection of the correct growth site depends on Rgf1 and on a correctly polarized actin cytoskeleton, both necessary for Rho1 activation at the pole. We propose an actin-dependent mechanism driven by Rgf1–Rho1 that marks the poles independently of MTs and the Tea1–Tea4 complex.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27104?af=R">Association of Reperfusion and Procedural Characteristics with Endovascular Thrombectomy Outcomes in Large Core Stroke: Sub‐Analysis from the SELECT2 Trial</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was shown to be safe and efficacious in patients with large core stroke in multiple randomized controlled trials. However, the impact of reperfusion and other procedural metrics on EVT outcomes in this population has not been well-characterized.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From the SELECT2 trial, we evaluated the association between reperfusion status, first-pass effect (near-complete or complete reperfusion [extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) 2c-3] in 1 pass), procedure time and primary technique (aspiration vs stent-retriever) with functional outcomes in patients receiving EVT across ASPECTS (3 vs 4 vs 5) and core estimate strata (&lt;70 vs ≥70ml, &lt;100 vs ≥100ml, and &lt;150 vs ≥150ml).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 180 patients who received thrombectomy, 144 (80%) achieved successful reperfusion (eTICI 2b-3) and demonstrated better clinical outcomes (adjusted generalized odds ratios [aGenOR]: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–2.15), compared with unsuccessful reperfusion. Results were consistent across ASPECTS and core estimate strata. Additionally, complete or near-complete reperfusion (eTICI 2c-3) was associated with better functional outcome (aGenOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.33–2.97) in patients achieving successful reperfusion. Functional outcome point estimates favored those with first-pass-effect (42 of 167 (25%), aGenOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.96–2.24). Longer procedure time was associated with worse modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution (aGenOR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96, <i>p</i>-value = 0.001 for 10 minutes increment). Aspiration-first technique was used in 43 of 154 (25%) patients and was not associated with higher reperfusion (88% vs 78%, <i>p</i> = 0.18) or better functional outcome (aGenOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.50–1.10) as compared with stent-retriever first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Successful reperfusion resulted in improved clinical outcomes in large core patients across baseline ischemic core strata. Near complete or complete reperfusion was further associated with better outcomes, whereas prolonged procedures were associated with worse outcomes. Results were consistent regardless of the technique used. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Cancer remains a public concern and leading cause of death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The number of cases is expected to double by 2040, according to GLOBOCAN 2020. Patients are usually diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC, which limits the number of effective treatment options. Oral-targeted therapies involving sorafenib and lenvatinib remain the first-line treatment option, which has recently been replaced by immunotherapy. Due to economic issues and ease of administration, the vast majority prefer oral systemic therapy. Sorafenib and lenvatinib, which belongs to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have few limitations of having large inter-individual variability in absorption, genetic polymorphisms, poor patient adherence to oral regimen limiting its long-term therapy. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring can overcome the limitations of TKIs and help individualise the dosage regimen with minimal adverse events. Therefore, this simple and rapid method using latest equipment enabled with ultra-high speed, high-sensitivity analysis (LCMS-8045) is expected to bring a change in clinical practice to improve the efficacy and safety of medication for optimal patient benefits.

                Introduction Health systems worldwide are struggling to ensure the affordability of medicines. Prescription, dispensing, and pharmaceutical expenditures are key variables that highlight the need to understand how global scientific evidence is generated against factors (implicit and non-explicit) that influence these variables. Objectives To provide a panorama of scientific production on drug prescription and dispensing, and its relationship with pharmaceutical expenditure in health systems worldwide. Methods A five-stage scientometric mapping was performed based on a systematic search of 8 databases. The five stages are: i) retrieval, ii) migration, iii) analysis, iv) visualization and v) interpretation. Results A corpus of evidence from 103 systematic literature reviews was obtained, screened and sifted, visualizing the countries, authors, databases, journals, institutions and time periods that contributed most to evidence generation. Central research themes are identified and phenomena related to article publication are discussed. Conclusions The analysis reveals a clear leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States in scientific production on prescribing, dispensing and pharmaceutical expenditure in health systems worldwide. This scientific production is mainly focused on financing policies, pharmaceutical incentives and interventions, and rational use of medicines. There is also evidence of the scarcity of scientific production in Latin American publications and authors, which could generate interest for future research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1332/v1?src=rss">Promoting Healthy Reading Strategies as a Self-Care Alternative to Self-Medication among University Students in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Healthy reading habits can improve concentration, critical thinking, information retention, and educational success skills. However, the lack of it among university students often leads to immense academic demands and pressures, particularly during examinations. This could result in self-medication and nonmedical use of drugs to cope with pressure and could negatively affect their physical and mental health, well-being, as well as academic performance. There is also the risk of the long-term effects of medication dependence, addiction, and decreased cognitive function. Therefore, establishing healthy reading habits is essential to student self-care and holistic well-being. This study used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), guidelines, and protocols to review published data between 2010 and 2024 from Sage Journals, African Journal Online, ProQuest Dissertations, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Twelve selected articles were thematically analysed, and social cognitive theoretical lenses guided interpretation and analysis. The review revealed the prevalence of medication misuse among university students, risk factors for drug misuse, interventions to reduce medication misuse, and the role of policymaking in supporting drug misuse among university students. Based on the findings, recommendations were made to address self-medication and promote healthy reading habits and students’ well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97854">Mechano-regulation of GLP-1 production by Piezo1 in intestinal L cells</a></h4>

              
                Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived hormone secreted by intestinal L cells and vital for postprandial glycemic control. As open-type enteroendocrine cells, whether L cells can sense mechanical stimuli caused by chyme and thus regulate GLP-1 synthesis and secretion is unexplored. Molecular biology techniques revealed the expression of Piezo1 in intestinal L cells. Its level varied in different energy status and correlates with blood glucose and GLP-1 levels. Mice with L cell-specific loss of Piezo1 (<i>Piezo1</i> IntL-CKO) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, increased body weight, reduced GLP-1 production and decreased CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway under normal chow diet or high-fat diet. Activation of the intestinal Piezo1 by its agonist Yoda1 or intestinal bead implantation increased the synthesis and secretion of GLP-1, thus alleviated glucose intolerance in diet-induced-diabetic mice. Overexpression of Piezo1, Yoda1 treatment or stretching stimulated GLP-1 production and CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway, which could be abolished by knockdown or blockage of Piezo1 in primary cultured mouse L cells and STC-1 cells. These experimental results suggest a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for GLP-1 production in L cells, which could offer new insights into diabetes treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95873">Astrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux maintaining brain homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Brain water homeostasis not only provides a physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glia in brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channel. How astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis in basal physiology remains to be understood. We report that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiber photometry in mobile mice. We then show that aquaporin-mediated constant water efflux maintains astrocyte volume and osmotic equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93232">Autophagosome development and chloroplast segmentation occur synchronously for piecemeal degradation of chloroplasts</a></h4>

              
                Plants distribute many nutrients to chloroplasts during leaf development and maturation. When leaves senesce or experience sugar starvation, the autophagy machinery degrades chloroplast proteins to facilitate efficient nutrient reuse. Here, we report on the intracellular dynamics of an autophagy pathway responsible for piecemeal degradation of chloroplast components. Through live-cell monitoring of chloroplast morphology, we observed the formation of chloroplast budding structures in sugar-starved leaves. These buds were then released and incorporated into the vacuolar lumen as an autophagic cargo termed a Rubisco-containing body. The budding structures did not accumulate in mutants of core autophagy machinery, suggesting that autophagosome creation is required for forming chloroplast buds. Simultaneous tracking of chloroplast morphology and autophagosome development revealed that the isolation membranes of autophagosomes interact closely with part of the chloroplast surface before forming chloroplast buds. Chloroplasts then protrude at the site associated with the isolation membranes, which divide synchronously with autophagosome maturation. This autophagy-related division does not require DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 5B, which constitutes the division ring for chloroplast proliferation in growing leaves. An unidentified division machinery may thus fragment chloroplasts for degradation in coordination with the development of the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100068">Host-derived Lactobacillus plantarum alleviates hyperuricemia by improving gut microbial community and hydrolase-mediated degradation of purine nucleosides</a></h4>

              
                The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia (HUA) and gout. However, it remains unclear whether probiotics residing in the host gut, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, can prevent HUA development. Herein, we isolated <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> SQ001 from the cecum of HUA geese and conducted in vitro assays on uric acid (UA) and nucleoside co-culture. Metabolomics and genome-wide analyses, revealed that this strain may promote nucleoside uptake and hydrolysis through its nucleoside hydrolase gene. The functional role of <i>iunH</i> gene was confirmed via heterologous expression and gene knockout studies. Oral administration of <i>L. plantarum</i> SQ001 resulted in increased abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> species and reduced serum UA levels. Furthermore, it downregulated hepatic xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme involved in UA synthesis, as well as renal reabsorption protein GLUT9, while enhancing the expression of renal excretion protein ABCG2. Our findings suggest that <i>L. plantarum</i> has potential to ameliorate gut microbial dysbiosis with HUA, thereby offering insights into its potential application as a probiotic therapy for individuals with HUA or gout.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93766">PKA regulation of neuronal function requires the dissociation of catalytic subunits from regulatory subunits</a></h4>

              
                Protein kinase A (PKA) plays essential roles in diverse cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous PKA upon activation remain debated. The classical model predicts that PKA catalytic subunits dissociate from regulatory subunits in the presence of cAMP, whereas a second model proposes that catalytic subunits remain associated with regulatory subunits following physiological activation. Here, we report that different PKA subtypes, as defined by the regulatory subunit, exhibit distinct subcellular localization at rest in CA1 neurons of cultured hippocampal slices. Nevertheless, when all tested PKA subtypes are activated by norepinephrine, presumably via the β-adrenergic receptor, catalytic subunits translocate to dendritic spines but regulatory subunits remain unmoved. These differential spatial dynamics between the subunits indicate that at least a significant fraction of PKA dissociates. Furthermore, PKA-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity and transmission can be supported only by wildtype, dissociable PKA, but not by inseparable PKA. These results indicate that endogenous PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits dissociate to achieve PKA function in neurons.

Loss of such attachment triggers a type of programmed cell death known as anoikis, the acquisition of resistance to which is a key step in cancer development. The mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance remain unclear, however. The intracellular F-actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in sensing the loss of cell–ECM attachment, but how its disruption affects cell fate during such stress is not well understood. Here, we reveal a cell survival strategy characterized by the formation of a giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) in the cytoplasm of the cells whose actin cytoskeleton is disrupted during loss of matrix attachment. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy showed that large vacuoles with a diameter of &gt;500 nm accumulated early after inhibition of actin polymerization in cells in suspension culture, and that these vacuoles subsequently coalesced to form a GUVac. GUVac formation was found to result from a variation of a macropinocytosis-like process, characterized by the presence of inwardly curved membrane invaginations. This phenomenon relies on both F-actin depolymerization and the recruitment of septin proteins for micron-sized plasma membrane invagination. The vacuole fusion step during GUVac formation requires PI(3)P produced by VPS34 and PI3K-C2α on the surface of vacuoles. Furthermore, its induction after loss of matrix attachment conferred anoikis resistance. Our results thus show that the formation of a previously unrecognized organelle promotes cell survival in the face of altered actin and matrix environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85755">Dynamic readout of the Hh gradient in the Drosophila wing disc reveals pattern-specific tradeoffs between robustness and precision</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the principles underlying the design of robust, yet flexible patterning systems is a key problem in developmental biology. In the Drosophila wing, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling determines patterning outputs using dynamical properties of the Hh gradient. In particular, the pattern of collier (col) is established by the steady-state Hh gradient, whereas the pattern of decapentaplegic (dpp), is established by a transient gradient of Hh known as the Hh overshoot. Here we use mathematical modeling to suggest that this dynamical interpretation of the Hh gradient results in specific robustness and precision properties. For instance, the location of the anterior border of col, which is subject to self-enhanced ligand degradation is more robustly specified than that of dpp to changes in morphogen dosage, and we provide experimental evidence of this prediction. However, the anterior border of dpp expression pattern, which is established by the overshoot gradient is much more precise to what would be expected by the steady-state gradient. Therefore, the dynamical interpretation of Hh signaling offers tradeoffs between

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98853">SLC35G1 is a highly chloride-sensitive transporter responsible for the basolateral membrane transport in intestinal citrate absorption</a></h4>

              
                The intestinal absorption of essential nutrients, especially those not readily biosynthesized, is a critical physiological process for maintaining homeostasis. Numerous studies have indicated that intestinal absorption is mediated by various membrane transporters. Citrate, a crucial bioactive compound produced as an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, is absorbed in the small intestine through carrier-mediated systems because of its high hydrophilicity. While the luminal absorption of citrate is mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1/SLC13A2), the mechanism governing the release of the transported citrate into the bloodstream remains unknown. Here, we explored the transporters responsible for intestinal citrate absorption at the basolateral membrane, focusing on highly expressed orphan transporters in the small intestine as candidates. Consequently, SLC35G1, originally identified as a partner of stromal interaction molecule 1, a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, was found to play a role in the intestinal absorption of citrate at the basolateral membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport was diminished by chloride ions at physiologically relevant extracellular concentrations. This suggests that SLC35G1, to our best knowledge, is the first transporter identified to be extremely sensitive to chloride ions among those functioning on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This study provides valuable insights into the intestinal absorption of citrate and significantly contributes to elucidating the poorly understood molecular basis of the intestinal absorption system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83424">Precise control of neural activity using dynamically optimized electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Neural implants have the potential to restore lost sensory function by electrically evoking the complex naturalistic activity patterns of neural populations. However, it can be difficult to predict and control evoked neural responses to simultaneous multi-electrode stimulation due to nonlinearity of the responses. We present a solution to this problem and demonstrate its utility in the context of a bidirectional retinal implant for restoring vision. A dynamically optimized stimulation approach encodes incoming visual stimuli into a rapid, greedily chosen, temporally dithered and spatially multiplexed sequence of simple stimulation patterns. Stimuli are selected to optimize the reconstruction of the visual stimulus from the evoked responses. Temporal dithering exploits the slow time scales of downstream neural processing, and spatial multiplexing exploits the independence of responses generated by distant electrodes. The approach was evaluated using an experimental laboratory prototype of a retinal implant: large-scale, high-resolution multi-electrode stimulation and recording of macaque and rat retinal ganglion cells ex vivo. The dynamically optimized stimulation approach substantially enhanced performance compared to existing approaches based on static mapping between visual stimulus intensity and current amplitude. The modular framework enabled parallel extensions to naturalistic viewing conditions, incorporation of perceptual similarity measures, and efficient implementation for an implantable device. A direct closed-loop test of the approach supported its potential use in vision restoration.

">Neural Representation of Time across Complementary Reference Frames</a></h4>

              
                Humans conceptualize time in terms of space, allowing flexible time construals from various perspectives. We can travel internally through a timeline to remember the past and imagine the future (i.e., mental time travel) or watch from an external standpoint to have a panoramic view of history (i.e., mental time watching). However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events. During fMRI scanning, they were guided to consider the event series from either an internal or external perspective in different tasks. Behavioral results confirmed the success of our manipulation, showing the expected symbolic distance effect in the internal-perspective task and the reverse effect in the external-perspective task. We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner. Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex retrieves event sequences egocentrically from the optimal perspective for the current task context. Such complementary allocentric and egocentric representations support both the stability of memory storage and the flexibility of time construals.

">Development of the Left Arcuate Fasciculus is Linked to Learning Gains in Reading, but not Math</a></h4>

              
                Past studies leveraging cross-sectional data have raised questions surrounding the relationship between diffusion properties of the white matter and academic skills. Some studies have suggested that white matter properties serve as static predictors of academic skills, whereas other studies have observed no such relationship. On the other hand, longitudinal studies have suggested that within-individual changes in the white matter are linked to learning gains over time. In the present study, we look to replicate and extend the previous longitudinal results linking longitudinal changes in the white matter properties of the left arcuate fasciculus to individual differences in reading development. To do so, we analyzed diffusion MRI data, along with reading and mathematics scores in a longitudinal sample of 340 students as they progressed from 1st grade into 4th grade. Longitudinal growth models revealed that year-to-year within-individual changes in reading scores, but not math, were related to the development of the left arcuate fasciculus. These findings provide further evidence linking the dynamics of white matter development and learning in a unique sample and highlight the importance of longitudinal designs.

">Trial-by-trial learning of successor representations in human behavior</a></h4>

              
                Decisions in humans and other organisms depend, in part, on learning and using models that capture the statistical structure of the world, including the long-run expected outcomes of our actions. One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD({lambda} > 0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD({lambda}) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD({lambda}) alongside an additional zeroth-order predictive model. The relatively large {lambda} we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.

">Autophagic stress activates distinct compensatory secretory pathways in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Autophagic dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease, leaving neurons vulnerable to the accumulation of damaged organelles and proteins. However, the late onset of diseases suggests that compensatory quality control mechanisms may be engaged to delay the deleterious effects induced by compromised autophagy. Neurons expressing common familial Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated mutations in LRRK2 kinase exhibit defective autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that both primary murine neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons harboring pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles. We used unbiased proteomics to characterize the secretome of LRRK2G2019S neurons and found that autophagic cargos including mitochondrial proteins were enriched. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that autophagosomes are rerouted toward secretion when cell-autonomous degradation is compromised, likely to mediate clearance of undegraded cellular waste. Immunoblotting confirmed the release of autophagic cargos and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that secretory autophagy was upregulated in LRRK2G2019S neurons. We also found that LRRK2G2019S neurons upregulate the release of exosomes containing miRNAs. Live-cell imaging confirmed that this upregulation of exosomal release was dependent on hyperactive LRRK2 activity, while pharmacological experiments indicate that this release staves off apoptosis. Finally, we show that markers of both vesicle populations are upregulated in plasma from mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2. In sum, we find that neurons expressing pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the compensatory release of secreted autophagosomes and exosomes, to mediate waste disposal and transcellular communication, respectively. We propose that this increased secretion contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, delaying neurodegenerative disease progression over the short term while potentially contributing to increased neuroinflammation over the longer term.

">Alterations and Imbalance of Dorsal and Ventral Mossy Cells in a Mouse Model of Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Mossy cells (MCs) in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) are important for regulating activity of dentate granule cells and are particularly vulnerable to excitotoxic damage in epilepsy. Recent studies have demonstrated that MCs in the dorsal and ventral DG differ in the patterns of their axonal projections and neurochemical identities. Such differences raised questions about the vulnerability and plasticity of dorsal and ventral MCs in epilepsy and led to this study using a mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Dorsal MCs were labeled by transfection of Cre-dependent eYFP in the dorsal DG of Calcrl-Cre mice that express Cre selectively in MCs. Ventral MCs were labeled with calretinin (CR), which labels ventral but not dorsal MCs. At 6-8 weeks after pilocarpine treatment, MC loss and axonal projections of remaining MCs were studied in control and pilocarpine-treated mice with confocal microscopy. Dorsal MCs were severely depleted, but many ventral MCs remained, and quantitative analysis of GluA2-labeled hilar neurons demonstrated a proportionally greater loss of dorsal MCs (77.6% loss) than ventral MCs (21.5% loss). Loss of dorsal MCs led to a marked reduction in the dorsal commissural pathway, while the remaining ventral MCs maintained a prominent, though reduced, ventral to dorsal association pathway. In pilocarpine-treated animals, a plexus of CR-labeled fibers extended into the middle molecular layer, suggesting axonal sprouting of remaining ventral MCs, with some of these fibers in contact with parvalbumin-labeled dendrites. These findings suggest that dorsal and ventral MCs differ in their vulnerability to seizure-induced damage in this animal model, creating an imbalance between the dorsal and ventral MC pathways that could alter the excitatory/inhibitory balance within the dentate gyrus.

">Correction of RBFOX1 deficit rescues Huntington's disease mis-splicing and pathology</a></h4>

              
                RNA mis-splicing correction therapies have been developed for neurological disorders like spinal muscular atrophy and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. In Huntington's disease (HD), pathogenic mis-splicing was initially observed in genes linked to neurodegeneration, such as HTT itself, MAPT, and TAF1. Later, genome-wide analyses identified a broader mis-splicing signature in HD brains, involving additional neurodegeneration-related genes. Correcting each mis-spliced gene individually would be unfeasible, highlighting the need to target upstream splicing factors altered in HD. Our previous motif-enrichment analyses of intronic sequences flanking the exons mis-spliced in HD identified RBFOX and U2AF2 as candidate splicing factors, both of which are reduced in HD brains. In this study, we tested their pathogenic relevance generating conditional transgenic mouse models that overexpress RBFOX1 or U2AF2 in forebrain neurons and combining them with HD mice. Our results show that moderate overexpression of RBFOX1, but not U2AF2, corrects multiple HD-associated mis-splicing events and alleviates HD mice neuropathology and motor symptoms. These findings demonstrate that RBFOX1 downregulation contributes to HD pathology and underscore the therapeutic potential of strategies aimed at increasing RBFOX1 levels.

                Psilocybin has been shown to induce fast and sustained improvements in mental well-being across various populations, yet its long-term mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Initial evidence suggests that longitudinal functional and structural brain changes implicate fronto-striatal-thalamic (FST) circuitry, a broad system involved in goal-directed behavior and motivational states. Here, we apply empirical methods and computational modeling to resting-state fMRI data from a within-subject longitudinal psilocybin trial in psychedelic-naive healthy volunteers. We first show increases in FST dynamic activity four weeks after a full dose of psilocybin. We then proceed to mechanistically account for these increased dynamics, by showing that reduced structural constraints underlie increased FST dynamic activity post psilocybin. Further, we show that these reduced structural constraints come along with increased bottom-up and reduced top-down modulation of FST circuits. While cortical reductions in top-down modulation are linked to regional 5-HT2A receptor availability, increased information outflow via subcortical and limbic regions relate to local D2 receptor availability. Together, these findings show that increased FST flexibility weeks after psilocybin administration is linked to serotonergic-mediated decreases in top-down information flow and dopaminergic-mediated increases in bottom-up information flow. This long-term functional re-organization of FST circuits may represent a common mechanism underling the potential clinical efficacy of psilocybin across various neuropsychiatric disorders including substance abuse, major depression, and anorexia.

">Loss of mitochondrial enzyme GPT2 leads to reprogramming of synaptic glutamate metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Recessive loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase 2 (GPT2) cause intellectual disability in children. Given this cognitive disorder, and because glutamate metabolism is tightly regulated to sustain excitatory neurotransmission, here we investigate the role of GPT2 in synaptic function. GPT2 catalyzes a reversible reaction interconverting glutamate and pyruvate with alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle intermediate; thereby, GPT2 may play an important role in linking mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with synaptic transmission. In mouse brain, we find that GPT2 is enriched in mitochondria of synaptosomes (isolated synaptic terminals). Loss of Gpt2 in mouse appears to lead to reprogramming of glutamate and glutamine metabolism, and to decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in pyramidal neurons of CA1 hippocampal slices from Gpt2-null mice reveal decreased excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changes in mEPSC frequency, or importantly, changes in inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs). Additional evidence of defective glutamate release included reduced levels of glutamate released from Gpt2-null synaptosomes measured biochemically. Glutamate release from synaptosomes was rescued to wild-type levels by alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation. Additionally, we observed evidence of altered metabolism in isolated Gpt2-null synaptosomes: decreased TCA cycle intermediates, and increased glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Notably, alterations in the TCA cycle and the glutamine pool were alleviated by alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation. In conclusion, our data support a model whereby GPT2 mitochondrial activity may contribute to glutamate availability in pre-synaptic terminals, thereby highlighting potential interactions between pre-synaptic mitochondrial metabolism and synaptic transmission.

">Reducing CETP activity prevents memory decline in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Epidemiological studies have shown that lower activity of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) correlates with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. While small molecule CETP inhibitors like evacetrapib have previously been assessed for cardiovascular diseases, their involvement in AD has not been investigated. Here, we establish CETP as a novel pharmacological target for AD treatment. Using CETP transgenic mice crossed to a mouse model of amyloidosis and administering evacetrapib, we provide evidence that CETP inhibition maintained memory independent of classic AD markers, increased hippocampal cholesterol, altered plasma lipoproteins, and changed transcription of genes linked to brain barriers. Using proteomic data of cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for AD (the PREVENT-AD cohort), we confirm that our mouse model reflects physiological changes in pre-symptomatic human subjects. We propose the repurposing of CETP inhibitors as an effective therapeutic strategy to delay or prevent cognitive impairment in AD.

">Evaluating Synthetic Diffusion MRI Maps created with Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models</a></h4>

              
                Generative AI models, such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and MidJourney, have recently gained widespread attention as they can generate high-quality synthetic images by learning the distribution of complex, high-dimensional image data. These models are now being applied to medical and neuroimaging data, where AI-based tasks such as diagnostic classification and predictive modeling typically use deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), with interpretability enhancements. In our study, we trained latent diffusion models (LDM) and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) specifically for generating synthetic Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) maps. We developed models that generate synthetic DTI maps of mean diffusivity by training on real 3D DTI scans, and evaluating the synthetic data's realism and diversity using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM). Additionally, we aim to assess the transfer learning capability of a 3D CNN-based Alzheimer's disease classifier, by pretraining it on sex classification on real and synthetic DTIs. Our approach efficiently produces realistic and diverse synthetic data, potentially helping to create interpretable AI-driven maps for neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics.

">MEDiCINe: Motion Correction for Neural Electrophysiology Recordings</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiology recordings from the brain using laminar multielectrode arrays allow researchers to measure the activity of many neurons simultaneously. However, laminar microelectrode arrays move relative to their surrounding neural tissue for a variety of reasons, such as pulsation, changes in intracranial pressure, and decompression of neural tissue after insertion. Inferring and correcting for this motion stabilizes the recording and is critical to identify and track single neurons across time. Such motion correction is a preprocessing step of standard spike sorting methods. However, estimating motion robustly and accurately in electrophysiology recordings is challenging due to the stochasticity of the neural data. To tackle this problem, we introduce MEDiCINe (Motion Estimation by Distributional Contrastive Inference for Neurophysiology), a novel motion estimation method. We show that MEDiCINe outperforms existing motion estimation methods on an extensive suite of simulated neurophysiology recordings and leads to more accurate spike sorting. We also show that MEDiCINe correctly estimates the motion in primate electrophysiology recordings with a variety of motion and stability statistics. We open-source MEDiCINe, usage instructions, examples integrating MEDiCINe with common tools for spike-sorting, and data and code for reproducing our results. This open software will enable other researchers to use MEDiCINe to improve spike sorting results and get the most out of their electrophysiology datasets.

                In vivo imaging of dynamic sub-cellular brain structures in Drosophila melanogaster is key to understanding several phenomena in neuroscience. However, a trade-off between spatial resolution, speed, photodamage, and setup complexity limits its implementation. Here, we designed and built a single objective light sheet microscope, customized for in vivo imaging of adult flies and optimized for maximum resolution. Unlike multi-objective light sheet setups, the microscope uses a single objective at the fly head interface, facilitating sample mounting and inspection, and reducing invasiveness. In contrast to two-photon microscopies, the light-sheet configuration with visible excitation offers reduced phototoxicity. We demonstrate in vivo imaging of the membrane, mitochondria, and dense-core vesicles in the axonal projections of small lateral ventral neurons. The achieved resolution was between 380 to 500 nm within a field of view of 70x50x12 m3. This unique combination of easy sample mounting, high resolution, and the low-phototoxicity of light sheet illumination paves the way for new dynamic studies in the brain of living flies.

">Dynamic Causal Modeling in Probabilistic Programming Languages</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the intricate dynamics of brain activities necessitates models that incorporate causality and nonlinearity. Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) presents a statistical framework that embraces causal relationships among brain regions and their responses to experimental manipulations, such as stimulation. In this study, we perform Bayesian inference on a neurobiologically plausible generative model that simulates event-related potentials observed in magneto/encephalography data. This translates into probabilistic inference of latent and observed states of a system driven by input stimuli, described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and potentially correlated parameters. We provide a guideline for reliable inference in the presence of multimodality, which arises from parameter degeneracy, ultimately enhancing the predictive accuracy of neural dynamics. Solutions include optimizing the hyperparameters, leveraging initialization with prior information, and employing weighted stacking based on predictive accuracy. Moreover, we implement the inference and conduct comprehensive model comparison in several probabilistic programming languages to streamline the process and benchmark their efficiency. Our investigation shows that model inversion in DCM extends beyond variational approximation frameworks, demonstrating the effectiveness of gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of posterior estimation using a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the automatic Laplace approximation, effectively addressing parameter degeneracy challenges. This technical endeavor holds the potential to advance the inversion of state-space ODE models, and contribute to neuroscience research and applications in neuroimaging through automatic DCM.

">Electrical Coordinated Reset Stimulation Induces Network Desynchronization in an in Vivo Model of Status Epilepticus</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, profoundly impacts individuals worldwide. Various electrical stimulation protocols have been investigated to mitigate epileptic seizures, among which Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation may have potential for inducing long-lasting neural desynchronization. This study explores the acute effects of CR stimulation on synchronization dynamics during Status Epilepticus (SE) in an in vivo animal model. An electrographically sustained seizure-state was induced via 4-aminopyridine (4AP) administration to CA3. Custom-designed electrode probes were implanted to facilitate simultaneous recording and electrical stimulation. Analytical univariate and bivariate features were constructed from the LFP time-series recording. Feature metrics focused on spike synchronization metrics and continuous signal analysis of amplitude, spectral power and phase synchronization across electrode pairs and frequency bands. Significance of modulation was assessed through permutation testing of the observed differences between the CR-stimulated group (N=5) compared to the control (no stimulation) group (N=3) during SE. Results showed overall decrease in amplitude and power univariate features, and a significant modulation of bivariate synchronization and connectivity measures across the spectrum between the CR stimulation and control group. Our findings underscore the potential effectiveness of CR stimulation in attenuating excessive neural synchronization, paving the way for further exploration of CR stimulation as a viable intervention for network desynchronization of epileptiform activity and subsequently treatment of seizures.

                Alpha-Synuclein (Syn) plays a central role in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the p.A53T mutation causes an early-onset familial form of PD with severe manifestations. The pathological effects of the p.A53T-Syn mutation have been extensively investigated in neurons, yet the consequences on astrocytes and astrocytic contribution to PD pathology are understudied. Here, we differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells from PD patients carrying the p.A53T-Syn mutation to astrocytes, which uncovered cell-intrinsic phenotypes, including calcium dyshomeostasis and accumulation of protein aggregates. Proteomic profiling and functional analyses revealed perturbed protein catabolic processes, involving the proteasome and autophagy, associated with lysosomal malfunction. Dopamine neurons co-cultured with p.A53T-Syn astrocytes displayed exacerbated neurodegeneration with hallmark Lewy-like pathologies, rescued by control astrocytes due to their ability to resolve neuronal Syn aggregates by endocytic clearance. Our findings underscore a critical impact of p.A53T-Syn on astrocytic protein quality control mechanisms, positioning astrocytes as important contributors to PD neuropathology.

">Resting-state connectivity modifies the effects of amyloid on cognitive and physical function: evidence for network-based cognitive reserve</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive and physical function are interrelated in aging co-occurring impairments in both domains can be debilitating and lead to increased risk of developing dementia. Amyloid beta (A{beta}) deposition in the brain is linked to cognitive decline and is also associated with poorer physical function in older adults. However, significant inter-individual variability exists with respect to the influence of increased brain A{beta} concentrations on cognitive and physical outcomes. Identifying factors that explain inter-individual variability in associations between A{beta} and clinical outcomes could inform interventions designed to delay declines in both cognitive and physical function. Cognitive reserve (CR) is considered a buffer that allows for cognitive performance that is better than expected for a given level of brain injury or pathology. Although the neural mechanisms underlying CR remain unknown, there is growing evidence that resting-state brain networks may serve as a neural surrogate for CR. The currently study evaluated whether functional brain networks modified associations between brain A{beta} and cognitive and physical function in community-dwelling older adults from the Brain Networks and Mobility (B-NET) study. We found that the integrity of the central executive and basal ganglia networks modified associations of A{beta} with cognitive and physical performance. Associations between brain A{beta} and cognitive and physical function were less pronounced when brain network integrity was high. The current study introduces novel evidence for brain networks underlying CR as a buffer against the influence of A{beta} accumulation on cognitive and physical function.

">Inhibition and Updating Share Common Resources: Evidence from Drift Diffusion Model</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition and updating are fundamental cognitive functions in humans, yet the nature of their relationship, whether shared or distinct, remains ambiguous. This study investigates the relationship between inhibition and updating and examines whether this relationship is altered in individuals with trait anxiety. A novel paradigm that combines N-back and congruent/incongruent Stroop tasks were utilized to explore these issues by employing Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and the hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM) methods. The results revealed that participants exhibited longer response times and higher error rates in conditions requiring both inhibition and updating compared to those requiring updating alone. SDT analysis indicated lower discriminability, while HDDM analysis showed slower drift rates and longer non-decision times. These findings suggest that inhibition consumes cognitive resources, leading to worse updating performance, implying that both functions may rely on shared resources. In the anxiety group, higher trait anxiety scores correlated with increased response times and decreased accuracy. The drift rate fully mediated the effect of trait anxiety on accuracy, suggesting that the speed of effective information accumulation is a key mechanism underlying the abnormal functioning of inhibition and updating in individuals with anxiety. Overall, the results elucidate the relationship between these fundamental cognitive functions, supporting the notion that inhibition and updating share cognitive resources. Furthermore, this study provides evidence and insights into the cognitive abnormalities observed in individuals with anxiety.

">Real-Time Spatiotemporal Filtering for Artifact-Free EEG during Electrical Neurostimulation</a></h4>

              
                Combining electrical neurostimulation with electroencephalography (EEG) for adaptive neurostimulation remains challenging due to the presence of stimulation artifacts in the recorded signal. Interpretation of EEG activity concurrent with stimulation requires real-time filtering of this noisy signal. While traditional frequency domain filters can suppress activity within frequency bands, they fail to differentiate sources in situations when there is a shared frequency characteristic between brain activity and stimulation signal. Here we present a new real-time denoising approach that combines spatial filtering and dynamic filter application. The spatiotemporal filter can suppress stimulation artifacts that share frequency bands with the brain signal in real-time while preserving the full spectral power. The spatial filter is also dynamically updated to account for possible changes in artifact topography. Finally, the filter is robust to changes of stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, enabling reliable denoising performance for inclusion in brain state-based closed-loop stimulation.

">Gut Microbiota Regulates Exercise-induced Hormetic Modulation of Cognitive Function</a></h4>

              
                Lifestyle factors, particularly physical exercise, significantly influence brain structure and cognitive function through a hormetic effect dependent on exercise intensity and duration. The underlying mechanisms of this profile remain largely unexplored. Recently, the gut microbiota, has emerged a potent modulator of lifestyle-induced changes on brain and behavior. Here, we demonstrate that a 40-minute protocol of moderate exercise enhances cognitive abilities related to object recognition and memory, and increases hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice compared to sedentary controls, but these cognitive and neurogenic benefits vanish when the exercise intensity or duration is increased. Furthermore, we identified significant alpha- and beta-diversity changes and distinct bacteria composition profiles of gut microbiota associated with different exercise regimens. Specific bacterial families showed altered relative abundances depending on exercise intensity and duration, with certain families' quantities significantly correlating with cognitive performance (Angelakisella, Acetatifactor, Erysipelatoclostridium, and Coriobacteriaceae UCG-002.). To parse causal mechanisms, fecal microbiota transplantation from exercised to sedentary mice replicated the cognitive and brain structural improvements observed in the donor animals. These findings suggest that the hormetic effects of physical exercise on cognitive function and neurogenesis are mediated by corresponding changes in the gut microbiota, indicating a novel mechanistic link between exercise, brain, and gut microbiota composition.

">Personalized tDCS targeting visual motion area V5 modulates smooth pursuit initiation</a></h4>

              
                Smooth pursuit eye movements provide an ideal model of sensorimotor integration with visual motion area V5 being a key candidate integrating visual motion processing with oculomotor control. We applied personalized transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) explicitly targeting individual V5 to induce subtle impairment or facilitation of sensorimotor integration during pursuit and assess the gain by personalized, compared to conventional normative tDCS. Pursuit initiation was specifically delayed during personalized cathodal tDCS targeting right V5 pointing towards the involvement of specific functional subareas of V5. The results were well-controlled by anodal and sham tDCS, different pursuit tasks, and by two control experiments, one that applied personalized tDCS targeting FEF and another that applied normative tDCS over V5, for all of which no pursuit modulation was observed. Importantly, in contrast to normative tDCS, personalized tDCS effectively modulated pursuit by adapting electric fields to individual anatomical and neurophysiological V5 properties, yielding interesting potential for the improved effectiveness of personalized tDCS in general.

">Cocaine, via ΔFosB, remodels gene expression and excitability in ventral hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Ventral hippocampus (vHPC) CA1 pyramidal neurons send glutamatergic projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc), and this vHPC-NAc circuit mediates cocaine seeking and reward, but it is unclear whether vHPC-NAc neuron properties are modulated by cocaine exposure to drive subsequent behavior. The immediate early gene transcription factor {Delta}FosB is induced throughout the brain by cocaine and is critical for cocaine seeking, but it's function in vHPC-NAc neurons is not understood. We now show that circuit-specific knockout of {Delta}FosB in vHPC-NAc neurons impaired cocaine reward expression and forced abstinence-induced seeking. We also found that vHPC-NAc excitability was decreased by experimenter-administered repeated cocaine and cocaine self-administration, and this cocaine-induced excitability decrease was mediated by {Delta}FosB expression. To uncover the mechanism of this change in circuit function, we used circuit-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP) to assess cocaine-induced, {Delta}FosB-dependent changes in gene expression in vHPC-NAc. We found that cocaine causes a {Delta}FosB-dependent increase in the expression of calreticulin, an ER-resident calcium-buffering protein. Calreticulin expression mediated vHPC-NAc excitability and was necessary for cocaine reward. These findings uncover a novel, non-canonical mechanism by which cocaine increases calreticulin in vHPC leading to decreased vHPC-NAc excitability and drives cocaine seeking and reward.

">Sex differences in the impact of nerve injury on Locus Coeruleus function and behaviour in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain often coexists with stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression, with a higher prevalence in women. Rodent studies reveal significant sex differences in pain and stress-related behaviours, emphasising the need to explore underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main noradrenergic nucleus in the brainstem, plays a crucial role in modulating pain and stress responses and exhibits sex-specific characteristics. In this study, we investigated the effects of neuropathic pain on the LC in male and female mice, focusing on sensory thresholds, emotional states, and cognitive function. Nerve injury caused immediate sensory hypersensitivity in both sexes, while depressive-like behaviours and cognitive impairments emerged only after prolonged injury. Interestingly, anxiety-like behaviours and heightened fear conditioning were exclusive to males, which correlated with specific structural and functional changes in the male LC, such as increased noradrenergic cell counts, larger somato-dendritic volume, and greater neuron excitability. In females, however, neuronal excitability was reduced. Chemogenetic inhibition of LC neurons alleviated depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours, as well as fear conditioning, but only in males. Overall, neuropathic pain induces distinct behavioural and neurobiological responses in males and females, challenging traditional views on female vulnerability to pain-induced anxiety and highlighting the need for sex-specific LC-targeted therapies.

">A chill brain-music interface for enhancing music chills with personalized playlists</a></h4>

              
                Music chills are pleasurable experiences while listening to music, often accompanied by physical responses, such as goosebumps1,2. Enjoying music that induces chills is central to music appreciation, and engages the reward system in the brain3-5. However, the specific songs that trigger chills vary with individual preferences6, and the neural substrates associated with musical rewards differ among individuals7-9, making it challenging to establish a standard method for enhancing music chills. In this study, we developed the Chill Brain-Music Interface (C-BMI), a closed-loop neurofeedback system that uses in-ear electroencephalogram (EEG) for song selection. The C-BMI generates personalized playlists aimed at evoking chills by integrating individual song preferences and neural activity related to music reward processing. Twenty-four participants listened to both self-selected and other-selected songs, reporting higher pleasure levels and experiencing more chills in their self-selected songs. We constructed two LASSO regression models to support the C-BMI. Model 1 predicted pleasure based on the acoustic features of the self-selected songs. Model 2 classified the EEG responses when participants listened to self-selected versus other-selected songs. Model 1 was applied to over 7,000 candidate songs, predicting pleasure scores. We used these predicted scores and acoustic similarity to the self-selected songs to rank songs that were likely to induce pleasure. Using this ranking, four tailored playlists were generated. Two playlists were designed to augment pleasure by selecting top-ranked songs, one of which incorporated real-time pleasure estimates from Model 2 to continuously update Model 1 and refine song rankings. Additionally, two playlists aimed to diminish pleasure, with one updated using Model 2. We found that the pleasure-augmenting playlist with EEG-based updates elicited more chills and higher pleasure levels than pleasure-diminishing playlists. Our results indicate that C-BMI using in-ear EEG data can enhance music-induced chills.

">Differentiating hallucination proneness dimensions through resting state alpha dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hallucination-like experiences (HLEs) are untriggered sensory perceptions linked to externalizing bias - the misattribution of self-generated sensory experiences to an external source. The vulnerability to HLEs, i.e., hallucination proneness (HP), is typically assessed by the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale (LSHS). A recent LSHS factor analysis revealed four distinct HP dimensions: Multisensory HLEs, Auditory daydreaming, Vivid thoughts and inner speech, and Personified HLEs. The current study assesses whether these HP dimensions map onto distinct patterns of resting state brain dynamics in the alpha frequency band due to its modulatory role in attention and perception. Methods: We used a Hidden semi-Markov Model to segment continuous RS alpha activity into nine recurrent brain states and extracted the total number of transitions (TT) and the number of visits per state (SV). We assessed how the HP dimensions relate to these metrics, calculated across the entire 3-minute recording and within shorter sliding windows to capture finer temporal changes. Results: All HP dimensions and increased RS time correlated with increased TT. Increased Personified HLEs scores linked to different time-dependent changes of SV in two states (SV to state 5 decreased over time, while visits to state 9 increased), highlighting distinct alpha dynamics in high- and low-hallucination prone individuals. Conclusions: Increased TT could indicate frequent attentional switches between internal and external states. Different SV patterns related to higher Personified HLEs scores suggest unstable source monitoring, potentially inducing an externalizing bias. These findings provide novel predictors of HP dimensions, revealing distinct neural profiles associated with different vulnerability profiles.

">Measuring Stimulus Information Transfer Between Neural Populations through the Communication Subspace</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing arises from the communication between neural populations across multiple brain areas. While the widespread presence of neural response variability shared throughout a neural population limits the amount of stimulus-related information those populations can accurately represent, how this variability affects the interareal communication of sensory information is unknown. We propose a mathematical framework to understand the impact of neural population response variability on sensory information transmission. We combine linear Fisher information, a metric connecting stimulus representation and variability, with the framework of communication subspaces, which suggests that functional mappings between cortical populations are low-dimensional relative to the space of population activity patterns. From this, we partition Fisher information depending on the alignment between the population covariance and the mean tuning direction projected onto the communication subspace or its orthogonal complement. We provide mathematical and numerical analyses of our proposed decomposition of Fisher information and examine theoretical scenarios that demonstrate how to leverage communication subspaces for flexible routing and gating of stimulus information. This work will provide researchers investigating interareal communication with a theoretical lens through which to understand sensory information transmission and guide experimental design.

                Astrocytes, which are increasingly recognized as pivotal constituents of brain circuits governing a wide range of functions, express GABA transporter 3 (Gat3), an astrocyte-specific GABA transporter responsible for maintenance of extra-synaptic GABA levels. Here, we examined the functional role of Gat3 in astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal activity and information encoding. First, we developed a multiplexed CRISPR construct applicable for effective genetic ablation of Gat3 in the visual cortex of adult mice. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of visual cortex neurons in Gat3 knockout mice, we observed changes in spontaneous and visually driven single neuronal response properties such as response magnitudes and trial-to-trial variability. Gat3 knockout exerted a pronounced influence on population-level neuronal activity, altering the response dynamics of neuronal populations and impairing their ability to accurately represent stimulus information. These findings demonstrate that Gat3 in astrocytes profoundly shapes the sensory information encoding capacity of neurons and networks within the visual cortex.

">Are resting-state networks the brain's cognitive atoms? Differential dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain networks across tasks and at rest</a></h4>

              
                It is increasingly popular to utilise functional connectivity (FC) analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize human functional brain networks and to use the emergent resting-state networks (RSNs) in basic and clinical neuroscience. Often, they are treated as 'atomic' building blocks that underpin human cognition. However, the true function of these RSNs, as well as the relationship between intrinsic and task-evoked functional brain networks, are complex and incompletely characterized. Here, we investigated the functional characteristics of the intrinsic and extrinsic networks using resting-state and task fMRI. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to estimate spatiotemporal functional networks during tasks and at rest, and to compare the spatiotemporal properties of each network. While there was some spatial correspondence between the RSNs and task-evoked networks, our results demonstrated that the task-evoked functional networks were different from the RSNs in task-relatedness as well as spatial topology. Furthermore, the degree of topological differences between the RSNs and task-evoked networks was modulated by a given task. Comparison between the RSNs and task-evoked networks showed that tasks reconfigure the RSNs by changing FC with various brain regions specific to the task condition. Our findings indicate that the brain does not maintain an "invariant intrinsic" network architecture when it engages in a task. Instead, the tasks reconfigure the network architectures, thereby accommodating specific computational/representational task requirements through flexible interactions between demand-specific regions. Thus, the results suggest that task fMRI is required to understand the full repertoire of the brain's functional architecture.

                Background: In addition to being biological sex groups, males and females are also individuals expressing behavioral diversity. Our MISSING (Mapping Intrinsic Sex Similarities as an Integral quality of Normalized Groups) model suggests that, with respect to behavior, grouping according to the individual yields groups with differences that exceed biological sex-related differences, but this needs further clarification. Thus, we hypothesized that, compared to the current model (grouping by biological sex), the MISSING model (grouping by individual attributes) was the more effective grouping strategy to identify behavioral diversity. Methods: We conducted experiments in rats to determine the locomotor activity (in 90 min) following intraperitoneal injections of saline (n = 12 males, n = 11 females) and cocaine (n = 8 males, n = 11 females). For the current model, we compared males versus females using unpaired t-tests. For the MISSING model, we identified clusters of individuals (males and females) using normal mixtures clustering analysis of several behavioral variables and employed unpaired t-tests to compare clusters and Two-way ANOVA to determine if there were any SEX by cluster interactions. For both models, we employed linear regression analysis to compare relationships between variables and Two-way repeated measures ANOVA to analyze locomotor activity time course. Results: For both the saline and cocaine groups, the MISSING model identified two behavioral clusters with differences that exceeded any differences due to biological sex. Conclusions: The MISSING model suggests that employing sex as a biological variable can limit our understanding of sex and individual differences in psychostimulant activity.

">Unifying Subicular Function: A Predictive Map Approach</a></h4>

              
                The successor representation has emerged as a powerful model for understanding mammalian navigation and memory; explaining the spatial coding properties of hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells. However, the diverse spatial responses of subicular neurons, the primary output of the hippocampus, have eluded a unified account. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating rodent behavioural biases into the successor representation successfully reproduces the heterogeneous activity patterns of subicular neurons. This framework accounts for the emergence of boundary and corner cells; neuronal types absent in upstream hippocampal regions. We provide evidence that subicular firing patterns are more accurately described by the successor representation than a purely spatial or boundary vector cell model of subiculum. Our work offers a unifying theory of subicular function that positions the subiculum, more than other hippocampal regions, as a predictive map of the environment.

">Olfactory bulb tracks breathing rhythms and place in freely behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrates sniff to control the odor samples that enter their nose. These samples can not only help identify odorous objects, but also locations and events. However, there is no receptor for place or time. Therefore, to take full advantage of olfactory information, an animal's brain must contextualize odor-driven activity with information about when, where, and how they sniffed. To better understand contextual information in the olfactory system, we captured the breathing and movements of mice while recording from their olfactory bulb. In stimulus- and task-free experiments, mice structure their breathing into persistent rhythmic states which are synchronous with statelike structure in ongoing neuronal population activity. These population states reflect a strong dependence of individual neuron activity on variation in sniff frequency, which we display using ''sniff fields'' and quantify using generalized linear models. In addition, many olfactory bulb neurons have ''place fields'' that display significant dependence of firing on allocentric location, which were comparable with hippocampal neurons recorded under the same conditions. At the population level, a mouse's location can be decoded from olfactory bulb with similar accuracy to hippocampus. Olfactory bulb place sensitivity cannot be explained by breathing rhythms or scent marks. Taken together, we show that the mouse olfactory bulb tracks breathing rhythms and self-location, which may help unite internal models of self and environment with olfactory information as soon as that information enters the brain.

	<p>Mixed Reality (MR) technology possesses profound and extensive potential across a multitude of domains, including, but not limited to industry, healthcare, and education. However, prolonged use of MR devices to watch stereoscopic content may lead to visual fatigue. Since visual fatigue involves multiple brain regions, our study aims to explore the topological characteristics of brain networks derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Because the Phase-Locked Value (PLV) is capable of effectively measuring the phase synchronization relationship between brain regions, it was calculated between all pairs of channels in both comfort and fatigue states. Subsequently, a sparse brain network was constructed based on PLV by applying an appropriate threshold. The node properties (betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, node efficiency) and edge properties (characteristic path length) were calculated based on the corresponding brain network within specific frequency bands for both comfort and fatigue states. In analyzing the PLV of brain connectivity in comfort and fatigue states, a notable enhancement in brain connectivity is observed within the alpha, theta, and delta frequency bands during fatigue status. By analyzing the node and edge properties of brain networks, it is evident that the mean values of these properties in the fatigue state were higher than those in the comfort state. By analyzing the node and edge properties at a local level, the average difference in betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients, and nodal efficiency across the three EEG frequency bands was computed to find significant brain regions. The main findings are as follows: Betweenness centrality primarily differs in frontal and parietal regions, with minor involvement in temporal and central regions. The clustering Coefficient mainly varies in the frontal region, with slight differences being seen in the temporal and occipital regions. Nodal efficiency primarily varies in the frontal, temporal, and central regions, with minor differences being seen in the parietal and occipital regions. Edge property analysis indicates that there is a higher occurrence of long-distance connections among brain regions during the fatigue state, which reflects a loss of synaptic transmission efficiency on a global level. Our study plays a crucial role in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying visual fatigue, potentially providing insights that could be applied to high-demand cognitive fields where prolonged use of MR devices leads to visual fatigue.</p>

	<p>Dyslexia&amp;amp;ndash;dysorthographia is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the symptoms appear during the person&amp;amp;rsquo;s development (generally around the age of 7 or 8) and persist throughout life. The study of this written language disorder mainly focuses on children, principally in the clinical, cognitive science and neuroscience fields. The importance and originality of this study are that it investigates the impact of dyslexia&amp;amp;ndash;dysorthographia on written production in young adults (students) with dyslexia, from a psycholinguistic perspective. To do this, students and matched-control individuals were asked to produce written texts on the same theme. These productions were then analysed, observing on-line indicators, such as pause location and duration. The current investigation found that students with dyslexia still have important difficulties with writing and their lack of automation in spelling has consequences on the transcription and planning process: although they have the same handwriting speed, pressure and word rate as control students, they make longer pauses before words, especially before short and long words, words involving grammatical inflexion, grammatical words and punctuation.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of chiropractic care using resting electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), clinical health assessments (Fitbit), and Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29). Methods: Seventy-six people with chronic low back pain (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 45 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 years, 33 female) were randomised into control (n = 38) and chiropractic (n = 38) groups. EEG and SEPs were collected pre and post the first intervention and post 4 weeks of intervention. PROMIS-29 was measured pre and post 4 weeks. Fitbit data were recorded continuously. Results: Spectral analysis of resting EEG showed a significant increase in Theta, Alpha and Beta, and a significant decrease in Delta power in the chiropractic group post intervention. Source localisation revealed a significant increase in Alpha activity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) post intervention and post 4 weeks. A significant decrease in N30 SEP peak amplitude post intervention and post 4 weeks was found in the chiropractic group. Source localisation demonstrated significant changes in Alpha and Beta power within the DMN post-intervention and post 4 weeks. Significant improvements in light sleep stage were observed in the chiropractic group along with enhanced overall quality of life post 4 weeks, including significant reductions in anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions: These findings indicate that many health benefits of chiropractic care are due to altered brain activity.</p>

                <p>Each olfactory cortical hemisphere receives ipsilateral odor information directly from the olfactory bulb and contralateral information indirectly from the other cortical hemisphere. Since neural projections to the olfactory cortex (OC) are disordered and nontopographic, spatial information cannot be used to align projections from the two sides like in the visual cortex. Therefore, how bilateral information is integrated in individual cortical neurons is unknown. We have found, in mice, that the odor responses of individual neurons to selective stimulation of each of the two nostrils are significantly correlated, such that odor identity decoding optimized with information arriving from one nostril transfers very well to the other side. Nevertheless, these aligned responses are asymmetric enough to allow decoding of stimulus laterality. Computational analysis shows that such matched odor tuning is incompatible with purely random connections but is explained readily by Hebbian plasticity structuring bilateral connectivity. Our data reveal that despite the distributed and fragmented sensory representation in the OC, odor information across the two hemispheres is highly coordinated.</p>

                <p>Age-related brain changes affect sleep and are reflected in properties of sleep slow-waves, however, the precise mechanisms behind these changes are still not completely understood. Here, we adapt a previously established whole-brain model relating structural connectivity changes to resting state dynamics, and extend it to a slow-wave sleep brain state. In particular, starting from a representative connectome at the beginning of the aging trajectory, we have gradually reduced the inter-hemispheric connections, and simulated sleep-like slow-wave activity. We show that the main empirically observed trends, namely a decrease in duration and increase in variability of the slow waves are captured by the model. Furthermore, comparing the simulated EEG activity to the source signals, we suggest that the empirically observed decrease in amplitude of the slow waves is caused by the decrease in synchrony between brain regions.</p>

                <p>The neural network, including the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), functions as an oculomotor neural integrator involved in the control of vertical gaze holding. Impairment of the vestibulocerebellum (VC), including the flocculus (FL), has been shown to affect vertical gaze holding, indicating that the INC cooperates with the VC in controlling this function. However, a network between the INC and VC has not been identified. In this study, we aimed to obtain anatomical evidence of a neural pathway from the INC to the VC (the INC-VC pathway) in rats. Injection of dextran-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or adeno-associated virus 2-retro (AAV2retro) expressing GFP into the FL or another VC region (uvula/nodulus) did not reveal any retrogradely labeled neurons in the INC, suggesting that INC neurons do not project directly to the VC. Rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing experiments revealed that the INC-VC pathway is mediated via synaptic connections with the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and medial vestibular nucleus (MVN). The INC neurons in the INC-VC pathway were mainly localized bilaterally within the rostral region of the INC. Transsynaptic tracing experiments involving the INC-FL pathway revealed that INC neurons connected to the FL via the bilateral PHN and MVN. These results indicate that the INC-VC pathway is not a direct pathway but is mediated via the PHN and MVN. These findings can provide clues for understanding the network mechanisms responsible for vertical gaze holding.</p>

                <p>Experience- and activity-dependent transcription is a candidate mechanism to mediate development and refinement of specific cortical circuits. Here, we demonstrate that the activity-dependent transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) is required in both presynaptic layer (L) 4 and postsynaptic L2/3 mouse (male and female) somatosensory (S1) cortical neurons for development of this specific synaptic connection. While postsynaptic deletion of <I>Mef2c</I> weakens L4 synaptic inputs, it has no effect on inputs from local L2/3, contralateral S1, or the ipsilateral frontal/motor cortex. Similarly, homozygous or heterozygous deletion of <I>Mef2c</I> in presynaptic L4 neurons weakens L4 to L2/3 excitatory synaptic inputs by decreasing presynaptic release probability. Postsynaptic MEF2C is specifically required during an early postnatal, experience-dependent, period for L4 to L2/3 synapse function, and expression of transcriptionally active MEF2C (MEF2C-VP16) rescues weak L4 to L2/3 synaptic strength in sensory-deprived mice. Together, these results suggest that experience- and/or activity-dependent transcriptional activation of MEF2C promotes development of L4 to L2/3 synapses. Additionally, MEF2C regulates the expression of many pre- and postsynaptic genes in postnatal cortical neurons. Interestingly, MEF2C was necessary for activity-dependent expression of many presynaptic genes, including those that function in transsynaptic adhesion and neurotransmitter release. This work provides mechanistic insight into the experience-dependent development of specific cortical circuits.</p>

                <p>Impaired inhibitory synapse development is suggested to drive neuronal hyperactivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy. We propose a novel mechanism by which astrocytes control the development of parvalbumin (PV)-specific inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, implicating ephrin-B/EphB signaling. Here, we utilize genetic approaches to assess functional and structural connectivity between PV and pyramidal cells (PCs) through whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemical analysis, and behaviors in male and female mice. While inhibitory synapse development is adversely affected by PV-specific expression of EphB2, a strong candidate ASD risk gene, astrocytic ephrin-B1 facilitates PV-&gt;PC connectivity through a mechanism involving EphB signaling in PV boutons. In contrast, the loss of astrocytic ephrin-B1 reduces PV-&gt;PC connectivity and inhibition, resulting in increased seizure susceptibility and an ASD-like phenotype. Our findings underscore the crucial role of astrocytes in regulating inhibitory circuit development and discover a new role of EphB2 receptors in PV-specific inhibitory synapse development.</p>

                <p>The precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals plays a crucial role in the physiological functions of neurons. Here, we investigated the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cultured hippocampal neurons from both female and male rats. In cultured hippocampal neurons, glucocorticoids inhibited the spontaneous somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes generated by Kv2.1-organized Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains. Furthermore, glucocorticoids rapidly reduced the cell surface expressions of Kv2.1 and Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 channels in hippocampal neurons. In HEK293 cells transfected with Kv2.1 alone, glucocorticoids significantly reduced the surface expression of Kv2.1 with little effect on K<sup>+</sup> currents. In HEK293 cells transfected with Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 alone, glucocorticoids inhibited Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 currents but had no effect on the cell surface expression of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2. Notably, in the presence of wild-type Kv2.1, glucocorticoids caused a decrease in the surface expression of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 channels in HEK293 cells. However, this effect was not observed in the presence of nonclustering Kv2.1S586A mutant channels. Live-cell imaging showed that glucocorticoids rapidly decreased Kv2.1 clusters on the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, Western blot results indicated a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of Kv2.1, suggesting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 clusters. Glucocorticoids rapidly decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration and the phosphorylation level of PKA in hippocampal neurons. The PKA inhibitor H89 mimicked the effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.1, while the PKA agonist forskolin abrogated the effect. In conclusion, glucocorticoids rapidly suppress Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in hippocampal neurons by promoting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 channel clusters through reducing PKA activity.</p>

                <p>Different people listening to the same story may converge upon a largely shared interpretation while still developing idiosyncratic experiences atop that shared foundation. What linguistic properties support this individualized experience of natural language? Here, we investigate how the "concrete&ndash;abstract" axis&mdash;the extent to which a word is grounded in sensory experience&mdash;relates to within- and across-subject variability in the neural representations of language. Leveraging a dataset of human participants of both sexes who each listened to four auditory stories while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that neural representations of "concreteness" are both reliable across stories and relatively unique to individuals, while neural representations of "abstractness" are variable both within individuals and across the population. Using natural language processing tools, we show that concrete words exhibit similar neural representations despite spanning larger distances within a high-dimensional semantic space, which potentially reflects an underlying representational signature of sensory experience&mdash;namely, imageability&mdash;shared by concrete words but absent from abstract words. Our findings situate the concrete&ndash;abstract axis as a core dimension that supports both shared and individualized representations of natural language.</p>

                <p>Estimating the direction of functional connectivity (FC) can help further elucidate complex brain function. However, the estimation of directed FC at the voxel level in fMRI data, and evaluating its performance, has yet to be done. We therefore developed a novel directed seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) method based on normalized pairwise Granger causality that provides greater detail and accuracy over ROI-based methods. We evaluated its performance against 145 cortical retrograde tracer injections in male and female marmosets that were used as ground truth cellular connectivity on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each injection, and we achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.95 for undirected and 0.942 for directed SCA in the case of high cell count threshold. This indicates that SCA can reliably estimate the strong cellular connections between voxels in fMRI data. We then used our directed SCA method to analyze the human default mode network (DMN) and found that dlPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and temporal lobe were separated from other DMN regions, forming part of the language-network that works together with the core DMN regions. We also found that the cerebellum (Crus I-II) was strongly targeted by the posterior parietal cortices and dlPFC, but reciprocal connections were not observed. Thus, the cerebellum may not be a part of, but instead a target of, the DMN and language-network. Summarily, our novel directed SCA method, visualized with a new functional flat mapping technique, opens a new paradigm for whole-brain functional analysis.</p>

                <p>Hyperbilirubinemia (HB) is a key risk factor for hearing loss in neonates, particularly premature infants. Here, we report that bilirubin (BIL)-dependent cell death in the auditory brainstem of neonatal mice of both sexes is significantly attenuated by ZD7288, a blocker for hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel-mediated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), or by genetic deletion of HCN1. GABAergic inhibitory interneurons predominantly express HCN1, on which BIL selectively acts to increase their intrinsic excitability and mortality by enhancing HCN1 activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane targeting. Chronic BIL elevation in neonatal mice in vivo increases the fraction of spontaneously active interneurons and their firing frequency, <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>, and death, compromising audition at the young adult stage in HCN1<sup>+/+</sup>, but not in HCN1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> genotype. We conclude that HB preferentially targets HCN1 to injure inhibitory interneurons, fueling a feedforward loop in which lessening inhibition cascades hyperexcitability, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, neuronal death, and auditory impairments. These findings rationalize HCN1 as a potential target for managing HB encephalopathy.</p>

                <p>Systemic study of pathogenic pathways and interrelationships underlying genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) facilitates the identification of new targets for effective treatments. Recently available large-scale multiomics datasets provide opportunities to use computational approaches for such studies. Here, we devised a novel <unl>di</unl>sease <unl>g</unl>ene <unl>id</unl>entification (digID) computational framework that consists of a semi-supervised deep learning classifier to predict AD-associated genes and a protein&ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network-based analysis to prioritize the importance of these predicted genes in AD. digID predicted 1,529 AD-associated genes and revealed potentially new AD molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets including GNAI1 and GNB1, two G-protein subunits that regulate cell signaling, and KNG1, an upstream modulator of CDC42 small G-protein signaling and mediator of inflammation and candidate coregulator of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Analysis of mRNA expression validated their dysregulation in AD brains but further revealed the significant spatial patterns in different brain regions as well as among different subregions of the frontal cortex and hippocampi. Super-resolution STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) further demonstrated their subcellular colocalization and molecular interactions with APP in a transgenic mouse model of both sexes with AD-like mutations. These studies support the predictions made by digID while highlighting the importance of concurrent biological validation of computationally identified gene clusters as potential new AD therapeutic targets.</p>

                <p>Words offer a unique opportunity to separate the processing mechanisms of object subcomponents from those of the whole object, because the phonological or semantic information provided by the word subcomponents (i.e., sublexical information) can conflict with that provided by the whole word (i.e., lexical information). Previous studies have revealed some of the specific brain regions and temporal information involved in sublexical information processing. However, a comprehensive spatiotemporal neural network for sublexical processing remains to be fully elucidated due to the low temporal or spatial resolutions of previous neuroimaging studies. In this study, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography signals with high spatial and temporal resolutions from a large sample of 39 epilepsy patients (both sexes) during a Chinese character oral reading task. We explored the activated brain regions and their connectivity related to three sublexical effects: phonological regularity (whether the whole character's pronunciation aligns with its phonetic radical), phonological consistency (whether characters with the same phonetic radical share the same pronunciation), and semantic transparency (whether the whole character's meaning aligns with its semantic radical). The results revealed that sublexical effects existed in the inferior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobe, and middle occipital gyrus. Additionally, connectivity from the middle occipital gyrus to the postcentral gyrus and from postcentral gyrus to the fusiform gyrus was associated with the sublexical effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of sublexical processing and object recognition in the brain.</p>

                <p>Plasticity in the subcortical motor basal ganglia&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cerebellar network plays a key role in the acquisition and control of long-term memory for new procedural skills, from the formation of population trajectories controlling trained motor skills in the striatum to the adaptation of sensorimotor maps in the cerebellum. However, recent findings demonstrate the involvement of a wider cortical and subcortical brain network in the consolidation and control of well-trained actions, including a brain region traditionally associated with declarative memory&mdash;the hippocampus. Here, we probe which role these subcortical areas play in skilled motor sequence control, from sequence feature selection during planning to their integration during sequence execution. An fMRI dataset (<I>N</I> = 24; 14 females) collected after participants learnt to produce four finger press sequences entirely from memory with high movement and timing accuracy over several days was examined for both changes in BOLD activity and their informational content in subcortical regions of interest. Although there was a widespread activity increase in effector-related striatal, thalamic, and cerebellar regions, in particular during sequence execution, the associated activity did not contain information on the motor sequence identity. In contrast, hippocampal activity increased during planning and predicted the order of the upcoming sequence of movements. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus preorders movements for skilled action sequences, thus contributing to the higher-order control of skilled movements that require flexible retrieval. These findings challenge the traditional taxonomy of episodic and procedural memory and carry implications for the rehabilitation of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <p>Key event-related potentials (ERPs) of perceptual decision-making such as centroparietal positivity (CPP) elucidate how evidence is accumulated toward a given choice. Furthermore, this accumulation can be impacted by visual target selection signals such as the N2 contralateral (N2c). How these underlying neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making are influenced by the spatial congruence of distractors relative to target stimuli remains unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in humans of both sexes to investigate the effect of distractor spatial congruency (same vs different hemifield relative to targets) on perceptual decision-making. We confirmed that responses for perceptual decisions were slower for spatially incongruent versus congruent distractors of high salience. Similarly, markers of target selection (N2c peak amplitude) and evidence accumulation (CPP slope) were found to be lower when distractors were spatially incongruent versus congruent. To evaluate the effects of congruency further, we applied drift diffusion modeling to participant responses, which showed that larger amplitudes of both ERPs were correlated with shorter nondecision times when considering the effect of congruency. The modeling also suggested that congruency's effect on behavior occurred prior to and during evidence accumulation when considering the effects of the N2c peak and CPP slope. These findings point to spatially incongruent distractors, relative to congruent distractors, influencing decisions as early as the initial sensory processing phase and then continuing to exert an effect as evidence is accumulated throughout the decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight how key electrophysiological signals of perceptual decision-making are influenced by the spatial congruence of target and distractor.</p>

Here we report a case of a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and a significant history of smoking, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long-standing bilateral claudication which recently progressed to rest pain. A history of AIOD was previously established. AIOD (TASC II Type D) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received best medical therapy. Conclusion Endovascular interventions present excellent alternatives to surgical techniques in the treatment of complex AIOD. Herein we presented an endovascular treatment of AIOD utilizing the kissing stent technique which showed satisfactory outcomes.

                Background The population is increasingly demanding a better quality of life in their territories, which requires better urban planning. This study aims to find out the effectiveness of urban planning implemented by local governments on citizen satisfaction. Method A systematic literature review was conducted exploring the evolution of the state-of-the-art databases in Scopus, WOS and Dimensions, involving a relevant selection of empirical studies on the effectiveness of urban planning on citizen satisfaction, using quality criteria and the application of the PRISMA diagram. Results The findings in the various empirical contributions find converging in three main blocks the contributions related to: (i) Urban planning as a catalyst for the impact of citizen satisfaction, given that using the planning tool will lead to the development of local policies based on the Neoliberalism approach for smart urban development; (ii) Theoretical contributions for urban planning that contextualises a modernist planning based on a multidimensional aspect to address quality of life for modern well-being and (iii) Smart planning for citizen satisfaction for the design and implementation of public governance reforms aimed at optimising urban planning management at the local level for smart urban city development. Conclusion There is strong theoretical and empirical support that is closely linked to sustainable development, happiness, public space, urban growth, urban areas, satisfied customers and urban residents. Future research should examine the relative weight of urban planning dimensions and effectiveness in the sustainable development of territories and citizen satisfaction.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies attained the inclusion criteria. The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Complexities in obturation and difficulties in disinfection are the major problems that make endodontic treatment very time-consuming. A new perspective is needed to reduce the working time as well as to answer these two problems. Until now, none of the established obturation techniques for root canal filling can guarantee a perfect seal. Solid substances cannot be manipulated easily to fill the tiny branches of the root canal system hermetically. At the same time, anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, especially Enterococcus faecalis, are very dominant in endodontic infections discussion. As shown in many studies, it is extremely difficult to perfectly disinfect Enterococcus faecalis even by using some irrigating solutions with strong antibacterial properties. Under anaerobic conditions, the invasion efficiency of facultative anaerobes is increased. In case irrigation and disinfection cannot totally eliminate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, a new strategy is also needed to deal with the bacteria that still survive in the root canal. Oxygen can fill the root canal system with ease, eliminate anaerobes, and prevent facultative anaerobes from being pathogenic. Therefore, using oxygen as obturation biomaterial after proper cleaning and shaping procedures is expected to solve the two major endodontic problems. The aim of this article was to discuss a new possible concept of dental restoration system that uses an oxygen-permeable membrane to decrease the time required in endodontic treatment. The membrane is placed at the orifice of a duct created to connect the entire root canal system with free air outside the restoration. The function of the membrane is more or less similar to the mask used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it enables the oxygen to circulate while preventing any fluid, debris, and microorganisms from passing. We hypothesize that the oxygen circulating in the root canal system will also act as an antimicrobial agent that is constantly renewed.

                Background Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been the gold standard since it was established in 1991. Various graft configurations have been developed to overcome the limitations of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), including contralateral gate cannulation (CGC). We propose a new device and technique intended to simplify endovascular AAA repair, along with reports of its application in six patients. Intervention The Taofan and Kang (T&K) bidirectional endovascular aortic repair (B-EVAR (B-EVAR) device uses a main-body stent graft, two-limb extensions, and bare metal stent. The procedure involved accessing the right and left femoral arteries, followed by standard aortography evaluation using a pigtail catheter through the contralateral femoral access. The main body stent graft is deployed through ipsilateral femoral access using a balloon catheter, while the contralateral gate is cannulated with a hydrophilic coated wire. Both balloons were inflated simultaneously to ensure that the wires were in different lumens. Contralateral and ipsilateral extensions were deployed using a limb extension stent graft. Standard aortography evaluation was repeated. Result T&K B-EVAR pilot procedures proved successful in various cases, from simple to complex anatomy, and even with varied graft stent deployment strategies. None of the patients had complications or prolonged length of stay (LOS). Follow-up CT did not reveal any high-pressure endoleaks. Conclusion T&K B-EVAR has been proven to simplify endovascular AAA repair in six patients with excellent results. It is also reproducible, potentially universally applicable, and can offer operators ease of use, faster procedure times, reduced fluoroscopy times, and reduced contrast usage.

                Background Excess nitrogen (N) loading to coastal ecosystems impairs estuarine water quality. Land management decisions made within estuarine watersheds have a direct impact on downstream N delivery. Natural features within watersheds can act as landscape sinks for N, such as wetlands, streams and ponds that transform dissolved N into gaseous N, effectively removing it from the aquatic system. Identifying and evaluating these landscape sinks and their spatial relationship to N sources can help managers understand the effects of alternative decisions on downstream resources. Methods The N-Sink approach uses widely available GIS data to identify landscape sinks within HUC-12 (or larger) catchments, estimate their N removal potential and map the effect of those sinks on N movement through the catchment. Static maps are produced to visualize N removal efficiency, transport and delivery, the latter in the form of an index. The R package nsink was developed to facilitate data acquisition, processing and visualization. Results nsink creates static maps for a specific HUC-12, or users can visit the University of Connecticut website to explore previously mapped areas. Users can investigate specific flowpaths interactively by clicking on any location within the catchment. A flowpath is generated with a table describing N removal along each segment. We describe the motivation behind developing nsink, discuss implementation in R, and present two use case examples. nsink is available from https://github.com/USEPA/nsink. Conclusions N-Sink is a decision support tool created for local decision-makers and NGOs to facilitate better understanding of the relationship between land use and downstream N delivery. Local decision-makers that have prioritized N mitigation in their long-term planning can use nsink to better understand the potential impact of proposed development projects, zoning variances, and land acquisition or restoration. nsink also allows resource economists to investigate the tradeoffs among different, often costly, N reduction strategies.

                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                <p>by John H. Tay, Arthur Kocher, Sebastian Duchene</p>

Our understanding of the evolution of many microbes has been revolutionised by the molecular clock, a statistical tool to infer evolutionary rates and timescales from analyses of biomolecular sequences. In all molecular clock models, evolutionary rates and times are jointly unidentifiable and ‘calibration’ information must therefore be used. For many organisms, sequences sampled at different time points can be employed for such calibration. Before attempting to do so, it is recommended to verify that the data carry sufficient information for molecular dating, a practice referred to as evaluation of temporal signal. Recently, a fully Bayesian approach, BETS (Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal), was proposed to overcome known limitations of other commonly used techniques such as root-to-tip regression or date randomisation tests. BETS requires the specification of a full Bayesian phylogenetic model, posing several considerations for untangling the impact of model choice on the detection of temporal signal. Here, we aimed to (i) explore the effect of molecular clock model and tree prior specification on the results of BETS and (ii) provide guidelines for improving our confidence in molecular clock estimates. Using microbial molecular sequence data sets and simulation experiments, we assess the impact of the tree prior and its hyperparameters on the accuracy of temporal signal detection. In particular, highly informative priors that are inconsistent with the data can result in the incorrect detection of temporal signal. In consequence, we recommend: (i) using prior predictive simulations to determine whether the prior generates a reasonable expectation of parameters of interest, such as the evolutionary rate and age of the root node, (ii) conducting prior sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the posterior to the choice of prior, and (iii) selecting a molecular clock model that reasonably describes the evolutionary process.

Prolyl-4-hydroxylase subunit alpha3 (P4HA3) is a triple helical procollagen synthesis protein. The role of P4HA3 in cancer development is not well known and lacks comprehensive analyses among human cancers. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between P4HA3 expression and anti-tumor immunity and its prognostic value in pan-cancer. P4HA3 expression was analyzed from TIMER2.0, GTEx, GEPIA2.0 and TCGA databases. Genetic and DNA methylation alterations, survival analysis and proteins co-expression analysis of P4HA3 in cBio Cancer Genomics Portal, TCGA, GSCA and TIMER2.0. The correlation between P4HA3 expression and immune infiltration was analyzed by TIDE, XCELL, MCPCOUNTER, and EPIC. We performed EdU and transwell experiments to evaluate the influence of P4HA3 on the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of different tumors. Patients derived xenograft (PDX) and subcutaneous transplantation models were utilized to explore the correlation between P4HA3 and immunotherapy response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Among 33 types of cancers, P4HA3 had generally different expression between different tumors, further analysis showed that the expression of P4HA3 was correlated with the cells infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The expression of P4HA3 was positively with the cell proliferation markers and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Moreover, P4HA3 deficiency inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of tumor cells, and promoted anti-tumor immunotherapy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. This pan-cancer analysis of P4HA3 provides a comprehensive understanding of its oncogenic and prognosis role in different cancers, P4HA3 abnormal expression could be a useful biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in cancer patients.

                <p>by Jonathan Eden, Ekaterina Ivanova, Etienne Burdet</p>

Physically connected humans have been shown to exploit the exchange of haptic forces and tactile information to improve their performance in joint action tasks. As human interactions are increasingly mediated through robots and networks it is important to understand the impact that network features such as lag and noise may have on human behaviour. In this paper, we investigated interaction with a human-like robot controller that provides similar haptic communication behaviour as human-human interaction and examined the influence and compensation mechanisms for delay and noise on haptic communication. The results of our experiments show that participants can perceive a difference between noise and delay, and make use of compensation mechanisms to preserve performance in both cases. However, while noise is compensated for by increasing co-contraction, delay compensation could not be explained by this strategy. Instead, computational modelling suggested that a distinct mechanism is used to compensate for the delay and yield an efficient haptic communication.

<p>Eight alternative or off-label treatments have been identified that all have plausible mechanisms for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and some benefits in small, flawed clinical trials. Created with <a target="_blank"

<p>There are no dramatically effective pharmacological treatments for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a complex disease with multiple underlying mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome alteration, and antiretroviral activity. We sifted through 15 years of reviews by a group called ALSUntangled to identify 8 alternative and off-label treatments that target ≥1 of these mechanisms, and have ≥1 human trial suggesting meaningful benefits. Given the overlapping pathological mechanisms of the highlighted products, we suggest that combinations of these treatments targeting diverse mechanisms might be worthwhile for future amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy development.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23646?af=R">Supramammillary Theta Oscillations in Water Maze Learning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the hippocampus (HPC), has been implicated through theta oscillations in various brain functions ranging from locomotion to learning and memory. While the indispensable role of the SuM in HPC theta generation in anesthetized animals is well-characterized, the SuM is not always necessary for HPC theta in awake animals. This raises questions on the precise behavioral relevance of SuM theta activity and its interaction with HPC theta activity. We used simultaneously recorded SuM and HPC local field potentials (LFPs) in a one-day water maze (WM) learning paradigm in rats (<i>n</i> = 8), to show that theta activities recorded from the SuM itself were not positively correlated with locomotor (swimming) speed nor acceleration, but the individual relationship between acceleration and SuM theta frequency is correlated with WM learning rates. In contrast, we found that SuM-HPC theta phase coherence is strongly correlated with swimming speed and acceleration, but these do not relate to WM learning. SuM-HPC-directed coherence analysis demonstrated no swimming kinetics nor learning rate associations, but revealed that periods of high SuM-HPC theta phase coherence are driven by the SuM at relatively low (~6.2 Hz) frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that the SuM and the HPC also engage in non-random, non-coherent phase coupling modes where either structure preferentially displays a ± 2 Hz difference with the other. Our data indicate SuM theta LFPs do not appear to be related to either speed coding or spatial learning in swimming rats and display non-random out-of-phase theta frequency coupling with the HPC.</p>

                The evolution and complex genetic architecture of facultative diapause in insects remain poorly understood. Jin et al. demonstrate that a supergene controlling insect diapause in an agricultural pest is formed by a chromosomal inversion. Their findings provide insight into how insects adapt to variable climatic conditions.

                Lynskey et al. report links between HIRA-mediated histone H3.3 deposition and R-loop homeostasis at ALT telomeres. In most ALT cancer cells, after ATRX-DAXX is inactivated, HIRA regulates telomeric chromatin assembly. HIRA limits ssDNA accumulation and mitigates out-of-control R-loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts at telomeres, threatening cancer cell survival.

                Mouse photoreceptors establish a dorsal-ventral chromatic gradient that is attenuated at the retinal output. Korympidou et al. explore how dendrites of inhibitory amacrine cells in the mouse retina respond to chromatic stimuli. They find that amacrine cell dendrites are less chromatically tuned, suggesting that inhibition “de-biases” the chromatic gradient.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96755">DNAH3 deficiency causes flagellar inner dynein arm loss and male infertility in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Axonemal protein complexes, including the outer and inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA), are highly ordered structures of the sperm flagella that drive sperm motility. Deficiencies in several axonemal proteins have been associated with male infertility, which is characterized by asthenozoospermia or asthenoteratozoospermia. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 3 (DNAH3) resides in the IDA and is highly expressed in the testis. However, the relationship between DNAH3 and male infertility is still unclear. Herein, we identified biallelic variants of <i>DNAH3</i> in four unrelated Han Chinese infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia through whole-exome sequencing (WES). These variants contributed to deficient DNAH3 expression in the patients’ sperm flagella. Importantly, the patients represented the anomalous sperm flagellar morphology, and the flagellar ultrastructure was severely disrupted. Intriguingly, <i>Dnah3</i> knockout (KO) male mice were also infertile, especially showing the severe reduction in sperm movement with the abnormal IDA and mitochondrion structure. Mechanically, nonfunctional DNAH3 expression resulted in decreased expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa flagella of patients and KO mice, including DNAH1, DNAH6, and DNALI1, the deletion of which has been involved in disruption of sperm motility. Moreover, the infertility of patients with <i>DNAH3</i> variants and <i>Dnah3</i> KO mice could be rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Our findings indicated that <i>DNAH3</i> is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoteratozoospermia and may further contribute to the diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prognosis of male infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89755">Functional implications of the exon 9 splice insert in GluK1 kainate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Kainate receptors are key modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. Different kainate receptor isoforms with distinct spatiotemporal expressions have been identified in the brain. The GluK1-1 splice variant receptors, which are abundant in the adult brain, have an extra fifteen amino acids inserted in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the receptor resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9. However, the functional implications of this post-transcriptional modification are not yet clear. We employed a multi-pronged approach using cryogenic electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and other biophysical and biochemical tools to understand the structural and functional impact of this splice insert in the extracellular domain of GluK1 receptors. Our study reveals that the splice insert alters the key gating properties of GluK1 receptors and their modulation by the cognate auxiliary Neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins 1 and 2. Mutational analysis identified the role of crucial splice residues that influence receptor properties and their modulation. Furthermore, the cryoEM structure of the variant shows that the presence of exon 9 in GluK1 does not affect the receptor architecture or domain arrangement in the desensitized state. Our study thus provides the first detailed structural and functional characterization of GluK1-1a receptors, highlighting the role of the splice insert in modulating receptor properties and their modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89582">Inhibition of the Notch signal transducer CSL by Pkc53E-mediated phosphorylation to fend off parasitic immune challenge in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Notch signalling activity regulates hematopoiesis in <i>Drosophila</i> and vertebrates alike. Parasitoid wasp infestation of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, however, requires a timely downregulation of Notch activity to allow the formation of encapsulation-active blood cells. Here, we show that the <i>Drosophila</i> CSL transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] is phosphorylated at Serine 269 in response to parasitoid wasp infestation. As this phosphorylation interferes with the DNA binding of Su(H), it reversibly precludes its activity. Accordingly, phospho-deficient <i>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></i> mutants are immune-compromised. A screen for kinases involved in Su(H) phosphorylation identified Pkc53E, required for normal hematopoiesis as well as for parasitoid immune response. Genetic and molecular interactions support the specificity of the Su(H)-Pkc53E relationship. Moreover, phorbol ester treatment inhibits Su(H) activity in vivo and in human cell culture. We conclude that Pkc53E targets Su(H) during parasitic wasp infestation, thereby remodelling the blood cell population required for wasp egg encapsulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95213">Distinct catecholaminergic pathways projecting to hippocampal CA1 transmit contrasting signals during navigation in familiar and novel environments</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory inputs to the hippocampus play pivotal roles in modulating synaptic plasticity, shaping neuronal activity, and influencing learning and memory. Recently, it has been shown that the main sources of catecholamines to the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC), may have overlapping release of neurotransmitters and effects on the hippocampus. Therefore, to dissect the impacts of both VTA and LC circuits on hippocampal function, a thorough examination of how these pathways might differentially operate during behavior and learning is necessary. We therefore utilized two-photon microscopy to functionally image the activity of VTA and LC axons within the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus in head-fixed male mice navigating linear paths within virtual reality (VR) environments. We found that within familiar environments some VTA axons and the vast majority of LC axons showed a correlation with the animals’ running speed. However, as mice approached previously learned rewarded locations, a large majority of VTA axons exhibited a gradual ramping-up of activity, peaking at the reward location. In contrast, LC axons displayed a pre-movement signal predictive of the animal’s transition from immobility to movement. Interestingly, a marked divergence emerged following a switch from the familiar to novel VR environments. Many LC axons showed large increases in activity that remained elevated for over a minute, while the previously observed VTA axon ramping-to-reward dynamics disappeared during the same period. In conclusion, these findings highlight distinct roles of VTA and LC catecholaminergic inputs in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region. These inputs encode unique information, with reward information in VTA inputs and novelty and kinematic information in LC inputs, likely contributing to differential modulation of hippocampal activity during behavior and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92074">Single-cell multiomics analysis of chronic myeloid leukemia links cellular heterogeneity to therapy response</a></h4>

              
                The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a paradigm in molecularly targeted cancer therapy. Nonetheless, TKI-insensitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) persist in most patients even after years of treatment and are imperative for disease progression as well as recurrence during treatment-free remission (TFR). Here, we have generated high-resolution single-cell multiomics maps from CML patients at diagnosis, retrospectively stratified by BCR::ABL1<sup>IS</sup> (%) following 12 months of TKI therapy. Simultaneous measurement of global gene expression profiles together with &gt;40 surface markers from the same cells revealed that each patient harbored a unique composition of stem and progenitor cells at diagnosis. The patients with treatment failure after 12 months of therapy had a markedly higher abundance of molecularly defined primitive cells at diagnosis compared to the optimal responders. The multiomic feature landscape enabled visualization of the primitive fraction as a mixture of molecularly distinct BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup>hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in variable ratio across patients, and guided their prospective isolation by a combination of CD26 and CD35 cell surface markers. We for the first time show that BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs can be distinctly separated as CD26<sup>+</sup>CD35<sup>-</sup> and CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup>, respectively. In addition, we found the ratio of LSC/HSC to be higher in patients with prospective treatment failure compared to optimal responders, at diagnosis as well as following 3 months of TKI therapy. Collectively, this data builds a framework for understanding therapy response and adapting treatment by devising strategies to extinguish or suppress TKI-insensitive LSCs.
