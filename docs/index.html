              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13198">Why does time feel the way it does? Towards a principled account of temporal experience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time flows, or at least the time of our experience does. Can we provide an objective account of why experience, confined to the short window of the conscious present, encompasses a succession of moments that slip away from now to then--an account of why time feels flowing? Integrated Information Theory (IIT) aims to account for both the presence and quality of consciousness in objective, physical terms. Given a substrate's architecture and current state, the formalism of IIT allows one to unfold the cause-effect power of the substrate, yielding a cause-effect structure. According to IIT, this accounts in full for the presence and quality of experience, without any additional ingredients. In previous work, we showed how unfolding the cause-effect structure of non-directed grids, like those found in many posterior cortical areas, can account for the way space feels--namely, extended. Here we show that unfolding the cause-effect structure of directed grids can account for how time feels--namely, flowing. First, we argue that the conscious present is experienced as flowing because it is composed of phenomenal distinctions (moments) that are directed, and these distinctions are related in a way that satisfies directed inclusion, connection, and fusion. We then show that directed grids, which we conjecture constitute the substrate of temporal experience, yield a cause-effect structure that accounts for these and other properties of temporal experience. In this account, the experienced present does not correspond to a process unrolling in "clock time," but to a cause-effect structure specified by a system in its current state: time is a structure, not a process. We conclude by outlining similarities and differences between the experience of time and space, and some implications for the neuroscience, psychophysics, and philosophy of time.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13202">Modularity, Hierarchical Flows and Symmetry of the Drosophila Connectome</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report investigates the modular organisation of the Central region in the Drosophila connectome. We identify groups of neurones amongst which information circulates rapidly before spreading to the rest of the network using Infomap. We find that information flows along pathways linking distant neurones, forming modules that span across the brain. Remarkably, these modules, derived solely from neuronal connectivity patterns, exhibit a striking left-right symmetry in their spatial distribution as well as in their connections. We also identify a hierarchical structure at the coarse-grained scale of these modules, demonstrating the directional nature of information flow in the system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13713">Representational Drift and Learning-Induced Stabilization in the Olfactory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain encodes external stimuli through patterns of neural activity, forming internal representations of the world. Recent experiments show that neural representations for a given stimulus change over time. However, the mechanistic origin for the observed "representational drift" (RD) remains unclear. Here, we propose a biologically-realistic computational model of the piriform cortex to study RD in the mammalian olfactory system by combining two mechanisms for the dynamics of synaptic weights at two separate timescales: spontaneous fluctuations on a scale of days and spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) on a scale of seconds. Our study shows that, while spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic weights induce RD, STDP-based learning during repeated stimulus presentations can reduce it. Our model quantitatively explains recent experiments on RD in the olfactory system and offers a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of drift and its relation to learning, which may be useful to study RD in other brain regions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13816">Who Saves us From Risk? Altruists Promote Cooperation in a Public Investment Game</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing commons in the risky world is crucial for human survival, however, suffers more from the "free-riding" problem. Here, we proposed a solution that limits the access of the resource to an agent and tested its efficiency with a novel public investment game. On each trial, all group members invest in an agent responsible for a gamble and distribution. Resources are distributed evenly between non-agent group members after the agent extracts for him/herself. In 3 laboratory experiments (n = 704), we found that, as an agent, many participants extracted fewer resources than others. This altruistic distribution strategy improved cooperation levels. Furthermore, this cooperation-promoting effect could be spread to selfish agents who are in the same group as the altruistic agent and was replicated in a one-shot setting. We proposed that, when the commons are under risk, this distribution solution serves as a better alternative to the well-documented sanction solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14112">Starting a Synthetic Biological Intelligence Lab from Scratch</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, researchers and industries are deploying gigantic models trained on billions of samples. While training these models consumes a huge amount of energy, human brains produce similar outputs (along with other capabilities) with massively lower data and energy requirements. For this reason, more researchers are increasingly considering alternatives. One of these alternatives is known as synthetic biological intelligence, which involves training \textit{in vitro} neurons for goal-directed tasks. This multidisciplinary field requires knowledge of tissue engineering, bio-materials, digital signal processing, computer programming, neuroscience, and even artificial intelligence. The multidisciplinary requirements make starting synthetic biological intelligence research highly non-trivial and time-consuming. Generally, most labs either specialize in the biological aspects or the computational ones. Here, we propose how a lab focusing on computational aspects, including machine learning and device interfacing, can start working on synthetic biological intelligence, including organoid intelligence. We will also discuss computational aspects, which can be helpful for labs that focus on biological research. To facilitate synthetic biological intelligence research, we will describe such a general process step by step, including risks and precautions that could lead to substantial delay or additional cost.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13237">Optimized two-stage AI-based Neural Decoding for Enhanced Visual Stimulus Reconstruction from fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity, measured through functional MRI (fMRI), into latent hierarchical representations. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using latent diffusion models (LDM) via a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Due to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential steps, the first one providing a rough visual approximation, the second on improving the stimulus prediction via LDM endowed by CLIP embeddings. This work proposes a non-linear deep network to improve fMRI latent space representation, optimizing the dimensionality alike. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset showed that the proposed architecture improved the structural similarity of the reconstructed image by about 2\% with respect to the state-of-the-art model, based on ridge linear transform. The reconstructed image's semantics improved by about 4\%, measured by perceptual similarity, with respect to the state-of-the-art. The noise sensitivity analysis of the LDM showed that the role of the first stage was fundamental to predict the stimulus featuring high structural similarity. Conversely, providing a large noise stimulus affected less the semantics of the predicted stimulus, while the structural similarity between the ground truth and predicted stimulus was very poor. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging non-linear relationships between BOLD signal and the latent representation and two-stage generative AI for optimizing the fidelity of reconstructed visual stimuli from noisy fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07315">An introduction to reinforcement learning for neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2311.07315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has a rich history in neuroscience, from early work on dopamine as a reward prediction error signal (Schultz et al., 1997) to recent work proposing that the brain could implement a form of 'distributional reinforcement learning' popularized in machine learning (Dabney et al., 2020). There has been a close link between theoretical advances in reinforcement learning and neuroscience experiments throughout this literature, and the theories describing the experimental data have therefore become increasingly complex. Here, we provide an introduction and mathematical background to many of the methods that have been used in systems neroscience. We start with an overview of the RL problem and classical temporal difference algorithms, followed by a discussion of 'model-free', 'model-based', and intermediate RL algorithms. We then introduce deep reinforcement learning and discuss how this framework has led to new insights in neuroscience. This includes a particular focus on meta-reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2018) and distributional RL (Dabney et al., 2020). Finally, we discuss potential shortcomings of the RL formalism for neuroscience and highlight open questions in the field. Code that implements the methods discussed and generates the figures is also provided.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01385">Anti-seizure medication tapering correlates with daytime delta band power reduction in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.01385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are the primary treatment for epilepsy, yet medication tapering effects have not been investigated in a dose, region, and time-dependent manner, despite their potential impact on research and clinical practice.
  We examined over 3000 hours of intracranial EEG recordings in 32 subjects during long-term monitoring, of which 22 underwent concurrent ASM tapering. We estimated ASM plasma levels based on known pharmaco-kinetics of all the major ASM types.
  We found an overall decrease in the power of delta band ({\delta}) activity around the period of maximum medication withdrawal in most (80%) subjects, independent of their epilepsy type or medication combination. The degree of withdrawal correlated positively with the magnitude of {\delta} power decrease. This dose-dependent effect was evident across all recorded cortical regions during daytime; but not in sub-cortical regions, or during night time. We found no evidence of a differential effect in seizure onset, spiking, or pathological brain regions.
  The finding of decreased {\delta} band power during ASM tapering agrees with previous literature. Our observed dose-dependent effect indicates that monitoring ASM levels in cortical regions may be feasible for applications such as medication reminder systems, or closed-loop ASM delivery systems. ASMs are also used in other neurological and psychiatric conditions, making our findings relevant to a general neuroscience and neurology audience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13553">Combining Aggregated Attention and Transformer Architecture for Accurate and Efficient Performance of Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their distinctive low-power characteristics. Meanwhile, Transformer models, known for their powerful self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Despite the significant advantages of both SNNs and Transformers, directly combining the low-power benefits of SNNs with the high performance of Transformers remains challenging. Specifically, while the sparse computing mode of SNNs contributes to reduced energy consumption, traditional attention mechanisms depend on dense matrix computations and complex softmax operations. This reliance poses significant challenges for effective execution in low-power scenarios. Given the tremendous success of Transformers in deep learning, it is a necessary step to explore the integration of SNNs and Transformers to harness the strengths of both. In this paper, we propose a novel model architecture, Spike Aggregation Transformer (SAFormer), that integrates the low-power characteristics of SNNs with the high-performance advantages of Transformer models. The core contribution of SAFormer lies in the design of the Spike Aggregated Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism, which significantly simplifies the computation process by calculating attention weights using only the spike matrices query and key, thereby effectively reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we introduce a Depthwise Convolution Module (DWC) to enhance the feature extraction capabilities, further improving overall accuracy. We evaluated and demonstrated that SAFormer outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs in both accuracy and energy consumption, highlighting its significant advantages in low-power and high-performance computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13610">Faster and Stronger: When ANN-SNN Conversion Meets Parallel Spiking Calculation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired and energy-efficient network, is currently facing the pivotal challenge of exploring a suitable and efficient learning framework. The predominant training methodologies, namely Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) and ANN-SNN Conversion, are encumbered by substantial training overhead or pronounced inference latency, which impedes the advancement of SNNs in scaling to larger networks and navigating intricate application domains. In this work, we propose a novel parallel conversion learning framework, which establishes a mathematical mapping relationship between each time-step of the parallel spiking neurons and the cumulative spike firing rate. We theoretically validate the lossless and sorting properties of the conversion process, as well as pointing out the optimal shifting distance for each step. Furthermore, by integrating the above framework with the distribution-aware error calibration technique, we can achieve efficient conversion towards more general activation functions or training-free circumstance. Extensive experiments have confirmed the significant performance advantages of our method for various conversion cases under ultra-low time latency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which jointly utilizes parallel spiking calculation and ANN-SNN Conversion, providing a highly promising approach for SNN supervised training.

                arXiv:2412.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic tabular data is essential to prevent the distribution of false or manipulated datasets that could compromise data-driven decision-making. This study explores whether synthetic tabular data can be reliably identified ''in the wild''-meaning across different generators, domains, and table formats. This challenge is unique to tabular data, where structures (such as number of columns, data types, and formats) can vary widely from one table to another. We propose three cross-table baseline detectors and four distinct evaluation protocols, each corresponding to a different level of ''wildness''. Our very preliminary results confirm that cross-table adaptation is a challenging task.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13762">Cultivating Archipelago of Forests: Evolving Robust Decision Trees through Island Coevolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their simplicity and interpretability, but they often lack robustness to adversarial attacks and data perturbations. The paper proposes a novel island-based coevolutionary algorithm (ICoEvoRDF) for constructing robust decision tree ensembles. The algorithm operates on multiple islands, each containing populations of decision trees and adversarial perturbations. The populations on each island evolve independently, with periodic migration of top-performing decision trees between islands. This approach fosters diversity and enhances the exploration of the solution space, leading to more robust and accurate decision tree ensembles. ICoEvoRDF utilizes a popular game theory concept of mixed Nash equilibrium for ensemble weighting, which further leads to improvement in results. ICoEvoRDF is evaluated on 20 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in optimizing both adversarial accuracy and minimax regret. The flexibility of ICoEvoRDF allows for the integration of decision trees from various existing methods, providing a unified framework for combining diverse solutions. Our approach offers a promising direction for developing robust and interpretable machine learning models

                arXiv:2412.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to mimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy for several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the backpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is optimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the manifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions matching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of local minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the search space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the instantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the best solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient descent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons separately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons forming a network.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is associated with a variety of neurologic deficits and impacts socialization decisions, mood, and overall quality of life. As a common symptom comprising the long COVID condition, persistent COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction (C19OD) may further impact the presentations of neuropsychiatric sequelae. Our study aims to characterize the longitudinal burden of depression, anxiety, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a population with C19OD. Methods: Individuals with perceived C19OD completed a psychophysical screening evaluation of their sense of smell using the comprehensive Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks olfactory assessment. Only those with validated psychophysical OD were included in this prospective longitudinal study for baseline and one-year follow-up. Participants also completed PHQ-9, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires at each time point. Anxiety, depression, and neuropsychiatric symptom prevalence was calculated and compared between time points with Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s chi-squared, Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: Each neuropsychiatric symptom evaluated in this study was reported by 13&amp;amp;ndash;49% of longitudinal cohort participants at both baseline and follow-up, except for seizure (0% at baseline and follow-up) and word-finding difficulty (61&amp;amp;ndash;68% at baseline and follow-up). Word-finding and focus difficulties were the most commonly reported symptoms. In total, 41% of participants reported some level of depression at baseline and 38% of participants reported depression at one-year follow-up, while 29% and 27% of participants reported some level of anxiety at respective time points. Conclusions: Individuals with C19OD are at risk for developing persistent neuropsychiatric conditions. These neurologic and psychiatric sequelae are persistent with repeated longitudinal assessment, even at nearly 2.5 years following initial COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objective: Aging is associated with both cognitive and physical decline. Some factors, such as lifestyle and environment, can significantly contribute to accelerating or slowing down the decline processes. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of lifestyle (active vs. non-active) and environmental context (institutionalized vs. non-institutionalized) on the cognitive functioning, psychological well-being, sleep quality, and daily living skills of elderly people. Methods: Our sample consisted of 182 subjects divided into active and non-active groups (subjects who engage or not in physical and social activities, respectively; mean age in years: 67.19 vs. 68.75) and 245 subjects divided into institutionalized and non-institutionalized groups (i.e., living in a nursing home or not, respectively; mean age in years: 79.49 vs. 71.72). Participants were enrolled voluntarily and randomly in the city of L&amp;amp;rsquo;Aquila. A battery of psychological instruments was administered to evaluate general cognitive decline, depressive symptoms, self-assessed sleep quality, and daily living skills. Results: Regarding lifestyle, the active group exhibited significantly lower levels of depression, better sleep quality, and daily living skills with respect to the non-active group. Regarding environmental context, institutionalized subjects showed higher levels of depression and reduced cognitive functioning, which were linked to reduced sleep quality and worsened daily living skills. When comparing the non-active with the institutionalized group, the latter showed higher levels of depression and reduced cognitive functioning, more sleep complaints, and reduced daily living skills. Conclusions: Our study highlights that an active lifestyle and a non-institutionalized environment, both allowing greater mobility and autonomy, are two factors that positively contribute to the mental and physical well-being of elderly individuals. Furthermore, the healthcare institution context appears to have a greater negative impact on the psycho-physical well-being of the subjects involved compared to a non-active lifestyle.</p>

                Background Postoperative immobilizatiton for patients with lower extremity fractures causes constipation, which usually affects 50–70% of patients. When it comes to nursing interventions for postoperative constipation, Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are two possible options. Aim The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage on constipation scores on post-operative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-posttest design without control group design was applied. 30 respondents used simple random sampling technique. The Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) questionnaire was used to assess the patient’s constipation levels before and after the intervention. The data analysis used independent t-test. Results The mean score of constipation of drinking water group after the intervention was 4.60 while abdominal Swedish massage was 3.56. Although both significantly reduced the constipation score, the p-value was 0.00. Conclusion The protocol of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage immediately after waking up effectively reduced constipation scores on postoperative lower extremity fracture patients and can be use to adjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate postoperative constipation patients with immobility and the use of strong analgetics.

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for human-computer interaction, particularly through eye-gesture recognition, enabling intuitive control for users and accessibility for individuals with physical impairments. Methods We developed an AI-driven eye-gesture recognition system using tools like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to translate eye movements into commands. The system was trained on a dataset of 20,000 gestures from 100 diverse volunteers, representing various demographics, and tested under different conditions, including varying lighting and eyewear. Results The system achieved 99.63% accuracy in recognizing gestures, with slight reductions to 98.9% under reflective glasses. These results demonstrate its robustness and adaptability across scenarios, confirming its generalizability. Conclusions This system advances AI-driven interaction by enhancing accessibility and unlocking applications in critical fields like military and rescue operations. Future work will validate the system using publicly available datasets to further strengthen its impact and usability.

                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds are rich in proteins, lipids, and essential nutrients, and they also contain various phytochemicals, including flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids such as trigonelline. Trigonelline (TG) is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the critical need for a fast, green, and economical method that overcomes inefficiencies, high solvent usage, and sensitivity limitations in the quantification of TG. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield was 5.36 mg/100 mg with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLC-MS/MS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4 ppb (SD = 176.4), with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (mean = 392.7, SD = 132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (mean = 91.9, SD = 83.3 ppb) and ACt (mean = 59.5, SD = 30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

                Background The burden of visual impairment and avoidable blindness has been attributed to the shortage and poor distribution of adequately trained eye care personnel. In the district health system, primary health care (PHC) nurses are the first point of contact for eye care patients. To provide adequate eye care, the nurses in PHC clinics apply their knowledge on basic eye health to ensure best practices and management for patients that present at their clinics. Anecdotal evidence regarding the knowledge and practices of these PHC professionals is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PHC nurses’ knowledge and practices on eye health. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 28 from the 74 PHC clinics in the district. A researcher-administered questionnaire using a 5-point likert scale with options strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree, was developed, piloted and finalised for this study. The tool had four sections: demographic information, knowledge of eye health, practices on evaluating visual function and identification and management of presenting eye conditions. Data were collected, captured onto MSXcel, cleaned, coded and analysed descriptively, and for Chi-squared significance at 95%, using R statistical software. Results From 200 responses, 86.4% (n=172) were females of the African race. Most (93.5%, n=187) had never undergone formal training in eye care. Only 28% (n=56) correctly identified a mature cataract while 28% (n=56) correctly identified signs of glaucoma; the global leading causes of preventable blindness. A total of 94% (n=188) failed to accurately measure visual acuity on a patient. Conclusions PHC nurses showed poor knowledge and practices of common eye conditions.

                <p>by Wei Lan, Tongsheng Ling, Qingfeng Chen, Ruiqing Zheng, Min Li, Yi Pan</p>

With the rapidly development of biotechnology, it is now possible to obtain single-cell multi-omics data in the same cell. However, how to integrate and analyze these single-cell multi-omics data remains a great challenge. Herein, we introduce an interpretable multitask framework (scMoMtF) for comprehensively analyzing single-cell multi-omics data. The scMoMtF can simultaneously solve multiple key tasks of single-cell multi-omics data including dimension reduction, cell classification and data simulation. The experimental results shows that scMoMtF outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms on these tasks. In addition, scMoMtF has interpretability which allowing researchers to gain a reliable understanding of potential biological features and mechanisms in single-cell multi-omics data.

                <p>by Janez Demšar, Blaž Zupan</p>

Data clustering is a core data science approach widely used and referenced in the scientific literature. Its algorithms are often intuitive and can lead to exciting, insightful results that are easy to interpret. For these reasons, data clustering techniques could be the first method encountered in data science training. This paper proposes a hands-on approach to data clustering training suitable for introductory courses. The education approach features problem-based training that starts with the data and gradually introduces various data processing and analysis methods, illustrating them through visual representations of data and models. The proposed training is suitable for a general audience, does not require a background in statistics, mathematics, or computer science, and aims to engage the audience through practical examples, an exploratory approach to data analysis with visual analysis, experimentation, and a gentle learning curve. The manuscript details the pedagogical units of the training, motivates them through the sequence of methods introduced, and proposes data sets and data analysis workflows to be explored in the class.

The optimal contraception dosing strategy proposed by Gavina et al. recently is a commendable attempt to model a complex physiological process with potenial to apply to real-life data. However, there is a need to take into account the real challenges that arise when moving from the theory to its practical application, and it is important that lessons learnt from clinical studies be taken into consideration in any theoretical modelling. In this manuscript, we spell out these lessons and elaborate practical challenges facing their model.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Two key series of discoveries about the hippocampus are described. One is the discovery of hippocampal spatial view cells in primates. This discovery opens the way to a much better understanding of human episodic memory, for episodic memory prototypically involves a memory of where people or objects or rewards have been seen in locations “out there” which could never be implemented by the place cells that encode the location of a rat or mouse. Further, spatial view cells are valuable for navigation using vision and viewed landmarks, and provide for much richer, vision-based, navigation than the place to place self-motion update performed by rats and mice who live in dark underground tunnels. Spatial view cells thus offer a revolution in our understanding of the functions of the hippocampus in memory and navigation in humans and other primates with well-developed foveate vision. The second discovery describes a computational theory of the hippocampal-neocortical memory system that includes the only quantitative theory of how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. It is shown how foundations for this research were the discovery of reward neurons for food reward, and non-reward, in the primate orbitofrontal cortex, and representations of value including of monetary value in the human orbitofrontal cortex; and the discovery of face identity and face expression cells in the primate inferior temporal visual cortex and how they represent transform-invariant information. This research illustrates how in order to understand a brain computation, a whole series of integrated interdisciplinary discoveries is needed to build a theory of the operation of each neural system.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Analysis Reveals Mitochondrial Placement Independent of Synapse Placement in Fine Caliber C. elegans Neurons"/>
<p>WormImage, a decades old electron microscopy database in the public domain, contains information about the ultrastructural placement of mitochondria within the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i> over an extent not found in other databases. We mined this database and found differences in mitochondrial size and density between neurons, but limited differences between different compartments of the same neurons. While neurons are clearly able to disperse mitochondria throughout their extent, we found no evidence that they place mitochondria at synapses.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurons rely on mitochondria for an efficient supply of ATP and other metabolites. However, while neurons are highly elongated, mitochondria are discrete and limited in number. Due to the slow rates of metabolite diffusion over long distances, it follows that neurons would benefit from an ability to control the distribution of mitochondria to sites of high metabolic activity such as synapses. Ultrastructural data over substantial portions of a neuron's extent that would allow for tests of such hypotheses are scarce. Here, we mined the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>’ electron micrographs of John White and Sydney Brenner and found systematic differences in average mitochondrial length (ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 µm), diameter (0.18–0.24 µm) and volume density (3.7%–6.5%) between neurons of different function and neurotransmitter type, but found limited differences in mitochondrial length, diameter, and density between axons and dendrites of the same neurons. In analyses of mitochondrial distribution, mitochondria were found to be distributed randomly with respect to presynaptic sites. Presynaptic sites were primarily localized to varicosities, but mitochondria were no more likely to be found in synaptic varicosities than non-synaptic varicosities. Consistently, mitochondrial volume density was no greater in synaptic varicosities than non-synaptic varicosities. Therefore, beyond the capacity to disperse mitochondria throughout their length, at least in <i>C. elegans</i>, fine caliber neurons manifest limited subcellular control of mitochondrial size and distribution.</p>

                Recent studies in non-human primates do not find pronounced signals related to the animal’s own body movements in the responses of neurons in the visual cortex. This is notable because such pronounced signals have been widely observed in the visual cortex of mice. Here, we discuss factors that may contribute to the differences observed between species, such as state, slow neural drift, eccentricity, and changes in retinal input. The interpretation of movement-related signals in the visual cortex also exemplifies the challenge of identifying the sources of correlated variables. Dissecting these sources is central for understanding the functional roles of movement-related signals. We suggest a functional classification of the possible sources, aimed at facilitating cross-species comparative approaches to studying the neural mechanisms of vision during natural behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100673">New soft tissue data of pterosaur tail vane reveals sophisticated, dynamic tensioning usage and expands its evolutionary origins</a></h4>

              
                Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87369">A large-scale proteomics resource of circulating extracellular vesicles for biomarker discovery in pancreatic cancer</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of all common tumors. Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase survival rates and better assessment of metastatic disease could improve patient care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to diagnose this deadly malignancy. Analyzing circulating extracellular vesicles (cEVs) using ‘liquid biopsies’ offers an attractive approach to diagnose and monitor disease status. However, it is important to differentiate EV-associated proteins enriched in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). To meet this need, we combined the novel EVtrap method for highly efficient isolation of EVs from plasma and conducted proteomics analysis of samples from 124 individuals, including patients with PDAC, benign pancreatic diseases and controls. On average, 912 EV proteins were identified per 100 µL of plasma. EVs containing high levels of PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, and RUVBL2 were associated with PDAC compared to the benign diseases in both discovery and validation cohorts. EVs with PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR were associated with metastasis, and those with CRP, RALB, and CD55 correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Finally, we validated a seven EV protein PDAC signature against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC. To our knowledge, our study represents the largest proteomics profiling of circulating EVs ever conducted in pancreatic cancer and provides a valuable open-source atlas to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalogue of novel cEVs that may assist in the development of biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with PDAC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97709">An integrated machine learning approach delineates an entropic expansion mechanism for the binding of a small molecule to α-synuclein</a></h4>

              
                The mis-folding and aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) such as α-synuclein (αS) underlie the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. However, targeting αS with small molecules faces challenges due to the lack of defined ligand-binding pockets in its disordered structure. Here, we implement a deep artificial neural network-based machine learning approach, which is able to statistically distinguish the fuzzy ensemble of conformational substates of αS in neat water from those in aqueous fasudil (small molecule of interest) solution. In particular, the presence of fasudil in the solvent either modulates pre-existing states of αS or gives rise to new conformational states of αS, akin to an ensemble-expansion mechanism. The ensembles display strong conformation-dependence in residue-wise interaction with the small molecule. A thermodynamic analysis indicates that small-molecule modulates the structural repertoire of αS by tuning protein backbone entropy, however entropy of the water remains unperturbed. Together, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between small molecules and IDPs, offering insights into entropic modulation and ensemble expansion as key biophysical mechanisms driving potential therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103973">Drosulfakinin signaling encodes early-life memory for adaptive social plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <i>Drosophila</i> establishes social clusters in groups, yet the underlying principles remain poorly understood. Here we performed a systemic analysis of social network behavior (SNB) that quantifies individual social distance (SD) in a group over time. The SNB assessment in 175 inbred strains from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel showed a tight association of short SD with long developmental time, low food intake, and hypoactivity. The developmental inferiority in short-SD individuals was compensated by their group culturing. By contrast, developmental isolation silenced the beneficial effects of social interactions in adults and blunted the plasticity of SNB under physiological challenges. Transcriptome analyses revealed genetic diversity for SD traits, whereas social isolation reprogrammed select genetic pathways, regardless of SD phenotypes. In particular, social deprivation suppressed the expression of the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (<i>Dsk</i>) in three pairs of adult brain neurons. Male-specific DSK signaling to Cholecystokinin-like receptor 17D1 mediated the SNB plasticity. In fact, transgenic manipulations of the DSK neuron activity were sufficient to imitate the state of social experience. Given the functional conservation of mammalian <i>Dsk</i> homologs, we propose that animals may have evolved a dedicated neural mechanism to encode early-life experience and transform group properties adaptively.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93125">Salmonella-induced SIRT1 and SIRT3 are crucial for maintaining the metabolic switch in bacteria and host for successful pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Sirtuins are the major players in host immunometabolic regulation. However, the role of sirtuins in the modulation of the immune metabolism pertaining to salmonellosis is largely unknown. Here, our investigation focussed on the role of two important sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT3, shedding light on their impact on intracellular <i>Salmonella</i>’s metabolic switch and pathogenesis establishment. Our study indicated the ability of the live <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium to differentially regulate the levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 for maintaining the high glycolytic metabolism and low fatty acid metabolism in <i>Salmonella</i>. Perturbing SIRT1 or SIRT3 through knockdown or inhibition resulted in a remarkable shift in the host metabolism to low fatty acid oxidation and high glycolysis. This switch led to decreased proliferation of <i>Salmonella</i> in the macrophages. Further, <i>Salmonella</i>-induced higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 led to a skewed polarization state of the macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 state toward an immunosuppressive M2, making it more conducive for the intracellular life of <i>Salmonella</i>. Alongside, governing immunological functions by modulating p65 NF-κB acetylation, SIRT1, and SIRT3 also skew <i>Salmonella-</i>induced host metabolic switch by regulating the acetylation status of HIF-1α and PDHA1. Interestingly, though knockdown of SIRT1/3 attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> proliferation in macrophages, in in vivo mice model of infection, inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1/3 led to more dissemination and higher organ burden, which can be attributed to enhanced ROS and IL-6 production. Our study hence reports for the first time that <i>Salmonella</i> modulates SIRT1/3 levels to maintain its own metabolism for successful pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104068">Rejuvenating aged osteoprogenitors for bone repair</a></h4>

              
                Aging is marked by a decline in tissue regeneration, posing significant challenges to an increasingly older population. Here, we investigate age-related impairments in calvarial bone healing and introduce a novel two-part rejuvenation strategy to restore youthful repair. We demonstrate that aging negatively impacts the calvarial bone structure and its osteogenic tissues, diminishing osteoprogenitor number and function and severely impairing bone formation. Notably, increasing osteogenic cell numbers locally fails to rescue repair in aged mice, identifying the presence of intrinsic cellular deficits. Our strategy combines Wnt-mediated osteoprogenitor expansion with intermittent fasting, which leads to a striking restoration of youthful levels of bone healing. We find that intermittent fasting improves osteoprogenitor function, benefits that can be recapitulated by modulating NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent pathways or the gut microbiota, underscoring the multifaceted nature of this intervention. Mechanistically, we identify mitochondrial dysfunction as a key component in age-related decline in osteoprogenitor function and show that both cyclical nutrient deprivation and Nicotinamide mononucleotide rejuvenate mitochondrial health, enhancing osteogenesis. These findings offer a promising therapeutic avenue for restoring youthful bone repair in aged individuals, with potential implications for rejuvenating other tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92418">Conformational dynamics of a nicotinic receptor neurotransmitter site</a></h4>

              
                Agonists enhance receptor activity by providing net-favorable binding energy to active over resting conformations, with efficiency (η) linking binding energy to gating. Previously, we showed that in nicotinic receptors, η-values are grouped into five structural pairs, correlating efficacy and affinity within each class, uniting binding with allosteric activation (Indurthi and Auerbach, 2023). Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the low-to-high affinity transition (L→H) at the Torpedo α−δ nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmitter site. Using four agonists spanning three η-classes, the simulations reveal the structural basis of the L→H transition where: the agonist pivots around its cationic center (‘flip’), loop C undergoes staged downward displacement (‘flop’), and a compact, stable high-affinity pocket forms (‘fix’). The η derived from binding energies calculated in silico matched exact values measured experimentally in vitro. Intermediate states of the orthosteric site during receptor activation are apparent only in simulations, but could potentially be observed experimentally via time-resolved structural studies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92718">The physiological landscape and specificity of antibody repertoires are consolidated by multiple immunizations</a></h4>

              
                Diverse antibody repertoires spanning multiple lymphoid organs (i.e., bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes) form the foundation of protective humoral immunity. Changes in their composition across lymphoid organs are a consequence of B-cell selection and migration events leading to a highly dynamic and unique physiological landscape of antibody repertoires upon antigenic challenge (e.g., vaccination). However, to what extent B cells encoding identical or similar antibody sequences (clones) are distributed across multiple lymphoid organs and how this is shaped by the strength of a humoral response remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an in-depth systems analysis of antibody repertoires across multiple distinct lymphoid organs of immunized mice and discovered that organ-specific antibody repertoire features (i.e., germline V-gene usage and clonal expansion profiles) equilibrated upon a strong humoral response (multiple immunizations and high serum titers). This resulted in a surprisingly high degree of repertoire consolidation, characterized by highly connected and overlapping B-cell clones across multiple lymphoid organs. Finally, we revealed distinct physiological axes indicating clonal migrations and showed that antibody repertoire consolidation directly correlated with antigen specificity. Our study uncovered how a strong humoral response resulted in a more uniform but redundant physiological landscape of antibody repertoires, indicating that increases in antibody serum titers were a result of synergistic contributions from antigen-specific B-cell clones distributed across multiple lymphoid organs. Our findings provide valuable insights for the assessment and design of vaccine strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92493">Antimicrobial activity of iron-depriving pyoverdines against human opportunistic pathogens</a></h4>

              
                The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected <i>Galleria mellonella</i> host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.

">Mechanisms for plastic landmark anchoring in zebrafish compass neurons</a></h4>

              
                Vision is a sensory modality particularly important for navigation, as it can inform animals of their current heading (i.e. visual landmarks) as well as its changes (i.e. optic flow). It has been shown that head direction (HD) neurons in various species incorporate the visual cues into their heading estimates. However, circuit mechanisms underlying this process remain still elusive in vertebrates. Here, we asked if and how the recently identified HD cells in the larval zebrafish - one of the smallest vertebrate models - incorporate visual information. By combining two-photon microscopy with a panoramic virtual reality setup, we demonstrate that the zebrafish HD cells can reliably track the orientation of multiple visual scenes, exploiting both landmark and optic flow cues. The mapping between landmark cues and the heading estimates is idiosyncratic across fish, and experience-dependent. Furthermore, we show that the landmark tracking requires the lateralized projection from the habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), where the HD neuron processes innervate. The physiological and morphological parallels suggest that a Hebbian mechanism similar to the fly ring neuron is at work in the habenula axons. Overall, the observations that the hindbrain HD cells of the larval zebrafish lacking an elaborate visual telencephalon shed new light on the evolution of the navigation circuitry in vertebrates.

">Comparative mapping of single-cell transcriptomic landscapes in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease (PD) represent a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Here, we performed the first direct comparison of their transcriptomic landscapes. METHODS: We profiled the whole transcriptomes of NDD cortical tissue by snRNA-seq. We used computational analyses to identify common and distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological pathways, vulnerable and disease-driver cell subtypes, and alteration in cell-to-cell interactions. RESULTS: The same vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtype was depleted in both AD and DLB. Potentially disease-driving neuronal cell subtypes were present in both PD and DLB. Cell-cell communication was predicted to be increased in AD but decreased in DLB and PD. DEGs were most commonly shared across NDDs within inhibitory neuron subtypes. Overall, we observed the greatest transcriptomic divergence between AD and PD, while DLB exhibited an intermediate transcriptomic signature. DISCUSSION: These results help explain the clinicopathological spectrum of this group of NDDs and provide unique insights into the shared and distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NDDs.

">Synaptic facilitation enhances the reliability and precision of high frequency neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                The small and tortuous volume of synaptic clefts limits the diffusion of Ca2+ ions during high frequency spiking. Extracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]o) of 0.8 mM or lower have been measured or calculated for different synapses. Here, we recorded evoked postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) and action potentials (AP) from young adult male and female mouse auditory brainstem principal neurons to investigate the relationship between neurotransmission reliability, stimulation frequency and [Ca2+]o. In 0.8 mM [Ca2+]o, we observed AP failures during afferent fiber stimulation at 100 Hz. Surprisingly, AP failures, EPSP-AP latency and jitter were all greatly reduced when stimulation frequency was increased to 500 Hz. Analysis of the EPSP/AP waveform revealed marked facilitation at 500 Hz that was not present at 100 Hz. Raising [Ca2+]o to 1.2 mM or 2.0 mM reduced or eliminated facilitation and, in these conditions, stimulation at 500 Hz increased the number of AP failures. In 0.8 mM [Ca2+]o, afferent fiber stimulation over a broad range of frequencies from 10-1000 Hz produced three different types of spiking responses: Type I cells exhibited band-pass filtering, with best response at approximately 500 Hz, Type II cells exhibited low-pass filtering above 600 Hz, and Type III cells exhibited shallow band-pass filtering centered at approximately 300 Hz. To predict AP success or failure, we built a model based on three factors: size of the EPSP, membrane potential immediately prior to the synaptic event and the number of preceding failures. We conclude that synaptic facilitation can contribute positively to the maintenance of reliable and precise high frequency neurotransmission in the auditory brainstem.

">Reanalysis of metabolomics data reveals that microbiota transfer therapy modulates important fecal and plasma metabolite profiles in children with autism spectrum disorders</a></h4>

              
                While Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed through behavioral symptoms and psychometric evaluations, it has also been associated with distinct metabolomic patterns. A previous clinical trial of Microbiome Transfer Therapy (MTT) in children with ASD and gastrointestinal (GI) issues revealed significant differences in plasma metabolomics between children with ASD and their typically developing (TD) counterparts, which diminished after MTT. The objective of this study was to reanalyze the plasma and fecal samples using updated metabolomics libraries at Metabolon, applying a comprehensive panel of statistical methods. This approach aimed to provide deeper insights into ASD-related metabolic differences and the impact of MTT. The reanalysis identified more statistically significant metabolites and highlighted specific metabolites whose relative intensities differed between the ASD and TD groups, as well as metabolites with significant changes in intensity post-MTT. Several plasma metabolites, including sarcosine, iminodiacetate, caproate, and caprylate, initially showed significant differences between the ASD and TD groups but shifted to resemble TD levels after MTT treatment. In fecal samples, p-cresol sulfate and sphingolipids emerged as metabolites with altered intensities following MTT treatment. Multivariate Fishers Discriminant Analysis (FDA) with leave-one-out cross-validation revealed that a set of metabolites, including p-cresol sulfate, hydroxyproline, and caprylate, could robustly classify the ASD and TD cohorts pre-treatment. However, after treatment, the same FDA model could not distinguish the two groups, as the FDA scores became similar to those of the TD cohort.

">A three-dimensional histological cell atlas of the developing human brain</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is believed to contain a full complement of neurons by the time of birth together with a substantial amount of the connectivity architecture, even though a significant amount of growth occurs postnatally. The developmental process leading to this outcome is not well understood in humans in comparison with model organisms. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies give three-dimensional coverage but not cellular resolution. In contrast, sparsely sampled histological or spatial omics analyses have provided cellular resolution but not dense whole brain coverage. To address the unmet need to provide a quantitative spatiotemporal map of developing human brain at cellular resolution, we leveraged tape-transfer assisted serial section histology to obtain contiguous histological series and unbiased imaging with dense coverage. Interleaved 20 thick Nissl and H&E series and MRI volumes are co-registered into multimodal reference volumes with 60 isotropic resolution, together with atlas annotations and a stereotactic coordinate system based on skull landmarks. The histological atlas volumes have significantly more contrast and texture than the MRI volumes. We computationally detect cells brain-wide to obtain quantitative characterization of the cytoarchitecture of the developing brain at 13-14 and 20-21 gestational weeks, providing the first comprehensive regional cell counts and characterizing the differential growth of the different brain compartments. Morphological characteristics permit segmentation of cell types from histology. We detected and quantified brain-wide distribution of mitotic figures representing dividing cells, providing an unprecedented spatiotemporal atlas of proliferative dynamics in the developing human brain. Further, we characterized the abundance and distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells, a transient cell population that plays essential roles in organizing glutamatergic cortical neurons into layers. Together, our study provides an unprecedented quantitative window into the developing human brain and the reference volumes and coordinate space should be useful for integrating spatial omics data sets with dense histological context.

">Naturalistic language comprehension engages a cascade of widespread brain networks in the one second following comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension (LC) is a cornerstone of human cognition, enabling the extraction of meaning from written and spoken communication with remarkable efficiency. Decades of neuroimaging research have identified the brain networks associated with LC, but limitations in spatial and temporal resolution have hindered a comprehensive characterization of the whole-brain (millimeter scale), real-time (millisecond precision) dynamics underlying this process. To overcome these constraints, we applied a fusion of multimodal brain imaging techniques (fMRI and EEG) in healthy adults (n = 30) to map the spatiotemporal progression of neural network engagement during LC in the one second following comprehension. Our findings reveal a cascade of brain network activations, beginning with the occipitotemporal perceptual word processing network (250 ms), followed by the temporoparietal semantic retrieval network (400 ms), the posterior default mode inferential network (500 ms), the frontotemporal semantic integration network (600 ms), and finally, a distributed goal-directed comprehension network (700 ms). Crucially, inferential processing emerged as a "hinge point," linking early word processing to later higher-order networks. Efficient LC was associated with greater mediation by this inferential network and reduced reliance on top-down semantic integration. These findings provide evidence that naturalistic LC relies on rapid, dynamic interactions across widespread brain networks, with individual differences in LC reflecting specific subnetwork interactions. This work offers a framework for investigating the temporal evolution of distributed brain network dynamics in complex cognition across domains and clinical populations.

	<p>To investigate the effects of one-week maternal separation (MS) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in adolescent and adulthood as well as adult hippocampal metabolomics simultaneously in offspring female and male rats. In the MS group, newborn SD rats were separated from their mothers for 3 h per day from postnatal days (PND) 2 to 8. The open field test (OFT), elevated plus mazes (EPM), novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and forced swimming test (FST) were conducted during adolescence and adulthood. Serum corticosterone, mRNA expression of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines, and hippocampal untargeted metabolomics of offspring adult rats were examined using an assay kit, qRT-PCR, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Both MS female and male rats showed similar behaviors in OFT, EPM, NSFT, and SPT, except for the latency to feeding during adolescence and the open arm entries during adulthood, showed statistical significance only in MS female rats. Serum corticosterone and hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; were significantly elevated in both female and male rats, and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; were significantly increased only in female rats. In hippocampal metabolism, the identification of differential metabolites displayed 53 and 37 in female rats and male rats, respectively (with 35 common metabolites), which were involved in 33 and 30 metabolic pathways with 28 common pathways. One-week MS induced sex-specific anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in female and male offspring rats during adolescence and adulthood, as well as sex-differentiated characteristics in the hippocampus inflammatory cytokines and metabolomics of adult MS rats. From the experimental data, the effects of MS on the female offspring rats were more severe than those of the male offspring rats.</p>

	<p>Background: Amphetamines increase dopamine levels in mid-brain regions which, in turn, impact top-down executive function. Repeated exposure is linked to substance use disorders. Nonetheless, amphetamines are used to manage attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating-related disorders. In ADHD, amphetamines upregulate a system characterised by low dopaminergic tone, assisting to improve executive function. A similar process might be at play with eating disorders; however, the effect of amphetamine treatment on executive function in this case has not been thoroughly considered. Methods: Participants (N = 52, Mage = 47.06, SD = 12.29) with a body mass index of 25&amp;amp;ndash;60 were randomised to treatment (6-week dexamphetamine titration) or control (placebo) groups. They completed an executive function measure&amp;amp;mdash;Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS-SF)&amp;amp;mdash;and response inhibition task&amp;amp;mdash;Stop-Signal Task (SST)&amp;amp;mdash;at Baseline, throughout titration, at Maintenance, and at Follow-up. Mixed effects models examined whether BDEFS-SF score or the SST variable, stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), changed across sessions as a function of treatment. Results: There was no effect of group (p = 0.440), but an effect of session (p = 0.024) on BDEFS-SF, with scores at Time 2 (p = 0.011, 95% CI [0.47, 3.49]) and Maintenance (p = 0.022, 95% CI [&amp;amp;minus;4.89, &amp;amp;minus;0.39]), respectively, higher and lower than other timepoints. There was no group by session interaction (p = 0.659). R2 (conditional) = 0.74; ICC = 0.73. There was an effect of group (p = 0.039) and session (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) on SSRT, but no interaction (p = 0.707). Baseline SSRT was significantly longer than the mean of all subsequent timepoints (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI [16.29, 33.84]). R2 (conditional) = 0.47; ICC = 0.39. Conclusions: There was no discernible impact of amphetamine treatment for obesity on executive function. Our results suggest some variation related to sample size and/or practice effects. Thus, while treatment appears unlikely to render individuals susceptible to substance use disorders, parallels with ADHD might be overstated.</p>

	<p>Antecedents: Executive functions (EFs) are the basis for establishing a goal and working towards that goal by coordinating thoughts and actions. EFs are fundamental to several aspects of daily life, specifically for academic performance. Aim: To analyse and compare the development of EFs in the transition period between the first and second cycles of early childhood education. Methodology: Non-experimental methodology, ex post facto design, descriptive, cross-sectional evolution study. Participants: Preschoolers of different educational levels (first and second cycle of infant education). In this study, the participants were evaluated by different informants: 54.42% by parents and 45.58% by teachers. In relation to gender, 52.65% were male and 47.35% were female. In relation to age, 37.54% had a range of 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 years and 62.46% had a range of 4&amp;amp;ndash;5 years. Measurement: The instrumental development of EFs was evaluated using BRIEF-P by key informants. Results: Preschoolers in the first cycle showed significantly higher scores than preschoolers in the second cycle in BRIEP-P. Conclusions: The development of EFs is key in these first key moments, having a special impact on later development and academic performance. It is necessary to work on EFs from the first cycle of early childhood education, considering the evolutionary development of EFs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Accurately classifying Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is essential for the effective operation of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), which is needed for reliable neurorehabilitation applications. However, many factors in the processing pipeline can influence classification performance. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of different processing steps on classification accuracy in EEG-based BCI systems. Methods: This study explores the impact of various processing techniques and stages, including the FASTER algorithm for artifact rejection (AR), frequency filtering, transfer learning, and cropped training. The Physionet dataset, consisting of four motor imagery classes, was used as input due to its relatively large number of subjects. The raw EEG was tested with EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet. To examine the impact of adding a spatial dimension to the input data, we also used the Multi-branch Conv3D Net and developed two new models, Conv2D Net and Conv3D Net. Results: Our analysis showed that classification accuracy can be affected by many factors at every stage. Applying the AR method, for instance, can either enhance or degrade classification performance, depending on the subject and the specific network architecture. Transfer learning was effective in improving the performance of all networks for both raw and artifact-rejected data. However, the improvement in classification accuracy for artifact-rejected data was less pronounced compared to unfiltered data, resulting in reduced precision. For instance, the best classifier achieved 46.1% accuracy on unfiltered data, which increased to 63.5% with transfer learning. In the filtered case, accuracy rose from 45.5% to only 55.9% when transfer learning was applied. An unexpected outcome regarding frequency filtering was observed: networks demonstrated better classification performance when focusing on lower-frequency components. Higher frequency ranges were more discriminative for EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet, but only when cropped training was applied. Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the complex interaction between processing techniques and neural network performance, emphasizing the necessity for customized processing approaches tailored to specific subjects and network architectures.</p>

                Background Quality Education is one of the primary requirements for the best survival. Pursuing higher education in a highly reputed institutions makes much difference in shaping the career of the individual. As many ranking and accreditation boards for higher education institutions like NAAC is prevalent, World ranking distinguishes institution reputation globally. The QS World University Ranking is a vital gauge for learners, educators, and institutions all over the world, allowing them to analyze and compare the quality and reputation of higher education. Predicting these rankings is difficult due to data availability concerns and QS’s frequent methodology revisions. Subjectivity and narrow criteria in rankings hamper the assessment of university greatness even more. Machine learning, data scraping, model adaptability, algorithm reversal, and short-term predictions are some existing ways of dealing with these difficulties. In this research, a prediction model for assessing institution performance in the QS World institution Rankings is designed using hybrid machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques. Two algorithms surpass others in forecasting ranks, according to the analysis. These hybrid models improves prediction accuracy of QS world rankings by integrating data analysis with model optimization using particle swarm optimization and Tabu search method.

                Background Pedagogical best practices play a pivotal role in ensuring the academic success of students within the higher education landscape. This study aims to systematically synthesize innovative pedagogical best practices within the university context. Methods We conducted a thorough systematic review using the rigorous PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. Our review involved comprehensive searches of scientific databases, including Eric, Scopus, and Proquest, covering both Spanish and English publications. We strategically employed Boolean operators like AND and OR to create a robust search equation. Our primary research question guiding this investigation was: “What innovative pedagogical practices have been developed in university settings to improve teaching and learning effectiveness?” This central question led us to delve deeply into the strategies utilized, pedagogical approaches adopted, and the noticeable impact achieved after their implementation. Additionally, we carefully established stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. Results A total of 25 scholarly articles that met the pre-established criteria were meticulously identified and included in this systematic review. The results were thoughtfully categorized into three distinct teaching strategies: the first emphasizing student-centered approaches, the second showcasing the integration of educational technology, and the third highlighting evaluation and feedback methodologies. Conclusions This systematic exploration of pedagogical best practices underscores their paramount importance in driving continuous improvement in teacher training and fostering innovation within the educational arena. Such practices not only create an engaging and effective learning environment but also set the stage for ongoing advancements in the teaching and learning processes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1528/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Rare Bilateral Double Profunda Femoris Artery Variation: Clinical Implications and Considerations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The profunda femoris artery (PFA) is the largest branch of the femoral artery supplying the thigh. The study reports a rare occurrence of bilateral double profunda artery in a male cadaver, aiming to inform surgeons of such variations to avoid complications during surgical interventions. Methods This study was conducted during routine dissections using 5-10% formalin-fixed lower limbs of a male cadaver at the Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, UAE Results In the right lower limb, two profunda femoris artery (PFA) branches arise from the common femoral artery (CFA) 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, one laterally and one posteromedially. The medial (MCFA) and lateral circumflex (LCFA) arteries branch from these PFAs respectively. The femoral nerve is anterior to the lateral PFA and LCFA and lateral to the posteromedial PFA. The obturator nerve runs posterior to the posteromedial PFA. In the left lower limb, two PFAs originate from the CFA, 2.5 and 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, lateral and posterior to the CFA, respectively. The LCFA stems from the upper PFA, while the medial MCFA arises from the CFA. The femoral nerve lies anterior to both the PFA and LCFA. The obturator nerve is posterior to the MCFA. The femoral vein crosses over the MCFA and the lower posterior PFA, distal to the MCFA origin. Conclusion This report enriches understanding of PFA anatomy and its variations, emphasizing the importance of tailored surgical approaches to minimize risks and ensure procedure success.

                Background Microbes living at extremes evolve unique survival strategies to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. Among these strategies is their distinctive metabolic potential and ability to produce specialized metabolites enabling them to compete for limited resources and defend against predators. These metabolites have significant potential in pharmaceutical and industrial applications, particularly in the development of drugs and biochemicals. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the culturable fungal communities associated with four desert plants and their surrounding soils in the Arabian Peninsula desert to identify their bioactive properties. Methods A total of 12 distinct fungal species were isolated from the plants and soils. Each plant hosted a unique set of fungi, demonstrating the diversity of desert-adapted fungal communities. Biological activities of the fungal extracts were evaluated through various assays, including antimicrobial, antifungal, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. Results Panicum turgidum harbors the most diverse fungal community, dominated by genera such as Mucor, Aspergillus, Colletotrichum, Alternaria, and Chaetomium. Aspergillus species comprise 33% of the total isolates, followed by Fusarium at 16%. All extracts exhibit diverse activities, with Aspergillus species demonstrating the highest antioxidant activities and total phenolic and flavonoid content. Fungi from P. turgidum, particularly Mucor sp., Aspergillus sp., and Curvularia sp., display potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while Mucor sp., Chaetomium sp., and Curvularia sp. exhibit moderate inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of exploring extremophilic microorganisms, such as those found in desert ecosystems, as they offer a wealth of compounds that could address current challenges in drug discovery and biotechnology.

Social insects, such as ants and bees, are known for their highly efficient and structured colonies. Division of labour, in which each member of the colony has a specific role, is considered to be one major driver of their ecological success. However, empirical evidence has accumulated showing that many workers, sometimes more than half, remain idle in insect societies. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these patterns, but none provides a consensual explanation. Task specialisation exploits inter-individual variations, which are mainly influenced by genetic factors beyond the control of the colony. As a result, individuals may also differ in the efficiency with which they perform tasks. In this context, we aimed to test the hypothesis that colonies generate a large number of individuals in order to recruit only the most efficient to perform tasks, at the cost of producing and maintaining a fraction of workers that remain inactive. We developed a model to explore the conditions under which variations in the scaling of workers’ production and maintenance costs, along with activity costs, allow colonies to sustain a fraction of inactive workers. We sampled individual performances according to different random distributions in order to simulate the variability associated with worker efficiency. Our results show that the inactivity of part of the workforce can be beneficial for a wide range of parameters if it allows colonies to select the most efficient workers. In decentralised systems such as insect societies, we suggest that inactivity is a by-product of the random processes associated with the generation of individuals whose performance levels cannot be controlled.

                <p>by Masami Iwamoto, Satoko Hirabayashi, Noritoshi Atsumi</p>

Voluntary breathing (VB), short–term exercise (STE), and mental stress (MS) can modulate breathing rate (BR), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP), thereby affecting human physical and mental state. While existing experimental studies have explored the relationship between VB, STE, or MS and BR, HR, and BP changes, their findings remain fragmented due to individual differences and challenges in simultaneous, BR, HR, and BP measurements. We propose a computational approach for in–silico simultaneous measurements of the physiological values by comprehensive prediction of the respiratory and circulatory system responses to VB, STE, or MS. Our integrated model combines a respiratory system with a circulatory model, leveraging actor–critic reinforcement learning to control respiratory muscles. We introduce specific parameters to account for involuntary or VB and hyperventilation induced by STE. We modeled mental stress as an electrical input to the amygdala based on prior studies indicating that stress leads to amygdala hyperactivity. Our predictions for breathing rate (BR), tidal volume, minute ventilation, HR, and BP are validated against literature data obtained during various conditions, including different VB patterns (ranging from 6 to 14 bpm), active or passive knee flexion STE, and MS load. The model demonstrates good agreement with experimental results and highlights its ability to explore the mechanism of individual differences. Our model predicts heart rate variability (HRV) indices of total power spectral density and the ellipse area of Poincaré plot. Notably, slow deep breathing at a BR of 6 bpm increases HRV indices, promoting relaxation and cognitive performance. Conversely, MS elevates BP but reduces HRV indices, indicating an unstable and risky state for mental and physical health. Overall, our proposed computational approach provides simultaneous and reasonable predictions of various physiological values, accounting for individual variations through specific parameters.

                <p>by Katherine Levandosky, Calina Copos</p>

Symmetry breaking, which is ubiquitous in biological cells, functionally enables directed cell movement and organized embryogenesis. Prior to movement, cells break symmetry to form a well-defined cell front and rear in a process called polarization. In developing and regenerating tissues, collective cell movement requires the coordination of the polarity of the migration machineries of neighboring cells. Though several works shed light on the molecular basis of polarity, fewer studies have focused on the regulation across the cell-cell junction required for collective polarization, thus limiting our ability to connect tissue-level dynamics to subcellular interactions. Here, we investigated how polarity signals are communicated from one cell to its neighbor to ensure coordinated front-to-rear symmetry breaking with the same orientation across the group. In a theoretical setting, we systematically searched a variety of intercellular interactions and identified that co-alignment arrangement of the polarity axes in groups of two and four cells can only be achieved with strong asymmetric regulation of Rho GTPases or enhanced assembly of complementary F-actin structures across the junction. Our results held if we further assumed the presence of an external stimulus, intrinsic cell-to-cell variability, or larger groups. The results underline the potential of using quantitative models to probe the molecular interactions required for macroscopic biological phenomena. Lastly, we posit that asymmetric regulation is achieved through junction proteins and predict that in the absence of cytoplasmic tails of such linker proteins, the likeliness of doublet co-polarity is greatly diminished.

                <p>by Maurice A. Itoe, W. Robert Shaw, Iryna Stryapunina, Charles Vidoudez, Duo Peng, Esrah W. Du, Tasneem A. Rinvee, Naresh Singh, Yan Yan, Oleksandr Hulai, Kate E. Thornburg, Flaminia Catteruccia</p>

Lipid metabolism is an essential component in reproductive physiology. While lipid mobilization has been implicated in the growth of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria parasites in their <i>Anopheles</i> vectors, the role of this process in the reproductive biology of these mosquitoes remains elusive. Here, we show that impairing lipolysis in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, the major malaria vectors, leads to embryonic lethality. Embryos derived from females in which we silenced the triglyceride lipase Ag<i>TL2</i> or the lipid storage droplet Ag<i>LSD1</i> develop normally during early embryogenesis but fail to hatch due to severely impaired metabolism. Embryonic lethality is efficiently recapitulated by exposing adult females to broad-spectrum lipase inhibitors prior to blood feeding, unveiling lipolysis as a potential target for inducing mosquito sterility. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the importance of maternal lipid mobilization in embryonic health that may inform studies on human reproduction.

                <p>by Matthew L. Lawton, Melissa M. Inge, Benjamin C. Blum, Erika L. Smith-Mahoney, Dante Bolzan, Weiwei Lin, Christina McConney, Jacob Porter, Jarrod Moore, Ahmed Youssef, Yashasvi Tharani, Xaralabos Varelas, Gerald V. Denis, Wilson W.

Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.

                <p>by Scott W. Emmons</p>

Despite decades of research on the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nervous system based on an anatomical description of synaptic connectivity, the circuits underlying behavior remain incompletely described and the functions of many neurons are still unknown. Updated and more complete chemical and gap junction connectomes of both adult sexes covering the entire animal including the muscle end organ have become available recently. Here, these are analyzed to gain insight into the overall structure of the connectivity network and to suggest functions of individual neuron classes. Modularity analysis divides the connectome graph into 10 communities that can be correlated with broad categories of behavior. A significant role of the body wall musculature end organ is emphasized as both a site of significant information convergence and as a source of sensory input in a feedback loop. Convergence of pathways for multisensory integration occurs throughout the network—most interneurons have similar indegrees and outdegrees and hence disperse information as much as they aggregate it. New insights include description of a set of high degree interneurons connected by many gap junctions running through the ventral cord that may represent a previously unrecognized locus of information processing. There is an apparent mechanosensory and proprioceptive field covering the entire body formed by connectivity of the many mechanosensory neurons of multiple types to 2 interneurons with output connections across the nervous system. Several additional significant, previously unrecognized circuits and pathways are uncovered, some involving unstudied neurons. The insights are valuable for guiding theoretical investigation of network properties as well as experimental studies of the functions of individual neurons, groups of neurons, and circuits.

Postingestive nutrient stimulation conditions food preferences through striatal dopamine and may be associated with blunted brain responses in obesity. In a cross-sectional study, we tested flavor-nutrient conditioning (FNC) with maltodextrin-enriched yogurt, with maltodextrin previously optimized for concentration and dextrose equivalents (<i>n</i> = 57), and to mask texture cues (<i>n</i> = 102). After conditioning, healthy volunteers (<i>n</i> = 52) increased preference for maltodextrin-paired (+102 kcal, CS<sup>+</sup>), relative to control (+1.8 kcal, CS<sup>-</sup>) flavors, as assessed according to intake, but not pleasantness. In a clinical study (<i>n</i> = 61), behavioral conditioning without effects on pleasantness was confirmed across pre-bariatric candidates with obesity, weight-stable post-surgery patients, and healthy controls, without significant differences between groups. Striatal dopamine D2-like receptor (DD2lR) availability, assessed with [<sup>123</sup>I]IBZM SPECT, was reduced in the obesity group and strongly correlated with conditioning strength and a measure of restrained eating in patients with gastric bypass. These results show that postingestive nutrient stimulation influences human food choices through behavioral reinforcement, and is conserved in obesity and after bariatric surgery.

Biogerontology research aims to explore the molecular basis of aging and discover new anti-aging therapeutic compounds or formulations to combat the detrimental effects of aging and promote a healthy life span. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been, and continues to be, an indispensable model organism in the field of biomedical research for discovering the molecular basis of aging S. cerevisiae has preserved nutritional signaling pathways (such as the target of rapamycin (TOR)-Sch9 and the Ras-AC-PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) pathways, and shows two distinct aging paradigms chronological life span (CLS) and replicative life span (RLS). This review explores the anti-aging properties of natural products, predominantly derived from plants, and phytoextracts using S. cerevisiae as a model organism.

                Background Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme that metabolizes commonly used drugs, such as tramadol hydrochloride (a widely used opioid analgesic). Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 have been shown to influence the pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs. This study aimed to screen 63 postoperative patients (wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and CYP2D6 multiplication) of Minangkabau ethnicity in West Sumatera, Indonesia, who received tramadol using a modified long PCR method, and to investigate the clinical impact of tramadol on these patients. This study had a retrospective clinical trial registry number NCT06642480. Methods The Reported Long PCR was modified using different DNA polymerases, optimizing annealing, and the number of step PCR to detect wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6. To ensure accurate PCR, the size of the PCR product was monitored: wild-type (5kb), CYP2D6*5 (6kb), and CYP2D6 multiplication genotype (10 kb). The wild-type PCR product was used as the internal control. The method was applied to screen 63 postoperative patients of Minangkabau ethnicity who received tramadol. The clinical impact was investigated and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a chi-square test. Result The Long PCR was successfully modified with a two-step PCR at 68°C °C as the annealing and extension temperatures. The screened genotype patients were dominated by the wild-type, followed by CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6 with percentages of 89%, 6,3%, and 4,7% respectively. A total of 6.3% of CYP2D6*5 cases were classified as heterozygous and predicted as intermediate metabolizers. In addition, sex and age did not affect postoperative tramadol analgesia treatment, whereas weight had a significant impact (p=0.008). Conclusion The percentages of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6 multiplication genotypes were similar to those observed in another Asian population. Based on statistical analysis, tramadol was effective as an analgesic treatment for postoperative Minangkabau ethnicity patients with wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiple CYP2D6 genotypes. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to confirm these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-844/v2?src=rss">Implementation of Chernobyl disaster optimizer based feature selection approach to predict software defects [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Software Defect Prediction (SDP) enables developers to investigate unscrambled faults in the inaugural parts of the software progression mechanism. However, SDP faces the threat of high dimensionality. Feature selection (FS) selects the finest features while carefully discarding others. Several meta-heuristic algorithms, like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Ant Colony Optimization, have been used to develop defect prediction models. However, these models have drawbacks like high cost, local optima trap, lower convergence rate, and higher parameter tuning. This study applies an innovative FS technique (FSCOA) rooted in Chernobyl Disaster Optimizer (CDO) technique. The proposed procedure intends to unwrap the best features for a prediction model while minimizing errors. Methods The proposed FSCOA investigated twelve public NASA software datasets from the PROMISE archive on Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Quantitative Discriminant Analysis classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recommended FSCOA method was correlated with existing FS techniques, like FSDE, FSPSO, FSACO, and FSGA. The statistical merit of the proposed measure was verified using Friedman and Holm tests. Results The experiment indicated that the proposed FSCOA approach bettered the accuracy in majority of the instances and achieved an average rank of 1.75 among other studied FS approaches while applying the Friedman test. Furthermore, the Holm test showed that the p-value was lower than or equivalent to the value of α/(A-i), except for the FSCOA and FSGA and FSCOA and FSACO models. Conclusion The results illustrated the supremacy of the prospective FSCOA procedure over extant FS techniques with higher accuracy in almost all cases due to its advantages like enhanced accuracy, the ability to deal with convoluted, high-magnitude datasets not grounded in local optima, and a faster convergence rate. These advantages empower the suggested FSCOA method to overcome the challenges of the other studied FS techniques.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91596">A genome-wide nucleosome-resolution map of promoter-centered interactions in human cells corroborates the enhancer-promoter looping model</a></h4>

              
                The enhancer-promoter looping model, in which enhancers activate their target genes via physical contact, has long dominated the field of gene regulation. However, the ubiquity of this model has been questioned due to evidence of alternative mechanisms and the lack of its systematic validation, primarily owing to the absence of suitable experimental techniques. In this study, we present a new MNase-based proximity ligation method called MChIP-C, allowing for the measurement of protein-mediated chromatin interactions at single-nucleosome resolution on a genome-wide scale. By applying MChIP-C to study H3K4me3 promoter-centered interactions in K562 cells, we found that it had greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to restriction endonuclease-based C-methods. This allowed us to identify EP300 histone acetyltransferase and the SWI/SNF remodeling complex as potential candidates for establishing and/or maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions. Finally, leveraging data from published CRISPRi screens, we found that most functionally verified enhancers do physically interact with their cognate promoters, supporting the enhancer-promoter looping model.

                We designed novel pre-drug compounds that transform into an active form that covalently modifies particular His residue in the active site, a difficult task to achieve, and applied to carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), a transmembrane protein, highly overexpressed in hypoxic solid tumors, important for cancer cell survival and proliferation because it acidifies tumor microenvironment helping invasion and metastases processes. The designed compounds have several functionalities: (1) primary sulfonamide group recognizing carbonic anhydrases (CA), (2) high-affinity moieties specifically recognizing CAIX among all CA isozymes, and (3) forming a covalent bond with the His64 residue. Such targeted covalent compounds possess both high initial affinity and selectivity for the disease target protein followed by complete irreversible inactivation of the protein via covalent modification. Our designed prodrug candidates bearing moderately active pre-vinylsulfone esters or weakly active carbamates optimized for mild covalent modification activity to avoid toxic non-specific modifications and selectively target CAIX. The lead inhibitors reached 2 pM affinity, the highest among known CAIX inhibitors. The strategy could be used for any disease drug target protein bearing a His residue in the vicinity of the active site.

                The vestibular system is integral to behavior; the loss of peripheral vestibular function leads to disabling consequences, such as blurred vision, dizziness, and unstable posture, severely limiting activities of daily living. Fortunately, the vestibular system’s well-defined peripheral structure and well-understood encoding strategies offer unique opportunities for developing sensory prostheses to restore vestibular function. While these devices show promising results in both animal models and implanted patients, substantial room for improvement remains. Research from an engineering perspective has largely focused on optimizing stimulation protocol to improve outcomes. However, this approach has often been pursued in isolation from research in neuroscience that has enriched our understanding of neural responses at the synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. Accordingly, this review bridges the domains of neuroscience and engineering to consider recent progress and challenges in vestibular prosthesis development. We advocate for interdisciplinary approaches that leverage studies of neural circuits at the population level, especially in light of recent advancement in large-scale recording technology, to identify impediments still to overcome and to develop more naturalistic stimulation strategies. Fully integrating neuroscience and engineering in the context of prosthesis development will help advance the field forward and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89950">Midbrain encodes sound detection behavior without auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Hearing involves analyzing the physical attributes of sounds and integrating the results of this analysis with other sensory, cognitive, and motor variables in order to guide adaptive behavior. The auditory cortex is considered crucial for the integration of acoustic and contextual information and is thought to share the resulting representations with subcortical auditory structures via its vast descending projections. By imaging cellular activity in the corticorecipient shell of the inferior colliculus of mice engaged in a sound detection task, we show that the majority of neurons encode information beyond the physical attributes of the stimulus and that the animals’ behavior can be decoded from the activity of those neurons with a high degree of accuracy. Surprisingly, this was also the case in mice in which auditory cortical input to the midbrain had been removed by bilateral cortical lesions. This illustrates that subcortical auditory structures have access to a wealth of non-acoustic information and can, independently of the auditory cortex, carry much richer neural representations than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88768">Statistical examination of shared loci in neuropsychiatric diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics</a></h4>

              
                Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant ‘local’ genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter.

                The giant striated muscle protein titin integrates into the developing sarcomere to form a stable myofilament system that is extended as myocytes fuse. The logistics underlying myofilament assembly and disassembly have started to emerge with the possibility to follow labeled sarcomere components. Here, we generated the mCherry knock-in at titin’s Z-disk to study skeletal muscle development and remodeling. We find titin’s integration into the sarcomere tightly regulated and its unexpected mobility facilitating a homogeneous distribution of titin after cell fusion – an integral part of syncytium formation and maturation of skeletal muscle. In adult mCherry-titin mice, treatment of muscle injury by implantation of titin-eGFP myoblasts reveals how myocytes integrate, fuse, and contribute to the continuous myofilament system across cell boundaries. Unlike in immature primary cells, titin proteins are retained at the proximal nucleus and do not diffuse across the whole syncytium with implications for future cell-based therapies of skeletal muscle disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99341">Characterization of cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs) across genes, cancer types, and patients</a></h4>

              
                A central goal of cancer genomics is to identify, in each patient, all the cancer-driving mutations. Among them, point mutations are referred to as cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs), which recur in cancers. The companion study shows that the probability of <i>i</i> recurrent hits in <b>n</b> patients would decrease exponentially with <i>i</i>; hence, any mutation with <i>i</i> ≥ 3 hits in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database is a high-probability CDN. This study characterizes the 50–150 CDNs identifiable for each cancer type of TCGA (while anticipating 10 times more undiscovered ones) as follows: (i) CDNs tend to code for amino acids of divergent chemical properties. (ii) At the genic level, far more CDNs (more than fivefold) fall on noncanonical than canonical cancer-driving genes (CDGs). Most undiscovered CDNs are expected to be on unknown CDGs. (iii) CDNs tend to be more widely shared among cancer types than canonical CDGs, mainly because of the higher resolution at the nucleotide than the whole-gene level. (iv) Most important, among the 50–100 coding region mutations carried by a cancer patient, 5–8 CDNs are expected but only 0–2 CDNs have been identified at present. This low level of identification has hampered functional test and gene-targeted therapy. We show that, by expanding the sample size to 10<sup>5</sup>, most CDNs can be identified. Full CDN identification will then facilitate the design of patient-specific targeting against multiple CDN-harboring genes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99340">The theory of massively repeated evolution and full identifications of cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs)</a></h4>

              
                Tumorigenesis, like most complex genetic traits, is driven by the joint actions of many mutations. At the nucleotide level, such mutations are cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs). The full sets of CDNs are necessary, and perhaps even sufficient, for the understanding and treatment of each cancer patient. Currently, only a small fraction of CDNs is known as most mutations accrued in tumors are not drivers. We now develop the theory of CDNs on the basis that cancer evolution is massively repeated in millions of individuals. Hence, any advantageous mutation should recur frequently and, conversely, any mutation that does not is either a passenger or deleterious mutation. In the TCGA cancer database (sample size <b>n</b>=300–1000), point mutations may recur in <i>i</i> out of <b>n</b> patients. This study explores a wide range of mutation characteristics to determine the limit of recurrences (<i>i<sup>*</sup></i>) driven solely by neutral evolution. Since no neutral mutation can reach <i>i<sup>*</sup></i>=3, all mutations recurring at <i>i</i>≥3 are CDNs. The theory shows the feasibility of identifying almost all CDNs if <b>n</b> increases to 100,000 for each cancer type. At present, only &lt;10% of CDNs have been identified. When the full sets of CDNs are identified, the evolutionary mechanism of tumorigenesis in each case can be known and, importantly, gene targeted therapy will be far more effective in treatment and robust against drug resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97543">An improved bacterial single-cell RNA-seq reveals biofilm heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to mammalian cells, bacterial cells lack mRNA polyadenylated tails, presenting a hurdle in isolating mRNA amidst the prevalent rRNA during single-cell RNA-seq. This study introduces a novel method, ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA depletion (RiboD), seamlessly integrated into the PETRI-seq technique, yielding RiboD-PETRI. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By efficiently eliminating rRNA reads and substantially enhancing mRNA detection rates (up to 92%), our method enables precise exploration of bacterial population heterogeneity. Applying RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity, distinctive subpopulations marked by unique genes within biofilms were successfully identified. Notably, PdeI, a marker for the cell-surface attachment subpopulation, was observed to elevate cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, promoting persister cell formation. Thus, we address a persistent challenge in bacterial single-cell RNA-seq regarding rRNA abundance, exemplifying the utility of this method in exploring biofilm heterogeneity. Our method effectively tackles a long-standing issue in bacterial scRNA-seq: the overwhelming abundance of rRNA. This advancement significantly enhances our ability to investigate the intricate heterogeneity within biofilms at unprecedented resolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100449">Control of 3′ splice site selection by the yeast splicing factor Fyv6</a></h4>

              
                Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed in two steps: 5ʹ splice site (SS) cleavage and exon ligation. A number of proteins transiently associate with spliceosomes to specifically impact these steps (first and second step factors). We recently identified Fyv6 (FAM192A in humans) as a second step factor in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>; however, we did not determine how widespread Fyv6’s impact is on the transcriptome. To answer this question, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze changes in splicing. These results show that loss of Fyv6 results in activation of non-consensus, branch point (BP) proximal 3ʹ SS transcriptome-wide. To identify the molecular basis of these observations, we determined a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast product complex spliceosome containing Fyv6 at 2.3 Å. The structure reveals that Fyv6 is the only second step factor that contacts the Prp22 ATPase and that Fyv6 binding is mutually exclusive with that of the first step factor Yju2. We then use this structure to dissect Fyv6 functional domains and interpret results of a genetic screen for <i>fyv6Δ</i> suppressor mutations. The combined transcriptomic, structural, and genetic studies allow us to propose a model in which Yju2/Fyv6 exchange facilitates exon ligation and Fyv6 promotes usage of consensus, BP distal 3ʹ SS.

">Lifespan Normative Modeling of Brain Microstructure</a></h4>

              
                Normative models of brain metrics based on large populations could be extremely valuable for detecting brain abnormalities in patients with a variety of disorders, including degenerative, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, but no such models exist for the brain's white matter (WM) microstructure. Here we present the first large-scale normative model of brain WM microstructure-based on 19 international diffusion MRI datasets covering almost the entire lifespan (totaling N=54,583 individuals; age: 4-91 years). We extracted regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics using a standardized analysis and quality control protocol and used hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) to model the statistical distribution of derived WM metrics as a function of age and sex. We extracted the average lifespan trajectories and corresponding centile curves for each WM region. We illustrate the utility of the method by applying it to detect and visualize profiles of WM microstructural deviations in a variety of contexts: in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome - a neurogenetic condition that markedly increases risk for schizophrenia. The resulting large-scale model provides a common reference to identify disease effects on the brain's microstructure in individuals or groups, and to compare disorders, and discover factors affecting WM abnormalities. The derived normative models are a new resource publicly available to the community, adaptable and extendable to future datasets as the available data expands.

">Where do I go? Decoding temporal neural dynamics of scene processing and visuospatial memory interactions using CNNs</a></h4>

              
                Visual scene perception enables rapid interpretation of the surrounding environment by integrating multiple visual features related to task demands and context, which is essential for goal-directed behavior. In the present work, we investigated the temporal neural dynamics underlying the interaction between the processing of visual features (i.e., bottom-up processes) and contextual knowledge (i.e., top-down processes) during scene perception. We analyzed EEG data from 30 participants performing scene memory and visuospatial memory tasks in which we manipulated the number of navigational affordances available (i.e., the number of open doors) while controlling for similar low-level visual features across tasks. We used convolutional neural networks (CNN) coupled with gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to assess the main channels and time points underlying neural processing for each task. We found that early occipitoparietal activity (50-250 ms post-stimulus) contributed most to the classification of several aspects of visual perception, including scene color, navigational affordances, and spatial memory content. In addition, we showed that the CNN successfully trained to detect affordances during scene perception was unable to detect the same affordances in the spatial memory task after learning, whereas a similarly trained and tested model for detecting wall color was able to generalize across tasks. Taken together, these results reveal an early common window of integration for scene and visuospatial memory information, with a specific and immediate influence of newly acquired spatial knowledge on early neural correlates of scene perception.

">Neural dynamics hierarchy in motor cortex and striatum across naturalistic behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Mammals perform a wide range of movements actuated by diverse patterns of muscle activity. Primary motor cortex (M1) and striatum are implicated in controlling these movements, but how their activity dynamics are organized to accommodate such diversity is poorly understood. We developed a paradigm that enabled us to investigate neural dynamics across diverse motor behaviors in mice. In contrast to existing views, we found neither behavior-specific nor behavior-invariant organization in single-neuron activity, population-level covariation, and muscle activity correlation. Instead, the similarity of activity dynamics between behaviors varied differentially across behavior pairs, forming a hierarchical organization. The same hierarchical organization was shared between M1 and striatum, despite stronger muscle activity correlation in M1 and greater behavior specificity in striatum. Network modeling indicated that striatal activity is sufficient to drive hierarchical dynamics in muscle pattern-generating circuits. These hierarchical dynamics may reflect a tradeoff between behavioral specialization and generalization in motor system function.

">Differential temporal filtering in the fly optic lobe</a></h4>

              
                Visual interneurons come in many different flavors, representing luminance changes at one location as ON or OFF signals with different dynamics, ranging from purely sustained to sharply transient responses. While the functional relevance of this representation for subsequent computations like direction-selective motion detection is well understood, the mechanisms by which these differences in dynamics arise are unclear. Here, I study this question in the fly optic lobe. Taking advantage of the known connectome I simulate a network of five adjacent optical columns each comprising 65 different cell types. Each neuron is modeled as an electrically compact single compartment, conductance-based element that receives input from other neurons within its column and from its neighboring columns according to the intra- and inter-columnar connectivity matrix. The sign of the input is determined according to the known transmitter type of the presynaptic neuron and the receptor on the postsynaptic side. In addition, some of the neurons are given voltage-dependent conductances known from the fly transcriptome. As free parameters, each neuron has an input and an output gain, applied to all its input and output synapses, respectively. The parameters are adjusted such that the spatio-temporal receptive field properties of 13 out of the 65 simulated neurons match the experimentally determined ones as closely as possible. Despite the fact that all neurons have identical leak conductance and membrane capacitance, this procedure leads to a surprisingly good fit to the data, where specific neurons respond transiently while others respond in a sustained way to luminance changes. This fit critically depends on the presence of an H-current in some of the first-order interneurons, i.e., lamina cells L1 and L2: turning off the H-current eliminates the transient response nature of many neurons leaving only sustained responses in all of the examined interneurons. I conclude that the diverse dynamic response behavior of the columnar neurons in the fly optic lobe starts in the lamina and is created by their different intrinsic membrane properties. I predict that eliminating the hyperpolarization-activated current by RNAi should strongly affect the dynamics of many medulla neurons and, consequently, also higher-order functions depending on them like direction-selectivity in T4 and T5 neurons.

">G protein Inactivation as a Mechanism for Addiction Treatment</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in the brain mediates the dysphoric effects of stress, and KOR antagonists may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug addiction, depression, and psychosis. One class of KOR antagonists, the long-acting norBNI-like antagonists, have been suggested to act by causing KOR inactivation through a cJun-kinase mechanism rather than by competitive inhibition. In this study, we screened for other opioid ligands that might produce norBNI-like KOR inactivation and found that nalfurafine (a G-biased KOR agonist) and nalmefene (a KOR partial agonist) also produce long-lasting KOR inactivation. Neither nalfurafine nor nalmefene are completely selective KOR ligands, but KOR inactivation was observed at doses 10-100 fold lower than necessary for mu opioid receptor actions. Daily microdosing with nalfurafine or nalmefene blocked KORs responsible for antinociceptive effects, blocked KORs mediating stress-induced aversion, and mitigated the aversion during acute and protracted withdrawal in fentanyl-dependent mice. Both nalfurafine and nalmefene have long histories of safety and use in humans and could potentially be repurposed for the treatment of dynorphin-mediated stress disorders.

">Dimorphic Neural Network Architecture Prioritizes Sexual-related Behaviors in Male C.elegans</a></h4>

              
                Neural network architecture determines its functional output. However, the detailed mechanisms are not well characterized. In this study, we focused on the neural network architectures of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans and the association with sexually dimorphic behaviors. We applied graph theory and computational neuroscience methods to systematically discern the features of these two neural networks. Our findings revealed that a small percentage of sexual-specific neurons exerted dominance throughout the entire male neural network, suggesting male's prioritized sexual-related behavior outputs. Based on the structural and dynamical characteristics of two complete neural networks,sub-networks containing sex-specific neurons and their immediate neighbors, or sub-networks exclusively comprising sex-shared neurons, we predicted dimorphic behavioral outcomes for males and hermaphrodites. To verify the prediction, we performed behavioral and calcium imaging experiments and dissected a circuit that is specific for the increased spontaneous local search in males for mate-searching. Our research sheds light on the neural circuits that underlie sexually dimorphic behaviors in C. elegans, and provides significant insights into the inter connected relationship between network architecture and functional outcomes at the whole-brain level.

">Mechanisms of Alpha-Synuclein Seeded Aggregation in Neurons Revealed by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</a></h4>

              
                The brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are characterized by the presence of Lewy body inclusions enriched with fibrillar forms of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn). Despite related evidence that Lewy pathology spreads across different brain regions as the disease progresses, the underlying mechanism hence the fundamental cause of PD progression is unknown. The propagation of aSyn pathology is thought to potentially occur through the release of aSyn aggregates from diseased neurons, their uptake by neighboring healthy neurons via endocytosis, and subsequent seeding of native aSyn aggregation in the cytosol. A critical aspect of this process is believed to involve the escape of internalized aggregates from the endolysosomal compartment, though direct evidence of this mechanism in cultured neuron models remains lacking. In this study, we utilize a custom-built, time-gated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM) to investigate the progression of seeded aggregation over time in live cortical neurons. By establishing fluorescence lifetime sensitivity to aSyn aggregation level, we are able to monitor the protein's aggregation state. Through a FLIM analysis of neurons expressing aSyn-mVenus and exposed to aSyn preformed fibrils labeled with the acid-responsive dye pHrodo, we reveal the protein's aggregation state in both the cytosol and the endolysosomal compartment. The results indicate that aSyn seeds undergo partial disassembly prior to escaping the endocytic pathway, and that this escape is closely linked to the aggregation of cytosolic aSyn. In certain neurons, monomeric aSyn is found to translocate from the cytosol into the endolysosomal compartment, where it apparently forms aggregates in proximity to retained seeds. Additional analyses reveals zones of neuritic aSyn aggregates that overlaps with regions of microtubule disruption. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of aSyn pathology propagation in PD and other synucleinopathies, motivate additional experiments along these lines, and offer a path to guide the development of disease-modifying therapies.

                Beta-propeller Protein Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a devastating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease linked to variants in WDR45. Currently, there is no cure or disease altering treatment for this disease. This is, in part, due to a lack of insight into early phenotypes of BPAN progression and WDR45's role in establishing and maintaining neurological function. Here we generated and characterized a mouse model bearing a c52C>T BPAN patient variant in Wdr45. We show this mutation ablates WDR45 protein expression and alters autophagy in the brain. Behavioral analysis of these mice revealed characteristic signs of BPAN including cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, and motor decline. We show these behaviors coincide with widespread neuroinflammation and development of axonal spheroids in multiple neuron subclasses throughout the brain. Several lines of evidence suggest these spheroids arise from axon terminals. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered multiple disrupted pathways in the cortex including genes associated with synapses, neurites, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. This is supported by accumulation of the iron regulating transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) and the endoplasmic reticulum resident calreticulin (CALR) in the cortex as these animals age. CALR forms spheroid structures similar to the axonal spheroids seen in these animals. Taken together, our data demonstrate that WDR45 is necessary for healthy brain function and maintenance of axon terminals. This model opens the door to therapeutics targeting BPAN and further exploration of the role of WDR45 in neuronal function.

">Optogenetic inhibition quenches the integration of sensory input in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Many fundamental processes of brain computation, such as sensory perception and motor control, heavily rely on the mesoscopic dynamics of activity across the cerebral cortex. Manipulating mesoscale activity and observing its effects across multiple brain regions is crucial for understanding the causal link between cortical dynamics and behavior. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a novel all-optical system that allows inhibition of excitatory neurons while simultaneously monitoring cortical responses at arbitrary sites across the entire dorsal cortex of mice. Methods: We combined wide-field imaging and optogenetics to create a mesoscale all-optical approach, enabling simultaneous monitoring and manipulation of cortical activity using light. Intravenous injection of two PHP.eB AAVs enabled the whole-brain co-expression of the red-shifted calcium indicator jRCaMP1b and the inhibitory actuator stGtACR2, with stable expression over several weeks. This system was calibrated, and the effects of inhibition on sensory responses were tested. Results: Increasing laser power progressively reduced spontaneous activity at the site of irradiation. A single 5-second pulse on the barrel field cortex significantly decreased the amplitude of sensory-evoked responses, not only in the stimulated region but across the entire stimulated hemisphere. Conclusions: This novel all-optical system enables targeted inhibition while concurrently monitoring mesoscale cortical activity. It provides insights into the dynamics of cortical circuits and offers a milestone for investigating the causal links between neuronal activity and behavior. Future research can use this tool to address sensory responsiveness impairments in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Reduced enteric BDNF-TrkB signaling drives glucocorticoid-mediated GI dysmotility</a></h4>

              
                Stress affects gastrointestinal (GI) function causing dysmotility, especially in disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI) patients. GI motility is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), suggesting that stress alters ENS biology to cause dysmotility. While stress increases glucocorticoid levels through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, how glucocorticoids affect GI motility is not known. Glucocorticoid signaling reduces expression of specific transcriptional isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system, altering signaling through its receptor Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) to cause behavioral defects. However, since the nature of ENS-specific Bdnf isoforms and their response to glucocorticoids remains unknown, we are limited in studying how stress impacts the ENS to cause dysmotility. Here, in male and female mice, we establish that stress-responsive Bdnf isoforms that are transcriptionally regulated at exons 4 and 6 represent >85% of all Bdnf isoforms in the post-natal ENS, and that Bdnf and Ntrk2 (TrkB) are expressed by enteric neurons. We further show using male mice dosed with a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (Dexa), that increased glucocorticoid signaling in ENS significantly reduces the expression of Bdnf transcripts and protein and that it significantly reduces GI motility. Finally, by using HIOC, a specific synthetic agonist of TrkB, we observe that HIOC treatment significantly improved GI motility of a cohort of Dexa-treated male mice, when compared to Dexa-treated and HIOC-untreated mice. Our results implicate BDNF- TrkB signaling in the etiology of stress-associated dysmotility and suggest that TrkB is a putative therapeutic target for dysmotility in DGBI patients.

">Periaqueductal gray passes over disappointment and signals continuity of remaining reward expectancy</a></h4>

              
                Disappointment is a vital factor in the learning and adjustment of strategies in reward-seeking behaviors. It helps them conserve energy in environments where rewards are scarce, while also increasing their chances of maximizing rewards by prompting them to escape to environments where richer rewards are anticipated (e.g., migration). However, another key factor in obtaining the reward is the ability to monitor the remaining possibilities of obtaining the outcome and to tolerate the disappointment in order to continue with subsequent actions. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) has been reported as one of the key brain regions in regulating negative emotions and escape behaviors in animals. The present study suggests that the PAG could also play a critical role in inhibiting escape behaviors and facilitating ongoing motivated behaviors to overcome disappointing events. We found that PAG activity is tonically suppressed by reward expectancy as animals engage in a task to acquire a reward outcome. This tonic suppression of PAG activity was sustained during a series of sequential task procedures as long as the expectancy of reward outcomes persisted. Notably, the tonic suppression of PAG activity showed a significant correlation with the persistence of animals' reward-seeking behavior while overcoming intermittent disappointing events. This finding highlights that the balance between distinct tonic signaling in the PAG, which signals remaining reward expectancy, and phasic signaling in the LHb, which signals disappointment, could play a crucial role in determining whether animals continue or discontinue reward-seeking behaviors when they encounter an unexpected negative event. This mechanism would be essential for animals to efficiently navigate complex environments with various reward volatilities and ultimately contributes to maximizing their reward acquisition.

">Psilocybin causes sex, time, and dose dependent alterations in brain signaling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a psychedelic tryptamine that has emerged as a potential candidate for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including treatment resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Clinical trials which have assessed the efficacy of psilocybin for these conditions report a rapid and sustained improvement in patient- and clinician-rated depression scores. The established mechanism of action for psychedelics such as psilocybin is agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2AR), however, the downstream molecular processes mediating their therapeutic effects remain unknown. As high doses of psychedelics are known to induce strong perceptual alterations, an additional outstanding question is whether subperceptual doses induce similar molecular effects as psychoactive dosages. Here, we report the first analysis of dose- and sex-dependent transcriptional changes in forebrains of female and male mice at 3 timepoints (8 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days) following a single administration of psilocybin at low (0.25 mg/kg) or high (1 mg/kg) doses. Grouped analysis of both sexes reveals dose- and time-dependent transcriptomic alterations. We report more rapid transcriptional changes and attenuation of such changes in females following a single low-dose relative to males treated identically. Females also responded more robustly to high-dose administration relative to males at 8 and 24 hours, with signal attenuation in both sexes by 7 days. A notable observation was the persistent transcriptional effect of low-dose psilocybin at 7 days, which outlasted high-dose changes, and which suggests that low doses may have prolonged biological effects. A myriad of pathways were altered depending on sex and timepoint, but common features included functions related to neuronal differentiation, neurogenesis, and changes in receptor signaling. These data reveal dose- and sex-dependent molecular effects of psilocybin and support previous studies demonstrating its effect on dendritogenesis. Given ongoing clinical interest in psilocybin for treating mental health disorders, our results suggest that these sexually divergent changes should be considered when weighing treatment strategies. Additional consideration should be given to temporal effects of low vs high dosages on gene transcription, especially when timing psilocybin with adjuvant cognitive behavioral therapy.

">A low-cost FPGA-based approach for pile-up corrected high-speed in vivo FLIM imaging</a></h4>

              
                Intensity-based two-photon microscopy (2PM) is a cornerstone of biomedical research but lacks the ability to measure concentrations, a pivotal task for longitudinal studies and quantitative comparisons. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) based on Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) can overcome those limits but suffers from "pile-up" distortions at high photon count rates, severely limiting acquisition speed. We introduce the "laser period blind time" (LPBT) method to correct pile-up distortions in photon counting electronics, enabling reliable low-cost TCSPC-FLIM at high count rates. The correction was implemented on low-cost hardware based on a field programable gate array (FPGA) and validated using a combination of in silico simulations and in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo measurements. The LBPT approach achieves <3% error in lifetime measurements at count rates more than ten times higher than traditional limits, allowing robust FLIM imaging of sub-second metabolite dynamics with subcellular resolution. Our work enables high-precision, cost-effective FLIM imaging at rates comparable to commercial systems and at a fraction of the cost, facilitating the adoption of FLIM across all areas of research needing affordable, quantitative live imaging solutions.

">Visual and vestibular processing of vertical motion: a psychophysical study</a></h4>

              
                The motion of objects and ourselves along the vertical is affected by gravitational acceleration. However, the visual system is poorly sensitive to accelerations, and the vestibular otoliths do not disassociate gravitational and inertial accelerations of ego-motion. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the brain resolves visual and vestibular ambiguities about vertical motion with internal models of gravity, which predict that downward motions are accelerated and upward motions are decelerated by gravity. In visual sessions, a target moved up or down while participants remained stationary. In vestibular sessions, participants were moved up or down, while they fixated an imaginary target moving along. In visual-vestibular sessions, participants were moved up or down while the visual target remained fixed. We found that downward motions of either the visual target or the participant were systematically perceived as lasting less than upward motions of the same duration, and vice-versa for the opposite direction of motion, consistent with the prior assumption that downward motion is accelerated and upward motion is decelerated by gravity. In visual-vestibular sessions, there was no significant difference in the average estimates of duration of downward and upward motion of the participant. However, there was large inter subject variability of these estimates.

">Integrating multi-system environmental factors to predict brain and behavior in adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Environmental factors have long been shown to influence brain structure and adolescent psychopathology. However, almost no research has included environmental factors spanning micro-to-macro-systems, brain structure, and psychopathology in an integrated framework. Here, we assessed the ways and degree to which multi-system environmental factors during late childhood predict subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence. Method: We used the baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (N = 2,766). A Bayesian latent profile analysis was applied to obtain distinct multi-system environmental profiles during late childhood. The profiles were used in a path analysis to predict their direct and indirect effects on subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence. Results: Bayesian latent profile analysis revealed nine environmental profiles. Two distinct profiles predicted greater externalizing problems in adolescents: (i) adversity across, family, school, and neighborhood systems and (ii) family conflict and low school involvement. In contrast, a profile of family and neighborhood affluence predicted fewer externalizing difficulties. Further, family and neighborhood affluence predicted higher subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted fewer externalizing problems; whereas, family economic and neighborhood adversity predicted lower subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted greater externalizing difficulties. Conclusion: We captured direct and indirect influences of environmental factors across multiple systems on externalizing psychopathology. Specifying the equifinal pathways to externalizing psychopathology serves to provide an evidence base for establishing different types of interventions based on the needs and risk profiles of youth.

">Imaging the dancing brain: Decoding sensory, motor and social processes during dyadic dance</a></h4>

              
                Real-world social cognition requires processing and adapting to multiple dynamic information streams. Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in de-noising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of participants engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination each uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modelled to control for muscle artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four key processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination accuracy. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized readiness potential triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self- or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners make visual contact, relies on visual cortical areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical movements best drive observers' EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modelling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.

">Centralized brain networks underlie body part coordination during grooming</a></h4>

              
                Animals must coordinate multiple body parts to perform important tasks such as grooming, or locomotion. How this movement synchronization is achieved by the nervous system remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the neural basis of body part coordination during goal-directed antennal grooming in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that unilateral or bilateral grooming of one or both antenna, respectively, arises from synchronized movements of the head, antennae, and forelegs. Simulated replay of these body part kinematics in a biomechanical model shows that this coordination makes grooming more efficient by permitting unobstructed, forceful collisions between the foreleg tibiae and antennae. Movements of one body part do not require proprioceptive sensory feedback from the others: neither amputation of the forelegs or antennae, nor immobilization of the head prevented movements of the other unperturbed body parts. By constructing a comprehensive antennal grooming network from the fly brain connectome, we find that centralized interneurons and shared premotor neurons interconnect and thus likely synchronize neck, antennal, and foreleg motor networks. A simulated activation screen of neurons in this network reveals cell classes required for the coordination of antennal movements during unilateral grooming. These cells form two coupled circuit motifs that enable robust body part synchronization: a recurrent excitatory subnetwork that promotes contralateral antennal pitch and broadcast inhibition that suppresses ipsilateral antennal pitch. Similarly centralized controllers may enable the flexible co-recruitment of multiple body parts to subserve a variety of behaviors.

">Physiological activity within peripheral nerves influences neural output in response to electrical stimulation: an in vivo study</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation therapies are often applied to peripheral nerves. These nerves can have physiological activity that interacts with the activity evoked by electrical stimulation, potentially influencing targeted neural output and clinical outcomes. Our goal was to quantify changes in sensory neural unit activity in response to variations in electrical stimulation frequency and amplitude. In a feline model, we applied cutaneous brushing to evoke pudendal nerve afferent activity with and without electrical stimulation via a pudendal nerve cuff electrode. We recorded neural output with microelectrode arrays implanted in ipsilateral sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Combined inter-spike interval distributions for all DRG units showed ranges of flattening, increases, and shifts in response to electrical stimulation. These distributions and changes within them due to electrical stimulation were largely driven by a select few units. Mixed-effects models revealed that quicker firing units generally decreased in firing rate in response to electrical stimulation and, conversely, slower firing units increased in firing rate. A unit's underlying firing rate also drove the magnitude of change in mean output firing rate in response to stimulation. Further, the models reported a small, negative correlation between the output mean unit firing rate and the applied electrical stimulation frequency. These results demonstrate the potential impact of electrical stimulation on underlying neural firing activity and output. Peripheral neuromodulation may normalize abnormal firing patterns in nerves contributing to pathological disorders or alter unrelated physiological activity in off-target neurons. These factors should be considered when selecting neuromodulation settings in animal subjects and human patients.

">Brain maps of general cognitive function and spatial correlations with neurobiological cortical profiles</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we attempt to answer two questions: 1) which regions of the human brain, in terms of morphometry, are most strongly related to individual differences in domain-general cognitive functioning (g)? and 2) what are the underlying neurobiological properties of those regions? We meta-analyse vertex-wise g-cortical morphometry (volume, surface area, thickness, curvature and sulcal depth) associations using data from 3 cohorts: the UK Biobank (UKB), Generation Scotland (GenScot), and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936), with the meta-analytic N = 38,379 (age range = 44 to 84 years old). These g-morphometry associations vary in magnitude and direction across the cortex (|{beta}| range = -0.12 to 0.17 across morphometry measures) and show good cross-cohort agreement (mean spatial correlation r = 0.57, SD = 0.18). Then, to address (2), we bring together existing - and derive new - cortical maps of 33 neurobiological characteristics from multiple modalities (including neurotransmitter receptor densities, gene expression, functional connectivity, metabolism, and cytoarchitectural similarity). We discover that these 33 profiles spatially covary along four major dimensions of cortical organisation (accounting for 65.9% of the variance) and denote aspects of neurobiological scaffolding that underpin the spatial patterning of MRI-cognitive associations we observe (significant |r| range = 0.21 to 0.56). Alongside the cortical maps from these analyses, which we make openly accessible, we provide a compendium of cortex-wide and within-region spatial correlations among general and specific facets of brain cortical organisation and higher order cognitive functioning, which we hope will serve as a framework for analysing other aspects of behaviour-brain MRI associations.

">The resource elasticity of control</a></h4>

              
                The ability to determine how much the environment can be controlled through our actions has long been viewed as fundamental to adaptive behavior. While traditional accounts treat controllability as a fixed property of the environment, in the real-world this property often depends on the effort, time, and money that we are willing and able to invest. In such cases, controllability can be said to be elastic to invested resources. Here we propose that inferring this elasticity is essential for efficient resource allocation, and thus, elasticity misestimations result in maladaptive behavior. To test these hypotheses, we developed a novel treasure hunt game where participants encountered environments with varying degrees of controllability and elasticity. Across two pre-registered studies (N=514), we first demonstrate that people infer elasticity and adapt their resource allocation accordingly. We then present a computational model that explains how people make this inference, and identify individual elasticity biases that lead to suboptimal resource allocation. Finally, we show that overestimation of elasticity is associated with elevated psychopathology involving an impaired sense of control. These findings establish the elasticity of control as a distinct cognitive construct guiding adaptive behavior, and a computational marker for control-related maladaptive behavior.

">What makes human cortical pyramidal neurons functionally complex</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit unique cognitive abilities within the animal kingdom, but the neural mechanisms driving these advanced capabilities remain poorly understood. Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.

">Non-Caloric Sweeteners combined with glucose affect hypothalamic glucose sensing-induced insulin secretion, food re-intake through neuronal cellular metabolism: An in vivo and in vitro approaches</a></h4>

              
                Changes in brain activity associated with deleterious metabolic effects of non-caloric sweeteners (NCS) have been demonstrated in humans, particularly when their intake is concomitant with that of glucose. Here, we have focused on hypothalamic glucose sensing in rats, detecting increases in circulating glucose levels and in turn triggering various physiological controls. The identification of sweet-taste receptors in the hypothalamus has suggested that they participate in glucosensing mechanism, but the existence of a dialogue between different pathways has never been studied. Here, we tested the acute effects of hypothalamic glucosensing combined with a NCS (sucralose or acesulfame potassium (aceK)), the latter binding only to sweet-taste receptors, without producing energy. Our working hypothesis was that the concomitance of two contradictory signals (energetic, sweet glucose vs. non-energetic, sweet NCS) could be responsible for deleterious physiological effects. After validation that sweet taste receptors and their signaling expressions were indeed present in the rat hypothalamus, insulin secretion induced by hypothalamic glucosensing (increased glucose level) in the presence of sucralose and aceK was examined. Insulin release was reduced compared to glucose alone, while the two NCS alone have no effect. Regarding the satiety-inducing effect of glucose, concomitant injection of each NCS with glucose produced the opposite effect to that observed with glucose alone, with food intake being increased, an effect also present with NCS injected alone. Using the GT1-7 hypothalamic cell line expressing sweet-taste receptors, we showed that the ATP concentration which normally increases with rising glucose levels was dose-dependently decreased in the presence of NCS, an effect which is inhibited in the presence of gurmarin, a specific inhibitor of sweet-taste receptors. The increase in ROS production in response to rising glucose levels was enhanced in the presence of NCS, an effect that was blocked in the presence of gurmarin. In both cases, NCS have an inhibitory effect on stimulated mitochondrial respiration. Taken together, these results suggest that NCS via sweet-taste receptors interfere with mitochondrial signaling and/or energy production during hypothalamic glucose sensing.

">MIND-Map; A Comprehensive Toolbox for Estimating Brain Dynamic States</a></h4>

              
                Studying dynamic brain states has offered new insights into understanding functional connectivity. One of the promising approaches for estimating these brain states is the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). However, despite its potential, its adoption in the neuroscience community has been limited due to its complexity. We developed the Markov Inference Dynamic Mapping (MIND-Map) toolbox to overcome this limitation. This interactive user-friendly toolbox leverages HSMM to identify brain states, analyze their dynamics, and perform two-sample statistical comparisons of network dynamics. Furthermore, it introduces a new approach, not yet used in conjunction with these models, for determining the optimal number of states, addressing a key challenge in the field. We assessed the performance of the HSMM and our method for identifying the optimal number of states using two datasets, including a unique dataset explicitly developed for this purpose.

">Evidence for systematic - yet task- and motor-contingent - rhythmicity of auditory perceptual judgements</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies advocate for a rhythmic mode of perception; however, the evidence in the context of auditory perception remains inconsistent. We propose that the divergent conclusions drawn from previous work stem from conceptual and methodological issues. These include ambiguous assumptions regarding the origin of perceptual rhythmicity, variations in listening tasks and attentional demands, differing analytical approaches, and the reliance on fixed participant samples for statistical testing. To systematically address these points, we conducted a series of experiments in which human participants performed auditory tasks involving monaural target sounds presented against binaural white noise backgrounds, while also recording eye movements. These experiments varied in whether stimuli were presented randomly or required motor initialization by the participant, the necessity of memory across trials and the manipulation of attentional demands across modalities. Our findings challenge the notion of universal rhythmicity in hearing, but support the existence of paradigm- and ear-specific fluctuations in perceptual sensitivity and response bias that emerge at multiple frequencies. Notably, the rhythmicity for sounds in the left and right ears appears to be largely independent among participants, and the strength of rhythmicity in behavioural data is linked to oculomotor activity and attentional requirements of the task. Overall, these results resolve conflicting conclusions drawn in previous work and provide specific avenues for further studies into the rhythmicity of auditory perception.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous studies have examined the role of working memory in cognitive tasks such as syntactic, semantic, and phonological processing, thereby contributing to our understanding of linguistic information management and retrieval. However, the real-time processing of phonological information&amp;amp;mdash;particularly in relation to suprasegmental features like tone, where its contour represents a time-varying signal&amp;amp;mdash;remains a relatively underexplored area within the framework of Information Processing Theory (IPT). This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the real-time processing of similar tonal information by native Cantonese speakers, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how IPT applies to auditory processing. Methods: Specifically, this study combined assessments of cognitive functions, an AX discrimination task, and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the discrimination results and real-time processing characteristics of native Macau Cantonese speakers perceiving three pairs of similar tones. Results: The behavioral results confirmed the completed merging of T2&amp;amp;ndash;T5 in Macau Cantonese, and the ongoing merging of T3&amp;amp;ndash;T6 and T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6, with perceptual merging rates of 45.46% and 27.28%, respectively. Mismatch negativity (MMN) results from the passive oddball experiment revealed distinct temporal processing patterns for the three tone pairs. Cognitive functions, particularly attention and working memory, significantly influenced tone discrimination, with more pronounced effects observed in the mean amplitude of MMN during T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6 discrimination. Differences in MMN peak latency between T3&amp;amp;ndash;T6 and T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6 further suggested the use of different perceptual strategies for these contour-related tones. Specifically, the T3&amp;amp;ndash;T6 pair can be perceived through early signal input, whereas the perception of T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6 relies on constant signal input. Conclusions: This distinction in cognitive resource allocation may explain the different merging rates of the two tone pairs. This study, by focusing on the perceptual difficulty of tone pairs and employing EEG techniques, revealed the temporal processing of similar tones by native speakers, providing new insights into tone phoneme processing and speech variation.</p>

	<p>Background: Many daily activities depend on visual inputs to improve motor accuracy and minimize errors. Reaching tasks present an ecological framework for examining these visuomotor interactions, but our comprehension of how different amounts of visual input affect motor outputs is still limited. The present study fills this gap, exploring how hand-related visual bias affects motor performance in a reaching task (to draw a line between two dots). Methods: Our setup allowed us to show and hide the visual feedback related to the hand position (cursor of a computer mouse), which was further disentangled from the visual input related to the task (tip of the line). Results: Data from 53 neurotypical participants indicated that, when the hand-related visual cue was visible and disentangled from the task-related visual cue, accommodating movements in response to spatial distortions were less accurate than when the visual cue was absent. Conclusions: We interpret these findings with reference to the concepts of motor affordance of visual cues, shifts between internally- and externally-oriented cognitive strategies to perform movements, and body-related reference frames.</p>

	<p>Background: Video games are no longer just entertainment; they are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance cognitive abilities, including spatial cognition. This skill is vital in academic disciplines, where strong spatial reasoning is essential for problem-solving and success. Aims: This study investigates how video game engagement impacts self-reported spatial abilities in university students, focusing on the frequency, types, and duration of gaming. It also explores the contributions of specific video game genres and features to perceived cognitive improvements. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 566 Saudi university students who completed an online questionnaire on their gaming habits and self-reported spatial abilities. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests and chi-square tests to assess the associations between video game behaviors and self-reported spatial cognition. Results: Frequent gamers (65% of participants) demonstrated significantly higher self-reported spatial abilities than infrequent gamers, particularly in adapting to spatial challenges (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Players engaged with action and open-world games reported the greatest perceived improvements in spatial cognition. No significant gender differences were observed, indicating that both males and females benefit equally from gaming. The use of perspective in games was notably linked to spatial skill enhancement (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Regular video game play, especially with spatially demanding genres, is associated with significant self-reported improvements in spatial abilities. These findings highlight the potential of video games as tools for enhancing self-reported spatial cognition in education and professional training, particularly in STEM fields.</p>

	<p>Background: This research project examining the moderating role of the Scout Movement in supporting mental health through the shaping of personal competence is based on Bandura&amp;amp;rsquo;s conception of social development (social cognitive theory) in terms of generating a sense of general self-efficacy. Methods: This research examined the moderating value of Scouting with regard to the connection between self-esteem and a sense of efficacy and styles of coping with stress in a group of 683 volunteers. Results: The results suggest that Scouting is a moderator of the relationship between the intensity of an emotion-focused stress coping style and a sense of self-efficacy&amp;amp;mdash;being a Scout intensifies the blocking effect of self-esteem on emotions in stressful situations, which can positively influence emotion regulation. Conclusions: The features described suggest the need to research Scouting as a non-formal education strategy to support the development of young people&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental health in different theoretical and methodological contexts. This work provides conclusions regarding understanding the role of Scouting as a moderator in coping with stress and, consequently, ensuring good mental health. It detailed the knowledge pertaining to specific mechanisms thanks to which Scouting can influence the development of emotional regulation and adaptive response to stressful situations.</p>

	<p>Background and Aims: Measuring stroke recovery poses a significant challenge, given the complexity of the recovery process. We aimed to identify a standardized and data-driven set of metrics of stroke rehabilitation in the literature that ensures the inclusion of all recovery domains and subdomains in the literature. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by four reviewers using the PRISMA guidelines on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for stroke recovery articles between 2004 and 2024. The inclusion criteria comprised experimental/observational studies, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. All studies had &amp;amp;ge;20 participants who were &amp;amp;ge;18 years of age, and had a follow-up of &amp;amp;ge;3 months. Outcomes included demographics, geographic origin, stroke mechanism, domains and subdomains, metrics used, and follow-up. A bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024551753). Results: Our search included 324 studies with a sample of 85,156 participants. The study identified seven domains (perception, physical and motor function (PF), speech and language (S&amp;amp;amp;L), cognition, activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life (QoL), and social interaction) and 96 constituent subdomains that encompass the complete landscape of the stroke recovery literature identified. The domains of PF and ADL constituted the vast share of the literature, albeit reducing in their relative representation over time, while domains such as perception and QoL have been increasingly studied since 2004. Using the domains, the study identified the set and frequency of all commonly used metrics to measure stroke recovery in the literature, of which the NIHSS (n = 72), BI (n = 55), and mRS (n = 51) were the most commonly used. We identified eighteen standard metrics that ensure the inclusion of all seven domains and 96 subdomains. Summary of Review and Conclusions: The identified set of domains and metrics within this study can help inform further clinical research and decision-making by providing a standardized set of metrics to be used for each domain. This approach ensures lesser represented domains and subdomains are also included during testing, providing a more complete view and measure of stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques&amp;amp;mdash;Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging&amp;amp;mdash;in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to maximize their clinical impact.</p>

	<p>The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) has been a cornerstone in cognitive aging research, offering a framework to explain how life experiences like education, occupation, bilingualism, and physical exercise may buffer individuals from cognitive decline in the face of aging or neurological disease. However, this paper argues that the CR model, while influential, may have outlived its usefulness due to inherent limitations that constrain future research directions and unintentionally encourage &amp;amp;ldquo;magical thinking&amp;amp;rdquo;. Specifically, CR&amp;amp;rsquo;s definition, which relies on cognitive performance being &amp;amp;ldquo;better than expected&amp;amp;rdquo; based on known measures of brain structure and function, makes the concept temporally bound to current scientific understanding, potentially stifling novel insights into cognition. In contrast, we propose a shift to a cognitive capacity (CC) framework, which views cognitive performance as being always determined by the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structural and functional capacities, without needing to invoke expectations based on incomplete knowledge. The CC framework is broader, encompassing factors that either promote or demote cognitive performance by directly modifying brain structure and function. This reconceptualization opens avenues for investigating cognitive enhancement not only in the context of aging or disease but also in young, healthy individuals. By emphasizing causal pathways between brain changes and cognitive outcomes, this perspective provides a more flexible and testable approach to understanding the mechanisms behind cognitive performance and its modulation across the lifespan.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cardiac arrest may cause significant hypoxic&amp;amp;ndash;ischemic injury leading to coma, seizures, myoclonic jerks, or status epilepticus. Mortality is high, but accurate prognostication is challenging. A multimodal approach is employed, in which electroencephalography (EEG) forms a key part with several recognised patterns of prognostic significance. Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical and qualitative features of the EEG of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Kingston General Hospital following cardiac arrest from 2017 to 2020 were reviewed. The study included 81 adult patients (&amp;amp;ge;18 years). Outcome was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) as 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 (favourable) or 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 (unfavourable). EEG patterns were divided into groups within the highly malignant, malignant and benign patterns described in the literature. Results: There were a wide range of causes and 22% had a favourable outcome. Highly malignant, malignant and benign patterns were associated with survival in 0%, 70% and 100%, respectively, and favourable outcomes in 0%, 48% and 100%. All patients with seizures died, and 94% with myoclonus had unfavourable outcomes. In contrast, EEG reactivity and improvement on follow-up EEG were associated with a favourable outcome. Conclusions: Highly malignant EEG, seizures and myoclonus were associated with unfavourable outcomes, while patients with malignant EEG had better outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-5/v2?src=rss">Conditioning factors for the scientific productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences at a private Peruvian University: A cross-sectional analytical study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The objective of this study was to determine the conditioning factors for scientific research productivity in university students of health sciences. Scientific productivity, in addition to making visible the generation of new knowledge, contributes to the well-being of the population and provides feedback to the scientific community in terms of methodologies, perspectives and results that help to break down barriers that delimit productivity in scientific research. Methods A cross-sectional analytical observational study was conducted. The study population was 4104 students enrolled during the 2021-I semester in the Faculty of Health Sciences of a private Peruvian university. A sample size of 400 students was determined and a stratified probability sampling was used. The variables were measured through surveys. The dependent variable was scientific research productivity, and the independent variables were institutional culture, knowledge management and technological capital. Summary measures are reported according to the type of variable. The chi-square test with a significance level of p<0.05 was applied to assess the association between the variables of interest. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the Stepwise method. Prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results From the total of 400 students, 74.5% were male, 57.25% were aged between 18 and 27 years, 17% belonged to the school of human medicine and 72% were in their sixth year of studies. Scientific research productivity was associated with management commitment (PR=1.493; 95%CI: 1.077–2.068, p=0.015), sense of personal growth (PR=1.632; 95%CI: 1.041–2.558; p=0.024), recognition by the university (PR=1.385; 95%CI: 1.012–1.896; p=0.043), strategic alliances (PR=1.422; 95%CI: 1.032–1.959; p=0. 03), having research proposals (PR=1.522; 95%CI: 1.114–2.08; p=0.009), dissemination of results obtained (PR=1.542; 95%CI: 1.12–2.122; p=0.01), availability of human resources (PR=1.591; 95%CI: 1.165–2.173; p=0.004), access to equipment and software (PR=1.482; 95%CI: 1.061–2.069; p=0.018) and to laboratories (PR=1.438; 95%CI: 1.047–1.974; p=0.024). Conclusion It is concluded that the research productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences is low. It is imperative to strengthen the university research culture that empowers students as agents of change and strengthens faculty participation in scientific networks and communities.

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1523/v1?src=rss">Dengue infection during pregnancy and the occurrence of pathological neonatal outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dengue infection during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal complications; therefore, the objective of this research is to determine these outcomes and describe the clinical manifestations of the infection. Methods A systematic review of studies published in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and thesis repositories published between 2013 and October 2023 was performed. DeCS and MeSH dengue and maternal-neonatal outcome were used. Thirteen studies were selected and the New Castle-Ottawa scale was used to assess their quality. Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were calculated to report the overall effect size using random-effects models. All analyses were performed in Rev Man 5.4.1 Results The 13 studies involved a population of 18,724 pregnant women, with cohorts ranging from 25 to 17,673 pregnant women. The most frequent outcomes in the pregnant women were cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage, and in the newborns, preterm delivery and low birth weight. According to the New Castle-Ottawa scale, six studies were considered low risk and seven studies moderate risk. Dengue is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 2.24), premature rupture of membranes (OR: 1.04) and cesarean section (OR: 1.13). It could not be concluded that dengue is a risk factor for the neonatal outcomes studied. The clinical picture of pregnant women with dengue was predominantly fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, anemia, dyspnea and myalgia. Conclusions Pregnancy-related changes in the immune, cardiovascular and coagulation systems, among others, increase the probability of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in case of DENV infection, such as postpartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, low birth weight and preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be considered a population at risk and should be included in dengue control, diagnosis and treatment policies.

                This paper explores the concept of α-ψ-ϕ  contractive mappings, contributing to the advancement of self-map extensions and fixed-point theorems within b-metric spaces. We introduce a new class of contractive mappings and demonstrate how they extend traditional contraction principles, offering a broader framework for analyzing fixed points in non-standard spaces. The main result of this study is a generalization of existing fixed-point theorems, supported by comprehensive corollaries, illustrative examples, and rigorous proofs. These findings provide deeper insights into the structure of b-metric spaces and open avenues for further applications in fields such as optimization and machine learning.

                Introduction Numerous studies have concluded that the functional ingredients benefit human health. Similarly, present times have seen exponential growth in functional food in bakery product segments like breads and biscuits. However, there is a lack of information on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional bakery products. This bibliometric study addresses this gap by identifying the current research trends in functional ingredients. Objective To investigate current research trends on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional biscuits. Method The study followed the “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews” standards for retrieving literature. The study went through three major stages, “assembling,” “arranging,” and “assessing,” to retrieve 612 articles from the Scopus database from 2013 to 2023. Through further filtering, 395 articles were selected. Result The analysis was conducted using R Studio and VOS viewer. The performance analysis and science mapping tools were used to evaluate the articles. The results showed a 5.76% annual growth in publication trends. The most researched functional ingredients were antioxidants, bioactive compounds, and dietary fiber. The review summarized the most studied foods to develop functional biscuits and highlighted the most experimented technological advancements. Conclusion The study revealed the need for future research studies on functional ingredients with a focus on studying the technical implications of technical advancements in extracting functional ingredients from foods. The study highlights the significance of future studies based on the acceptance of functional biscuits and their sensory properties, focusing on the mass population. The study derives the possible applicability of functional ingredients in developing new formulations from publications and their usefulness in developing new formulations. This insight on the applicability of functional ingredients provides an opportunity for biscuit/cookie manufacturing to boost consumption among the population to a new ascending graph.

                Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurological condition that primarily affects older people. Currently available AD drugs are associated with side effects and there is a need to develop natural drugs from plants. Aquilaria is as an endangered medicinal plant genus (commonly called agarwood plants) and various products of Aquilaria plant spp. including resinous heartwood, leaves, bark, and stem have been widely used in various traditional medicine systems. Research on agarwood plants is sparse and only a few previous studies demonstrated their neuroprotective properties in vitro. Owing to the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolites in agarwood plants, it is imperative not only to protect these plants but also evaluate the bioactivity of agarwood phytochemicals. Methods This study used Molsoft tools to predict the physicochemical properties of agarwood ligands, including the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, lipophilicity, solubility, and the molecular polar surface area and volume of agarwood ligands. Additionally, ADMET (absorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties were predicted using ADMETlab 2.0. Computational methods such as AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed for the docking of 41 selected agarwood compounds with AD-related molecular targets. Results and Conclusion According to docking data, three compounds aquilarisin (ASN), aquilarisinin (ANN), aquilarixanthone (AXN) showed highest binding affinity to selected AD targets compared to their known inhibitors. MD simulation studies revealed that, selected agarwood compounds’ protein-ligand complexes showed remarkable structural stability throughout 100ns simulation. The agarwood chemicals aquilarisin, aquilarisinin, aquilarixanthone, pillion (PLN), and agarotetrol (AGT) are consequently suggested as some of the found hits against AD targets, however, additional experimental validation is required to establish their effectiveness.

                Background Yeast strains that are tolerant to several environmental stresses are extensively employed to produce bioethanol from sugar-rich feedstock. Bioethanol production efficiency in Metehara and Fincha Sugar Factories (the two major sugar factories in Ethiopia) is 50% lower than that of similar factories in other parts of the world. Methods In our previous research findings, five wild indigenous strains of multi-stress tolerance yeast were isolated from traditional fermented alcoholic beverages (Tella, Tej, and Areke) in Ethiopia to the purpose of evaluate their potential use for bioethanol using sugarcane molasses as a substrate. Result The optimal parameters for maximum ethanol production were pH of 4.5, 25°Brix, 30°C, 4.0 g/l ammonium sulfate, supplement with yeast extract, and 72 h of incubation period. Under these optimum conditions, 13.13 ± 0.08% (v/v) ethanol was obtained. The yield of hydrous and anhydrous bioethanol from fermented molasses samples were produced at 94.20–95.60% (v/v) and 99.05–99.56% (v/v), respectively. Conclusion According to this finding, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT15, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT18F, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate R9MU strains have been good candidates for production of industrial bioethanol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-710/v2?src=rss">Expert Consensus Methods In The Humanities: An Exploration of their Potential [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the significant role of consensus and dissensus in knowledge production, formal approaches to consensus are notably less common in the humanities compared to their frequent application in natural, social, and life sciences. This article therefore explores the potential of expert consensus methods in humanities-related research. Methods In order to do so, an interdisciplinary team of both sciences researchers experienced in consensus methods and researchers familiar with the domain of the humanities and epistemology, conducted a literary review and exchanged their expertise in multiple brainstorm sessions. Results This resulted in the identification of six key elements of expert consensus methods. It also provided for an overview of different types of expert consensus methods that regularly used in the natural, social, and life sciences: Delphi studies, nominal groups, consensus conferences, and Glaser’s state of the art method and illustrative examples from both sciences and humanities-related studies. An overview of possible purposes for applying these methods is provided to identify the research contexts in which these methods have proven their value, which can be extrapolated to humanities related issues for which these methods seem promising. Conclusions The comparisons and categorisation show that, when focusing on the purposes, there seem to be humanities-related issues that may lend themselves better to structured expert consensus methods than their subject matter and research methods might suggest. When deliberately applied in context chosen by researchers with expertise in a specific humanities domain, expert consensus methods can accelerate epistemic process, enhance transparency, increase replicability, stimulate diversity, and encourage fair processes in humanities research and the application of its findings.

                Background Escherichia coli is a critical priority pathogen due to its significant morbidity, mortality, and growing antimicrobial resistance, underscoring the urgent need for novel control strategies. This bacterium is frequently implicated in outbreaks associated with horticultural products, particularly those cultivated in organic farming systems. The aim of this study was to isolate and evaluate the potential of a bacteriophage as a biocontrol agent against E. coli in compost and agricultural irrigation water. Methods E. coli presence in compost samples (n=17) was determined through microbiological assays, and the bacterial identity was confirmed by PCR amplification of the phoA gene. Antimicrobial resistance profiles of the isolates were assessed using the disk diffusion method. Bacteriophage isolation was conducted from livestock fecal samples using a double-layer agar technique. The stability of the bacteriophage under varying pH levels and temperatures was evaluated, along with its replication dynamics. Additionally, the phage’s efficacy in reducing E. coli populations in compost and irrigation water was assessed. Genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the bacteriophage were conducted to characterize its genetic profile. Results E. coli strains isolated exhibiting multidrug resistance were isolated from compost samples. The isolated bacteriophage, named Alux-21, exhibited stability at neutral pH and retained viability at both 4°C and 40°C over a six-month period. Importantly, the phage achieved a significant reduction of E. coli counts, exceeding 3.8 logs in compost and 3 logs in irrigation water, demonstrating its superior efficacy compared to previously reported phages in similar substrates. Genomic analysis confirmed the absence of virulence-associated, lysogeny, and antibiotic resistance genes. Conclusion The findings highlight Alux-21 as a sustainable biocontrol agent for E. coli in compost and irrigation water. Field validation will be crucial to establish its scalability and efficacy under real-world agricultural conditions.

                Background Ensuring comprehensive access to family planning improves gender equality, empowers women, and, eventually, reduces poverty. However, in the pastoralist community, women were rooted in strong cultural and religious perspectives that promoted many children, discouraged the use of FP, had high male dominance, and had limited control over their life, including the use of FP. Objective To explore the barriers to LARC utilization among pastoralist women in southern Ethiopia. Methods This study used a qualitative descriptive study design and included thirty-three pastoralist women for focus group discussions and twelve key informants for IDI, who were purposefully selected from three pastoral districts. The participants were interviewed and explored the primary barriers to using LARCs. The principal researcher led the interview via a semi structured interview guide that allowed for flexibility in exploring issues aided by audio tape. The approach included a broad inductive thematic analysis, with significant concepts derived from transcripts. Results In this study, there are many barriers to LARC utilization organized into five themes, including myths and misconception (perceived side effects, FP is not suitable for women who work intensively and carry heavy objects and travel long distances), the desire to have many children (children are wealth and Gods gifts), religious belief, distances of health facilities and husband objection. Conclusion and recommendations Information education communication should be provided to address myths and misconceptions about the LARC during the FP intervention for pastoralist women via HEW, HCP, media, and community education. There is a need to enhance social opportunities by involving religious leaders and partners in decision-making and providing health information and counseling to religious leaders and couples in the community through HEW. As myths and misconceptions about LARC use emanate from a variety of concerns, this study may not cover all of them; therefore, future research is needed to investigate additional myths and misconceptions concerning contraception use.

                <p>by Thiago Ohno Bezerra, Antonio C. Roque</p>

Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters by increasing their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals). While glutamate released by neurons trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals through IP<sub>3</sub>- and glutamate transporter-dependent mechanisms, dopamine released in distant sites activates astrocytes via dopaminergic receptors. However, little is known about the modulatory effects of dopamine on glutamate-evoked astrocytic activity. To investigate this question, we developed multi-compartment, conductance-based astrocyte models with three distinct morphologies: unipolar; bipolar; and bifurcated-terminal. Glutamate induced localized responses, while dopamine activated all compartments. In the unipolar model, global dopaminergic stimulation reduced the threshold frequency of glutamatergic stimulation required to activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Phase-plane analysis of a simplified version of this model revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are influenced by compartment radius and neurotransmitter type. Morphology significantly influenced glutamate-dopamine interactions. In the bipolar model, glutamatergic stimulation in one process minimally affected the other. Conversely, in the bifurcated-terminal model, where a single process bifurcates into two secondary processes, high-frequency glutamatergic stimulation in one secondary process evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the other. Dopamine further facilitated this latter cross-process interaction by lowering the glutamatergic stimulation frequency needed to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the adjacent secondary process. These findings suggest that dopamine enhances the initiation and propagation of glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, with the extent of propagation depending on astrocytic morphology and the spatial distribution of glutamatergic inputs.

                <p>by Moritz Grosse-Wentrup, Akshey Kumar, Anja Meunier, Manuel Zimmer</p>

Explaining how neuronal activity gives rise to cognition arguably remains the most significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience. We introduce neuro-cognitive multilevel causal modeling (NC-MCM), a framework that bridges the explanatory gap between neuronal activity and cognition by construing cognitive states as (behaviorally and dynamically) causally consistent abstractions of neuronal states. Multilevel causal modeling allows us to interchangeably reason about the neuronal- and cognitive causes of behavior while maintaining a physicalist (in contrast to a strong dualist) position. We introduce an algorithm for learning cognitive-level causal models from neuronal activation patterns and demonstrate its ability to learn cognitive states of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> from calcium imaging data. We show that the cognitive-level model of the NC-MCM framework provides a concise representation of the neuronal manifold of <i>C. elegans</i> and its relation to behavior as a graph, which, in contrast to other neuronal manifold learning algorithms, supports causal reasoning. We conclude the article by arguing that the ability of the NC-MCM framework to learn causally interpretable abstractions of neuronal dynamics and their relation to behavior in a purely data-driven fashion is essential for understanding biological systems whose complexity prohibits the development of hand-crafted computational models.

In the realm of infectious disease control, accurate modeling of the transmission dynamics is pivotal. As human mobility and commuting patterns are key components of communicable disease spread, we introduce a novel travel time aware metapopulation model. Our model aims to enhance estimations of disease transmission. By providing more reliable assessments on the efficacy of interventions, curtailing personal rights or human mobility behavior through interventions can be minimized. The proposed model is an advancement over traditional compartmental models, integrating explicit transmission on travel and commute, a factor available in agent-based models but often neglected with metapopulation models. Our approach employs a multi-edge graph ODE-based (Graph-ODE) model, which represents the intricate interplay between mobility and disease spread. This granular modeling is particularly important when assessing the dynamics in densely connected urban areas or when heterogeneous structures across entire countries have to be assessed. The given approach can be coupled with any kind of ODE-based model. In addition, we propose a novel multi-layer waning immunity model that integrates waning of different paces for protection against mild and severe courses of the disease. As this is of particular interest for late-phase epidemic or endemic scenarios, we consider the late-phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. The results of this work show that accounting for resolved mobility significantly influences the pattern of outbreaks. The improved model provides a refined tool for predicting outbreak trajectories and evaluating intervention strategies in relation to mobility by allowing us to assess the transmission that result on traveling. The insights derived from this model can serve as a basis for decisions on the implementation or suspension of interventions, such as mandatory masks on public transportation. Eventually, our model contributes to maintaining mobility as a social good while reducing exuberant disease dynamics potentially driven by travel activities.

                <p>by Siwen Zhao, Xuguang Jiang, Ning Li, Tao Wang</p>

Phospholipids are critical building blocks of mitochondria, and proper mitochondrial function and architecture rely on phospholipids that are primarily transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we show that mitochondrial form and function rely on synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the ER through phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS), trafficking of PS from ER to mitochondria (and within mitochondria), and the conversion of PS to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Using a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that Slowmo (SLMO) specifically transfers PS from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the IMM within the inner boundary membrane (IBM) domain. Thus, SLMO is required for shaping mitochondrial morphology, but its putative conserved binding partner, dTRIAP, is not. Importantly, SLMO’s role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology is conserved in humans via the SLMO2 protein and is independent of mitochondrial dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of a conserved PSS-SLMO-PISD pathway in maintaining the structure and function of mitochondria.

                Abstract Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation therapy improved motor status compared to rehabilitation alone in the phase III VNS-REHAB stroke trial, but treatment response was variable and not associated with any clinical measures acquired at baseline, such as age or side of paresis. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures would be associated with treatment-related gains, examining performance of regional injury measures versus global brain health measures in parallel with clinical measures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the VNS-REHAB trial were used to derive regional injury measures (extent of injury to corticospinal tract, the primary regional measure; plus extent of injury to precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus; lesion volume; and lesion topography) and global brain health measures (degree of white matter hyperintensities, the primary global brain measure; plus volumes of cerebrospinal fluid, cortical gray matter, white matter, each thalamus, and total brain). Eight clinical measures assessed at baseline were also evaluated (treatment group, age, race, gender, paretic side, pre-stroke dominant hand, time since stroke, and baseline Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score). Bivariate analyses compared each measure with the primary trial end point (change in Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score from baseline to end of 6 weeks of treatment) across all subjects, with secondary analyses examining trial groups separately.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRIs were available from 80 patients (age = 59.8 ± 9.5 years, 29 women). Across all patients, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.028) at baseline was associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. In the VNS group, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and larger ipsilesional thalamus volume (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.046) were each associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses tested the interaction that each baseline measure had with treatment group and found that the model examining white matter hyperintensities had a significant interaction term, indicating 2.3 less change in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) points in the VNS group relative to the control group for each point increase in modified Fazekas scale.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging measures are associated with extent of gains on the primary endpoint of a phase III stroke recovery trial. Among the neuroimaging measures examined, a measure of global brain health (extent of white matter hyperintensities) was better at explaining the change in arm impairment as compared with measures of regional injury; this was true when examining all study subjects as well as only those in the VNS group and is consistent with the global mechanism of action that VNS has throughout the cerebrum. Future studies can evaluate additional measures that further predict response to VNS therapy. The current findings suggest that individual patient neuroimaging results may be useful for a personalized medicine approach to stroke recovery therapeutics. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<p>Because imagination activates the same neural circuits used in understanding the present, one can access that imagination even in non-linguistic animals through decoding techniques applied to large neural ensembles. This personal retrospective traces the history of the initial discovery that hippocampal theta sequences sweep forward to goals during moments of deliberation and discusses the history that was necessary to put ourselves in the position to recognize this signal. It also discusses how that discovery fits into the larger picture of hippocampal function and the concept of cognition as computation.</p>

                This study demonstrates that hippocampal activity during remote recall is crucial for the reconsolidation of remote memory, also called systems reconsolidation, with new hippocampal engram cells recruited to enable memory updating. The findings reveal that adult neurogenesis supports this recruitment process and the role of mPFC projections to the hippocampus and amygdala in systems reconsolidation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93778">Identification of an early subset of cerebellar nuclei neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons serve as the primary output of the cerebellum and originate from the cerebellar primordium at early stages of cerebellar development. These neurons are diverse, integrating information from the cerebellar cortex and relaying it to various brain regions. Employing various methodologies, we have characterized a specific subset of CN neurons that do not originate from the rhombic lip or ventricular zone of the cerebellar primordium. Embryos were collected at early stages of development and processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, in situ hybridization (ISH), embryonic culture, DiI labeling, and flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Our findings indicate that a subset of CN neurons expressing α-synuclein (SNCA), OTX2, MEIS2, and p75NTR (NGFR) are located in the rostroventral region of the NTZ. While CN neurons derived from the rhombic lip are positioned in the caudodorsal area of the NTZ in the cerebellar primordium. Utilizing Otx2-GFP and <i>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, we have determined that these cells do not originate from the germinal zone of the cerebellar primordium. These results suggest the existence of a novel extrinsic germinal zone for the cerebellar primordium, possibly the mesencephalon, from which early CN neurons originate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99914">Biochemical and neurophysiological effects of deficiency of the mitochondrial import protein TIMM50</a></h4>

              
                TIMM50, an essential TIM23 complex subunit, is suggested to facilitate the import of ~60% of the mitochondrial proteome. In this study, we characterized a <i>TIMM50</i> disease-causing mutation in human fibroblasts and noted significant decreases in TIM23 core protein levels (TIMM50, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM23). Strikingly, TIMM50 deficiency had no impact on the steady-state levels of most of its putative substrates, suggesting that even low levels of a functional TIM23 complex are sufficient to maintain the majority of TIM23 complex-dependent mitochondrial proteome. As TIMM50 mutations have been linked to severe neurological phenotypes, we aimed to characterize TIMM50 defects in manipulated mammalian neurons. TIMM50 knockdown in mouse neurons had a minor effect on the steady state level of most of the mitochondrial proteome, supporting the results observed in patient fibroblasts. Amongst the few affected TIM23 substrates, a decrease in the steady state level of components of the intricate oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ribosome complexes was evident. This led to declined respiration rates in fibroblasts and neurons, reduced cellular ATP levels, and defective mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal processes, possibly contributing to the developmental defects observed in patients with TIMM50 disease. Finally, increased electrical activity was observed in TIMM50 deficient mice neuronal cells, which correlated with reduced levels of KCNJ10 and KCNA2 plasma membrane potassium channels, likely underlying the patients’ epileptic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89892">Unsupervised discovery of family specific vocal usage in the Mongolian gerbil</a></h4>

              
                In nature, animal vocalizations can provide crucial information about identity, including kinship and hierarchy. However, lab-based vocal behavior is typically studied during brief interactions between animals with no prior social relationship, and under environmental conditions with limited ethological relevance. Here, we address this gap by establishing long-term acoustic recordings from Mongolian gerbil families, a core social group that uses an array of sonic and ultrasonic vocalizations. Three separate gerbil families were transferred to an enlarged environment and continuous 20-day audio recordings were obtained. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to quantify 583,237 vocalizations, we show that gerbils exhibit a more elaborate vocal repertoire than has been previously reported and that vocal repertoire usage differs significantly by family. By performing gaussian mixture model clustering on the VAE latent space, we show that families preferentially use characteristic sets of vocal clusters and that these usage preferences remain stable over weeks. Furthermore, gerbils displayed family-specific transitions between vocal clusters. Since gerbils live naturally as extended families in complex underground burrows that are adjacent to other families, these results suggest the presence of a vocal dialect which could be exploited by animals to represent kinship. These findings position the Mongolian gerbil as a compelling animal model to study the neural basis of vocal communication and demonstrates the potential for using unsupervised machine learning with uninterrupted acoustic recordings to gain insights into naturalistic animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95547">Microstructural asymmetries of the planum temporale predict functional lateralization of auditory-language processing</a></h4>

              
                Structural hemispheric asymmetry has long been assumed to guide functional lateralization of the human brain, but empirical evidence for this compelling hypothesis remains scarce. Recently, it has been suggested that microstructural asymmetries may be more relevant to functional lateralization than macrostructural asymmetries. To investigate the link between microstructure and function, we analyzed multimodal MRI data in 907 right-handed participants. We quantified structural asymmetry and functional lateralization of the planum temporale (PT), a cortical area crucial for auditory-language processing. We found associations between PT functional lateralization and several structural asymmetries, such as surface area, intracortical myelin content, neurite density, and neurite orientation dispersion. The PT structure also showed hemispheric-specific coupling with its functional activity. All these functional-structural associations are highly specific to within-PT functional activity during auditory-language processing. These results suggest that structural asymmetry underlies functional lateralization of the same brain area and highlights a critical role of microstructural PT asymmetries in auditory-language processing.
