              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19740">Linton Stereo Illusion: Response on Johnston (1991)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (Linton, 2024) I present a new illusion (the 'Linton Stereo Illusion') that challenges our understanding of stereo vision. A vision scientist has shared their own analysis of the 'Linton Stereo Illusion' (titled: 'There is no challenge to our understanding of stereo vision: Response to Linton and Kriegeskorte (ECVP 2024 and ArXiv:2408.00770)') claiming that the 'Linton Stereo Illusion' is fully explained by Johnston (1991). I regard Johnston (1991) as one of the most important stereo vision papers in our young (< 200-year-old) field, and so this challenge requires a response. In this paper I explain why Johnston (1991) cannot explain the 'Linton Stereo Illusion'. Indeed, Johnston (1991) makes predictions that are the exact opposite of those observed in the 'Linton Stereo Illusion'. I also highlight a key concern with Johnston (1991)'s account that has so far been overlooked. Johnston (1991)'s account predicts that vergence eye movements will cause massive stereo distortions, leading to a world of unstable stereo perception. But this simply does not reflect our visual experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19750">The Geometry of Concepts: Sparse Autoencoder Feature Structure</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders have recently produced dictionaries of high-dimensional vectors corresponding to the universe of concepts represented by large language models. We find that this concept universe has interesting structure at three levels: 1) The "atomic" small-scale structure contains "crystals" whose faces are parallelograms or trapezoids, generalizing well-known examples such as (man-woman-king-queen). We find that the quality of such parallelograms and associated function vectors improves greatly when projecting out global distractor directions such as word length, which is efficiently done with linear discriminant analysis. 2) The "brain" intermediate-scale structure has significant spatial modularity; for example, math and code features form a "lobe" akin to functional lobes seen in neural fMRI images. We quantify the spatial locality of these lobes with multiple metrics and find that clusters of co-occurring features, at coarse enough scale, also cluster together spatially far more than one would expect if feature geometry were random. 3) The "galaxy" scale large-scale structure of the feature point cloud is not isotropic, but instead has a power law of eigenvalues with steepest slope in middle layers. We also quantify how the clustering entropy depends on the layer.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19953">EEG Based Decoding of the Perception and Regulation of Taboo Words</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In daily interactions, emotions are frequently conveyed and triggered through verbal exchanges. Sometimes, we must modulate our emotional reactions to align with societal norms. Among the emotional words, taboo words represent a specific category that has been poorly studied. One intriguing question is whether these word categories can be predicted from EEG responses with the use of machine learning methods. To address this question, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to decode the word categories from Event Related Potential (ERP) in 40 native Italian speakers. 240 neutral, negative and taboo words were used to this aim. Results indicate that the SVM classifier successfully distinguished between the three-word categories, with significant differences in neural activity ascribed to the late positive potential mainly detected in the central-parietal-occipital and anterior right scalp areas in the time windows of 450-649 ms and 650-850 ms. These findings were in line with the established distribution pattern of the late positive potential. Intriguingly, the study also revealed that word categories were still detectable in the regulate condition. This study extends previous results on the domain of the cortical responses of taboo words, and how machine learning methods can be used to predict word categories from EEG responses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20037">Roles of LLMs in the Overall Mental Architecture</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand existing LLMs, we may examine the human mental (cognitive/psychological) architecture, and its components and structures. Based on psychological, philosophical, and cognitive science literatures, it is argued that, within the human mental architecture, existing LLMs correspond well with implicit mental processes (intuition, instinct, and so on). However, beyond such implicit processes, explicit processes (with better symbolic capabilities) are also present within the human mental architecture, judging from psychological, philosophical, and cognitive science literatures. Various theoretical and empirical issues and questions in this regard are explored. Furthermore, it is argued that existing dual-process computational cognitive architectures (models of the human cognitive/psychological architecture) provide usable frameworks for fundamentally enhancing LLMs by introducing dual processes (both implicit and explicit) and, in the meantime, can also be enhanced by LLMs. The results are synergistic combinations (in several different senses simultaneously).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20053">LinBridge: A Learnable Framework for Interpreting Nonlinear Neural Encoding Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural encoding of artificial neural networks (ANNs) links their computational representations to brain responses, offering insights into how the brain processes information. Current studies mostly use linear encoding models for clarity, even though brain responses are often nonlinear. This has sparked interest in developing nonlinear encoding models that are still interpretable. To address this problem, we propose LinBridge, a learnable and flexible framework based on Jacobian analysis for interpreting nonlinear encoding models. LinBridge posits that the nonlinear mapping between ANN representations and neural responses can be factorized into a linear inherent component that approximates the complex nonlinear relationship, and a mapping bias that captures sample-selective nonlinearity. The Jacobian matrix, which reflects output change rates relative to input, enables the analysis of sample-selective mapping in nonlinear models. LinBridge employs a self-supervised learning strategy to extract both the linear inherent component and nonlinear mapping biases from the Jacobian matrices of the test set, allowing it to adapt effectively to various nonlinear encoding models. We validate the LinBridge framework in the scenario of neural visual encoding, using computational visual representations from CLIP-ViT to predict brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the linear inherent component extracted by LinBridge accurately reflects the complex mappings of nonlinear neural encoding models; 2) the sample-selective mapping bias elucidates the variability of nonlinearity across different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. This study presents a novel tool for interpreting nonlinear neural encoding models and offers fresh evidence about hierarchical nonlinearity distribution in the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20735">Murine AI excels at cats and cheese: Structural differences between human and mouse neurons and their implementation in generative AIs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mouse and human brains have different functions that depend on their neuronal networks. In this study, we analyzed nanometer-scale three-dimensional structures of brain tissues of the mouse medial prefrontal cortex and compared them with structures of the human anterior cingulate cortex. The obtained results indicated that mouse neuronal somata are smaller and neurites are thinner than those of human neurons. These structural features allow mouse neurons to be integrated in the limited space of the brain, though thin neurites should suppress distal connections according to cable theory. We implemented this mouse-mimetic constraint in convolutional layers of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which were then subjected to image generation tasks using photo datasets of cat faces, cheese, human faces, and birds. The mouse-mimetic GAN outperformed a standard GAN in the image generation task using the cat faces and cheese photo datasets, but underperformed for human faces and birds. The mouse-mimetic DDIM gave similar results, suggesting that the nature of the datasets affected the results. Analyses of the four datasets indicated differences in their image entropy, which should influence the number of parameters required for image generation. The preferences of the mouse-mimetic AIs coincided with the impressions commonly associated with mice. The relationship between the neuronal network and brain function should be investigated by implementing other biological findings in artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2410.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust recording and decoding from the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for advances in human-machine interfacing. However, technologies used to directly measure CNS activity are limited by their resolution, sensitivity to interferences, and invasiveness. Advances in muscle recordings and deep learning allow us to decode the spiking activity of spinal motor neurons (MNs) in real time and with high accuracy. MNs represent the motor output layer of the CNS, receiving and sampling signals originating in different regions in the nervous system, and generating the neural commands that control muscles. The input signals to MNs can be estimated from the MN outputs. Here we argue that peripheral neural interfaces using muscle sensors represent a promising, non-invasive approach to estimate some neural activity from the CNS that reaches the MNs but does not directly modulate force production. We also discuss the evidence supporting this concept, and the necessary advances to consolidate and test MN-based CNS interfaces in controlled and real-world settings.

                arXiv:2410.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of neural power spectra plays a crucial role in understanding brain function and dysfunction. While recent efforts have led to the development of methods for decomposing spectral data, challenges remain in performing statistical analysis and group-level comparisons. Here, we introduce Bayesian Spectral Decomposition (BSD), a Bayesian framework for analysing neural spectral power. BSD allows for the specification, inversion, comparison, and analysis of parametric models of neural spectra, addressing limitations of existing methods. We first establish the face validity of BSD on simulated data and show how it outperforms an established method (\fooof{}) for peak detection on artificial spectral data. We then demonstrate the efficacy of BSD on a group-level study of EEG spectra in 204 healthy subjects from the LEMON dataset. Our results not only highlight the effectiveness of BSD in model selection and parameter estimation, but also illustrate how BSD enables straightforward group-level regression of the effect of continuous covariates such as age. By using Bayesian inference techniques, BSD provides a robust framework for studying neural spectral data and their relationship to brain function and dysfunction.

Abstract: Introduction Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, and early diagnosis is key to improving outcomes. Its complexity makes predicting onset and progression challenging. EEG has emerged as a valuable tool for studying schizophrenia, with machine learning increasingly applied for diagnosis. This paper assesses the accuracy of ML models for predicting schizophrenia and examines the impact of stress during EEG recording on model performance. We integrate acute stress prediction into the analysis, showing that overlapping conditions like stress during recording can negatively affect model accuracy.
  Methods Four XGBoost models were built: one for stress prediction, two to classify schizophrenia (at rest and task), and a model to predict schizophrenia for both conditions. XAI techniques were applied to analyze results. Experiments tested the generalization of schizophrenia models using their datasets' healthy controls and independent health-screened controls. The stress model identified high-stress subjects, who were excluded from further analysis. A novel method was used to adjust EEG frequency band power to remove stress artifacts, improving predictive model performance.
  Results Our results show that acute stress vary across EEG sessions, affecting model performance and accuracy. Generalization improved once these varying stress levels were considered and compensated for during model training. Our findings highlight the importance of thorough health screening and management of the patient's condition during the process. Stress induced during or by the EEG recording can adversely affect model generalization. This may require further preprocessing of data by treating stress as an additional physiological artifact. Our proposed approach to compensate for stress artifacts in EEG data used for training models showed a significant improvement in predictive performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19793">Single-word Auditory Attention Decoding Using Deep Learning Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying auditory attention by comparing auditory stimuli and corresponding brain responses, is known as auditory attention decoding (AAD). The majority of AAD algorithms utilize the so-called envelope entrainment mechanism, whereby auditory attention is identified by how the envelope of the auditory stream drives variation in the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. However, neural processing can also be decoded based on endogenous cognitive responses, in this case, neural responses evoked by attention to specific words in a speech stream. This approach is largely unexplored in the field of AAD but leads to a single-word auditory attention decoding problem in which an epoch of an EEG signal timed to a specific word is labeled as attended or unattended. This paper presents a deep learning approach, based on EEGNet, to address this challenge. We conducted a subject-independent evaluation on an event-based AAD dataset with three different paradigms: word category oddball, word category with competing speakers, and competing speech streams with targets. The results demonstrate that the adapted model is capable of exploiting cognitive-related spatiotemporal EEG features and achieving at least 58% accuracy on the most realistic competing paradigm for the unseen subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with this problem.

                arXiv:2410.19810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal training of a vision transformer for brain encoding depends on three factors: model size, data size, and computational resources. This study investigates these three pillars, focusing on the effects of data scaling, model scaling, and high-performance computing on brain encoding results. Using VideoGPT to extract efficient spatiotemporal features from videos and training a Ridge model to predict brain activity based on these features, we conducted benchmark experiments with varying data sizes (10k, 100k, 1M, 6M) and different model configurations of GPT-2, including hidden layer dimensions, number of layers, and number of attention heads. We also evaluated the effects of training models with 32-bit vs 16-bit floating point representations. Our results demonstrate that increasing the hidden layer dimensions significantly improves brain encoding performance, as evidenced by higher Pearson correlation coefficients across all subjects. In contrast, the number of attention heads does not have a significant effect on the encoding results. Additionally, increasing the number of layers shows some improvement in brain encoding correlations, but the trend is not as consistent as that observed with hidden layer dimensions. The data scaling results show that larger training datasets lead to improved brain encoding performance, with the highest Pearson correlation coefficients observed for the largest dataset size (6M). These findings highlight that the effects of data scaling are more significant compared to model scaling in enhancing brain encoding performance. Furthermore, we explored the impact of floating-point precision by comparing 32-bit and 16-bit representations. Training with 16-bit precision yielded the same brain encoding accuracy as 32-bit, while reducing training time by 1.17 times, demonstrating its efficiency for high-performance computing tasks.

                arXiv:2410.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.

Abstract: The initial sections of the paper give a concise presentation, specially designed for a mathematically oriented audience, of some of the most basic facts on the functional architecture of early vision. Such information is usually scattered in a variety of papers and books, which are not easily accessible by non-specialists. Our goal is thus to offer a handy and short introduction to this topics, which might be helpful for researchers willing to enter the area of the applications of modern Differential Geometry in studies on the visual systems, baptized neurogeometry by J. Petitot. We then offer a survey of three of the most important neurogeometric models: Petitot's contact model of the primary visual cortex, its extension to A. Sarti, G. Citti and J. Petitot's symplectic model, and P. C. Bressloff and J. D. Cowan's spherical model of hypercolumns. We finally discuss the main points of the so-called ``conformal model'' for hypercolumns (a model that was briefly presented in [D. V. Alekseevsky, Conformal model of hypercolumns in V1 cortex and the Moebius group, in ``Geometric science of information'', pp. 65--72, Springer, 2021] and given in detail in [D. V. Alekseevsky and A. Spiro, Conformal models for hypercolumns in the primary visual cortex V1, arXiv 2024]), which can be considered as a synthesis of the symplectic and the spherical models.

                arXiv:2310.15173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standardizing terminology to annotate electrophysiological events can improve both computational research and clinical care. Sharing data enriched with standard terms can facilitate data exploration, from case studies to mega-analyses. The machine readability of such electrophysiological event annotations is essential for performing analyses efficiently across software tools and packages. Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) provide a framework for describing events in neuroscience experiments. HED library schemas extend the standard HED schema vocabulary to include specialized vocabularies, such as standardized clinical terms for electrophysiological events. The Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) defines terms for annotating EEG events, including artifacts. This study developed a HED library schema for SCORE, making the terms machine-readable. We demonstrate that the HED-SCORE library schema can be used to annotate events in EEG data stored in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Clinicians and researchers worldwide can now use the HED-SCORE library schema to annotate and compute on electrophysiological data obtained from the human brain.

                arXiv:2312.05484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmark features of neocortical anatomy is the presence of extensive top-down projections into primary sensory areas, with many impinging on the distal apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. While it is known that they exert a modulatory effect, altering the gain of responses, their functional role remains an active area of research. It is hypothesized that these top-down projections carry contextual information that can help animals to resolve ambiguities in sensory data. One proposed mechanism of contextual integration is a non-linear integration of distinct input streams at apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Computationally, however, it is yet to be demonstrated how such an architecture could leverage distinct compartments for flexible contextual integration and sensory processing when both sensory and context signals can be unreliable. Here, we implement an augmented deep neural network with distinct apical and basal compartments that integrates a) contextual information from top-down projections to apical compartments, and b) sensory representations driven by bottom-up projections to basal compartments, via a biophysically inspired rule. In addition, we develop a new multi-scenario contextual integration task using a generative image modeling approach. In addition to generalizing previous contextual integration tasks, it better captures the diversity of scenarios where neither contextual nor sensory information are fully reliable. To solve this task, this model successfully learns to select among integration strategies. We find that our model outperforms those without the "apical prior" when contextual information contradicts sensory input. Altogether, this suggests that the apical prior and biophysically inspired integration rule could be key components necessary for handling the ambiguities that animals encounter in the diverse contexts of the real world.

                arXiv:2409.17510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.

Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes as it allows for the functional organization of the brain to be captured without relying on a specific task or stimuli. In this paper, we present a novel modeling architecture called BrainRGIN for predicting intelligence (fluid, crystallized, and total intelligence) using graph neural networks on rsfMRI derived static functional network connectivity matrices. Extending from the existing graph convolution networks, our approach incorporates a clustering-based embedding and graph isomorphism network in the graph convolutional layer to reflect the nature of the brain sub-network organization and efficient network expression, in combination with TopK pooling and attention-based readout functions. We evaluated our proposed architecture on a large dataset, specifically the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset, and demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting individual differences in intelligence. Our model achieved lower mean squared errors and higher correlation scores than existing relevant graph architectures and other traditional machine learning models for all of the intelligence prediction tasks. The middle frontal gyrus exhibited a significant contribution to both fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting their pivotal role in these cognitive processes. Total composite scores identified a diverse set of brain regions to be relevant which underscores the complex nature of total intelligence.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be state-of-the-art models for visual cortical neurons. Cortical neurons in the primary visual cortex are sensitive to contextual information mediated by extensive horizontal and feedback connections. Standard CNNs integrate global contextual information to model contextual modulation via two mechanisms: successive convolutions and a fully connected readout layer. In this paper, we find that self-attention (SA), an implementation of non-local network mechanisms, can improve neural response predictions over parameter-matched CNNs in two key metrics: tuning curve correlation and peak tuning. We introduce peak tuning as a metric to evaluate a model's ability to capture a neuron's feature preference. We factorize networks to assess each context mechanism, revealing that information in the local receptive field is most important for modeling overall tuning, but surround information is critically necessary for characterizing the tuning peak. We find that self-attention can replace posterior spatial-integration convolutions when learned incrementally, and is further enhanced in the presence of a fully connected readout layer, suggesting that the two context mechanisms are complementary. Finally, we find that decomposing receptive field learning and contextual modulation learning in an incremental manner may be an effective and robust mechanism for learning surround-center interactions.

Abstract: Designing optimization approaches, whether heuristic or meta-heuristic, usually demands extensive manual intervention and has difficulty generalizing across diverse problem domains. The combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offers a promising new approach to overcome these limitations and make optimization more automated. In this setup, LLMs act as dynamic agents that can generate, refine, and interpret optimization strategies, while EAs efficiently explore complex solution spaces through evolutionary operators. Since this synergy enables a more efficient and creative search process, we first conduct an extensive review of recent research on the application of LLMs in optimization. We focus on LLMs' dual functionality as solution generators and algorithm designers. Then, we summarize the common and valuable designs in existing work and propose a novel LLM-EA paradigm for automated optimization. Furthermore, centered on this paradigm, we conduct an in-depth analysis of innovative methods for three key components: individual representation, variation operators, and fitness evaluation. We address challenges related to heuristic generation and solution exploration, especially from the LLM prompts' perspective. Our systematic review and thorough analysis of the paradigm can assist researchers in better understanding the current research and promoting the development of combining LLMs with EAs for automated optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21274">High-level hybridization of heuristics and metaheuristics to solve symmetric TSP: a comparative study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP is one of the most explored problems in the scientific literature to solve real problems regarding the economy, transportation, and logistics, to cite a few cases. Adapting TSP to solve different problems has originated several variants of the optimization problem with more complex objectives and different restrictions. Metaheuristics have been used to solve the problem in polynomial time. Several studies have tried hybridising metaheuristics with specialised heuristics to improve the quality of the solutions. However, we have found no study to evaluate whether the searching mechanism of a particular metaheuristic is more adequate for exploring hybridization. This paper focuses on the solution of the classical TSP using high-level hybridisations, experimenting with eight metaheuristics and heuristics derived from k-OPT, SISR, and segment intersection search, resulting in twenty-four combinations. Some combinations allow more than one set of searching parameters. Problems with 50 to 280 cities are solved. Parameter tuning of the metaheuristics is not carried out, exploiting the different searching patterns of the eight metaheuristics instead. The solutions' quality is compared to those presented in the literature.

                arXiv:2410.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to solve the problem of finding obstacle-free paths for autonomous agents operating in stochastic and uncertain environments. However, when the underlying stochastic dynamics of the environment experiences drastic distribution shifts, the optimal policy obtained in the trained environment may be sub-optimal or may entirely fail in helping find goal-reaching paths for the agent. Approaches like domain randomization and robust RL can provide robust policies, but typically assume minor (bounded) distribution shifts. For substantial distribution shifts, retraining (either with a warm-start policy or from scratch) is an alternative approach. In this paper, we develop a novel approach called {\em Evolutionary Robust Policy Optimization} (ERPO), an adaptive re-training algorithm inspired by evolutionary game theory (EGT). ERPO learns an optimal policy for the shifted environment iteratively using a temperature parameter that controls the trade off between exploration and adherence to the old optimal policy. The policy update itself is an instantiation of the replicator dynamics used in EGT. We show that under fairly common sparsity assumptions on rewards in such environments, ERPO converges to the optimal policy in the shifted environment. We empirically demonstrate that for path finding tasks in a number of environments, ERPO outperforms several popular RL and deep RL algorithms (PPO, A3C, DQN) in many scenarios and popular environments. This includes scenarios where the RL algorithms are allowed to train from scratch in the new environment, when they are retrained on the new environment, or when they are used in conjunction with domain randomization. ERPO shows faster policy adaptation, higher average rewards, and reduced computational costs in policy adaptation.

                arXiv:2410.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current quantum computing paradigm, significant focus is placed on the reduction or mitigation of quantum decoherence. When designing new quantum processing units, the general objective is to reduce the amount of noise qubits are subject to, and in algorithm design, a large effort is underway to provide scalable error correction or mitigation techniques. Yet some previous work has indicated that certain classes of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, may, in fact, be intrinsically robust to or even benefit from the presence of a small amount of noise. Here, we demonstrate that noise levels in quantum hardware can be effectively tuned to enhance the ability of quantum neural networks to generalize data, acting akin to regularisation in classical neural networks. As an example, we consider a medical regression task, where, by tuning the noise level in the circuit, we improved the mean squared error loss by 8%.

                arXiv:2410.20297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in their potential for application within the military domain. However, the current generation of LLMs demonstrate sub-optimal performance on Army use cases, due to the prevalence of domain-specific vocabulary and jargon. In order to fully leverage LLMs in-domain, many organizations have turned to fine-tuning to circumvent the prohibitive costs involved in training new LLMs from scratch. In light of this trend, we explore the viability of adapting open-source LLMs for usage in the Army domain in order to address their existing lack of domain-specificity. Our investigations have resulted in the creation of three distinct generations of TRACLM, a family of LLMs fine-tuned by The Research and Analysis Center (TRAC), Army Futures Command (AFC). Through continuous refinement of our training pipeline, each successive iteration of TRACLM displayed improved capabilities when applied to Army tasks and use cases. Furthermore, throughout our fine-tuning experiments, we recognized the need for an evaluation framework that objectively quantifies the Army domain-specific knowledge of LLMs. To address this, we developed MilBench, an extensible software framework that efficiently evaluates the Army knowledge of a given LLM using tasks derived from doctrine and assessments. We share preliminary results, models, methods, and recommendations on the creation of TRACLM and MilBench. Our work significantly informs the development of LLM technology across the DoD and augments senior leader decisions with respect to artificial intelligence integration.

                arXiv:2410.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking is a technique that involves embedding nearly unnoticeable statistical signals within generated content to help trace its source. This work focuses on a scenario where an untrusted third-party user sends prompts to a trusted language model (LLM) provider, who then generates a text from their LLM with a watermark. This setup makes it possible for a detector to later identify the source of the text if the user publishes it. The user can modify the generated text by substitutions, insertions, or deletions. Our objective is to develop a statistical method to detect if a published text is LLM-generated from the perspective of a detector. We further propose a methodology to segment the published text into watermarked and non-watermarked sub-strings. The proposed approach is built upon randomization tests and change point detection techniques. We demonstrate that our method ensures Type I and Type II error control and can accurately identify watermarked sub-strings by finding the corresponding change point locations. To validate our technique, we apply it to texts generated by several language models with prompts extracted from Google's C4 dataset and obtain encouraging numerical results. We release all code publicly at https://github.com/doccstat/llm-watermark-cpd.

                arXiv:2410.21265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An old idea in optimization theory says that since the gradient is a dual vector it may not be subtracted from the weights without first being mapped to the primal space where the weights reside. We take this idea seriously in this paper and construct such a duality map for general neural networks. Our map, which we call modular dualization, forms a unifying theoretical basis for training algorithms that are a) fast and b) scalable. Modular dualization involves first assigning operator norms to layers based on the semantics of each layer, and then using these layerwise norms to recursively induce a duality map on the weight space of the full neural architecture. We conclude by deriving GPU-friendly algorithms for dualizing Embed, Linear and Conv2D layers -- the latter two methods are based on a new rectangular Newton-Schulz iteration that we propose. Our iteration was recently used to set new speed records for training NanoGPT. Overall, we hope that our theory of modular duality will yield a next generation of fast and scalable optimizers for general neural architectures.

                arXiv:2211.12714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developmental plasticity plays a prominent role in shaping the brain's structure during ongoing learning in response to dynamically changing environments. However, the existing network compression methods for deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) draw little inspiration from brain's developmental plasticity mechanisms, thus limiting their ability to learn efficiently, rapidly, and accurately. This paper proposed a developmental plasticity-inspired adaptive pruning (DPAP) method, with inspiration from the adaptive developmental pruning of dendritic spines, synapses, and neurons according to the ``use it or lose it, gradually decay" principle. The proposed DPAP model considers multiple biologically realistic mechanisms (such as dendritic spine dynamic plasticity, activity-dependent neural spiking trace, and local synaptic plasticity), with additional adaptive pruning strategy, so that the network structure can be dynamically optimized during learning without any pre-training and retraining. Extensive comparative experiments show consistent and remarkable performance and speed boost with the extremely compressed networks on a diverse set of benchmark tasks for deep ANNs and SNNs, especially the spatio-temporal joint pruning of SNNs in neuromorphic datasets. This work explores how developmental plasticity enables complex deep networks to gradually evolve into brain-like efficient and compact structures, eventually achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for biologically realistic SNNs.

                arXiv:2309.09550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain can self-organize rich and diverse sparse neural pathways to incrementally master hundreds of cognitive tasks. However, most existing continual learning algorithms for deep artificial and spiking neural networks are unable to adequately auto-regulate the limited resources in the network, which leads to performance drop along with energy consumption rise as the increase of tasks. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired continual learning algorithm with adaptive reorganization of neural pathways, which employs Self-Organizing Regulation networks to reorganize the single and limited Spiking Neural Network (SOR-SNN) into rich sparse neural pathways to efficiently cope with incremental tasks. The proposed model demonstrates consistent superiority in performance, energy consumption, and memory capacity on diverse continual learning tasks ranging from child-like simple to complex tasks, as well as on generalized CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, the SOR-SNN model excels at learning more complex tasks as well as more tasks, and is able to integrate the past learned knowledge with the information from the current task, showing the backward transfer ability to facilitate the old tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed model exhibits self-repairing ability to irreversible damage and for pruned networks, could automatically allocate new pathway from the retained network to recover memory for forgotten knowledge.

Abstract: Objective: This work explores use of a few-shot transfer learning method to train and implement a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) on a BrainChip Akida AKD1000 neuromorphic system-on-chip for developing individual-level, instead of traditionally used group-level, models using electroencephalographic data. Main Results: Efficacy of the above methodology to develop individual-specific braking intention predictive models by rapidly adapting the group-level model in as few as three training epochs while achieving at least 90% accuracy, true positive rate and true negative rate is presented. Further, results show the energy-efficiency of the neuromorphic hardware through a power reduction of over 97% with only a $1.3* increase in latency when using the Akida AKD1000 processor for network inference compared to an Intel Xeon central processing unit. Similar results were obtained in a subsequent ablation study using a subset of five out of 19 channels.

Abstract: To adapt to real-world dynamics, intelligent systems need to assimilate new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to a degradation in performance on old tasks. To address this, continual learning concept is proposed for enabling autonomous systems to acquire new knowledge and dynamically adapt to changing environments. Specifically, energy-efficient continual learning is needed to ensure the functionality of autonomous systems under tight compute and memory resource budgets (i.e., so-called autonomous embedded systems). Neuromorphic computing, with brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers inherent advantages for enabling low-power/energy continual learning in autonomous embedded systems. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the foundations and methods for enabling continual learning in neural networks, then analyze the state-of-the-art works considering SNNs. Afterward, comparative analyses of existing methods are conducted while considering crucial design factors, such as network complexity, memory, latency, and power/energy efficiency. We also explore the practical applications that can benefit from SNN-based continual learning and open challenges in real-world scenarios. In this manner, our survey provides valuable insights into the recent advancements of SNN-based continual learning for real-world application use-cases.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art synchrony-based models encode object bindings with complex-valued activations and compute with real-valued weights in feedforward architectures. We argue for the computational advantages of a recurrent architecture with complex-valued weights. We propose a fully convolutional autoencoder, SynCx, that performs iterative constraint satisfaction: at each iteration, a hidden layer bottleneck encodes statistically regular configurations of features in particular phase relationships; over iterations, local constraints propagate and the model converges to a globally consistent configuration of phase assignments. Binding is achieved simply by the matrix-vector product operation between complex-valued weights and activations, without the need for additional mechanisms that have been incorporated into current synchrony-based models. SynCx outperforms or is strongly competitive with current models for unsupervised object discovery. SynCx also avoids certain systematic grouping errors of current models, such as the inability to separate similarly colored objects without additional supervision.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98648">Sub-cone visual resolution by active, adaptive sampling in the human foveola</a></h4>

              
                The foveated architecture of the human retina and the eye’s mobility enables prime spatial vision, yet the interplay between photoreceptor cell topography and the constant motion of the eye during fixation remains unexplored. With in vivo foveal cone-resolved imaging and simultaneous microscopic photo stimulation, we examined visual acuity in both eyes of 16 participants while precisely recording the stimulus path on the retina. We find that resolution thresholds were correlated with the individual retina’s sampling capacity, and exceeded what static sampling limits would predict by 18%, on average. The length and direction of fixational drift motion, previously thought to be primarily random, played a key role in achieving this sub-cone diameter resolution. The oculomotor system finely adjusts drift behavior towards retinal areas with higher cone densities within only a few hundred milliseconds to enhance retinal sampling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87780">Linking the evolution of two prefrontal brain regions to social and foraging challenges in primates</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance (an index of ecological constraints), and population density (an index of social constraints). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.

	<p>Background: Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of long-term music training (i.e., musicianship) on the neural processing of sound, including simple tones and speech. However, the effects of musicianship on the encoding of simultaneously presented pitches, in the form of complex musical chords, is less well established. Presumably, musicians&amp;amp;rsquo; stronger familiarity and active experience with tonal music might enhance harmonic pitch representations, perhaps in an attention-dependent manner. Additionally, attention might influence chordal encoding differently across the auditory system. To this end, we explored the effects of long-term music training and attention on the processing of musical chords at the brainstem and cortical levels. Method: Young adult participants were separated into musician and nonmusician groups based on the extent of formal music training. While recording EEG, listeners heard isolated musical triads that differed only in the chordal third: major, minor, and detuned (4% sharper third from major). Participants were asked to correctly identify chords via key press during active stimulus blocks and watched a silent movie during passive blocks. We logged behavioral identification accuracy and reaction times and calculated information transfer based on the behavioral chord confusion patterns. EEG data were analyzed separately to distinguish between cortical (event-related potential, ERP) and subcortical (frequency-following response, FFR) evoked responses. Results: We found musicians were (expectedly) more accurate, though not faster, than nonmusicians in chordal identification. For subcortical FFRs, responses showed stimulus chord effects but no group differences. However, for cortical ERPs, whereas musicians displayed P2 (~150 ms) responses that were invariant to attention, nonmusicians displayed reduced P2 during passive listening. Listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; degree of behavioral information transfer (i.e., success in distinguishing chords) was also better in musicians and correlated with their neural differentiation of chords in the ERPs (but not high-frequency FFRs). Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest long-term music training strengthens even the passive cortical processing of musical sounds, supporting more automated brain processing of musical chords with less reliance on attention. Our results also suggest that the degree to which listeners can behaviorally distinguish chordal triads is directly related to their neural specificity to musical sounds primarily at cortical rather than subcortical levels. FFR attention effects were likely not observed due to the use of high-frequency stimuli (&amp;amp;gt;220 Hz), which restrict FFRs to brainstem sources.</p>

     alt="A Novel Mouse Model for Cerebral Inflammatory Demyelination in X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy: Insights into Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Targets"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Over 500 million people worldwide rely on sorghum as a main food crop. About 10% of the daily caloric intake of households in Ethiopia’s northwest and eastern regions, including Benishangul Gumuz, comes from sorghum. A hemi-biotrophic fungal pathogen called Colletotrichum sublineolum caused anthracnose disease is among the biotic constraints of sorghum production. Methods Ten selected sorghum genotypes were assessed for sorghum anthracnose severity and its temporal and spatial dynamics on field plots in the districts of Assosa and Bambasi. The performance of the chosen sorghum genotypes was assessed using the following metrics: AUDPC, disease progress rate, yield-related trait, sorghum grain yield, and mean severity index. Anthracnose severity was evaluated using a 1–5 disease rating scale and assessments conducted at seven consecutive time points. Results Ten genotypes of sorghum were examined in the districts of Assosa and Bambasi, with mean anthracnose severity index ranging from 60-77 PSI and 53-82 PSI, respectively. AUDPC varied from 351 to 470 % days and 316 to 499 % days at Assosa and Bambasi districts, respectively. Bambasi district achieved a larger grain yield than the Assosa district. Assosa-1 demonstrated a significant level of disease pressure, yet the current investigation found that this genotype is the highest performing genotype in both locations. Conclusions There is a considerable positive link between the severity of anthracnose and the weekly total rainfall and relative humidity. At both trial sites, Mersa-1 continuously produced higher grain yields and reduced disease levels. Breeders might utilize the Baco Striga sorghum genotype as a check line in a breeding effort to resist anthracnose disease because it shown a high vulnerability to the disease at both locations.

                Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (Chittodvega) is one among many types of mental disorders explained in Ayurveda. It can be defined as a Chitta (mind) + Udvega (anxiety)= Chittodvega- Anxious status of a mind. Celastrus paniculatus also known as Jyotishmati stimulates and improves the digestive fire and metabolism at a cellular level (Jatharagni and Majja dhatwagni). It can be correlated to GAD. GAD is characterized by feelings of threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and tension, and symptoms such as palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. It affects women more frequently than men and prevalence rates are high in midlife (prevalence in females over age 35: 10%) and older subjects. In modern medicine the first-line psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline (SNRIs). Aim and objectives To evaluate the comparative efficacy of Jyotishmati versus sertraline in the management of Chittodvega. Methods In this randomized active controlled double blind equivalence trial a total of 70 patients will be enrolled and divided into two equal groups. Patients between 20–50 years age of either gender having symptoms of Chittodvega and a Hamilton anxiety rating (HAM-A) scale score less than 24 (i.e., mild to moderate) will be selected for the study. In Group A, sertraline capsules 25 mg for first 7 days and then dose increased to 50 mg at bedtime for next 53 days and in Group B Jyotishmati Capsules 500 mg will be given twice a day after food with water for 60 days. Result and observation The patients will be assessed on the HAM-A scale, serum cortisol and WHO Quality of Life on day 0, 30, 60 and 90 and data will be analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables to evaluate whether treatments are equivalent.

                Abstract Background In the 21st century, the recognition of the rights and needs of victims of sexual violence has emerged as a fundamental discourse within international, regional, and local policy agendas. This has been influenced by the lasting psychological, emotional, and physical effects of sexual violence on the victims. These commentaries and agitation have spurred the need for alternative ways in which the Nigerian criminal justice system can be strengthened by incorporating criminal justice mechanisms and interventions that would enhance the needs and interests of victims in accessing justice despite its adversarial system of justice. Methods This study aims to appraise the different mechanisms of justice, needs, and interests of victims of sexual violence through a theoretical lens and drawing lessons from South Africa and Australia. To achieve this work, a doctrinal research methodology that utilized existing literature and secondary sources such as textbooks and online websites was adopted. Results The study found that there is a need for accountability for the protection of victims, implementation of legislation, and scaling up of resources for effective support services. In addition, the absence of resources, effective monitoring and compliance institutions, monitoring reports, specialized courts, and special regulations hampers the implementation of a victim-centered approach. Among others, the study recommends an all-inclusive criminal justice mechanism that would further incorporate a victim-centered approach towards advancing the rights and quality of justice for victims of Sexual Violence and the need for a victim impact statement to our criminal justice system for cases of sexual violence. Conclusion The study concludes that there is a need to make provisions for more effective alternative responses to incorporate the justice interests and needs of victims of sexual violence.

                Background Ovarian pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy, accounting for 0.5% to 1% of all ectopic pregnancies, with an incidence ranging from 1 in 2,100 to 1 in 60,000 pregnancies. Due to its rarity and the lack of common risk factors, diagnosing ovarian pregnancy is often challenging and typically occurs during surgical exploration. Case Presentation We present the case of a 40-year-old woman who experienced severe pelvic pain, light vaginal bleeding, and 8 weeks of amenorrhea. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was hemodynamically unstable, with low blood pressure and a rapid heart rate. An ultrasound revealed an empty uterus, an irregular mass on her right ovary, and free fluid in the pelvis. Her beta-hCG level was elevated, and her hemoglobin level was low. Given the suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy, she underwent emergency surgery. During the operation, the surgical team discovered a large amount of clotted blood and a ruptured mass on her left ovary measuring 10 x 9.5 cm. Due to heavy bleeding, they performed a left oophorectomy and salpingectomy. Histopathological analysis later confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy. Conclusion This case underscores the challenges in diagnosing ovarian pregnancy and highlights the necessity for prompt surgical intervention, particularly in unstable patients. Early detection and appropriate management are critical to prevent life-threatening complications.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis faces numerous challenges, including high sparsity, a high-dimensional feature space, and biological noise. These challenges hinder downstream analysis, necessitating the use of feature selection methods to identify informative genes, and reduce data dimensionality. However, existing methods for selecting highly variable genes (HVGs) exhibit limited overlap and inconsistent clustering performance across benchmark datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle to accurately select HVGs from fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and minority cell types, which are more difficult to distinguish, raising concerns about the reliability of their results. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel feature selection framework for scRNA-seq data called Mcadet. Mcadet integrates Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), graph-based community detection, and a novel statistical testing approach. To assess the effectiveness of Mcadet, we conducted extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world data, employing unbiased metrics for comparison. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of Mcadet in the selection of HVGs in scenarios involving fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and datasets containing minority cell populations. Overall, we demonstrate that Mcadet enhances the reliability of selected HVGs, although the impact of HVG selection on various downstream analyses varies and needs to be further investigated.

                <p>by Jiamu Jiang, Emilie Foyardg, Mark C. W. van Rossumg</p>

Synaptic plasticity enables animals to adapt to their environment, but memory formation can require a substantial amount of metabolic energy, potentially impairing survival. Hence, a neuro-economic dilemma arises whether learning is a profitable investment or not, and the brain must therefore judiciously regulate learning. Indeed, in experiments it was observed that during starvation, Drosophila suppress formation of energy-intensive aversive memories. Here we include energy considerations in a reinforcement learning framework. Simulated flies learned to avoid noxious stimuli through synaptic plasticity in either the energy expensive long-term memory (LTM) pathway, or the decaying anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) pathway. The objective of the flies is to maximize their lifespan, which is calculated with a hazard function. We find that strategies that switch between the LTM and ARM pathways, based on energy reserve and reward prediction error, prolong lifespan. Our study highlights the significance of energy-regulation of memory pathways and dopaminergic control for adaptive learning and survival. It might also benefit engineering applications of reinforcement learning under resources constraints.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012553">Competitive plasticity to reduce the energetic costs of learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mark C. W. van Rossum, Aaron Pache</p>

The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation, but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories. Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates, already carries a significant metabolic cost. Yet, learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to require at least 10<sup>8</sup> synaptic updates. Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1) only modify synapses with large updates, and 2) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires, yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses. In particular in this case, large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity. The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly.

Establishing suitable <i>in vitro</i> culture conditions for microorganisms is crucial for dissecting their biology and empowering potential applications. However, a significant number of bacterial and fungal species, including <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i>, remain unculturable, hampering research efforts. <i>P</i>. <i>jirovecii</i> is a deadly pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite the major impact of <i>Pneumocystis</i> on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus. This is largely due to the fact that its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism <i>in vitro</i>. We present a comprehensive <i>in silico</i> genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Pneumocystis</i> growth and metabolism, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth <i>in vitro</i>. We utilise recently published genome data and available information in the literature as well as bioinformatics and software tools to develop and validate the model. In addition, we employ relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the <i>Pneumocystis</i> growth medium. Our findings offer insights into the biology of <i>Pneumocystis</i> and provide a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen <i>in vitro</i>.

Epidemiological delays are key quantities that inform public health policy and clinical practice. They are used as inputs for mathematical and statistical models, which in turn can guide control strategies. In recent work, we found that censoring, right truncation, and dynamical bias were rarely addressed correctly when estimating delays and that these biases were large enough to have knock-on impacts across a large number of use cases. Here, we formulate a checklist of best practices for estimating and reporting epidemiological delays. We also provide a flowchart to guide practitioners based on their data. Our examples are focused on the incubation period and serial interval due to their importance in outbreak response and modeling, but our recommendations are applicable to other delays. The recommendations, which are based on the literature and our experience estimating epidemiological delay distributions during outbreak responses, can help improve the robustness and utility of reported estimates and provide guidance for the evaluation of estimates for downstream use in transmission models or other analyses.

                <p>by Raúl A. Reyes Hueros, Rodrigo A. Gier, Sydney M. Shaffer</p>

Individual cells grown in culture exhibit remarkable differences in their growth, with some cells capable of forming large clusters, while others are limited or fail to grow at all. While these differences have been observed across cell lines and human samples, the growth dynamics and associated cell states remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed clonal tracing through imaging and cellular barcoding of an in vitro model of esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT). We found that about 10% of clones grow exponentially, while the remaining have cells that become non-proliferative leading to a halt in the growth rate. Using mathematical models, we demonstrate two distinct growth behaviors: exponential and logistic. Further, we discovered that the propensity to grow exponentially is largely heritable through four doublings and that the less proliferative clones can become highly proliferative through increasing plating density. Combining barcoding with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified the cellular states associated with the highly proliferative clones, which include genes in the WNT and PI3K pathways. Finally, we identified an enrichment of cells resembling the highly proliferative cell state in the proliferating healthy human esophageal epithelium.

                <p>by Haolin Jiang, Yulian Xu, Yunguang Tong, Dong Zhang, Ruhong Zhou</p>

As an emerging class of RNA molecules, circular RNAs play pivotal roles in various biological processes, thereby determining their three-dimensional (3D) structure is crucial for a deep understanding of their biological significances. Similar to linear RNAs, the development of computational methods for circular RNA 3D structure prediction is challenging, especially considering the inherent flexibility and potentially long length of circular RNAs. Here, we introduce an extension of our previous IsRNA2 model, named IsRNAcirc, to enable circular RNA 3D structure predictions through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The workflow of IsRNAcirc consists of four main steps, including input preparation, end closure, structure prediction, and model refinement. Our results demonstrate that IsRNAcirc can provide reasonable 3D structure predictions for circular RNAs, which significantly reduce the locally irrational elements contained in the initial input. Moreover, for a validation test set comprising 34 circular RNAs, our IsRNAcirc can generate 3D models with better scores than the template-based 3dRNA method. These findings demonstrate that our IsRNAcirc method is a promising tool to explore the structural details along with intricate interactions of circular RNAs.

                <p>by Yushi Yang, Abdelwahab Kawafi, Qiao Tong, Erika Kague, Chrissy L. Hammond, C. Patrick Royall</p>

Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state, serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing, disease genetics, and the effect of drugs. The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents. The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems. In a few cases, the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles, or the enzymatic behaviour of <i>de novo</i> proteins. Usually, however, while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors, it typically cannot be changed at will. Here, we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish. We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally. In particular, we probe the effect of the lack of <i>col11a2</i> gene in zebrafish, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. The resulting <i>col11a2 -/-</i> zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and <i>col11a2 -/-</i> zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. In this way, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system, changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model.

Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external computers, allowing processing of brain activity and the ability to control external devices. While often used for medical purposes, BCIs may also hold great promise for nonmedical purposes to unlock human neurocognitive potential. In this Essay, we discuss the prospects and challenges of using BCIs for cognitive enhancement, focusing specifically on invasive enhancement BCIs (eBCIs). We discuss the ethical, legal, and scientific implications of eBCIs, including issues related to privacy, autonomy, inequality, and the broader societal impact of cognitive enhancement technologies. We conclude that the development of eBCIs raises challenges far beyond practical pros and cons, prompting fundamental questions regarding the nature of conscious selfhood and about who—and what—we are, and ought, to be.

                <p>by Minghui Zhao, Yumeng Xin, Haoyun Deng, Zhentao Zuo, Xiaoying Wang, Yanchao Bi, Ning Liu</p>

Animals guide their behaviors through internal representations of the world in the brain. We aimed to understand how the macaque brain stores such general world knowledge, focusing on object color knowledge. Three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were conducted in macaque monkeys: viewing chromatic and achromatic gratings, viewing grayscale images of their familiar fruits and vegetables (e.g., grayscale strawberry), and viewing true- and false-colored objects (e.g., red strawberry and green strawberry). We observed robust object knowledge representations in the color patches, especially the one located around TEO: the activity patterns could classify grayscale pictures of objects based on their memory color and response patterns in these regions could translate between chromatic grating viewing and grayscale object viewing (e.g., red grating—grayscale images of strawberry), such that classifiers trained by viewing chromatic gratings could successfully classify grayscale object images according to their memory colors. Our results showed direct positive evidence of object color memory in macaque monkeys. These results indicate the perceptually grounded knowledge representation as a conservative memory mechanism and open a new avenue to study this particular (semantic) memory representation with macaque models.

                <p>by Carlos Pascual-Caro, Jaime de Juan-Sanz</p>

To enable transmission of information in the brain, synaptic vesicles fuse to presynaptic membranes, liberating their content and exposing transiently a myriad of vesicular transmembrane proteins. However, versatile methods for quantifying the synaptic translocation of endogenous proteins during neuronal activity remain unavailable, as the fast dynamics of synaptic vesicle cycling difficult specific isolation trafficking proteins during such a transient surface exposure. Here, we developed a novel approach using synaptic cleft proximity labeling to capture and quantify activity-driven trafficking of endogenous synaptic proteins at the synapse. We show that accelerating cleft biotinylation times to match the fast dynamics of vesicle exocytosis allows capturing endogenous proteins transiently exposed at the synaptic surface during neural activity, enabling for the first time the study of the translocation of nearly every endogenous synaptic protein. As proof-of-concept, we further applied this technology to obtain direct evidence of the surface translocation of noncanonical trafficking proteins, such as ATG9A and NPTX1, which had been proposed to traffic during activity but for which direct proof had not yet been shown. The technological advancement presented here will facilitate future studies dissecting the molecular identity of proteins exocytosed at the synapse during activity, helping to define the molecular machinery that sustains neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.

The mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) plays crucial role in intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of oxidative metabolism. In recent decades, the role of MCU pore-forming proteins has been highlighted in cancer. However, the contribution of MCU-associated regulatory proteins mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 and 2 (MICU1 and MICU2) to pathophysiological conditions has been poorly investigated. Here, we describe the role of MICU2 in cell proliferation and invasion using in vitro and in vivo models of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated an increase in MICU2 expression and the MICU2/MICU1 ratio in advanced CRC and CRC-derived metastases. We report that expression of MICU2 is necessary for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and quality of the mitochondrial network. Our data reveal the interplay between MICU2 and MICU1 in the metabolic flexibility between anaerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS. Overall, our study sheds light on the potential role of the MICUs in diseases associated with metabolic reprogramming.

                <p>by Aijun Liu, Yezhou Liu, Geng Chen, Wenping Lyu, Fang Ye, Junlin Wang, Qiwen Liao, Lizhe Zhu, Yang Du, Richard D. Ye</p>

Chemerin is an adipokine with chemotactic activity to a subset of leukocytes. Chemerin binds to 3 G protein-coupled receptors, including chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1), and C-C chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2). Here, we report that GPR1 is capable of Gi signaling when stimulated with full-length chemerin or its C-terminal nonapeptide (C9, YFPGQFAFS). We present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Gi-coupled GPR1 bound to full-length chemerin and to the C9 peptide, respectively. C9 insertion into the transmembrane (TM) binding pocket is both necessary and sufficient for GPR1 signaling, whereas the full-length chemerin uses its bulky N-terminal core for interaction with a β-strand located at the N-terminus of GPR1. This interaction involves multiple β-strands of full-length chemerin, forming a β-sheet that serves as a “lid” for the TM binding pocket and is energetically expensive to remove as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations with free energy landscape analysis. Combining results from functional assays, our structural model explains why C9 is an activating peptide at GPR1 and how the full-length chemerin uses a “two-site” model for enhanced interaction with GPR1.

                Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a widely distributed bacterium that is Gram-positive and serves as the primary cause of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) episodes. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a sequela resulting from repeated ARF attacks which are also caused by repeated GAS infections. ARF/RHD morbidity and mortality rates are incredibly high in low- and middle-income countries. This is closely related to poor levels of sanitation which causes the enhanced incidence of GAS infections. Management of carditis in RHD cases is quite challenging, particularly in developing countries, considering that medical treatment is only palliative, while definitive treatment often requires more invasive procedures with high costs. Preventive action through vaccination against GAS infection is one of the most effective steps as a solution in reducing RHD morbidity and mortality due to curative treatments are expensive. Various developments of M-protein-based GAS vaccines have been carried out over the last few decades and have recently begun to enter the clinical stage. Nevertheless, this vaccination generates cross-reactive antibodies that might trigger ARF assaults as a result of the resemblance between the M-protein structure and proteins found in many human tissues. Consequently, the development of a vaccine utilizing L-Rhamnose derived from the poly-rhamnose backbone of Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) commenced. The L-Rhamnose-based vaccine was chosen due to the absence of the Rhamnose biosynthesis pathway in mammalian cells including humans thus this molecule is not found in any body tissue. Recent pre-clinical studies reveal that L-Rhamnose-based vaccines provide a protective effect by increasing IgG antibody titers without causing cross-reactive antibodies in test animal tissue. These findings demonstrate that the L-Rhamnose-based vaccine possesses strong immunogenicity, which effectively protects against GAS infection while maintaining a significantly higher degree of safety.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

[version 5; peer review: awaiting </a></h4>

              
                The haemorrhagic features of viral haemorrhagic fevers may be caused by common patterns of metabolic disturbances of the glucose and ascorbate homeostasis. Haemorrhages and vasculature disfunctions are a clinical feature not only of viral haemorrhagic fevers, but also in scurvy, diabetes and thrombotic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Interestingly, the expression of glucose and ascorbate transporter Glut-1 on the erythrocyte membrane is associated with the inability to synthesize ascorbate and is restricted to that very species that are susceptible to filoviruses (primates, humans and fruit bats). Glut-1 may play a pivotal role in haemorrhagic fever pathogenesis. TIM-1 and TAM receptors have been recognized to enhance entry of Ebola, Lassa and Dengue viruses and viral interferences with TIM-1 could disturb its function, disturbing the expression of Glut-1. In those species not able to synthesize ascorbate and expressing Glut-1 on erythrocytes virus could interact with Glut-1 or other functionally related protein, and the influx of glucose into the cells would be severely impaired. As a consequence, transient hyperglycemia and a marked oxidative stress coupled with the high levels of glucose in plasma would be established, and then promote the activation of NF–κB transcription, exacerbating a pro-inflammatory response mediated by cytokines and chemokines: The inability to synthesize ascorbate is an Achilles Heel when trying to counteract the oxidative stress.

                Background Drinking water of the right and approved quality is a basic requirement for the development of any civilization. According to SDG 6 it is crucial to provide every citizen with equitable water quality and quantity. Methods The study area is the smart city of Bhubaneswar with 67 wards and three zones: the north zone, south-west zone, and south-east zone with around 12.4 lakh population. To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there is a deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system is still existing due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health Engineering department.

                The ability to learn from experience that certain cues and situations are associated with threats or safety is crucial for survival and adaptive behavior. Understanding the neural substrates of threat and safety learning has high clinical significance because deficits in these forms of learning characterize anxiety disorders. Traditionally, dopamine neurons were thought to uniformly support reward learning by signaling reward prediction errors. However, the dopamine system is functionally more diverse than was initially appreciated and is also critical for processing threat and safety. In this review, I highlight recent studies demonstrating that dopamine neurons generate prediction errors for threat and safety, and describe how dopamine projections to the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and striatum regulate associative threat and safety learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96576">Regional response to light illuminance across the human hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Light exerts multiple non-image-forming biological effects on physiology including the stimulation of alertness and cognition. However, the subcortical circuitry underlying the stimulating impact of light is not established in humans. We used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the impact of variations in light illuminance on the regional activity of the hypothalamus while healthy young adults (N=26; 16 women; 24.3±2.9 y) were completing two auditory cognitive tasks. We find that, during both the executive and emotional tasks, higher illuminance triggered an activity increase over the posterior part of the hypothalamus, which includes part of the tuberomamillary nucleus and the posterior part of the lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, increasing illuminance evoked a decrease in activity over the anterior and ventral parts of the hypothalamus, encompassing notably the suprachiasmatic nucleus and another part of the tuberomammillary nucleus. Critically, the performance of the executive task was improved under higher illuminance and was negatively correlated with the activity of the posterior hypothalamus area. These findings reveal the distinct local dynamics of different hypothalamus regions that underlie the impact of light on cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/78738">Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 controls regulatory T cell subset differentiation and effector function</a></h4>

              
                FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are key for immune homeostasis. Here, we reveal that nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) controls naïve and effector Treg cell states. Upon NCOR1 deletion in T cells, effector Treg cell frequencies were elevated in mice and in in vitro-generated human Treg cells. NCOR1-deficient Treg cells failed to protect mice from severe weight loss and intestinal inflammation associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis, indicating impaired suppressive function. NCOR1 controls the transcriptional integrity of Treg cells, since effector gene signatures were already upregulated in naïve NCOR1-deficient Treg cells while effector NCOR1-deficient Treg cells failed to repress genes associated with naïve Treg cells. Moreover, genes related to cholesterol homeostasis including targets of liver X receptor (LXR) were dysregulated in NCOR1-deficient Treg cells. However, genetic ablation of LXRβ in T cells did not revert the effects of NCOR1 deficiency, indicating that NCOR1 controls naïve and effector Treg cell subset composition independent from its ability to repress LXRβ-induced gene expression. Thus, our study reveals that NCOR1 maintains naïve and effector Treg cell states via regulating their transcriptional integrity. We also reveal a critical role for this epigenetic regulator in supporting the suppressive functions of Treg cells in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91994">Large-scale analysis of the integration of enhancer-enhancer signals by promoters</a></h4>

              
                Genes are often regulated by multiple enhancers. It is poorly understood how the individual enhancer activities are combined to control promoter activity. Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse embryonic stem cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals in a non-linear manner that depends on promoter strength. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.

                Ion channels are biological transistors that control ionic flux across cell membranes to regulate electrical transmission and signal transduction. They are found in all biological membranes and their conductive state kinetics are frequently disrupted in human diseases. Organelle ion channels are among the most resistant to functional and pharmacological interrogation. Traditional channel protein reconstitution methods rely upon exogenous expression and/or purification from endogenous cellular sources which are frequently contaminated by resident ionophores. Here, we describe a fully synthetic method to assay functional properties of polycystin channels that natively traffic to primary cilia and endoplasmic reticulum organelles. Using this method, we characterize their oligomeric assembly, membrane integration, orientation, and conductance while comparing these results to their endogenous channel properties. Outcomes define a novel synthetic approach that can be applied broadly to investigate channels resistant to biophysical analysis and pharmacological characterization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97088">Development of a Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling to study cooperative behaviors</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans, has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MarmoAAP), a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities. Furthermore, MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94658">The T cell receptor β chain repertoire of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes improves neoantigen prediction and prioritization</a></h4>

              
                In the realm of cancer immunotherapy, the meticulous selection of neoantigens plays a fundamental role in enhancing personalized treatments. Traditionally, this selection process has heavily relied on predicting the binding of peptides to human leukocyte antigens (pHLA). Nevertheless, this approach often overlooks the dynamic interaction between tumor cells and the immune system. In response to this limitation, we have developed an innovative prediction algorithm rooted in machine learning, integrating T cell receptor β chain (TCRβ) profiling data from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients for a more precise neoantigen prioritization. TCRβ sequencing was conducted to profile the TCR repertoire of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 28 CRC patients. The data unveiled both intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity in the TCRβ repertoires of CRC patients, likely resulting from the stochastic utilization of V and J segments in response to neoantigens. Our novel combined model integrates pHLA binding information with pHLA-TCR binding to prioritize neoantigens, resulting in heightened specificity and sensitivity compared to models using individual features alone. The efficacy of our proposed model was corroborated through ELISpot assays on long peptides, performed on four CRC patients. These assays demonstrated that neoantigen candidates prioritized by our combined model outperformed predictions made by the established tool NetMHCpan. This comprehensive assessment underscores the significance of integrating pHLA binding with pHLA-TCR binding analysis for more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.

">Genetic and functional adaptations and alcohol-biased signaling in the mediodorsal thalamus of alcohol dependent mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a significant health concern characterized by an individual's inability to control alcohol intake. With alcohol misuse increasing and abstinence rates declining, leading to severe social and health consequences, it is crucial to uncover effective treatment strategies for AUD by focusing on understanding neuroadaptations and cellular mechanisms. The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a brain region essential for cognitive functioning and reward-guided choices. However, the effects of alcohol (ethanol) dependence on MD neuroadaptations and how dependence alters MD activity during choice behaviors for alcohol and a natural reward (sucrose) are not well understood. Adult C57BL/6J mice treated with chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure were used to assess genetic and functional adaptations in the MD. Fiber photometry-based recordings of GCaMP6f expressed in the MD of C57BL/6J mice were acquired to investigate in vivo neural adaptations during choice drinking sessions for alcohol (15%) and either water or sucrose (3%). There were time-dependent changes in cFos and transcript expression during acute withdrawal and early abstinence. Differentially expressed genes were identified in control mice across different circadian time points and when comparing control and alcohol dependent mice. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the alcohol-sensitive genes revealed disruption of genes that control glial function, axonal myelination, and protein binding. CIE exposure also increased evoked firing in MD cells at 72 hours of withdrawal. In alcohol-dependent male and female mice that show increased alcohol drinking and preference for alcohol over water, we observed an increase in alcohol intake and preference for alcohol when mice were given a choice between alcohol and sucrose. Fiber photometry recordings demonstrated that MD activity is elevated during and after licking bouts for alcohol, water, and sucrose, and the signal for alcohol is significantly higher than that for water or sucrose during drinking. The elevated signal during alcohol bouts persisted in alcohol dependent mice. These findings demonstrate that CIE causes genetic and functional neuroadaptations in the MD and that alcohol dependence enhances alcohol-biased behaviors, with the MD uniquely responsive to alcohol, even in dependent mice.

">Microsaccades strongly modulate but do not cause the N2pc EEG marker of spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                The N2pc is a popular human-neuroscience marker of covert and internal spatial attention that occurs 200-300 ms after being prompted to shift attention - a time window also characterised by the spatial biasing of microsaccades. Here we show how co-occurring microsaccades profoundly modulate N2pc amplitude during the top-down deployment of spatial attention in both perception and working memory. At the same time, we show that a significant - even if severely weakened - N2pc can still be established in the absence of co-occurring microsaccades. Thus, while microsaccade presence and direction strongly modulate N2pc amplitude, microsaccades are not strictly a prerequisite for the N2pc to be observed.

">Reduced Folate Carrier 1 (RFC1/Slc19a1) Suppression Exacerbates Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in Experimental Ischemic Stroke in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                The Reduced Folate Carrier 1 (RFC1), also called solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1/SLC19a1), is recognized for transporting folates across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). RFC1 has recently been defined as a hypoxia-immune related gene whose expression levels were induced by acute retinal ischemia, suggesting that RFC1 may have a role in the response of the brain to ischemic injury. Despite a recent human meta-analysis suggesting an association between certain RFC1 polymorphisms and the risk of silent brain infarctions, preclinical evidence concerning the potential role of RFC1 in acute ischemic stroke has yet to be presented. To investigate this, we first characterized RFC1 protein expression in mouse microvessels and pericytes which play significant roles in stroke pathophysiology. Then, we examined the temporal (1-h, 24-h, and 48-h) and spatial (infarct, periinfarct, contralateral) expression of RFC1 protein in the intraluminal transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. Finally, we knocked down RFC1 protein with RFC1-siRNA in the potential periinfarct region before induction of ischemia and investigated BBB integrity and infarct size in vivo via 7T-MRI. Moreover, we utilized a pharmacological modulation -methotrexate, a non-covalent inhibitor of RFC1- to further investigate the role of RFC1 in maintaining BBB integrity. Our study revealed that, i) RFC1 protein levels were dynamic throughout the acute phases of ischemic stroke, ii) RFC1 suppression aggravated the BBB leakage during ischemia. These results emphases the role of RFC1 in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and supports the evidence from human studies.

">The functional impact of LGI1 autoantibodies on human CA3 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Autoantibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 protein (LGI1 mAb) lead to limbic encephalitis characterized by seizures and memory deficits. While animal models provide insights into mechanisms of LGI1 mAb action, species-specific confirmation is lacking. In this study, we investigated the effects of patient-derived LGI1 mAb on human CA3 neurons using cultured ex vivo slices. Analysis of intrinsic properties and morphology indicated functional integrity of these neurons under incubation conditions. Human CA3 neurons received spontaneous excitatory currents with large amplitudes and frequencies, suggestive of "giant" AMPA currents. In slices exposed to LGI1 mAb, human CA3 neurons displayed increased neuronal spike frequency, mirroring effects observed with the Kv1.1 channel blocker DTX-K. This increase likely resulted from decreased Kv1.1 channel activity at the axonal initial segment, as indicated by alterations in action potential properties. A detailed analysis revealed differences between LGI1 mAb and DTX-K effects on action potential properties, suggesting distinct mechanisms of action and emphasizing the need for further exploration of downstream pathways. Our findings underscore the importance of species specific confirmatory studies of disease mechanisms and highlight the potential of human hippocampal slice cultures as a translational model for investigation of disease mechanisms beyond epilepsy, including the effects of pharmacological compounds and autoantibodies.

">Light tunes a novel long-term threat avoidance behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals must constantly scan their environment for imminent threats to their safety. However, they must also integrate their past experiences across long timescales to assess the potential recurrence of new threats. Though visual inputs are critical for the detection of environmental danger, whether and how visual information shapes an animal's assessment of whether a new threat is likely to reappear in a given context is unknown. Using a novel behavioral assessment of long-term threat avoidance behavior, we find that animals will avoid a familiar location where they previously experienced a single exposure to an innately threatening visual stimulus. This avoidance behavior is highly sensitive and lasts for multiple days. Intriguingly, we find that the melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells tune this behavior via a perihabenular-nucleus accumbens circuit distinct from the canonical visual threat detection circuits. These findings define a specific retinal cell type driving a new long-term threat avoidance behavior driven by prior visual experience.

">Reductions of Grin2a in adolescent dopamine neurons confers aberrant salience and related psychosis phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Psychosis is a hallmark of schizophrenia. It typically emerges in late adolescence and is associated with dopamine abnormalities and aberrant salience. Most genes associated with schizophrenia risk involve ubiquitous targets that may not explain delayed emergence of dopaminergic disruptions. This includes GRIN2A, the gene encoding the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both common and rare variants of GRIN2A are considered genetic risk factors for schizophrenia diagnosis. We find that Grin2a knockout in dopamine neurons during adolescence is sufficient to produce a behavioral phenotype that mirrors aspects of psychosis. These include disruptions in effort optimization, salience attribution, and ability to utilize feedback to guide behavior. We also find a selective effect of this manipulation on dopamine release during prediction error signaling. These data provide mechanistic insight into how variants of GRIN2A may lead to the latent presentation of aberrant salience and abnormalities in dopamine dynamics. This etiologically relevant model may aid future discovery of course altering treatments for schizophrenia.

">Association of cerebellar inflammation and neurodegeneration in a novel spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuroinflammation is a recognized pathological characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. Spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Our previous studies reported human mutations in KCNC3 gene are causative for SCA13. Human R423H allelic mutation induces early-onset neurodegeneration and aberrant intracellular retention of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in drosophila. However, the neurodegeneration and inflammatory response induced by the R424H allele are unknown in a mammalian model of disease. Method: In this study, a single Kcnc3 R424H mutation (Analogous to the human SCA13 R423H isoform) transgenic mice were created using CRISPR/Cas 9 technique. Motor function (gait, tremor, coordination and balance) and cerebellar volume (scanned and imaged with 7T MRI) of the R424H transgenic mice were evaluated at multiple timepoints. Neurodegeneration (Purkinje cells loss) as well as cerebellar (astroglia, microglia and macrophage activation) and peripheral (plasma cytokines levels) inflammatory responses were examined and analyzed. Result: The R424H transgenic mice showed marked neurological motor dysfunction with high-frequency tremor, aberrant gait, and short latency to fall in Rotarod testing at 3 and 6 months of age. Abnormal spontaneous firing was recorded in electrophysiology of Purkinje cells. Pathological changes in our R424H transgenic mice included progressive Purkinje cell degeneration and cerebellar atrophy. Over-active microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages were observed in the cerebella of transgenic mice. Pearson correlation analyses indicated that the number of Calbindin positive cells, a Purkinje cell marker, showed a strong inverse correlation with the positive cell number of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), and CD68. The expression of EGFR/pEGFR was positively correlated with CD68 and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein. Conclusion: Transgenic R424H mice provide a novel SCA13 model showing significant motor deficits, Purkinje cells loss, cerebellar inflammation, and atrophy. Our study suggests that the activation of inflammatory immune cells (astroglia, microglia and macrophages) and strong expression of EGFR/ pEGFR signal in these immune cells are associated with Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum. This abnormal neuroinflammation may play a significant role in the aggressive procession of neurodegeneration.

                Replay facilitates memory consolidation in both biological and artificial systems. Using the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework, we study replay in both humans and birds through computational modelling. We investigate impacts of replay triggered by targeted memory reactivation during sleep and experiments examining how sleep affects the development of birdsong in young songbirds. We show that qualitatively realistic sleep effects can be captured by highly abstracted, idealised CLS models. Our modelling sheds theoretical insights on the mechanisms underlying both strengthening and weakening effects of targeted memory reactivation, and supports the empirical hypothesis that replay drives overnight performance deterioration and correlates positively with the final performance in birdsong development.

                Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is characterized by multiple coupled rhythms involved in memory consolidation, alongside an arrhythmic 1/f scale-free background also hypothesized to contribute to NREM sleep functions. Spectral parametrization methods have been recently introduced to describe the properties of rhythmic and arrhythmic processes in the spectral domain. However, these approaches fall short disentangling rhythms from arrhythmicity regarding the time series. This is crucial as arrhythmicity can impact the morphology of individual oscillations, therefore affecting their frequency, amplitude, waveform, and their cross-frequency coupling estimated transiently. We introduce 'Rhythms & Background' (RnB), an innovative wavelet-based methodology that compensates for arrhythmicity within the time domain. We validate RnB against spectral methods and demonstrate its enhanced capability to characterize the hallmark features of NREM sleep rhythms. Furthermore, RnB reveal the rhythmic time series, highlighting key NREM sleep rhythms with improved sensitivity to their phase-amplitude coupling.

">Catecholamines reduce choice history biases</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognitive behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers' history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions.

">Mechanisms and purpose of lowered action potential firing threshold in fast-spiking interneurons in the human neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain exhibits various interspecies differences. Microanatomical and molecular differences in homologous neurons between species are best characterized in the neocortical mantle, but the purpose of these differences remains poorly understood. We performed whole-cell microelectrode recordings and microanatomical and molecular analyses of human fast-spiking parvalbumin (pvalb)-expressing interneurons in neocortical tissue resected during brain surgery. Fast-spiking interneurons exhibited a lower action potential (AP) firing threshold in humans than in mice. Compared with mouse neurons, human neurons displayed an elongated axon initial segment (AIS), and the human AIS was deficient in low-voltage activated inhibitory Kv1 potassium channels. Contrarily, Kv1 ion channels were prominent in mouse neurons. Computational fast-spiking interneuron model simulations revealed that human-type AIS lowers the AP threshold and shortens the time lag for AP generation. Thus, human AIS supports fast in-fast out electrical circuit function in human pvalb neurons, which have electrically slow membrane potential kinetics in somata.

">Shifts in Naturalistic Behaviors Induced by Early Social Isolation Stress are Associated with Adult Binge-like Eating in Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                Binge eating (BE) is a highly pervasive maladaptive coping strategy in response to severe early life stress such as emotional and social neglect. BE is described as repeated episodes of uncontrolled eating and is tightly linked with comorbid mental health concerns. Despite social stressors occurring at a young age, the onset of BE typically does not occur until adulthood providing an interval for potential therapeutic intervention. Currently, our knowledge of longitudinal noninvasive digital biomarkers predictive of BE needs further development. Monitoring longitudinal impacts of adolescent social isolation stress on naturalistic behaviors in rats will enable the identification of noninvasive digital markers of disease progression to predict adult eating strategies. Recognizing adolescent naturalistic behaviors shaped by social stress informs our understanding of the underlying neurocircuits most effected. This study aimed to monitor and identify longitudinal behavioral shifts to enhance predictive capabilities in a rat model of social isolation stress-induced BE. We placed Paired (n=12) and Socially Isolated (SI, n=12) female rats in observational home cages weekly for seven weeks to evaluate the effect of SI on 10 naturalistic behaviors. All 10 naturalistic behaviors were simultaneously detected and tracked using Noldus Ethovision XT automated recognition software. Composite phenotypic z-scores were calculated by standardizing all 10 behaviors. When transitioning into adulthood, all rats underwent conventional emotionality testing and were exposed to a Western-like high fat diet (WD, 43% kcal from fat) to evaluate BE. Longitudinal assessments revealed SI-induced shifts in adolescent phenotypic z-scores and that sniffing, unsupported rearing, jumping, and twitching were the most susceptible to SI. SI increased emotionality compared to the Paired controls. Finally, we identified adolescent twitching as a digital biomarker of adult WD consumption. This study employed novel approaches to identify early life predictive biomarkers of adult eating strategies and laid a foundation for future investigations.

Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we tracked the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential targets during search. We show how we look back into memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time required for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp EEG, but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification behavior as an integral component of visual search, and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.

">The aberrant language network dynamics in autism ages 5-40 years</a></h4>

              
                Background: Language impairments, which affect both structural aspects of language and pragmatic use, are frequently observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These impairments are often associated with atypical brain development and unusual network interaction patterns. However, a neurological framework remains elusive to explain them. Methods: In this study, we utilized the dynamic "meta-networking" framework of language-a theoretical model that describes the domain-segregation dynamics during resting states-to investigate cortical language network abnormalities in ASD aged 5-40 years. Results: Our findings revealed distinct developmental trajectories for three domain-specific language subnetworks in ASD, characterized by unique patterns of hypo- and hyper-connectivity that vary with age. Notably, these language network abnormalities proved to be strong predictors of verbal Intelligence Quotient and communication deficits, though they did not predict social abilities or stereotypical behaviors. Limitations: Due to the limited availability of linguistic data, our study was unable to assess the language deficit profiles of individuals with ASD. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings refined our understanding of the network mechanisms for language and communication deficits in ASD.

">Inclusivity in fNIRS Studies: Quantifying the Impact of Hair and Skin Characteristics on Signal Quality with Practical Recommendations for Improvement</a></h4>

              
                Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) holds transformative potential for research and clinical applications in neuroscience due to its non-invasive nature and adaptability to real-world settings. However, despite its promise, fNIRS signal quality is sensitive to individual differences in biophysical factors such as hair and skin characteristics, which can significantly impact the absorption and scattering of near-infrared light. If not properly addressed, these factors risk biasing fNIRS research by disproportionately affecting signal quality across diverse populations. Our results quantify the impact of various hair properties, skin pigmentation as well as head size, sex and age on signal quality, providing quantitative guidance for future hardware advances and methodological standards to help overcome these critical barriers to inclusivity in fNIRS studies. We provide actionable guidelines for fNIRS researchers, including a suggested metadata table and recommendations for cap and optode configurations, hair management techniques, and strategies to optimize data collection across varied participants. This research paves the way for the development of more inclusive fNIRS technologies, fostering broader applicability and improved interpretability of neuroimaging data in diverse populations.

                Understanding the interplay between human brain structure and function is crucial to discern neural dynamics. This study explores the relation between brain structure and macroscale functional activity using subject-specific structural connectome eigenmodes, complementing prior work that focused on group-level models and geometry. Leveraging data from the Human Connectome Project, we assess accuracy in reconstructing various functional MRI-based cortical maps using individualised eigenmodes, specifically, across a range of connectome construction parameters. Our results show only minor differences in performance between surface geometric eigenmodes, a local neighborhood graph, a highly smoothed null model, and individual and group-level connectomes at modest smoothing and density levels. Furthermore, our results suggest that spatially smooth eigenmodes best explain functional data. The absence of improvement of individual connectomes and surface geometry over smoothed null models calls for further methodological innovation to better quantify and understand the degree to which brain structure constrains brain function.

">The claustrum is critical for maintaining working memory information</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) enables the mammalian brain to temporarily store and manipulate information, supporting cognitive tasks and communication processes. Rather than depending on a single specialized area, WM is thought to operate through a distributed network spanning cortical and subcortical regions. A dedicated WM storage area would likely require broad reciprocal connections with various cortical regions to accommodate the diverse range of information WM retains. The claustrum (CLA), with its extensive bidirectional connections to the neocortex, presents a compelling candidate for such a role. Here, we examined the involvement of the CLA in WM processes by recording CLA neuronal activity in mice engaged in olfactory and tactospatial delayed non-match-to-sample WM tasks. We identified cue-selective and delay-specific neurons in the CLA that maintained activity for tens of seconds after the stimulus presentation ended. Additionally, population activity in the CLA allowed for decoding of cue identity post-stimulus, although this signal gradually declined over time, aligning with animal behavior. Remarkably, both chemo- and optogenetic inhibition of CLA neurons severely impaired WM performance across multiple types of stored information, highlighting the CLA's critical role during both cue encoding, delay periods, and target comparison phases. These findings challenge the view that no single brain area is essential for WM storage and support a role for the CLA as an essential WM storage hub.

">An anterior hypothalamic circuit gates stress vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                Prior adversity increases susceptibility to subsequent stressful events, but the causal underlying changes in brain circuitry are poorly understood. We harnessed unbiased whole-brain activity mapping to identify circuits that are functionally remodeled by prior adversity. This revealed that the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) displays heightened stress reactivity in previously stressed mice. This was accompanied by increased functional connectivity between the AHN and a threat-related limbic network. Using in vivo Miniscope imaging, we found that neuronal activity in the AHN encodes stressor valence. Moreover, stimulating AHN neurons enhanced, and inhibiting their activity mitigated, reactivity to stressful events. Lastly, silencing amygdala inputs to the AHN abolished the ability of prior adversity to increase stress sensitivity. These findings define a key role of the AHN in gating stress vulnerability by scaling valence signals from the amygdala.

">Cortical Reactivations Modulated by Local InhibitoryCircuits Mediate Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Highly salient events activate neurons across various brain regions. During subsequent rest or sleep, the activity patterns of these neurons often correlate with those observed during the preceding experience. Growing evidence suggests that these reactivations play a crucial role in memory consolidation, the process by which experiences are solidified in cortical networks for long-term storage. Here, we demonstrate that reactivations in the lateral visual cortex are vital for the consolidation of visual association learning. By employing longitudinal two-photon Ca2+ imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, we show that targeted manipulation of PV+ inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuated cue-specific reactivations and learning, with no apparent effect on normal network function during training. In contrast, reactivations in the control group were biased towards salient cues, aligned with learning process and persisted for hours after training had ended. Overall, our results underscore a crucial role for cortical reactivations in memory consolidation.

">Mapping hippocampal-cerebellar functional connectivity across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Although the hippocampus and cerebellum are traditionally considered to support distinct memory systems, evidence from nonhuman species indicates a close bidirectional relationship during learning and navigational behaviour, with the hippocampus projecting to - and receiving input from - several cerebellar regions. However, little is known about the nature and topography of hippocampal-cerebellar connectivity in the human brain. To address this gap, we applied seed-based functional connectivity analyses to resting-state fMRI data from 479 cognitively normal participants, aged 18-88 years. We identified significant functional correlations between the hippocampus and widespread areas of cerebellar cortex, particularly lobules HIV, HV, HVI, HVIIA (Crus I and II), HIX, and HX. Contrasting the left and right hippocampus, we found significant correlations with the contralateral Crus II. We also compared longitudinal subdivisions of the hippocampus, revealing that anterior hippocampus demonstrated stronger connectivity with right Crus II, whereas posterior hippocampus was strongly connected to vermal parts of lobule V. Finally, we found that functional correlations between several hippocampal seeds (left, right, and anterior) and lobules HVI and HV decreased significantly with age. These results provide novel insights into hippocampal-cerebellar functional organisation and the influence of ageing on this system. Further studies are required to establish the role of this connection in learning and memory, as well as its potential vulnerability to neurodegeneration.

">Minimally invasive electrocorticography (ECoG) recording in common marmosets</a></h4>

              
                Electrocorticography (ECoG) enables high spatio-temporal resolution recordings of brain activity with excellent signal quality, making it essential for pre-surgical mapping in epilepsy patients and increasingly useful in neuroscience research, including the development of brain-machine interfaces. The relatively minimal cortical convolution in non-human primate (NHP) brains facilitates ECoG recordings, in particular in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), whose lissencephalic (unfolded) brain surface provides broad cortical access. One of the key advantages of ECoG recordings is the ability to study interactions between distant brain regions. The standard approach is the usage of large electrode arrays, which, however, require extended trepanations and a trade-off between size and electrode spacing. This study introduces an alternative ECoG approach for examining interactions between multiple distant cortical areas in marmosets, combining the advantages of circumscribed trepanations with high-density electrode arrays at specific sites of interest. Two adult marmosets underwent ECoG implantation across frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of interest, assessed by circumscribed trepanations to position individual high-density electrode arrays. Postoperative monitoring showed rapid recovery and no long-term complications. The animals remained healthy, and stable neural recordings were successfully obtained during behavioral tasks, highlighting the method's effectiveness for long-term cortical monitoring.

                Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we explore the potential of neural field theory (NFT) as a computational framework for representing consciousness states. While prior research has validated NFT's capacity to differentiate between normal and pathological states of consciousness, the relationship of its parameters to the representation of consciousness levels remains unclear. Here, we fitted a corticothalamic NFT model to EEG data collected from healthy individuals and patients with disorders of consciousness. We then comprehensively explored the correlations between the fitted NFT parameters and features extracted from both experimental and simulated EEG data, across various states of consciousness. The identified correlations not only highlight the model's ability to differentiate between states of consciousness, but also shed light on the physiological bases of these states, pinpointing potential biomarkers. Our results provide valuable insights into how consciousness levels are represented within the NFT framework and into the dynamics of brain activity across various consciousness states. This underscores the potential of NFT as a useful tool for consciousness research, facilitating in-silico experimentation.

                In multiple sclerosis (MS) the circulating metabolome is dysregulated, with indole lactate (ILA) being one of the most significantly reduced metabolites. We demonstrate that oral supplementation of ILA impacts key MS disease processes in two preclinical models. ILA reduces neuroinflammation by dampening immune cell activation/ infiltration; and promotes remyelination and in vitro oligodendrocyte differentiation through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Supplementation of ILA, a reductive indole metabolite, restores the gut microbiome's oxidative/reductive metabolic balance by lowering circulating indole acetate (IAA), an oxidative indole metabolite, that blocks remyelination and oligodendrocyte maturation. The ILA-induced reduction in circulating IAA is linked to changes in IAA-producing gut microbiota taxa and pathways that are also dysregulated in MS. Notably, a lower ILA:IAA ratio correlates with worse MS outcomes. Overall, these findings identify ILA as a new potential anti-inflammatory remyelinating agent and provide novel insights into the role of gut dysbiosis-related metabolic alterations in MS progression.

">Chemosensory modulation of eye-body coordination in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated eye-body movements are essential for many animal behaviors, yet the influence of chemosensory inputs on these movements remains underexplored. Here, we enhance the Fish-On-Chips optofluidic platform to reveal that larval zebrafish use coupled saccade-tail flips for chemosensory avoidance, but not pursuit. Spontaneous saccades, which alternate in direction, are closely synchronized with tail flips via anticipatory adjustments in tail flip event rate, directionality, and kinematics. In response to ethologically representative chemosensory cues, this coordination is differentially modulated based on valence. Aversive chemical cues increase saccade frequency and the proportion of saccade-coupled tail flips, while also enhancing the turning intent as the coupling strengthens. Conversely, appetitive chemicals promote more sustained gliding movements without impacting saccades or their tail flip coupling. Brain-wide neuronal activity imaging reveals that the pallium, a cortical homolog in teleosts, strongly represents the sensorimotor transformation of aversive cue-associated coupled saccade tail flips. Our findings underscore the critical role of chemosensory cues in regulating eye-body coordination in an early vertebrate species, highlighting a deep evolutionary integration of sensory inputs to optimize locomotion.

">Synaptic composition, activity, mRNA translation and dynamics in combined single-synapse profiling using multimodal imaging</a></h4>

              
                The function of neuronal circuits, and its perturbation by psychoactive molecules or disease-associated genetic variants, is governed by the interplay between synapse activity and synaptic protein localization and synthesis across a heterogeneous synapse population. Here, we combine in situ measurement of synaptic multiprotein compositions and activation states, synapse activity in calcium traces or glutamate spiking, and local translation of specific genes, across the same individual synapses. We demonstrate how this high-dimensional data enables identification of interdependencies in the multiprotein-activity network, and causal dissection of complex synaptic phenotypes in disease-relevant chemical and genetic NMDAR loss of function that translate in vivo. We show how this method generalizes to other subcellular systems by deriving mitochondrial protein networks, and, using support vector machines, its value in overcoming animal variability in phenotyping. Integrating multiple synapse information modalities enables deep structure-function characterization of synapse populations and their responses to genetic and chemical perturbations.

">Acute Aerobic Exercise Enhances Associative Learning in Active but not Sedentary Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Physical exercise has repeatedly been reported to have advantageous effects on brain functions, including learning and memory formation. However, objective tools to measure such effects are often lacking. Eyeblink conditioning is a well-characterised method for studying the neural basis of associative learning. As such, this paradigm has potential as a tool to assess to what extent exercise affects one of the most basic forms of learning. Until recently, however, using this paradigm for testing human subjects in their daily life was technically challenging. As a consequence, no studies have investigated how exercise affects eyeblink conditioning in humans. Here we hypothesize that acute aerobic exercise is associated with improved performance in eyeblink conditioning. Furthermore, we explored whether the effects of exercise differed for people with an active versus a sedentary lifestyle. We conducted a case-control study using a smartphone-based platform for conducting neurometric eyeblink conditioning in healthy adults aged between 18-40 years (n = 36). Groups were matched on age, sex, and education level. Our primary outcome measures included the amplitude and timing of conditioned eyelid responses over the course of eyeblink training. As a secondary measure, we studied the amplitude of the unconditioned responses. Acute exercise significantly enhanced the acquisition of conditioned eyelid responses; however, this effect was only true for individuals with an active lifestyle. No statistically significant effects were established for timing of the conditioned responses and amplitude of the unconditioned responses. This study highlights a facilitative role of acute aerobic exercise in associative learning and emphasises the importance of accounting for lifestyle when investigating the acute effects of exercise on brain functioning.

">Orthogonal spectral and temporal envelope representation in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Speech sounds are acoustically composed of two main components: spectral and temporal. The spectral components or carrier frequency is known to be perceived through activity at specific locations on the tonotopic map in the auditory cortex. The temporal envelope - referring to the dynamic changes in sound wave amplitude over time - plays an essential role in speech perception by mediating phoneme recognition. However, how the steepness of the envelope, which shapes its temporal structure, is represented in the auditory cortex remains poorly understood. This study investigates how the steepness of the envelope of sound waves is represented as a functional organization in the mouse auditory cortex, in relation to spectral tonotopic organization. Using macroscale calcium imaging in GCaMP6f-expressing mice, we mapped the auditory cortex's responses to tones with systematically varying rise-ramp steepness and frequencies. Our findings reveal that, in two primary-like regions of the auditory cortex, the steepness of the rise ramp is orderly mapped orthogonally to the tonotopic gradient, forming a two-dimensional representation on the cortical surface. Conversely, a significant representation of rise-ramp steepness was not detected in higher-order-like auditory regions. These findings suggest that a dichotomous functional organization independently processes temporal envelopes and spectral features in the mammalian auditory cortex, with cortical functional structures mirroring the two acoustic structures.

">A circuit model for transsaccadic space updating and mislocalization</a></h4>

              
                We perceive a stable, continuous world despite drastic changes of retinal images across saccades. However, while persistent objects in daily life appear stable across saccades, stimuli flashed around saccades can be grossly mislocalized. We address this puzzle with our recently proposed circuit model for perisaccadic receptive-field (RF) remapping in LIP and FEF. The model uses center/surround connections to store a relevant stimulus' retinal location in memory as a population activity. This activity profile is updated across each saccade by directional connections gated by the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command. The updating is a continuous backward (against the saccade) shift of the population activity (equivalent to continuous forward remapping of the RFs), whose cumulative effect across the saccade is a subtraction of the saccade vector. The model explains forward and backward translational mislocalization for stimuli flashed around the saccade onset and offset, respectively, as insufficient and unnecessary cumulative updating after the saccade, caused by the sluggish CD time course and visual response latency. We confirm the model prediction that for perisaccadic RFs measured with flashes before the saccades, the final forward remapping magnitudes after the saccades are smaller for later flashes. We discuss the possibility that compressive mislocalization results from a brief reduction of attentional remapping and repulsion. Although many models of RF remapping, transsaccadic updating, and perisaccadic mislocalization have been proposed, our work unifies them into a single circuit mechanism and suggests that the brain uses "unaware" decoders which do not distinguish between different origins of neurons' activities.

">NAD+ - and EVA1-C-dependent reversal of neurological deficits is mediated by differential alternative RNA splicing in tauopathic animal models</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant alternative splicing events (ASEs) are emerging as a new hallmark of aging and are linked to age-related neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD brains are characterized by abundant intracellular proteinaceous aggregates, including neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Although NAD+ and related metabolites can slow down AD progression, the effects of NAD+ on ASEs in AD remain unclear. This study investigates the relationships between NAD+ metabolism, ASEs and AD or AD-like pathologies including tauopathies using deep-learning AI-based algorithms to predict protein structures and protein-protein interactions as well as experimental tauopathy models including hTau.P301S transgenic mice and transgenic hTau[P301L] Caenorhabditis elegans. Mouse transcriptomic data were mined to detect ASEs that were differentially induced in the presence of NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) with specific focus on the Eva1-C locus. The results reveal that the relative abundance of Eva1-C isoforms is sensitive to both the concentration of NR and to tauopathy genotype. NAD+ abundance/metabolic status modulates ASEs and the expression of EVA1-C isoforms, which in turn regulate the interaction with the key proteins, BAG-1 and HSP70, involved in orchestrating protein homeostasis. Importantly, EVA1-C is dramatically reduced in the postmortem entorhinal cortex and hippocampal neurons from 20 Braak 5/6 AD patients compared to 20 of cognitive normal humans. Thus, this study supports the novel idea that NAD+ metabolism modulates abundance of specific mRNA isoforms, and that ASEs influence disease progression in model tauopathies and potentially AD. These results could facilitate future development of NAD+-based splice-switching therapeutics for AD.

	<p>Background. Language development in toddlers can be influenced by social interactions in environments and proximal contexts with mothers and fathers. We present the literature on mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; education level and socioeconomic status on the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s language development; further evidence is needed in the Italian-speaking context. Aims. The study aims to confirm the role of mother and father education level on toddlers&amp;amp;rsquo; language skills assessed with direct and indirect measures. Methods and Procedures. Participants were 51 Italian-speaking children aged 33 to 41 months. Children were tested with a lexical test (PinG test) for comprehension and production of nouns and predicates and a morpho-syntactic test for grammar comprehension (PCGO). Parents of the children completed a demographic form and the Italian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates CDI long version. Two series of one-way ANCOVAs were performed to study the role of mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education on separate measures of their child&amp;amp;rsquo;s language. Outcomes and Results. Findings suggest that in most families, mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education is higher than fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education. There was no significant difference between children of parents with low&amp;amp;ndash;middle level of education and children of parents with high level of education for the grammar comprehension tasks (PCGO) and indirect measure of vocabulary production (MacArthur-Bates CDI). However, both mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education appears to be significant for the direct measurement of word production. Conclusions and Implications. This study provides new evidence for the role of mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; education on the development of word production in children aged 33 to 41 months, contributing to enriching the literature on the Italian context; it lays the groundwork for future research on the social and environmental factors that can affect language development.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Opting to perform emotion regulation when facing high-arousal stimuli enhances the reduction in negative emotions. Previous research has indicated that self-choice, that is, personally choosing from multiple alternatives, can improve performance. However, it is unclear whether the emotion regulation strategy chosen among multiple alternatives in daily life enhances stress reduction compared to a forced strategy. This study aimed to reveal the effects of self-choice emotion regulation and its underlying neural basis. Methods: Participants were 40 healthy adults who met the inclusion criteria; they performed self-choice emotion regulation, forced emotion regulation, and no emotion regulation (the control condition) while their brain activity was captured using a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. First, the participants were shown a stressful scenario. Secondly, they rated the stress they experienced. Thirdly, they performed self-choice or forced emotion regulation or did nothing. Finally, participants rated their stress level again. Results: Self-choice emotion regulation reduced stress better than forced-choice emotion regulation. The stress reduction was associated with decreases in the activation of the left opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Self-choice can improve emotion regulation, and this effect is likely mediated by the neural efficiency of the left inferior frontal gyrus.</p>

	<p>Objectives&amp;amp;mdash;Our aim is to investigate the executive functions involved in idiom comprehension. The understanding of idioms has largely been explored from a developmental perspective. However, little is known about the cognitive processes involved. Recent studies highlight the contributions of working memory and inhibitory control in idiom processing. We investigated executive functions&amp;amp;rsquo; implication in idiom comprehension from a life-span perspective. Methods&amp;amp;mdash;The participants of this study were aged from 6 years to adulthood (n = 109 participants). An idiom comprehension task and executive tests were administered. Results and Conclusions&amp;amp;mdash;The results indicated that idiom comprehension improved across all the age groups tested. Moreover, the involvement of inhibition and cognitive flexibility processes was specific at different ages and particularly involved during adolescence.</p>

We describe an ambitious project to abstract medical records facilitating epidemiological investigation. Methods: Abstracted data include medications; laboratory results; women&amp;amp;rsquo;s health; blood pressure; physical injuries; cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric and other medical conditions. Results: Of 1419 of 5763 participants with completed abstractions, 1387 (97.7%) were deceased; 602 (42.4%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias; 985 (69.4%) had a brain autopsy. Each participant had an average of 34.3 (SD = 13.4) years of data abstracted. Over 64% had pharmacy data preceding 1977; 87.5% had laboratory data preceding 1988. Stroke, anxiety, depression and confusion during hospitalization were common among participants diagnosed with dementia. Conclusions: Medical records are transformed into data for analyses with outcomes derived from other ACT data. We provide detailed, unparalleled longitudinal clinical data to support a variety of epidemiological research on clinical-pathological correlations.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Debates regarding how to represent verb phrases (VPs) consisting of the verb plus the complement and the aspectual marker -le in Mandarin Chinese remain an issue. Methods: Syntactic priming under a memory disguise paradigm was employed to investigate the issue using the SVO-ba alternation, where the SVO structure consists of a subject verb object, and the ba structure of a subject ba object verb, in five-year-olds (n = 216), an age with fully fledged grammatical knowledge but little interference from literacy. Results: The results indicate that both the complement and the marker -le should be represented in terms of phrasal rather than morphological structures. When -le is inflected to the verb alone, realization, which makes an event a fact, rather than completion, which makes an event finished, is accomplished. The event must be telicized to a state through a resultative complement to induce reliable production of the ba construction. The postverbal elements represent their own phrasal structure and challenge the verb-centered lexico-syntactic account because there are no additional representations left within a verb. Conclusions: More elicitations of the SVO than the ba invite future neurolinguistic explorations to disentangle the impacts of the frequency and thematic arrangement of agent and patient on grammatical representations cross-linguistically.</p>

	<p>Background: Managing anxiety and behavior during pediatric dental procedures is challenging. This study examines the effects of combining ibuprofen with midazolam sedation using both behavioral management and clinical hypnosis to improve patient cooperation and reduce post-treatment pain. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 311 children (mean age 74.2 months, standard deviation (SD) = 24.7) was conducted. Patients received either midazolam with ibuprofen (n = 156) or midazolam only (n = 155). Behavior was assessed using the Venham Behavior Rating Scale and anxiety with the Dental Subscale of Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fear Survey Schedule (CFSS-DS) and the Inventory of Stressful Situations (ISS) questionnaires. Statistical analyses included Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests and correlation analyses. Results: Ibuprofen did not significantly improve behavior during procedures (drinking phase 0.61, SD 1.31, p = 0.13; before treatment 0.25, SD 0.93, p = 0.53, anesthesia 1.21, SD 1.55, p = 0.29; after treatment 0.51, SD 1.22, p = 0.68), indicating that pharmacological pain management alone is insufficient to address behavioral challenges. Ibuprofen significantly reduced post-treatment pain, with 7.2% of cases reporting pain in the non-ibuprofen group compared to none in the ibuprofen group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Ibuprofen had no effect on intraoperative behavior and only a limited effect on post-procedural pain, mainly for more invasive procedures. This study highlights the integration of sedation with behavioral strategies, such as clinical hypnosis, to manage anxiety and improve patient cooperation, aiming to enhance treatment outcomes using this integrative approach to pediatric dentistry. Further research is needed to optimize these strategies and verify them in a prospective setting.</p>

                Rabani et al. show that CD84 upregulation leads to increased immune suppression in the TME of TNBC. In Bregs, CD84 controls interleukin-10 expression through the β-catenin/Tcf4 pathway. Blocking CD84 potentiates anti-tumor immunity, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Hence, the authors suggest CD84 as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Driving abilities require the synchronized activity of cerebral networks associated with sensorimotor integration, motricity, and executive functions. Drivers with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (DwP) have impaired driving ability, but little is known about the impact of &amp;amp;ldquo;wearing-off&amp;amp;rdquo; and therapies in addition to L-DOPA on driving capacities. This study aimed to (i) compare driving performance between DwP during different motor states and healthy controls and (ii) assess the impact of add-on therapies on driving abilities. Methods: DwP (n = 26) were enrolled as individuals experiencing wearing-off symptoms and treated (within 6 months before the enrollment) with add-on therapies to L-DOPA, including MAO inhibitors for DwP-A (n = 12) or opicapone for DwP-B (n = 14). Age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 12) were also enrolled. DwP received two driving assessments in a driving simulator during their &amp;amp;ldquo;best-on&amp;amp;rdquo; time and during their wearing-off time on different days. An anamnestic driving questionnaire was collected with the assistance of partners. A Virtual Driving Rating Scale (VDRS) was calculated, as well as learning curves (LCs) for driving items calculated in minutes. Results: DwP reported worse driving performance than CON at the driving questionnaire. In line with this, DwP showed worse VDRS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and LC (p = 0.021) than CON. Lower VDRS was associated with wearing-off (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but DwP-B had better driving performance while in their &amp;amp;ldquo;best-on&amp;amp;rdquo; time (p = 0.037) and more items improving with LCs (7 vs. 3) than DwP-A. Conclusions: DwP demonstrated impaired driving compared to controls. Wearing-off symptoms can also affect driving ability, but therapies (opicapone more so than MAO inhibitors) may play a role in preserving specific driving skills, possibly through maintaining learning abilities.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and emotional instability (EI) using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Additionally, it sought to identify key molecular mechanisms underlying emotional instability through a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. Methods: MR analyses utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were conducted to estimate the effects of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the BMR on PTSD, MDD, and EI. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Concurrently, a bioinformatic analysis was executed on gene expression datasets (GSE53987 and GSE21138) derived from emotionally unstable patients. This analysis encompassed the differential gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by an functional enrichment analysis to uncover key molecular pathways associated with EI. Results: The MR analysis revealed that increased physical activity may have a protective effect against PTSD, albeit with inconsistent effects on MDD and EI. Sedentary behavior and the BMR demonstrated minimal associations with PTSD, MDD, or EI. The bioinformatic analysis identified 114 DEGs associated with EI, with YWHAB, SRRM2, MST1, HDAC10, and HSPA1A highlighted as significant genes. The functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs unveiled key pathways potentially involved in the molecular pathology of emotional instability. Conclusions: Physical activity appears to protect against PTSD, whereas its effects on MDD and EI are less definitive. The bioinformatic findings offer a deeper molecular understanding of EI, pinpointing specific genes and pathways that may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Further research is warranted to elucidate these intricate interactions and the identified molecular mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Migraine is a disease that stands out for its high prevalence and socioeconomic costs. It involves the entire trigeminovascular system, the signaling substances, and their targets. However, the role of meningeal mast cells in migraine is still unclear. To better understand one of the components of neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology, we developed an in vivo rat model in which the dura mater was exposed bilaterally to investigate the influence of topiramate on capsaicin-induced mast cell degranulation and CGRP release from dura mater. Methods: On the day of the experiment, rats were anesthetized, and a craniectomy was performed on each parietal bone. Test substances were applied in situ over the dura mater using the right and left sides of the dura mater for the test and control, respectively. After exposure, the dura mater was processed for mast cell staining and counting. Using this setup, the effect of capsaicin (10&amp;amp;minus;3 M) was evaluated in rats of both sexes, and subsequently the effect of in situ (10&amp;amp;minus;3 M, 20 &amp;amp;micro;L) and (20 mg/kg/day for 10 days) topiramate treatment on mast cell degranulation and CGRP release were evaluated. Results: In both female and male rats, there was a greater amount of degranulated mast cells in the side stimulated by capsaicin compared to the control side in both females (18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3% vs. 74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3%; p = 0.016) and males (28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2% vs. 74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3%, p = 0.016). In the group treated with topiramate for 10 days prior to the experiments, capsaicin did not induce mast cell degranulation (control 20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% vs. capsaicin 22 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.375) in contrast to animals treated for 10 days with gavage control (control 25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% vs. capsaicin 76 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.016). Topiramate applied in situ concomitant with capsaicin did not protect the mast cells from degranulation in response to capsaicin (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2% vs. 44 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.016). There was a significant reduction in CGRP release from the dura mater in the group treated with topiramate for 10 days compared to the control. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a novel experimental model wherein systemic administration of topiramate is observed to modulate the impact of capsaicin on meningeal mast cell degranulation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) has the potential to draw positive consequences from trauma. Hence, there is interest in finding ways to promote PTG. Research has identified an attentional bias towards positive resilience-related words (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;persistence&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;amp;rdquo;) in university students who report high PTG after experiencing adversities. Although people can respond to these experiences by showing low PTG, this bias seems to help with their struggle by making purposeful contents more accessible. Therefore, boosting attentional bias towards positive resilience-related words could help people with low PTG. Methods: In this study, the participants were thirty-six university students who had experienced bullying before entering university. Using a Stroop emotional task, they identified the color of resilience and neutral words, either positive or negative, before and after being submitted to transcranial direct current stimulation. Stimulation was targeted at the right temporal area involved in intentionality processing. Results: In the anodal condition, the results support a stimulation effect on the resilience attentional bias that could benefit participants with low PTG. A significant moderation of approach motivation for this effect was also found. Specifically, only when participants had medium or high approach motivation did stimulation boost the attentional bias in students with low PTG. Conclusions: These results support that tDCS stimulation in this brain area is effective in enhancing resilience attentional bias in low-PTG students. However, for this effect to occur it is necessary to have approach motivation, which is motivation related to goals.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Microsurgical clipping has traditionally been considered a standard treatment for middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. Recently, a caseload reduction related to improved endovascular treatment options has occurred in cerebrovascular neurosurgery. Therefore, studies that report the clinical and radiological outcomes after clipping are highly warranted. Methods: Patients with an unruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysm, who were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery in Linz between 2002 and 2019, were included in this study. Clinical and radiological outcome parameters were evaluated for each patient. Results: Overall, 272 patients were eligible for inclusion. Complete aneurysm occlusion was demonstrated in 266 (99.3%) of the 268 (98.5%) patients who underwent postoperative digital subtraction angiography. In six (2.2%) patients, a permanent new neurological deficit (pNND) persisted after treatment. Intraoperative aneurysm rupture was a significant factor (p = 0.0049) in the logistic regression. At the last follow-up, only two patients (0.7%) had an unfavorable outcome (mRS &amp;amp;gt; 2). More recent surgeries were associated with fewer cases of pNND (p = 0.009). A transient new neurological deficit occurred in 13 patients (4.8%), with aneurysm size being a significant risk factor (p = 0.009). Surgical site infections were reported in four patients (1.5%), with patient age (p = 0.039) and time (p = 0.001) being significant factors. Two patients died (0.7%) perioperatively and two patients (0.7%) needed a retreatment in the long-term follow-up. Conclusions: The findings indicate that microsurgical clipping is a safe procedure with minimal need for retreatment. It achieves a high occlusion rate while maintaining a very low rate of adverse outcomes. Continuous intraoperative enhancements over time have contributed to a progressive improvement in clinical outcomes in recent years. This trend is exemplified by the absence of detectable pNND in the era of ICG angiography. Consequently, these data support the conclusion that microsurgical clipping should still be considered an appropriate treatment option for unruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysms.</p>

	<p>In schizophrenia, it was suggested that an integrated and multimodal approach, combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, could improve functional outcomes and clinical features in patients living with schizophrenia (PLWS). Among these alternatives, evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) represent feasible treatment options targeting the clinical features that are unmet needs of PLWS (especially negative and cognitive symptoms). As no clear evidence is available on the combination of these non-pharmacological approaches, this review aimed to collect the available literature on the combination of EBPIs and NIBS in the treatment of PLWS. We demonstrated that the field of combining EBPIs and NIBS in schizophrenia is in its infancy, as only 11 studies were reviewed. In fact, only a few trials, with divergent results, combined these non-pharmacological modalities; while emerging evidence is available on the combination of cognitive remediation and rTMS/iTBS, inconclusive results were obtained. Conversely, albeit preliminary, more solid findings are available on the combination of HF-rTMS and family intervention. Moreover, despite the fact that cognitive activation could not be considered an EBPI, promising results are available in combination with tDCS to improve the working memory domain. To overcome these limitations, we considered several methodological issues to promote research in this field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face challenges in social communication due to difficulties in considering context, processing information, and interpreting social cues. This study aims to explore the neural processes related to pragmatic language communication in children with ASD and address the research question of how functional brain connectivity operates during complex pragmatic language tasks. Methods: We examined differences in brain functional connectivity between children with ASD and typically developing peers while they engaged in video recordings of spoken language tasks. We focused on two types of speech acts: semantic and pragmatic. Results: Our results showed differences between groups during the pragmatic and semantic language processing, indicating more idiosyncratic connectivity in children with ASD in the Left Somatomotor and Left Limbic networks, suggesting that these networks play a role in task-dependent functional connectivity. Additionally, these functional differences were mainly localized to the left hemisphere.</p>

	<p>Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently a promising technique for psychiatric patients with severe and treatment-resistant symptoms. However, the results to date have been quite heterogeneous, and the indications for psychosurgery with DBS remain in an experimental phase. One of the major challenges limiting the advancement of DBS in psychiatric disorders is the lack of objective criteria for diagnosing certain conditions, which are often based more on clinical scales rather than measurable biological markers. Additionally, there is a limited capacity to objectively assess treatment outcomes. Methods: This overview examines the literature on the available biomarkers in psychosurgery in relation to DBS, as well as other relevant biomarkers in psychiatry with potential applicability for this treatment modality. Results: There are five types of biomarkers: clinical/behavioral, omic, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neurobiochemical. The information provided by each biomarker within these categories is highly variable and may be relevant for diagnosis, response prediction, target selection, program adjustment, etc. Conclusions: A better understanding of biomarkers and their applications would allow DBS in psychosurgery to advance on a more objective basis, guided by the information provided by them and within the context of precision psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a leading neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting approximately 55 million individuals globally, a number projected to escalate to 139 million by 2050. Despite extensive research spanning several decades, the cure for AD remains at a developing stage. The only existing therapeutic options are limited to symptom management, and are often accompanied by adverse side effects. The pathological features of AD, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, result in progressive neuronal death, synaptic loss, and brain atrophy, leading to significant cognitive decline and a marked reduction in quality of life. Objective: In light of the shortcomings of existing pharmacological interventions, this review explores the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) as a non-invasive therapeutic option for AD. PBM employs infrared light to facilitate cellular repair and regeneration, focusing on addressing the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s underlying biomechanical mechanisms. Method: This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the mechanisms of PBM and an analysis of preclinical studies evaluating its impact on cellular health, cognitive function, and disease progression in AD.The review provides a comprehensive overview of the various wavelengths and application methods, evaluating their efficacy in mitigating AD-related symptoms. Conclusions: The findings underscore the significant potential of PBM as a safe and effective alternative treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, emphasizing the necessity for further research and clinical trials to establish its therapeutic efficacy conclusively.</p>

                <p>Pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, has recently been found to play an important role in spinal cord injury (SCI). C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), and NLR-family CARD-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) have been reported to be associated with neuronal pyroptosis, but few studies have clarified their functions and regulatory mechanisms in SCI. In this study, CLEC5A, TREM1, and NLRC4 were highly expressed in lidocaine-induced SCI rat models, and their knockdown alleviated lidocaine-induced SCI. The elevation of pyroptosis-related indicators LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; levels in SCI rats was attenuated after silencing of CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. Lidocaine-induced decrease in cell viability and the elevation in cell death were partly reversed after CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4 silencing. Lidocaine-mediated effects on the levels of LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; in lidocaine-induced PC12 cells were weakened by downregulating CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. CLEC5A could interact with TREM1 to mediate NLRC4 expression, thus accelerating neuronal pyroptosis, ultimately leading to SCI exacerbation. In conclusions, CLEC5A interacted with TREM1 to increase NLRC4 expression, thus promoting neuronal pyroptosis in rat SCI models, providing new insights into the role of neuronal pyroptosis in SCI.</p>

                <p>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) from <I>Polygonum multiflorum</I> exerts neuroprotective effects after ischemic stroke. We explored whether TSG improved ischemic stroke injury via PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro model and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model were established. Cerebral injury was assessed by neurological score, hematoxylin and eosin staining, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and brain water content. Apoptosis, cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8, and JC-1 staining, respectively. Colocalization of LC3-labeled autophagosomes with lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2-labeled lysosomes or translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20-labeled mitochondria was observed with fluorescence microscopy. The ubiquitination level was determined using ubiquitination assay. The interaction between molecules was validated by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione <I>S</I>-transferase pull-down. We found that TSG promoted mitophagy and improved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion damage in MCAO rats. In OGD/R-subjected neurons, TSG promoted mitophagy, repressed neuronal apoptosis, upregulated Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1), and activated PINK1/Parkin signaling. TSG upregulated ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) to elevate YBX1 protein. Furthermore, USP10 inhibited ubiquitination-dependent YBX1 degradation. <I>USP10</I> overexpression activated PINK1/Parkin signaling and promoted mitophagy, which were reversed by <I>YBX1</I> knockdown. Moreover, TSG upregulated USP10 to promote mitophagy and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, TSG facilitated PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy by upregulating USP10/YBX1 axis to ameliorate ischemic stroke.</p>

                <p>It remains unknown whether the Chinese tree shrew, regarded as the closest sister of primate, has evolved a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) comparable with primates that is characterized by a fourth layer (L4) enriched with granular cells and reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Here, we reported that following AAV-hSyn-EGFP expression in the MD neurons, the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography revealed their projection trajectories and targeted brain areas, such as the hippocampus, the corpus striatum, and the dlPFC. Cre-dependent transsynaptic viral tracing identified the MD projection terminals that targeted the L4 of the dlPFC, in which the presence of granular cells was confirmed via cytoarchitectural studies by using the Nissl, Golgi, and vGlut2 stainings. Additionally, the L5/6 of the dlPFC projected back to the MD. These results suggest that the tree shrew has evolved a primate-like dlPFC which can serve as an alternative for studying cognition-related functions of the dlPFC.</p>

Data in behavioral research is often quantified with event-logging software, generating large data sets containing detailed information about subjects, recipients, and the duration of behaviors. Exploring and analyzing such large data sets can be challenging without tools to visualize behavioral interactions between individuals or transitions between behavioral states, yet software that can adequately visualize complex behavioral data sets is rare. TIBA (The Interactive Behavior Analyzer) is a web application for behavioral data visualization, which provides a series of interactive visualizations, including the temporal occurrences of behavioral events, the number and direction of interactions between individuals, the behavioral transitions and their respective transitional frequencies, as well as the visual and algorithmic comparison of the latter across data sets. It can therefore be applied to visualize behavior across individuals, species, or contexts. Several filtering options (selection of behaviors and individuals) together with options to set node and edge properties (in the network drawings) allow for interactive customization of the output drawings, which can also be downloaded afterwards. TIBA accepts data outputs from popular logging software and is implemented in Python and JavaScript, with all current browsers supported. The web application and usage instructions are available at tiba.inf.uni-konstanz.de. The source code is publicly available on GitHub: github.com/LSI-UniKonstanz/tiba.

                <p>by Uma R. Mohan, Joshua Jacobs</p>

Invasive brain stimulation is used to treat individuals with episodic memory loss; however, studies to date report both enhancement and impairment of memory. This Essay discusses the sources of this variability, and suggests a path towards developing customized stimulation protocols for more consistent memory enhancement.
Author summary: Episodic memory is a critical aspect of everyday life that allows us to recall events, make decisions, and navigate our environments. It is estimated that 1 in 25 Americans suffer from episodic memory loss from Alzheimer ‘s disease, dementia, or following a traumatic brain injury. Clinicians and researchers have recently tried to help supplement or repair memory in individuals with episodic memory disorders using electrical brain stimulation. However, although there is evidence of invasive brain stimulation improving memory, studies also show that it can have variable effects, and sometimes cause memory impairment. In this Essay, we investigate these differences and try to explain this variability. We propose that key aspects of the memory network are heterogeneous across individuals, requiring customized stimulation protocols to create successful brain stimulation systems for memory enhancement. We provide a plan for applying brain stimulation while overcoming this variability by using closed-loop stimulation protocols that are customized according to a person’s own anatomical structure, functional connectivity, and memory-related electrophysiological patterns.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

                Abstract Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Liu et al. show that C. elegans specifically recognizes divergent oomycete pathogens through paired transmembrane C-type lectin receptors. These act mainly in AWA neurons and the intestine to induce in the epidermis a protective immune response characterized by the induction of chitinase-like (chil) genes.

                In this paper, Lu et al. characterize a population of neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis that is activated by general anesthetics and diazepam. These neurons suppress behavioral and autonomic characteristics of anxiety and could be a key mediator of the anxiolytic properties of anesthetics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104071">Navigating neurodiversity in higher education in India</a></h4>

              
                The concept of neurodiversity embraces the idea that there are many different ways of perceiving, thinking about and responding to the world around us. Yet, many countries – including India, with its vast population – still struggle with this concept. Societal perceptions and stereotypes surrounding neurodiversity, often fuelled by ignorance and misinformation, contribute to the marginalisation and exclusion experienced by neurodivergent individuals. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities that neurodivergent students in Indian higher education face, highlighting the urgent need for systemic change to co-create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95811">GDF2 and BMP10 coordinate liver cellular crosstalk to maintain liver health</a></h4>

              
                The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is primarily composed of hepatocytes (HCs), endothelial cells (ECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which spatially interact and cooperate with each other to maintain liver homeostasis. However, the complexity and molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these different cell types remain to be revealed. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of <i>Gdf2</i> (also known as <i>Bmp9</i>) and <i>Bmp10</i> in different liver cell types and demonstrated that HSCs were the major source of GDF2 and BMP10 in the liver. Using transgenic ALK1 (receptor for GDF2 and BMP10) reporter mice, we found that ALK1 is expressed on KCs and ECs other than HCs and HSCs, and GDF2 and BMP10 secreted by HSCs promote the differentiation of KCs and ECs and maintain their identity. <i>Pdgfb</i> expression was significantly upregulated in KCs and ECs after <i>Gdf2</i> and <i>Bmp10</i> deletion, ultimately leading to HSCs activation and liver fibrosis. ECs express several angiocrine factors, such as BMP2, BMP6, Wnt2, and Rspo3, to regulate HC iron metabolism and metabolic zonation. We found that these angiocrine factors were significantly decreased in ECs from <i>Gdf2/Bmp10</i><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice, which further resulted in liver iron overload and disruption of HC zonation. In summary, we demonstrated that HSCs play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk via the production of GDF2 and BMP10, highlighting the important role of intercellular interaction in organ development and homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84053">Emergence of planar cell polarity from the interplay of local interactions and global gradients</a></h4>

              
                Planar cell polarity (PCP) – tissue-scale alignment of the direction of asymmetric localization of proteins at the cell-cell interface – is essential for embryonic development and physiological functions. Abnormalities in PCP can result in developmental imperfections, including neural tube closure defects and misaligned hair follicles. Decoding the mechanisms responsible for PCP establishment and maintenance remains a fundamental open question. While the roles of various molecules – broadly classified into “global” and “local” modules – have been well-studied, their necessity and sufficiency in explaining PCP and connecting their perturbations to experimentally observed patterns have not been examined. Here, we develop a minimal model that captures the proposed features of PCP establishment – a global tissue-level gradient and local asymmetric distribution of protein complexes. The proposed model suggests that while polarity can emerge without a gradient, the gradient not only acts as a global cue but also increases the robustness of PCP against stochastic perturbations. We also recapitulated and quantified the experimentally observed features of swirling patterns and domineering non-autonomy, using only three free model parameters - the rate of protein binding to membrane, the concentration of PCP proteins, and the gradient steepness. We explain how self-stabilizing asymmetric protein localizations in the presence of tissue-level gradient can lead to robust PCP patterns and reveal minimal design principles for a polarized system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100083">One N-glycan regulates natural killer cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and modulates Fc γ receptor IIIa/CD16a structure</a></h4>

              
                Both endogenous antibodies and a subset of antibody therapeutics engage Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)IIIa/CD16a to stimulate a protective immune response. Increasing the FcγRIIIa/IgG1 interaction improves the immune response and thus represents a strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy. FcγRIIIa is a heavily glycosylated receptor and glycan composition affects antibody-binding affinity. Though our laboratory previously demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cell N-glycan composition affected the potency of one key protective mechanism, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), it was unclear if this effect was due to FcγRIIIa glycosylation. Furthermore, the structural mechanism linking glycan composition to affinity and cellular activation remained undescribed. To define the role of individual amino acid and N-glycan residues, we measured affinity using multiple FcγRIIIa glycoforms. We observed stepwise affinity increases with each glycan truncation step, with the most severely truncated glycoform displaying the highest affinity. Removing the N162 glycan demonstrated its predominant role in regulating antibody-binding affinity, in contrast to four other FcγRIIIa N-glycans. We next evaluated the impact of the N162 glycan on NK cell ADCC. NK cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 allotype exhibited increased ADCC following kifunensine treatment to limit N-glycan processing. Notably, an increase was not observed with cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 S164A variant that lacks N162 glycosylation, indicating that the N162 glycan is required for increased NK cell ADCC. To gain structural insight into the mechanisms of N162 regulation, we applied a novel protein isotope labeling approach in combination with solution NMR spectroscopy. FG loop residues proximal to the N162 glycosylation site showed large chemical shift perturbations following glycan truncation. These data support a model for the regulation of FcγRIIIa affinity and NK cell ADCC whereby composition of the N162 glycan stabilizes the FG loop and thus the antibody-binding site.

	<p>Background: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to synchronize their actions with external auditory stimuli through a process called auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor or rhythmic entrainment. Positive effects of rhythmic entrainment have been demonstrated in adults with neurological movement disorders, yet the neural substrates supporting the transformation of auditory input into timed rhythmic motor outputs are not fully understood. We aimed to systematically map and synthesize the research on the neural correlates of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor entrainment and synchronization. Methods: Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews, a systematic search was conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus) for articles published between 2013 and 2023. Results: From an initial return of 1430 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized based on the neuroimaging modality. There is converging evidence that auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor synchronization engages bilateral cortical and subcortical networks, including the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Specifically, the supplementary motor area and the basal ganglia are essential for beat-based timing and internally guided rhythmic movements, while the cerebellum plays an important role in tracking and processing complex rhythmic patterns and synchronizing to the external beat. Self-paced tapping is associated with additional activations in the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, suggesting that tapping in the absence of auditory cues requires more neural resources. Lastly, existing studies indicate that movement rate and the type of music further modulate the EEG power in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of clinical implications and rhythm-based therapies.</p>

	<p>Background: The neurosurgical treatment of thoracic disc herniation (TDH) has undergone dramatic changes over the years in terms of surgical approaches and intraoperative technological tools. There is still no unanimous consent on the criteria for approach selection, and the choice varies among Institutions. The aim of this study is to compare anterior and posterolateral approaches for TDH in terms of functional and surgical outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines from EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar online databases up to May 2024 incorporated studies that reported outcomes of thoracic disc herniation surgeries. Analyzed factors included major peri- and postoperative complications, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, neurological improvement, and complete hernia resection. Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and mean differences. Results: The posterolateral approach was associated with significantly lower rates of major medical (OR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.27) and surgical complications (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.99) compared to the anterior approach. Additionally, posterolateral approaches reduced intraoperative blood loss and shorter hospital stays. Posterolateral techniques were linked to higher odds of neurological improvement (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.99) and higher rates of complete hernia resection (OR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.71). Conclusions: Posterolateral approaches offer advantages in terms of safety, recovery, neurological improvement, and complete hernia resection. More extensive prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and refine surgical strategies. Emerging technologies, such as the exoscope and 45&amp;amp;deg; endoscopy, may further enhance surgical outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background. Pain is known to negatively impact attention, but its influence on more complex cognitive abilities, such as logical reasoning, remains inconsistent. This may be due to compensatory mechanisms (e.g., investing additional resources), which might not be detectable at the behavioral level but can be observed through psychophysiological measures. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally induced pain affects logical reasoning and underlying attentional mechanisms, using both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. Methods. A total of 98 female participants were divided into a pain-free control group (N = 47) and a pain group (N = 51). Both groups completed the Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) task, with EEG recordings capturing task-related power (TRP) changes in the upper alpha frequency band (10&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz). We used a mixed design where all participants completed half of the APM task in a pain-free state (control condition); the second half was completed under pain induction by the pain group but not the pain-free group (experimental condition). Results. Logical reasoning performance, as measured by APM scores and response times, declined during the experimental condition, compared to the control condition for both groups, indicating that the second part of the APM was more difficult than the first part. However, no significant differences were found between the pain and pain-free groups, suggesting that pain did not impair cognitive performance at the behavioral level. In contrast, EEG measures revealed significant differences in upper alpha band power, particularly at fronto-central sites. In the pain group, the decrease in TRP during the experimental condition was significantly smaller compared to both the control condition and the pain-free group. Conclusions. Pain did not impair task performance at the behavioral level but reduced attentional resources, as reflected by changes in upper alpha band activity. This underscores the importance of incorporating more sensitive psychophysiological measures alongside behavioral measures to better understand the impact of pain on cognitive processes.</p>

	<p>Background: Focal mechanical vibration therapy has gained attention as a potential intervention to improve motor function while decreasing spasticity and pain in post-stroke patients. Despite promising results, there remains variability in study designs and outcomes, warranting a review of its clinical efficacy. Methods: A review was conducted to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of focal mechanical vibration therapy on post-stroke rehabilitation. Six studies were included, assessing outcomes such as spasticity reduction (using the Modified Ashworth Scale), motor function recovery (Wolf Motor Function Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment), and pain management (Visual Analog Scale, Numerical Rating Scale). The quality of studies was evaluated using the PEDro scale and RoB-2 tool. An overview review was conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic. Results: The included studies demonstrated significant reductions in spasticity and improvements in motor function in most patients receiving focal vibration therapy. Notable improvements were observed when focal vibration was combined with other rehabilitation techniques, such as progressive modular rebalancing or robotic rehabilitation. Pain levels were also reduced in several studies. However, differences in vibration parameters (frequency, amplitude), small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Focal mechanical vibration therapy appears to be an effective adjunct in post-stroke rehabilitation, particularly for reducing spasticity and improving motor function. Although short-term benefits are promising, further research is required to determine long-term efficacy and optimal treatment parameters. This review evaluates the effectiveness of focal vibration therapy in treating motor deficits and spasticity in post-stroke patients. The results suggest its potential to improve these conditions, though further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Around 20% of cancer patients will develop brain metastases (BrMs), with 15&amp;amp;ndash;25% occurring in the posterior fossa (PF). Although the effectiveness of systemic therapies is increasing, surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (S+SRS) versus definitive SRS remains the mainstay of treatment. Given the space restrictions within the PF, patients with BrMs in this location are at higher risk of brainstem compression, hydrocephalus, herniation, coma, and death. However, the criteria for treating large PF BrMs with S+SRS versus definitive SRS remains unclear. Methods: We reviewed a prospective registry database (2009 to 2020) and identified 64 patients with large PF BrMs (&amp;amp;ge;4 cc) treated with SRS or S+SRS. Clinical and radiological parameters were analyzed. The two endpoints were overall survival (OS) and local failure (LF). Results: Patients in the S+SRS group were more highly symptomatic than patients in the SRS group. Gait imbalance and intracranial pressure symptoms were 97% and 80%, and 47% and 35% for S+SRS and SRS, respectively. Radiologically, there were significant differences in the mean volume of the lesions [6.7 cm3 in SRS vs. 29.8 cm3 in the S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]; compression of the fourth ventricle [47% in SRS vs. 96% in S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]; and hydrocephalus [0% in SRS vs. 29% in S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]. Patients treated with S+SRS had a higher Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA). LF was 12 and 17 months for SRS and S+SRS, respectively. Moreover, the S+SRS group had improved OS (12 vs. 26 months, p = 0.001). Conclusions: A higher proportion of patients treated with S+SRS presented with hydrocephalus, fourth-ventricle compression, and larger lesion volumes. SRS-alone patients had a lower KPS, a lower GPA, and more brain metastases. S+SRS correlated with improved OS, suggesting that it should be seriously considered for patients with large PF-BrM.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely aggressive brain tumor that has few available treatment options and a dismal prognosis. Recent research has highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) produced from mesenchymal stem cells as a potential treatment approach for GBM. MSC-EVs, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, perform a significant function in cellular communication and have shown promise in mediating anti-tumor effects. Purpose: This systematic literature review aims to consolidate current findings on the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in GBM treatment. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across major medical databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) up to September 2024 to identify studies investigating the use of MSC-derived EVs in GBM therapy. Keywords included &amp;amp;ldquo;extracellular vesicles&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;mesenchymal stem cells&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;targeted therapies&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;outcomes&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;adverse events&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;glioblastoma&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;exosomes&amp;amp;rdquo;. Inclusion criteria were studies published in English involving GBM models both in vivo and in vitro and those reporting on therapeutic outcomes of MSC-EVs. Data were extracted and analyzed based on EV characteristics, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic efficacy. Results: The review identified several key studies demonstrating the anti-tumor effects of MSC-EVs in GBM models. A total of three studies were included, focusing on studies conducted between 2021 and 2023. The review included three studies that collectively enrolled a total of 18 patients. These studies were distributed across two years, with two trials published in 2023 (66.7%) and one in 2021 (33.3%). The mean age of the participants ranged from 37 to 57 years. In terms of gender distribution, males were the predominant group in all studies. Prior to receiving MSC-EV therapy, all patients had undergone standard treatments for GBM, including surgery, chemotherapy (CT), and, in some cases, radiation therapy (RT). In all three studies, the targeted treatment involved the administration of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene therapy delivered to the tumor site, then 14 days of ganciclovir treatment. Outcomes across the studies indicated varying levels of efficacy for the MSC-EV-based therapy. The larger 2023 study reported fewer encouraging outcomes, with a median PFS of 11.0 months (95% CI: 8.3&amp;amp;ndash;13.7) and a median OS of 16.0 months (95% CI: 14.3&amp;amp;ndash;17.7). Adverse effects were reported in only one of the studies, the 2021 trial, where patients experienced mild-to-moderate side effects, including fever, headache, and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis. A total of 11 studies on preclinical trials, using in vitro and in vivo models, were included, covering publications from 2010 to 2024. The studies utilized MSCs as delivery systems for various therapeutic agents (interleukin 12, interleukin 7, doxorubicin, paclitaxel), reflecting the versatility of these cells in targeted cancer therapies. Conclusions: MSC-derived EVs represent a promising therapeutic approach for GBM, offering multiple mechanisms to inhibit tumor growth and enhance treatment efficacy. Their ability to deliver bioactive molecules and modulate the tumor microenvironment underscores their potential as a novel, cell-free therapeutic strategy. Future studies should optimize EV production and delivery methods and fully understand their long-term effects in clinical settings to harness their therapeutic potential in GBM treatment.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The primary life-threatening complication in spinal&amp;amp;ndash;bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is ventilatory failure. The present study analyzes the longitudinal patterns of respiratory function tests over a follow-up of 11 years. Methods: We collected data from 9 genetically confirmed SBMA patients. Spirometric measurements [maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC)], serum biochemical indices and SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS) were collected every 6 months for 11 years. An average time curve was utilized to assess the changes in both pulmonary tests and serum biochemical indices of the patients. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA was applied to assess statistical differences. The Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the correlations between the respiratory function tests and serum biochemical and clinical indices. Results: A progressive decrease was observed in the respiratory function tests; the slope of the linear regression was significantly non-zero (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for all three time curves. A major decrease was observed for MEP (52%) and MIP (42%), while this was minor for FVC (25%). SBMAFRS score correlated with FVC (r = 0.27), MIP (r = 0.53) and MEP (r = 0.51). MIP and MEP correlated with creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.3, r = 0.25, respectively) and MIP with creatinine levels (r = 0.31). Conclusions: This longitudinal study shows a progressive decline of spirometric data throughout life in SBMA patients. The decline appears to be related to clinical deterioration and muscle denervation. Spirometric measures relative to maximal strength of the respiratory muscles (MIP and MEP) may have a better predictive value for pulmonary and muscular decline than FVC.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the embodiment of action-related language is well-established in the mother tongue (L1), less is known about the embodiment of a second language (L2) acquired later in life through formal instruction. We used the high temporal resolution of ERPs and topographic ERP analyses to compare embodiment in L1 and L2 and to investigate whether L1 and L2 are embodied with different strengths at different stages of linguistic processing. Methods: Subjects were presented with action-related and non-action-related verbs in a silent reading task. Subjects were late French&amp;amp;ndash;German and German&amp;amp;ndash;French bilinguals, respectively, and we could therefore collapse across languages to avoid common confounding between language (French and German) and order of acquisition (L1, L2). Results: We could show distinct effects of embodiment and language. Embodiment affected only the sensory and lexical stages of processing with increased strength and power of the N1 component for motor vs. non-motor verbs, and language affected the lexical and semantic stages of processing with stronger P2/N400 components for L2 than for L1. Non-motor verbs elicited a stronger P1 component in L2. Conclusions: Our results suggest that processing words in L2 requires more effortful processing. Importantly, L1 and L2 are not embodied differently, and embodiment affects early and similar stages of processing in L1 and L2, possibly integrating other process of action&amp;amp;ndash;language interaction</p>

	<p>Background: Revised El Escorial (rEEC) and Awaji criteria are currently used for diagnosing and categorizing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, they are complex; their sensitivity is still not optimal for research purposes, and they present high inter-rater variability in clinical practice. To address these points, in 2019, a new set of diagnostic criteria was proposed, namely the Gold Coast criteria (GCC), characterized by a dichotomous diagnostic categorization, i.e., ALS or not ALS. Methods:&amp;amp;nbsp;In order to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of GCC in a practical clinical setting, we retrospectively evaluated 131 patients diagnosed with ALS and 104 control subjects. ALSFRS-R score, electrophysiological tests, neuroradiological investigations, and CSF analysis were obtained. rEEC, Awaji, and GCC were applied at the first and last evaluations. Results: The sensitivity of GCC (93.1%; 96.1%) was greater than rEEC (71.8%; 87%) and Awaji criteria (77.8%; 89.3%) both at the first visit and last follow-up. The GCC&amp;amp;rsquo;s specificity (28.8%) is lower than that of the other two criteria (rEEC 45.2%; Awaji 43.3%). Conclusions: Our study suggests that in a real-world setting, the GCC are more sensitive and have substantially lower risk of false negative diagnoses than rEEC and Awaji criteria. Although rEEC had the highest specificity, they may delay the diagnosis. Systematically using the GCC could help to achieve an earlier diagnosis and quickly refer patients to the correct management. The low specificity of GCC is likely to not significantly impact patient recruitment in clinical trials; therefore, its use might allow a faster and earlier enrollment.</p>

                Background Underwater gliders are widely used in marine applications for monitoring purposes. These gliders must withstand hydrodynamic forces and maintain its body stability. The underwater environments are highly unpredictable, and small changes in the environment can lead to significant instability in underwater vehicles. Methods This study uses different numerical techniques to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a torpedo-shaped glider. A symmetric torpedo-shaped glider model was created and analyzed using a licensed version of ANSYS 20.1 Fluent tool. The behavior of the torpedo glider under various flow conditions was examined such as variation of grid test, change of turbulent models, the variation in the inflow boundary conditions involves varying the velocity from 10.16 m/s to 15.16 m/s in 1m/s increment and from 10.16 m/s to 7.66 m/s in 0.5 m/s, also six different models were analyzed. Results Research was also attempted with different turbulent models and the Spalart-Allmara model was producing least validation error of 1.28 % with a primary focus on nose optimization. By varying the nose length, the study aimed to identify the best-suited nose geometry to minimize drag force. The nose lengths were varied to 0.205 m and 0.19m, resulting in validation errors of 2.81% and 1.16%, respectively, the results are clearly explained in the sub sequent sections of this article. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has evaluated various modifications and their impact on drag force reduction. The application of Spallart-Allmara model resulted in an improvement of 1.28%. Decrease in velocity lead to a significant reduction in the drag force, with an improvement of 37.3%. The nose optimization also contributed to drag force; a nose length of 0.205m yielded a 3.37% improvement. While a 0.19m nose length resulted in a 1.67% reduction. This study helps researchers in hydrodynamics by optimizing geometry for drag reduction.

                Background Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) is a cause for heart disease and lung cancer among non- smokers. This cluster randomized control trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a tobacco smoke free home intervention in reducing exposure to second hand smoke. Protocol The intervention will be conducted among 30 clusters in urban and peri-urban areas of Kochi, India. The sample size is 300 per arm and 15 clusters to detect a minimal difference of 0.03ng/ml in cotinine levels between groups, at 80% power with a two-sided alfa of 0.05 considering variable cluster size. A baseline survey will be undertaken to identify smokers. Data related to smoking, indoor smoking, nicotine dependence, blood pressure (BP) of smokers, morbidity experienced, and lung volume Fev1/Fev6 of smokers will be measured. Urine cotinine, morbidity, BP of spouse and child will be assessed. Air quality monitors measuring PM2.5 will be placed in homes. Trained self-help group women and frontline health workers will implement the intervention. The intervention will consist of monthly home visits to educate the smoker on the harms of second-hand smoke using 3 A’s. The circle of influencers around the smoking men will also be contacted by the members of self-help group to provide support to stop smoking within homes and to quit. They will then organize two-three meetings of community leaders and heads of women’s groups, present data on harms of SHS, and explain the rationale for establishing smoke free homes in their community for a duration of six months. After the intervention a post assessment will be conducted and this will be repeated after six months. Ethics and dissemination The trial protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. Results will be submitted to open access peer reviewed journals and shared with other stakeholders. Trial registration CTRI/2021/06/034478

Methods The Web of Science database was selected for the search conducted in February 2024, and selection and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. Collaborative networks were generated using VOSviewer software, while altimetric data were analysed using Dimensions. The relationship between the bibliometric and altimetric data was examined using Spearman correlation. Results The search yielded 355 articles, of which 175 were included, published between 2008 and 2024. The most cited article reached 324 citations. Proof of concept was the most common study design (n=135), and the majority of studies used AI to detect and diagnose dental caries (n=122), with radiography being the most commonly used diagnostic method (n=99). The author with the highest number of articles was Schwendicke F (n=15), and the leading institution was Charite University, Berlin (n=13). China was the leading country in terms of research output (n=28) and Asia was the leading continent (n=54). The use of AI in cariology has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary interventions and optimise patient outcomes. Research interest in AI for cariology has increased significantly over the past five years, particularly in Asia. Conclusion These findings suggest significant clinical benefits and highlight the need for further research, particularly clinical trials, to validate these applications in practice.

                Background Triple-negative breast cancers are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, is highly aggressive, and has a relatively poor prognosis and poor clinical outcome. Objective To identify a novel drug target protein against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and potential phytochemical lead molecules against novel drug targets. Methods In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database and employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area solvation, a potential lead molecule was identified. Result The androgen receptor (AR) was found to be the target protein, and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule to combat TNBC. Upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were given to STRING tool to investigate the network topology, and androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub gene in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Based on Lipinski’s rule and ADMET properties, molecular interaction studies were analyzed using induced fit docking, wherein significant binding interactions were displayed by 2-hydroxynaringenin. Molecular dynamics studies and MM-GBSA of AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex revealed strong and stable interactions. Conclusion AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC needs to be investigated further in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1269/v1?src=rss">Prevalence and risk factors of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Thammasat University Hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 3 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 93.22%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least three days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

                <p>by Ashima Keshava, Farbod Nosrat Nezami, Henri Neumann, Krzysztof Izdebski, Thomas Schüler, Peter König</p>

Natural eye movements have primarily been studied for over-learned activities such as tea-making, sandwich-making, and hand-washing, which have a fixed sequence of associated actions. These studies demonstrate a sequential activation of low-level cognitive schemas facilitating task completion. However, whether these action schemas are activated in the same pattern when a task is novel and a sequence of actions must be planned in the moment is unclear. Here, we recorded gaze and body movements in a naturalistic task to study action-oriented gaze behavior. In a virtual environment, subjects moved objects on a life-size shelf to achieve a given order. To compel cognitive planning, we added complexity to the sorting tasks. Fixations aligned with the action onset showed gaze as tightly coupled with the action sequence, and task complexity moderately affected the proportion of fixations on the task-relevant regions. Our analysis revealed that gaze fixations were allocated to action-relevant targets just in time. Planning behavior predominantly corresponded to a greater visual search for task-relevant objects before the action onset. The results support the idea that natural behavior relies on the frugal use of working memory, and humans refrain from encoding objects in the environment to plan long-term actions. Instead, they prefer just-in-time planning by searching for action-relevant items at the moment, directing their body and hand to it, monitoring the action until it is terminated, and moving on to the following action.

                <p>by Pablo Capilla-Lasheras, Nina Bircher, Antony M. Brown, Xavier Harrison, Thomas Reed, Jennifer E. York, Dominic L. Cram, Christian Rutz, Lindsay Walker, Marc Naguib, Andrew J. Young</p>

Explaining the evolution of sex differences in cooperation remains a major challenge. Comparative studies highlight that offspring of the more philopatric sex tend to be more cooperative within their family groups than those of the more dispersive sex but we do not understand why. The leading “Philopatry hypothesis” proposes that the more philopatric sex cooperates more because their higher likelihood of natal breeding increases the direct fitness benefits of natal cooperation. However, the “Dispersal trade-off hypothesis” proposes that the more dispersive sex cooperates less because preparations for dispersal, such as extra-territorial prospecting, trade-off against natal cooperation. Here, we test both hypotheses in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers (<i>Plocepasser mahali</i>), using a novel high-resolution automated radio-tracking method. First, we show that males are the more dispersive sex (a rare reversal of the typical avian sex difference in dispersal) and that, consistent with the predictions of both hypotheses, females contribute substantially more than males to cooperative care while within the natal group. However, the Philopatry hypothesis cannot readily explain this female-biased cooperation, as females are not more likely than males to breed within their natal group. Instead, our radio-tracking findings support the Dispersal trade-off hypothesis: males conduct pre-dispersal extra-territorial prospecting forays at higher rates than females and prospecting appears to trade-off against natal cooperation. Our findings thus highlight that the evolution of sex differences in cooperation could be widely attributable to trade-offs between cooperation and dispersal; a potentially general explanation that does not demand that cooperation yields direct fitness benefits.

Reynolds, Nicolas Torquet, Stefania Tolu, Sarah Mondoloni, Claire Nguyen, Amy Siriphanh, Robin Justo, Steve Didienne, Nicolas Debray, Cécile Viollet, Louis Raynaud, Yasmine Layadi, Coralie Fouquet, Bernadette Hannesse, Ana-Marta Capaz, Thomas Topilko, Nicolas Renier, Alexandre Mourot, Fabio Marti, Philippe Faure</p>

Individual animals differ in their traits and preferences, which shape their social interactions, survival, and susceptibility to disease, including addiction. Nicotine use is highly heterogenous and has been linked to the expression of personality traits. Although these relationships are well documented, we have limited understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that give rise to distinct behavioral profiles and their connection to nicotine susceptibility. To address this question, we conducted a study using a semi-natural and social environment called “Souris-City” to observe the long-term behavior of individual male mice. Souris-City provided both a communal living area and a separate test area where mice engaged in a reward-seeking task isolated from their peers. Mice developed individualistic reward-seeking strategies when choosing between water and sucrose in the test compartment, which, in turn, predicted how they adapted to the introduction of nicotine as a reinforcer. Moreover, the profiles mice developed while isolated in the test area correlated with their behavior within the social environment, linking decision-making strategies to the expression of behavioral traits. Neurophysiological markers of adaptability within the dopamine system were apparent upon nicotine challenge and were associated with specific profiles. Our findings suggest that environmental adaptations influence behavioral traits and sensitivity to nicotine by acting on dopaminergic reactivity in the face of nicotine exposure, potentially contributing to addiction susceptibility. These results further emphasize the importance of understanding interindividual variability in behavior to gain insight into the mechanisms of decision-making and addiction.

                Background Large research consortia can generate tremendous amounts of biological information, including high-resolution soil, vegetation, and climate data. While this knowledge stock holds invaluable potential for answering evolutionary and ecological questions, making these data exploitable for modelling remains a daunting task due to the many processing steps required for synthesis. This might result in many researchers to fall back to a handful of ready-to-use data sets, potentially at the expense of statistical power and scientific rigour. In a push for a more stringent approach, we introduce BEpipeR, an R pipeline that allows for the streamlined synthesis of plot-based Biodiversity Exploratories data. Methods BEpipeR was designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind. For instance, users simply choose between aggregating forest or grassland data, or a combination thereof, effectively allowing them to process any experimental plot data of this research consortium. Additionally, instead of coding, they parse most processing information in a user-friendly way through parameter sheets. Processing includes, among others, the creation of a spatially explicit plot-ID template, data wrangling, quality control, plot-wise aggregations, the calculation of derived metrics, data joining to a large composite data set, and metadata compilation. Results With BEpipeR, we provide a feature-rich pipeline that allows users to process Biodiversity Exploratories data in a flexible and reproducible way. This pipeline might serve as a starting point for aggregating the numerous data sets of this and potentially similar research consortia. In this way, it might be a primer for the construction of consortia-wide composite data sets that take full advantage of the consortia’s rich information stocks, ultimately boosting the visibility and participation of individual research projects. Conclusions The BEpipeR permits the user-friendly processing and plot-wise aggregation of Biodiversity Exploratories data. With modifications, this framework may be easily adopted by other research consortia.
