	<p>Altered interoception, or the processing of bodily signals, has been argued to play a role in the development and maintenance of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, interoceptive interventions focusing on bodily awareness, such as mindfulness meditation, may improve treatment outcomes for individuals with SUD. Here we review: (1) subjective, behavioral and brain evidence for altered interoceptive processing in SUD, focusing on insular and anterior cingulate cortices (INS, ACC), key regions for interoceptive processing; (2) research highlighting links between mindfulness and brain function; and (3) extant brain research investigating mindfulness-based interventions in SUD. SUD tend to be characterized by heightened INS and ACC responses to drug cues but blunted interoceptive awareness and attenuated INS and ACC responses during tasks involving bodily attention and/or perturbations. In contrast, mindfulness interventions in healthy individuals are linked to enhanced INS and ACC responses and heightened interoceptive awareness. It is crucial for future research to identify: (1) whether mindfulness-based treatments are efficacious across substance classes; (2) what particular approaches and dosages show the largest effect sizes in enhancing INS and ACC function to non-drug stimuli and reducing responsivity to substance cues, thereby improving SUD treatment outcomes (reducing drug craving and relapse).</p>

	<p>It has been shown that learned temporal information can be exploited to help facilitate the target identification in the attentional blink task. Here, we tested whether similar exploitation also worked on short-term temporal information, even when it did not reliably predict the target onset. In two experiments, we randomly manipulated either the interval between targets (T1 and T2; Experiment 1) or the temporal regularity of stimulus presentation (Experiment 2) in each trial. The results revealed evidence of effects of immediate temporal experience mainly on T2 performances but also occasionally on T1 performances. In general, the accuracy of T2 was enhanced when a longer inter-target interval was explicitly processed in the preceding trial (Experiment 1) or the temporal regularity, regardless of being explicitly or implicitly processed, was present in the stimulus stream, especially after T1 (Experiment 2). These results suggest that, under high temporal uncertainty, both interval and rhythmic cues can still be exploited to regulate the allocation of processing resources, thus, modulating the target identification in the attentional blink task, consistent with the view of flexible attentional allocation, and further highlighting the importance of the interplay between temporal processing and attentional control in the conscious visual perception.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive impairments manifest through interactions between microscopic and macroscopic changes. On the microscale, a neurometabolic cascade alters neurotransmission, while on the macroscale diffuse axonal injury impacts the integrity of long-range connections. Large-scale brain network modeling allows us to make predictions across these spatial scales by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to investigate how microscale changes invisible to conventional neuroimaging influence large-scale brain dynamics. To this end, we analyzed structural and functional neuroimaging data from a well characterized sample of 44 adult TBI patients recruited from a regional trauma center, scanned at 1&ndash;2 weeks postinjury, and with follow-up behavioral outcome assessed 6 months later. Thirty-six age-matched healthy adults served as comparison participants. Using The Virtual Brain, we fit simulations of whole-brain resting-state functional MRI to the empirical static and dynamic functional connectivity of each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that patients with acute traumatic intracranial lesions had lower cortical regional inhibitory connection strengths than comparison participants, while patients without acute lesions did not differ from the comparison group. Further multivariate PLS analyses found correlations between lower semiacute regional inhibitory connection strengths and more symptoms and lower cognitive performance at a 6 month follow-up. Critically, patients without acute lesions drove this relationship, suggesting clinical relevance of regional inhibitory connection strengths even when traumatic intracranial lesions were not present. Our results suggest that large-scale connectome-based models may be sensitive to pathophysiological changes in semi-acute phase TBI patients and predictive of their chronic outcomes.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb<sup>+</sup>) and somatostatin-positive (Sst<sup>+</sup>) cells are the two largest subgroups of inhibitory interneurons. Studies in visual cortex indicate that synaptic connections between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells are common while connections between Sst<sup>+</sup> interneurons have not been observed. The inhibitory connectivity and kinetics of these two interneuron subpopulations, however, have not been characterized in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). Using fluorescence-guided paired recordings in mouse brain slices from interneurons and excitatory cells in layer 2/3 mEC, we found that, unlike neocortical measures, Sst<sup>+</sup> cells inhibit each other, albeit with a lower probability than Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells (18% vs 36% for unidirectional connections). Gap junction connections were also more frequent between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells than between Sst<sup>+</sup> cells. Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells inhibited each other with larger conductances, smaller decay time constants, and shorter delays. Similarly, synaptic connections between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> and excitatory cells were more likely and expressed faster decay times and shorter delays than those between Sst<sup>+</sup> and excitatory cells. Inhibitory cells exhibited smaller synaptic decay time constants between interneurons than on their excitatory targets. Inhibition between interneurons also depressed faster, and to a greater extent. Finally, inhibition onto layer 2 pyramidal and stellate cells originating from Pvalb<sup>+</sup> interneurons were very similar, with no significant differences in connection likelihood, inhibitory amplitude, and decay time. A model of short-term depression fitted to the data indicates that recovery time constants for refilling the available pool are in the range of 50&ndash;150 ms and that the fraction of the available pool released on each spike is in the range 0.2&ndash;0.5.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cross Talk between {alpha}7 and {alpha}3{beta}4 Nicotinic Receptors Prevents Their Desensitization in Human Chromaffin Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>The physical interaction and functional cross talk among the different subtypes of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the various tissues is unknown. Here, we have investigated this issue between the only two nAChRs subtypes expressed, the &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 subtypes, in a human native neuroendocrine cell (the chromaffin cell) using electrophysiological patch-clamp, fluorescence, and Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. Our data show that &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 receptor subtypes require their mutual and maximal efficacy of activation to increase their expression, to avoid their desensitization, and therefore, to increase their activity. In this way, after repetitive stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh), &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 receptor subtypes do not desensitize, but they do with choline. The nicotinic current increase associated with the &alpha;3&beta;4 subtype is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, both receptor subtypes physically interact. Interaction and expression of both subtypes are reversibly reduced by tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatases inhibition, not by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, expression is greater in human chromaffin cells from men compared to women, but FRET efficiency is not affected. Together, our findings indicate that human &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 subtypes mutually modulate their expression and activity, providing a promising line of research to pharmacologically regulate their activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Desensitization of nicotinic receptors is accepted to occur with repetitive agonist stimulation. However, here we show that human native &alpha;3&beta;4 and &alpha;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes do not desensitize, and instead, increase their activity when they are activated by the physiological agonist acetylcholine (ACh). An indispensable requirement is the activation of the other receptor subtype with maximal efficacy, and the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cooperate in the case of the &alpha;3&beta;4 current increase. Because choline is an &alpha;3&beta;4 partial agonist, it will act as a limiting factor of nicotinic currents enhancement in the absence of ACh, but in its presence, it will further potentiate &alpha;7 currents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Input and ACh Modulation Regulate Dendritic Ca2+ Spike Duration in Pyramidal Neurons, Directly Affecting Their Somatic Output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nonlinear synaptic integration in dendrites is a fundamental aspect of neural computation. One such key mechanism is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike at the apical tuft of pyramidal neurons. Characterized by a plateau potential sustained for tens of milliseconds, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplifies excitatory input, facilitates somatic action potentials (APs), and promotes synaptic plasticity. Despite its essential role, the mechanisms regulating it are largely unknown. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the plateau and termination phases of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike under input current perturbations, long-step current-injections, and variations in the dendritic high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance (that occur during cholinergic modulation). We found that, surprisingly, timed excitatory input can shorten the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike duration while inhibitory input can either elongate or terminate it. A significant elongation also occurs when the high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<SUB>HVA</SUB>) conductance is increased. To mechanistically understand these phenomena, we analyzed the currents involved in the spike. The plateau and termination phases are almost exclusively controlled by the Ca<SUB>HVA</SUB> inward current and the I<SUB>m</SUB> outward K<sup>+</sup> current. We reduced the full model to a single-compartment model that faithfully preserved the responses of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike to interventions and consisted of two dynamic variables: the membrane potential and the K<sup>+</sup>-channel activation level. A phase-plane analysis of the reduced model provides testable predictions for modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike and reveals various dynamical regimes that explain the robust nature of the spike. Regulating the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike significantly impacts the cell synaptic-plasticity window and, as we show, its input-output relationship.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pyramidal neurons are the cortex's principal projection neurons. In their apical tuft, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes significantly impact information processing, synaptic plasticity, and the cell's input-output relationship. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanisms regulating them. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike responses to synaptic perturbations and cholinergic modulation. We showed a counterintuitive phenomenon: early excitatory input shortens the spike, whereas weak inhibition elongates it. Also, we demonstrated that acetylcholine (ACh) extends the spike. Through a reduced model containing only the membrane potential and the K<sup>+</sup>-channel activation level, we explained these phenomena using a phase-plane analysis. Our work provides new information about the robustness of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike and its controlling mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contribution of G-Protein {alpha}-Subunits to Analgesia, Hyperalgesia, and Hyperalgesic Priming Induced by Subanalgesic and Analgesic Doses of Fentanyl and Morphine</a></h4>

              
                <p>While opioids produce both analgesia and side effects by action at &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs), at spinal and supraspinal sites, the potency of different opioids to produce these effects varies. While it has been suggested that these differences might be because of bias for signaling via &beta;-arrestin versus G-protein &alpha;-subunits (G&alpha;), recent studies suggest that G-protein-biased MOR agonists still produce clinically important side effects. Since bias also exists in the role of G&alpha; subunits, we evaluated the role of G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits in analgesia, hyperalgesia, and hyperalgesic priming produced by fentanyl and morphine, in male rats. We found that intrathecal treatment with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense (AS-ODN) for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2, G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3, and G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> markedly attenuated hyperalgesia induced by subanalgesic dose (sub-AD) fentanyl, while AS-ODN for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1, as well as G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2 and G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3, but not G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB>, prevented hyperalgesia induced by sub-AD morphine. AS-ODN for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1 and G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2 unexpectedly enhanced analgesia induced by analgesic dose (AD) fentanyl, while G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1 AS-ODN markedly reduced AD morphine analgesia. Hyperalgesic priming, assessed by prolongation of prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB>-induced hyperalgesia, was not produced by systemic sub-AD and AD fentanyl in G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3 and G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> AS-ODN-treated rats, respectively. In contrast, none of the G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> AS-ODNs tested affected priming induced by systemic sub-AD and AD morphine. We conclude that signaling by different G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits is necessary for the analgesia and side effects of two of the most clinically used opioid analgesics. The design of opioid analgesics that demonstrate selectivity for individual G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> may produce a more limited range of side effects and enhanced analgesia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Biased &mu;-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists that preferentially signal through G-protein &alpha;-subunits over &beta;-arrestins have been developed as an approach to mitigate opioid side effects. However, we recently demonstrated that biased MOR agonists also produce hyperalgesia and priming. We show that oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to different G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits play a role in hyperalgesia and analgesia induced by subanalgesic and analgesic dose (respectively), of fentanyl and morphine, as well as in priming. Our findings have the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in adverse effects of opioid analgesics that could assist in the development of novel analgesics, preferentially targeting specific G-protein &alpha;-subunits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Specific Plasticity Loci and Their Synergism Mediate Operant Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite numerous studies examining the mechanisms of operant conditioning (OC), the diversity of OC plasticity loci and their synergism have not been examined sufficiently. In the well-characterized feeding neural circuit of <I>Aplysia</I>, <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> appetitive OC increases neuronal excitability and electrical coupling among several neurons leading to an increase in expression of ingestive behavior. Here, we used the <I>in vitro</I> analog of OC to investigate whether OC reduces the excitability of a neuron, B4, whose inhibitory connections decrease expression of ingestive behavior. We found OC decreased the excitability of B4. This change appeared intrinsic to B4 because it could be replicated with an analog of OC in isolated cultures of B4 neurons. In addition to changes in B4 excitability, OC decreased the strength of B4's inhibitory connection to a key decision-making neuron, B51. The OC-induced changes were specific without affecting the excitability of another neuron critical for feeding behavior, B8, or the B4-to-B8 inhibitory connection. A conductance-based circuit model indicated that reducing the B4-to-B51 synapse, or increasing B51 excitability, mediated the OC phenotype more effectively than did decreasing B4 excitability. We combined these modifications to examine whether they could act synergistically. Combinations including B51 synergistically enhanced feeding. Taken together, these results suggest modifications of diverse loci work synergistically to mediate OC and that some neurons are well suited to work synergistically with plasticity in other loci.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ways in which synergism of diverse plasticity loci mediate the change in motor patterns in operant conditioning (OC) are poorly understood. Here, we found that OC was in part mediated by decreasing the intrinsic excitability of a critical neuron of <I>Aplysia</I> feeding behavior, and specifically reducing the strength of one of its inhibitory connections that targets a key decision-making neuron. A conductance-based computational model indicated that the known plasticity loci showed a surprising level of synergism to mediate the behavioral changes associated with OC. These results highlight the importance of understanding the diversity, specificity and synergy among different types of plasticity that encode memory. Also, because OC in <I>Aplysia</I> is mediated by dopamine (DA), the present study provides insights into specific and synergistic mechanisms of DA-mediated reinforcement of behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Uniform and Nonuniform Nature of Slow and Rapid Scaling in Embryonic Motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons regulate the strength of their synapses in response to a perturbation to stabilize neuronal signaling through a form of homeostatic plasticity known as synaptic scaling. The process of scaling has the potential to alter all of a cell's miniature postsynaptic current (mPSC) amplitudes by a single multiplicative factor (uniform scaling), and in doing so could change action potential-dependent or evoked synaptic strength by that factor. However, recent studies suggest that individual synapses scale with different scaling factors (nonuniform). This could complicate the simple multiplicative transform from mPSC scaling to the evoked response. We have previously identified a slow AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic scaling in chick embryo motoneurons following 2 d <I>in vivo</I> perturbations inhibiting neuronal activity or GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R function, and now show a rapid form of scaling following NMDAR blockade <I>in vitro</I>. Slow GABAergic scaling appeared to be of a classical uniform pattern. Alternatively, other forms of rapid and slow scaling demonstrated a uniform and nonuniform component in their mPSC amplitude distributions. Slow and rapid AMPAergic scaling was mediated by insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. The nonuniform pattern of scaling may contribute to the observed complexity of the changes in evoked responses. Scaling-induced changes in mPSC amplitudes were not associated with changes in probability of release (<I>Pr</I>). Together, our results demonstrate a new rapid form of scaling in embryonic motoneurons, that slow and rapid scaling is not purely uniform, and that upscaling does not translate to an increase in evoked responses in a simple manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Different forms of homeostatic plasticity are thought to play a critical role in maintaining neural function. For example, altering the amplitudes of spontaneous currents through a form of homeostatic plasticity known as synaptic scaling could affect evoked transmission; however, this is rarely tested. Here we demonstrate two forms of scaling and show that in many cases synaptic strength scales differently for distinct synapses within an embryonic motoneuron. These results have functional consequences for evoked synaptic strength and suggest that, like Hebbian plasticity, scaling can change relative synaptic strengths within a cell. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how different forms of homeostatic plasticity influence neuronal communication as the nascent spinal network is first established in the embryonic period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Mechanism for Coding Depth from Motion Parallax in Area MT: Gain Modulation or Tuning Shifts?</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are two distinct sources of retinal image motion: objects moving in the world and observer movement. When the eyes move to track a target of interest, the retinal velocity of some object in the scene will depend on both eye velocity and that object's motion in the world. Thus, to compute the object's velocity relative to the head, a coordinate transformation must be performed by vectorially adding eye velocity and retinal velocity. In contrast, a very different interaction between retinal and eye velocity signals has been proposed to underlie estimation of depth from motion parallax, which involves computing the ratio of retinal and eye velocities. We examined how neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area of male macaques combine eye velocity and retinal velocity, to test whether this interaction is more consistent with a partial coordinate transformation (for computing head-centered object motion) or a multiplicative gain interaction (for computing depth from motion parallax). We find that some MT neurons show clear signatures of a partial coordinate transformation for computing head-centered velocity. Even a small shift toward head-centered velocity tuning can account for the observed depth-sign selectivity of MT neurons, including a strong dependence on speed preference that was previously unexplained. A formal model comparison reveals that the data from many MT neurons are equally well explained by a multiplicative gain interaction or a partial transformation toward head-centered tuning, although some responses can only be well fit by the coordinate transform model. Our findings shed new light on the neural computations performed in area MT, and raise the possibility that depth-sign selectivity emerges from a partial coordinate transformation toward representing head-centered velocity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Eye velocity signals modulate the responses of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area to retinal image motion. Two different types of interactions between retinal and eye velocities have previously been considered: a vector addition computation for computing head-centered velocity, and a multiplicative gain interaction for computing depth from motion parallax. Whereas previous work favored a multiplicative gain interaction in MT, we demonstrate that some MT neurons show clear evidence of a partial shift toward coding head-centered velocity. Moreover, we demonstrate that even a small shift toward head coordinates is sufficient to account for the depth-sign selectivity observed previously in area MT, thus raising the possibility that a partial coordinate transformation may also provide a mechanism for computing depth from motion parallax.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting and Manipulating Cone Responses to Naturalistic Inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primates explore their visual environment by making frequent saccades, discrete and ballistic eye movements that direct the fovea to specific regions of interest. Saccades produce large and rapid changes in input. The magnitude of these changes and the limited signaling range of visual neurons mean that effective encoding requires rapid adaptation. Here, we explore how macaque cone photoreceptors maintain sensitivity under these conditions. Adaptation makes cone responses to naturalistic stimuli highly nonlinear and dependent on stimulus history. Such responses cannot be explained by linear or linear-nonlinear models but are well explained by a biophysical model of phototransduction based on well-established biochemical interactions. The resulting model can predict cone responses to a broad range of stimuli and enables the design of stimuli that elicit specific (e.g., linear) cone photocurrents. These advances will provide a foundation for investigating the contributions of cone phototransduction and post-transduction processing to visual function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We know a great deal about adaptational mechanisms that adjust sensitivity to slow changes in visual inputs such as the rising or setting sun. We know much less about the rapid adaptational mechanisms that are essential for maintaining sensitivity as gaze shifts around a single visual scene. We characterize how phototransduction in cone photoreceptors adapts to rapid changes in input similar to those encountered during natural vision. We incorporate these measurements into a quantitative model that can predict cone responses across a broad range of stimuli. This model not only shows how cone phototransduction aids the encoding of natural inputs but also provides a tool to identify the role of the cone responses in shaping those of downstream visual neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Specific Neural Representations of Generalizable Metacognitive Control Signals in the Human Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a critical role in cognitive control over different domains of tasks. The dACC activities uniformly represent task-generic intensities of control signals across different tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the dACC activities could also encode task identities of control signals across different tasks. If so, how the two types of control information are coherently organized in the dACC? Decision uncertainty is an internally-generated control signal by retrospective monitoring, namely, metacognition, even with no external feedback. We here investigated neural representations of decision uncertainty accompanying three decision-making tasks in the domains of perception, rule-based inference, and memory using trial-by-trial univariate and multivariate analyses on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired on human male and female healthy subjects. Our results demonstrated that the dACC represented decision uncertainty commonly across the three decision-making tasks. Further, the multivariate fMRI analyses revealed a mosaic form of neural representations of decision uncertainty across tasks in the dACC. The identity and intensity information was separately represented in two dissociable components, the high-dimensional pattern and the scalar magnitude, of the dACC multivoxel fMRI activities. Lastly, a follow-up behavioral experiment confirmed that this mosaic form of neural representations of parallelly existing decision uncertainty across different tasks should lead to mutual interferences more on the intensity, but less on the identity of control signals. Thus, our findings suggest that the dACC with the mosaic form of neural representations could provide task-generic and task-specific metacognitive control signals to guide appropriate control on different decision-making tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Metacognition is a form of cognitive control using internally generated decision uncertainty to guide behavior adjustment with no needs of external feedback. Decision uncertainty as a generalizable control signal is commonly encoded in the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) accompanying different decision-making tasks. It remains unknown whether or not the task-specific control information is represented in the dACC. We here revealed that multivoxel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activities associated with decision uncertainty in the dACC concurrently represented the identity and intensity information. The mixtures of neural representations of decision uncertainty across different tasks should cause specific interferences on each other. Hence, the neural representations of control signals in the human dACC should be task-generic and task-specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Saturating Nonlinearities of Contrast Response in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response nonlinearities are ubiquitous throughout the brain, especially within sensory cortices where changes in stimulus intensity typically produce compressed responses. Although this relationship is well established in electrophysiological measurements, it remains controversial whether the same nonlinearities hold for population-based measurements obtained with human fMRI. We propose that these purported disparities are not contingent on measurement type and are instead largely dependent on the visual system state at the time of interrogation. We show that deploying a contrast adaptation paradigm permits reliable measurements of saturating sigmoidal contrast response functions (10 participants, 7 female). When not controlling the adaptation state, our results coincide with previous fMRI studies, yielding nonsaturating, largely linear contrast responses. These findings highlight the important role of adaptation in manifesting measurable nonlinear responses within human visual cortex, reconciling discrepancies reported in vision neuroscience, re-establishing the qualitative relationship between stimulus intensity and response across different neural measures and the concerted study of cortical gain control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nonlinear stimulus&ndash;response relationships govern many essential brain functions, ranging from the sensory to cognitive level. Certain core response properties previously shown to be nonlinear with nonhuman electrophysiology recordings have yet to be reliably measured with human neuroimaging, prompting uncertainty and reconsideration. The results of this study stand to reconcile these incongruencies in the vision neurosciences, demonstrating the profound impact adaptation can have on brain activation throughout the early visual cortex. Moving forward, these findings facilitate the study of modulatory influences on sensory processing (i.e., arousal and attention) and help establish a closer link between neural recordings in animals and hemodynamic measurements from human fMRI, resuming a concerted effort to understand operations in the mammalian cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Are Required for Contending Strategy Selection While Solving Spatial Navigation Problems</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do animals adopt a given behavioral strategy to solve a recurrent problem when several effective strategies are available to reach the goal? Here we provide evidence that striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) modulate their activity when mice must select between different strategies with similar goal-reaching effectiveness. Using a cell type-specific transgenic murine system, we show that adult SCIN ablation impairs strategy selection in navigational tasks where a goal can be independently achieved by adopting an allocentric or egocentric strategy. SCIN-depleted mice learn to achieve the goal in these tasks, regardless of their appetitive or aversive nature, in a similar way as controls. However, they cannot shift away from their initially adopted strategies, as control mice do, as training progresses. Our results indicate that SCINs are required for shaping the probability function used for strategy selection as experience accumulates throughout training. Thus, SCINs may be critical for the resolution of cognitive conflicts emerging when several strategies compete for behavioral control while adapting to environmental demands. Our findings may increase our understanding about the emergence of perseverative/compulsive traits in neuropsychiatric disorders with a reported SCIN reduction, such as Tourette and Williams syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Selecting the best suited strategy to solve a problem is vital. Accordingly, available strategies must be compared across multiple dimensions, such as goal attainment effectiveness, cost&ndash;benefit trade-off, and cognitive load. The striatum is involved in strategy selection when strategies clearly diverge in their goal attainment capacity; however, its role whenever several strategies can be used for goal reaching&mdash;therefore making selection dependent on additional strategy dimensions&mdash;remains poorly understood. Here, we show that striatal cholinergic interneurons can signal strategy competition. Furthermore, they are required to adopt a given strategy whenever strategies with similar goal attainment capacity compete for behavioral control. Our study suggests that striatal cholinergic dysfunction may result in anomalous resolution of problems whenever complex cognitive valuations are required.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Effects of Endogenous and Exogenous Attention on Sensory Tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Covert spatial attention (without concurrent eye movements) improves performance in many visual tasks (e.g., orientation discrimination and visual search). However, both covert attention systems&mdash;endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary)&mdash;exhibit differential effects on performance in tasks mediated by spatial and temporal resolution suggesting an underlying mechanistic difference. We investigated whether these differences manifest in sensory tuning by assessing whether and how endogenous and exogenous attention differentially alter the representation of two basic visual dimensions&mdash;orientation and spatial frequency (SF). The same human observers detected a grating embedded in noise in two separate experiments (with endogenous or exogenous attention cues). Reverse correlation was used to infer the underlying neural representation from behavioral responses, and we linked our results to established neural computations via a normalization model of attention. Both endogenous and exogenous attention similarly improved performance at the attended location by enhancing the gain of all orientations without changing tuning width. In the SF dimension, endogenous attention enhanced the gain of SFs above and below the target SF, whereas exogenous attention only enhanced those above. Additionally, exogenous attention shifted peak sensitivity to SFs above the target SF, whereas endogenous attention did not. Both covert attention systems modulated sensory tuning via the same computation (gain changes). However, there were differences in the strength of the gain. Compared with endogenous attention, exogenous attention had a stronger orientation gain enhancement but a weaker overall SF gain enhancement. These differences in sensory tuning may underlie differential effects of endogenous and exogenous attention on performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Covert spatial attention is a fundamental aspect of cognition and perception that allows us to selectively process and prioritize incoming visual information at a given location. There are two types: endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary). Both typically improve visual perception, but there are instances where endogenous improves perception but exogenous hinders perception. Whether and how such differences extend to sensory representations is unknown. Here we show that both endogenous and exogenous attention mediate perception via the same neural computation&mdash;gain changes&mdash;but the strength of the orientation gain and the range of enhanced spatial frequencies depends on the type of attention being deployed. These findings reveal that both attention systems differentially reshape the tuning of features coded in striate cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reduced Learning of Sound Categories in Dyslexia Is Associated with Reduced Regularity-Induced Auditory Cortex Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>A main characteristic of dyslexia is poor use of sound categories. We now studied within-session learning of new sound categories in dyslexia, behaviorally and neurally, using fMRI. Human participants (males and females) with and without dyslexia were asked to discriminate which of two serially-presented tones had a higher pitch. The task was administered in two protocols, with and without a repeated reference frequency. The reference condition introduces regularity, and enhances frequency sensitivity in typically developing (TD) individuals. Enhanced sensitivity facilitates the formation of "high" and "low" pitch categories above and below this reference, respectively. We found that in TDs, learning was paralleled by a gradual decrease in activation of the primary auditory cortex (PAC), and reduced activation of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are important for using sensory history. No such sensitivity was found among individuals with dyslexia (IDDs). Rather, IDDs showed reduced behavioral learning of stimulus regularities and no regularity-associated adaptation in the auditory cortex or in higher-level regions. We propose that IDDs' reduced cortical adaptation, associated with reduced behavioral learning of sound regularities, underlies their impoverished use of stimulus history, and consequently impedes their formation of rich sound categories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reading difficulties in dyslexia are often attributed to poor use of phonological categories. To test whether poor category use could result from poor learning of new sound categories in general, we administered an auditory discrimination task that examined the learning of new pitch categories above and below a repeated reference sound. Individuals with dyslexia (IDDs) learned categories slower than typically developing (TD) individuals. TD individuals showed adaptation to the repeated sounds that paralleled the category learning in their primary auditory cortex (PAC) and other higher-level regions. In dyslexia, no brain region showed such adaptation. We suggest that poor learning of sound statistics in sensory regions may underlie the poor representations of both speech and nonspeech categories in dyslexia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Direct Cochlear Recordings in Humans Show a Theta Rhythmic Modulation of Auditory Nerve Activity by Selective Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>The architecture of the efferent auditory system enables prioritization of strongly overlapping spatiotemporal cochlear activation patterns elicited by relevant and irrelevant inputs. So far, attempts at finding such attentional modulations of cochlear activity delivered indirect insights in humans or required direct recordings in animals. The extent to which spiral ganglion cells forming the human auditory nerve are sensitive to selective attention remains largely unknown. We investigated this question by testing the effects of attending to either the auditory or visual modality in human cochlear implant (CI) users (3 female, 13 male). Auditory nerve activity was directly recorded with standard CIs during a silent (anticipatory) cue-target interval. When attending the upcoming auditory input, ongoing auditory nerve activity within the theta range (5-8 Hz) was enhanced. Crucially, using the broadband signal (4-25 Hz), a classifier was even able to decode the attended modality from single-trial data. Follow-up analysis showed that the effect was not driven by a narrow frequency in particular. Using direct cochlear recordings from deaf individuals, our findings suggest that cochlear spiral ganglion cells are sensitive to top-down attentional modulations. Given the putatively broad hair-cell degeneration of these individuals, the effects are likely mediated by alternative efferent pathways compared with previous studies using otoacoustic emissions. Successful classification of single-trial data could additionally have a significant impact on future closed-loop CI developments that incorporate real-time optimization of CI parameters based on the current mental state of the user.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The efferent auditory system in principle allows top-down modulation of auditory nerve activity; however, evidence for this is lacking in humans. Using cochlear recordings in participants performing an audiovisual attention task, we show that ongoing auditory nerve activity in the silent cue-target period is directly modulated by selective attention. Specifically, ongoing auditory nerve activity is enhanced within the theta range when attending upcoming auditory input. Furthermore, over a broader frequency range, the attended modality can be decoded from single-trial data. Demonstrating this direct top-down influence on auditory nerve activity substantially extends previous works that focus on outer hair cell activity. Generally, our work could promote the use of standard cochlear implant electrodes to study cognitive neuroscientific questions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Factors Drive the Spatiotemporal Progression of Tau Pathology in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mechanisms underlying the initial accumulation of tau pathology across the human brain are largely unknown. We examined whether baseline factors including age, amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;), and neural activity predicted longitudinal tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions that reflect distinct stages of tau pathogenesis. Seventy cognitively normal human older adults (77 &plusmn; 6 years, 59% female) received two or more <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir (FTP) and <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET scans (mean follow-up, 2.5 &plusmn; 1.1 years) to quantify tau and (A&beta;). Linear mixed-effects models were used to calculate the slopes of FTP change in entorhinal cortex (EC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and inferior temporal gyrus (IT), and slopes of global PiB change. Thirty-seven participants underwent functional MRI to measure baseline activation. Older age predicted EC tau accumulation, and baseline EC tau levels predicted subsequent tau accumulation in EC and PHC. In IT, however, baseline EC tau interacted with A&beta; to predict IT tau accumulation. Higher baseline local activation predicted tau accumulation within EC and PHC, and higher baseline hippocampal activation predicted EC tau accumulation. Our findings indicate that factors predicting tau accumulation vary as tau progresses through the temporal lobe. Older age is associated with initial tau accumulation in EC, while baseline EC tau and neural activity drive tau accumulation within medial temporal lobe. A&beta; subsequently facilitates tau spread from medial to lateral temporal lobe. Our findings elucidate potential drivers of tau accumulation and spread in aging, which are critical for understanding Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To further understand the mechanisms leading to tau pathogenesis and spread, we tested whether baseline factors such as age, amyloid-&beta; pathology, and activation predicted longitudinal tau accumulation in cognitively normal older adults. We found that distinct mechanisms contribute to tau accumulation as tau progresses across the temporal lobe, with initial tau accumulation in entorhinal cortex driven by age and subsequent spread driven by neural activity and amyloid-&beta;. We demonstrate that higher baseline activation predicts increased longitudinal tau accumulation, providing novel evidence that activation-dependent tau production may occur in the human brain. Our findings support major hypotheses generated from preclinical research, and have important translational implications, suggesting that the reduction of hyperactivation may help prevent the development of tau pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurophysiological and Brain Structural Markers of Cognitive Frailty Differ from Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>With increasing life span and prevalence of dementia, it is important to understand the mechanisms of cognitive aging. Here, we focus on a subgroup of the population we term "cognitively frail," defined by reduced cognitive function in the absence of subjective memory complaints, or a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Cognitive frailty is distinct from cognitive impairment caused by physical frailty. It has been proposed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease, but may alternatively represent one end of a nonpathologic spectrum of cognitive aging. We test these hypotheses in humans of both sexes, by comparing the structural and neurophysiological properties of a community-based cohort of cognitive frail adults, to people presenting clinically with diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and community-based cognitively typical older adults. Cognitive performance of the cognitively frail was similar to those with mild cognitive impairment. We used a novel cross-modal paired-associates task that presented images followed by sounds, to induce physiological responses of novelty and associative mismatch, recorded by EEG/MEG. Both controls and cognitively frail showed stronger mismatch responses and larger temporal gray matter volume, compared with people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that community-based cognitively frail represents a spectrum of normal aging rather than incipient Alzheimer's disease, despite similar cognitive function. Lower lifelong cognitive reserve, hearing impairment, and cardiovascular comorbidities might contribute to the etiology of the cognitive frailty. Critically, community-based cohorts of older adults with low cognitive performance should not be interpreted as representing undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study investigates the neural signatures of cognitive frailty in relation to healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease. We focus on the cognitive aspect of frailty and show that, despite performing similarly to the patients with mild cognitive impairment, a cohort of community-based adults with poor cognitive performance do not show structural atrophy or neurophysiological signatures of Alzheimer's disease. Our results call for caution before assuming that cognitive frailty represents latent Alzheimer's disease. Instead, the cognitive underperformance of cognitively frail adults could result in cumulative effects of multiple psychosocial risk factors over the lifespan, and medical comorbidities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with solid and hematological cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous research has consistently shown the significant difference in outcome between cancerous and non-cancerous patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no studies have compared the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in hematologic cancers patients and solid cancers patients. Therefore, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 patients with hematological cancer and primary solid cancer worldwide through a meta-analysis and systematic review. Methods: This meta-analysis and systematic review included English language articles published between December 2019 – January 2021 from Pubmed and Google Scholar. The Newcastle Ottawa Score was used to assess the quality and bias of included studies. The outcome measures were case-fatality rate and critical care events for COVID-19 patients with cancer and comorbidities. Results: The initial search found 8910 articles, of 20 were included in the analysis. Critical care events and mortality were higher in the hematological than primary solid cancer group (relative risk (RR)=1.22 & 1.65; p <0.001). Conversely, mortality was lower in patients with two or fewer comorbidities (RR=0.57; p<0.001) and patients under the 75-year-old group (RR=0.53; p< 0.05). Conclusions: Hematologic malignancy, age, and the number of comorbidities are predictor factors for worse prognosis in COVID-19 infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Late complications of radiotherapy for breast cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The long term functional and aesthetic impact of breast neoplasia treatment partly reflects the consequences of high dose irradiation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. This work, based on a case observed in our department and a review of the literature, aims to discuss certain secondary manifestations following breast irradiation and their therapeutic options. Our work reports the case of a premenopausal 46-year-old patient, treated for a right breast neoplasia. In July 2019, the patient underwent a Patey with simple postoperative follow-up. Histology substantiated the presence of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma SBRI. Mastectomy was followed by locoregional irradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirteen months after the end of irradiation, the patient reconsulted for functional impotence and pain at the level of the right upper limb. The clinical examination showed cutaneous sclerosis and lymphedema. An X-ray showing the non-metastatic fracture of the clavicle. The patient underwent physiotherapy sessions with slight improvement on the functional level and clear improvement on the sensory level with progressive disappearance of pain. Therapeutic options for complications of breast irradiation include massage, bandages, and physical exercise, often used in combination. The precise localization of the tumor bed and the application of appropriate clinical target volumes and planning target volumes are essential, as these concepts are fundamental for partial breast irradiation and avoid the complications of radiotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatio-temporal characteristics of Tuberculosis in Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The number of Tuberculosis (TB) cases or deaths is declining, however, the rate of decline is not adequate to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO's) mitigation. TB remains a public health problem in Ghana with a significant economic and health burden on its citizens and health care system.  Consequently, there is a need for further studies about the disease aimed at accelerating the rate of decline in cases. Methods:  The spatio-temporal characteristics of TB in Ghana using Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal regression models was analysed in this study. Data were obtained from Ghana National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) for the 10 regions of Ghana, collected over a six-year period. The study also examines some baseline predictors of TB infections to ascertain their effects on the TB risk across the ten regions in Ghana. Results: Hot-spots of TB cases are observed in the Upper East, Upper West, Volta, Western, and Central regions and low risk in the Northern, Ashanti, Greater Accra, Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Western regions. The results indicated a clustering of risk between neighboring regions. TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, awareness that TB is airborne, HIV prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income are important predictors of  detection for this disease across the ten regions of Ghana. Conclusion: Most regions in Ghana have similar TB risks. A substantial reduction in TB cases  requires measures that will increase  detection, success and cure rates, awareness, knowledge about how this disease spreads as well adequate health facilities with easy access.

                Background: Hydranencephaly is a congenital abnormality of the central nervous system characterized by massive hemispheric necrosis and ventricular dilatation with most of the cerebral hemispheres being replaced by membranous sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be one of the causes of hydranencephaly. The choice of therapy for hydranencephaly is a challenge because of poor prognosis, but now neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation may give new hope. Case report: We report a case of a female newborn born at term by cesarean section from a gravida 5, para 3, abortus 1 (G5P3A1) mother with suspected hydrocephalus. Head circumference was 35 cm at birth. The baby was born crying immediately, looked active, and did not appear cyanotic, but on the second day, the baby looked less active, moaned, showed acral cyanosis, and had a large fontanelle that was dilated and soft. Signs of hydrocephalus such as Macewen’s sign, setting sun phenomenon, and transillumination were found to be positive. Echocardiographic examination showed floppy interatrial septum and mild mitral regurgitation. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head showed hydranencephaly. The toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) screening showed positive anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG). The baby underwent a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt procedure with a head circumference of 36 cm before surgery. VP shunt was performed with an opening pressure of 15 cmH2O. Conclusions: After the VP shunt procedure, the baby's general condition improved with the head circumference within normal limits. The baby was discharged from the hospital after 16 days of treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

                The performance of diagnostic tests crucially depends on the disease prevalence, test sensitivity, and test specificity. However, these quantities are often not well known when tests are performed outside defined routine lab procedures which make the rating of the test results somewhat problematic. A current example is the mass testing taking place within the context of the world-wide SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Here, for the first time in history, laboratory test results have a dramatic impact on political decisions. Therefore, transparent, comprehensible, and reliable data is mandatory. It is in the nature of wet lab tests that their quality and outcome are influenced by multiple factors reducing their performance by handling procedures, underlying test protocols, and analytical reagents. These limitations in sensitivity and specificity have to be taken into account when calculating the real test results. As a resolution method, we have developed a Bayesian calculator, the Bayes Lines Tool (BLT), for analyzing disease prevalence, test sensitivity, test specificity, and, therefore, true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative numbers from official test outcome reports. The calculator performs a simple SQL (Structured Query Language) query and can easily be implemented on any system supporting SQL. We provide an example of influenza test results from California, USA, as well as two examples of SARS-CoV-2 test results from official government reports from The Netherlands and Germany-Bavaria, to illustrate the possible parameter space of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity consistent with the observed data. Finally, we discuss this tool’s multiple applications, including its putative importance for informing policy decisions.

                Cor triatriatum is an extremely rare cardiac congenital malformation characterized by subdivision of the left atrium into two chambers. This division is due to the presence of an abnormal fibromuscular membrane interrupted by one or more openings that communicate the two chambers. The  size and number of those orifices is variable, affecting the age of onset of symptoms and their severity. Our case describes the fortuitous discovery of this pathology in a young adult in her forties, following the finding of atrial fibrillation during a preoperative assessment of a strangulated hernia. The cardiac ultrasound allowed in our case to invoke the diagnosis, confirmed thereafter with an angioscanner.  Surgical resection was not required in our patient who was put on medical treatment involving a beta-blocker to reduce atrial fibrillation and an anticoagulant treatment to decrease the thromboembolic risk, with a good clinical evolution. It seems therefore interesting to consider this uncommon pathology which may be latent for a long time, manifesting after some physiological or pathological situations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bocavirus Infection Radiologically Resembling a Congestive Heart Failure in a Patient with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Case-Report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a viral pathogen from the genus Bocaparvovirus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae) discovered in 2005. Most of available literature is about HBoV in children and adults with hematological malignancies and in otherwise healthy children with respiratory infections. Information regarding infection in the adult population with solid tumors is scarce. Case Report: We report the case of a 51-year-old male with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer undergoing chemotherapy treatment who presented with fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and pleuritic pain. Imaging techniques showed signs of congestive heart failure. Symptoms, laboratory tests and echocardiography revealed a more probable infectious etiology. Antibiotic therapy was started. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal exudate for respiratory viruses was positive for HBoV. The rest of the microbiological tests were negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Bacterial culture of BAL was negative while respiratory virus PCR confirmed positivity for HBoV. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued. The patient gradually recovered. Conclusions: Emerging infectious diseases are a notorious threat for immunocompromised populations such as solid tumor patients. This case is unique because to our knowledge this is the first case report article of HBoV in a solid tumor patient and because imaging techniques exhibited signs of congestive heart failure that did not correlate with the rest of the tests. It shows that unusual pathogens should be considered when managing serious clinical complications with uncommon presentations in cancer patients. Notable diagnostic efforts should be made to reach a diagnosis in these cases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain death debates: from bioethics to epistemology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                50 years after its introduction, brain death remains controversial among scholars. The debates focus on one question: is brain death a good criterion for determining death? This question has been answered from various perspectives: medical, metaphysical, ethical, and legal or political. Most authors either defend the criterion as it is, propose some minor or major revisions, or advocate abandoning it and finding better solutions to the problems that brain death was intended to solve when it was introduced. In short, debates about brain death have been characterized by partisanship, for or against. Here I plead for a non-partisan approach that has been overlooked in the literature: the epistemological or philosophy of science approach. Some scholars claim that human death is a matter of fact, a biological phenomenon whose occurrence can be determined empirically, based on science. We should take this claim seriously, whether we agree with it or not. The question is: how do we know that human death is a scientific matter of fact? Taking the epistemological approach means, among other things, examining how the determination of human death became an object of scientific inquiry, exploring the nature of the brain death criterion itself, and analysing the meaning of its core concepts such as “irreversibility” and “functions”.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Near-term forecasting of companion animal tick paralysis incidence: An iterative ensemble model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas J. Clark, Tatiana Proboste, Guyan Weerasinghe, Ricardo J. Soares Magalhães</p>

Tick paralysis resulting from bites from <i>Ixodes holocyclus</i> and <i>I</i>. <i>cornuatus</i> is one of the leading causes of emergency veterinary admissions for companion animals in Australia, often resulting in death if left untreated. Availability of timely information on periods of increased risk can help modulate behaviors that reduce exposures to ticks and improve awareness of owners for the need of lifesaving preventative ectoparasite treatment. Improved awareness of clinicians and pet owners about temporal changes in tick paralysis risk can be assisted by ecological forecasting frameworks that integrate environmental information into statistical time series models. Using an 11-year time series of tick paralysis cases from veterinary clinics in one of Australia’s hotspots for the paralysis tick <i>Ixodes holocyclus</i>, we asked whether an ensemble model could accurately forecast clinical caseloads over near-term horizons. We fit a series of statistical time series (ARIMA, GARCH) and generative models (Prophet, Generalised Additive Model) using environmental variables as predictors, and then combined forecasts into a weighted ensemble to minimise prediction interval error. Our results indicate that variables related to temperature anomalies, levels of vegetation moisture and the Southern Oscillation Index can be useful for predicting tick paralysis admissions. Our model forecasted tick paralysis cases with exceptional accuracy while preserving epidemiological interpretability, outperforming a field-leading benchmark Exponential Smoothing model by reducing both point and prediction interval errors. Using online particle filtering to assimilate new observations and adjust forecast distributions when new data became available, our model adapted to changing temporal conditions and provided further reduced forecast errors. We expect our model pipeline to act as a platform for developing early warning systems that can notify clinicians and pet owners about heightened risks of environmentally driven veterinary conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Individual risk perception and empirical social structures shape the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valeria d’Andrea, Riccardo Gallotti, Nicola Castaldo, Manlio De Domenico</p>

The dynamics of a spreading disease and individual behavioral changes are entangled processes that have to be addressed together in order to effectively manage an outbreak. Here, we relate individual risk perception to the adoption of a specific set of control measures, as obtained from an extensive large-scale survey performed via Facebook—involving more than 500,000 respondents from 64 countries—showing that there is a “one-to-one” relationship between perceived epidemic risk and compliance with a set of mitigation rules. We then develop a mathematical model for the spreading of a disease—sharing epidemiological features with COVID-19—that explicitly takes into account non-compliant individual behaviors and evaluates the impact of a population fraction of infectious risk-deniers on the epidemic dynamics. Our modeling study grounds on a wide set of structures, including both synthetic and more than 180 real-world contact patterns, to evaluate, in realistic scenarios, how network features typical of human interaction patterns impact the spread of a disease. In both synthetic and real contact patterns we find that epidemic spreading is hindered for decreasing population fractions of risk-denier individuals. From empirical contact patterns we demonstrate that connectivity heterogeneity and group structure significantly affect the peak of hospitalized population: higher modularity and heterogeneity of social contacts are linked to lower peaks at a fixed fraction of risk-denier individuals while, at the same time, such features increase the relative impact on hospitalizations with respect to the case where everyone correctly perceive the risks.

                Secondary localizations of cutaneous  metastases from endometrial cancer  are rarely observed  with a prevalence of 0.8% and can be indicative of deep pelvic cancer (ovarian or endometrial). The prognosis is usually poor, with skin metastases most often indicating  advanced disease. This work, based on a case observed in our department and a review of the literature, aims to highlight the existence of this dramatic form of cutaneous  extension of a common disease. Dermatologists are often consulted due to the non-specific nature of the lesions and should be aware of this entity. As with other cutaneous  metastases, an accurate diagnosis  is based on a the patient’s thorough medical and surgical history in conjunction with histopathology

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Treatment profiles and trajectories surrounding the diagnosis of major depressive disorder: a research protocol for a Danish register-based study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness that causes significant suffering and expenses at the personal and societal levels. The disorder is subject to heterogeneity reflected by diverse clinical phenotypes and assorted responses to treatment. Research on MDD treatments have focused on one treatment at a time, however many patients receive several different treatments. Considering the number of available treatment options, we hypothesize that it is possible to identify clinically meaningful groups of patients based on their psychiatric treatment. The objective of this study is therefore to identify psychiatric treatment profiles and trajectories of patients with major depressive disorder and, for the identified profiles and trajectories, to assess clinical and sociodemographic factors. Method: The study will be a population-based register study of patients with major depressive disorder in the Danish National Patient Register between 2011 and 2015. Using latent class analyses, we will identify homogenous groups of patients based on their psychiatric treatment patterns. These patterns constitute psychiatric treatment profiles which will be identified at six time-intervals, from 1.5 years before to 3 years after diagnosis of major depressive disorder. By cross-tabulating the identified treatment profiles, we will establish psychiatric treatment trajectories. Patients sharing profiles and trajectories will be characterized. Discussion: Identification of psychiatric treatment profiles and trajectories based on an unsupervised learning algorithm have the potential to reveal hidden patterns of psychiatric treatment. This will potentially pave the way for future studies of treatment combinations and a larger insight into the different courses of treatment. Furthermore, the assessment of clinical and sociodemographic factors may indicate different patient characteristics across treatment profiles and trajectories.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) leads to lymphopenia and infectious complications in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we aimed to reveal immune markers of DMF-associated lymphopenia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective observational study longitudinally assessed 31 individuals with MS by single-cell mass cytometry before, and after 12 and 48 weeks of DMF therapy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Employing a neural network-based representation learning approach, we identified a CCR4-expressing T helper cell population negatively associated with relevant lymphopenia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CCR4-expressing T helper cells represent a candidate prognostic biomarker for the development of relevant lymphopenia in patients undergoing DMF treatment.</p>

<p>P53 is typically degraded by proteasomes, with Mdm2 playing a significant role. Under tauopathy stress, pathogenic P-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau, AT8, and AT100 P-tau) are formed in the neurites. They gradually moved from the neurites into the soma and nucleus. P-tau nuclear mislocalization is accompanied by p53 stabilization, bax, and cleaved caspase-3 formation, and significant nucleolar dispersion, ultimately leading to neuron death. <i>Cis</i>Pt, <i>Cis</i> P-tau; AT8, AT8 P-tau; AT100, AT100 P-tau; CBax, cleaved bax; CCasp3, cleaved caspase-3; Cytoc, Cytochrome c.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tau protein abnormalities are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In tau-overexpressing SHSY5Y cells and iPSC-derived neuron models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), axonal tau translocates into the nuclear compartment, resulting in neuronal dysfunction. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which tau translocation results in neurodegeneration remain elusive thus far. We studied the nuclear displacement of different P-tau species [<i>Cis</i> phosphorylated Thr231-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau), phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205-tau (AT8 P-tau), and phosphorylated Thr212/Ser214-tau (AT100 P-tau)] at various time points using starvation in primary cortical neurons and single severe TBI (ssTBI) in male mouse cerebral cortices as tauopathy models. While all P-tau species translocated into the somatodendritic compartment in response to stress, <i>cis</i> P-tau did so more rapidly than the other species. Notably, nuclear localization of P-tau was associated with p53 apoptotic stabilization and nucleolar stress, both of which resulted in neurodegeneration. In summary, our findings indicate that P-tau nuclear translocation results in p53-dependent apoptosis and nucleolar dispersion, which is consistent with neurodegeneration.</p>

                Transfer between cells is an unexpected addition to the mitochondrial life cycle. In this issue of Neuron, Van der Vlist et al. now provide evidence that M2-macrophages infiltrating sensory ganglia resolve pain by transferring particles containing mitochondria to neurons—thus boosting nociceptors back to normal function.

                In this issue of Neuron, Chiang et al. examine population coding of self-ordered sequences in prefrontal cortex.

                Presynaptic active zones are megadalton-sized protein machines for spatiotemporal precision of neurotransmitter release. Tan et al. ablate active zones and rebuild their functions within synapses using small protein domains. RIM zinc fingers rendered undocked vesicles fusion competent, and Ca2+ triggering of release was restored by tethering this priming domain to Ca2+ channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endurance exercise ameliorates phenotypes in Drosophila models of Spinocerebellar Ataxias</a></h4>

              
                Endurance exercise is a potent intervention with widespread benefits proven to reduce disease incidence and impact across species.  While endurance exercise supports neural plasticity, enhanced memory, and reduced neurodegeneration, less is known about the effect of chronic exercise on the progression of movement disorders such as ataxias. Here, we focused on three different types of ataxias, Spinocerebellar Ataxias Type (SCAs) 2, 3, and 6, belonging to the polyglutamine (polyQ) family of neurodegenerative disorders. In <i>Drosophila</i> models of these SCAs, flies progressively lose motor function. In this study, we observe marked protection of speed and endurance in exercised SCA2 flies and modest protection in exercised SCA6 models, with no benefit to SCA3 flies. Causative protein levels are reduced in SCA2 flies after chronic exercise, but not in SCA3 models, linking protein levels to exercise-based benefits. Further mechanistic investigation indicates that the exercise-inducible protein, Sestrin (Sesn), suppresses mobility decline and improves early death in SCA2 flies, even without exercise, coincident with disease protein level reduction and increased autophagic flux. These improvements depend on previously established functions of Sesn that reduce oxidative damage and modulate mTOR activity. Our study suggests differential responses of polyQ SCAs to exercise, highlighting the potential for more extensive application of exercise-based therapies in the prevention of polyQ neurodegeneration. Defining the mechanisms by which endurance exercise suppresses polyQ SCAs will open the door for more effective treatment for these diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">YAP1 activation by human papillomavirus E7 promotes basal cell identity in squamous epithelia</a></h4>

              
                Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of stratified squamous epithelial cells causes nearly five percent of cancer cases worldwide. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers harbor few mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway compared to HPV-negative cancers at the same anatomical site, prompting the hypothesis that an HPV-encoded protein inactivates the Hippo pathway and activates the Hippo effector YAP1. The HPV E7 oncoprotein is required for HPV infection and for HPV-mediated oncogenic transformation. We investigated the effects of HPV oncoproteins on YAP1 and found that E7 activates YAP1, promoting YAP1 nuclear localization in basal epithelial cells. YAP1 activation by HPV E7 required that E7 bind and degrade the tumor suppressor PTPN14. E7 required YAP1 transcriptional activity to extend the lifespan of primary keratinocytes, indicating that YAP1 activation contributes to E7 carcinogenic activity. Maintaining infection in basal cells is critical for HPV persistence, and here we demonstrate that YAP1 activation causes HPV E7 expressing cells to be retained in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia. We propose that YAP1 activation resulting from PTPN14 inactivation is an essential, targetable activity of the HPV E7 oncoprotein relevant to HPV infection and carcinogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel mechanism of bulk cytoplasmic transport by cortical dynein in Drosophila ovary</a></h4>

              
                Cytoplasmic dynein, a major minus-end directed microtubule motor, plays essential roles in eukaryotic cells. <i>Drosophila</i> oocyte growth is mainly dependent on the contribution of cytoplasmic contents from the interconnected sister cells, nurse cells. We have previously shown that cytoplasmic dynein is required for <i>Drosophila</i> oocyte growth and assumed that it simply transports cargoes along microtubule tracks from nurse cells to the oocyte. Here we report that instead of transporting individual cargoes along stationary microtubules into the oocyte, cortical dynein actively moves microtubules within nurse cells and from nurse cells to the oocyte via the cytoplasmic bridges, the ring canals. This robust microtubule movement is sufficient to drag even inert cytoplasmic particles through the ring canals to the oocyte. Furthermore, replacing dynein with a minus-end directed plant kinesin linked to the actin cortex is sufficient for transporting organelles and cytoplasm to the oocyte and driving its growth. These experiments show that cortical dynein performs bulk cytoplasmic transport by gliding microtubules along the cell cortex and through the ring canals to the oocyte. We propose that the dynein-driven microtubule flow could serve as a novel mode of fast cytoplasmic transport.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of canonical Wnt signalling by the ciliopathy protein MKS1 and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1</a></h4>

              
                Primary ciliary defects cause a group of developmental conditions known as ciliopathies. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into ciliary ubiquitin processing in cells and for mouse model lacking the ciliary protein Mks1. <i>In vivo </i>loss of Mks1 sensitizes cells to proteasomal disruption, leading to abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. We identified UBE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that polyubiquitinates β-catenin, and RNF34, an E3 ligase, as novel interactants of MKS1. UBE2E1 and MKS1 colocalized, and loss of UBE2E1 recapitulates the ciliary and Wnt signalling phenotypes observed during loss of MKS1. Levels of UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-dependent and UBE2E1 mediates both regulatory and degradative ubiquitination of MKS1. We demonstrate that processing of phosphorylated β-catenin occurs at the ciliary base through the functional interaction between UBE2E1 and MKS1. These observations suggest that correct β-catenin levels are tightly regulated at the primary cilium by a ciliary-specific E2 (UBE2E1) and a regulatory substrate-adaptor (MKS1).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NMDA receptors in visual cortex are necessary for normal visuomotor integration and skill learning</a></h4>

              
                The experience of coupling between motor output and visual feedback is necessary for the development of visuomotor skills and shapes visuomotor integration in visual cortex. Whether these experience dependent changes of responses in V1 depend on modifications of the local circuit or are the consequence of circuit changes outside of V1 remains unclear. Here, we probed the role of NMDA receptor dependent signaling, which is known to be involved in neuronal plasticity, in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) during visuomotor development. We used a local knockout of NMDA receptors and a photoactivatable inhibition of CaMKII in V1 during first visual experience to probe for changes in neuronal activity in V1 as well as the influence on performance in a visuomotor task. We found that a knockout of NMDA receptors before, but not after, first visuomotor experience reduced responses to unpredictable stimuli, diminished the suppression of predictable feedback in V1, and impaired visuomotor skill learning later in life. Our results demonstrate that NMDA receptor dependent signaling in V1 is critical during first visuomotor experience for shaping visuomotor integration and enabling visuomotor skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociable roles of theta and alpha in sub-second and supra-second time reproduction:An investigation of their links to depression and anxiety</a></h4>

              
                The Striatal Beat Frequency model (Matell & Meck, 2004) suggests that multiple cortical oscillators contribute to human temporal cognition. Based on the theory, the current study examined the interactions between interval timing and neural oscillations, as predicted by timing deficits found in neuropsychiatric conditions. The interaction is predicted to manifest in frontal-midline theta and occipital alpha oscillations, which are two important cortical oscillatory sources engaged in working memory and time perception. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to examine how depression and anxiety modulate frontal-midline theta and occipital data during the encoding of sub- and supra-second intervals. In the current study, participants reproduced sub- (400, 600, 800ms) and supra-second (1600, 1800, 2000ms) intervals while they underwent scalp EEG recordings. Anxiety and depression levels were measured via self-report psychometrics. We found that higher levels of self-reported anxiety and depression were associated with shorter reproduction of lengths of durations. Further, time-frequency analysis of scalp EEG revealed a dissociation where state anxiety altered the links between frontal-midline theta power and sub-second interval reproduction, while depression and trait anxiety altered the association between occipital alpha power and supra-second interval reproduction. Our results suggest that anxiety and depression alter time perception, and this differentially relates to frontal-midline theta and occipital alpha as substrates for sub- and supra-second interval timing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurovascular Uncoupling: Multimodal Imaging Delineates the Acute Effects of MDMA</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelic compounds have attracted increasing interest in recent years due to their therapeutic potential for psychiatric disorders. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is currently being investigated in clinical trials to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. To understand the acute effects of psychedelic drugs in vivo, functional MR imaging (fMRI) has been widely used in recent years. Notably, fMRI studies have shown that MDMA leads to inhibition of brain activity, challenging earlier hypotheses indicating mainly excitatory effects. However, interpretation of hemodynamic changes induced by psychedelics is challenging because of the potent vascular effects associated with this class of substances. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the acute effects of MDMA using simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)/fMRI in rats. For this purpose, hemodynamic changes measured by BOLD-fMRI were related to alterations in glucose utilization and serotonin transporter (SERT) occupancy, investigated using [18F]FDG functional PET (fPET) and [11C]DASB PET. We demonstrate that MDMA induces global hemodynamic decreases accompanied by localized metabolic increases. Elevated metabolism was found primarily in limbic projection areas involved in emotion processing. Concurrent BOLD-fMRI decreases, also found in extracerebral areas, indicate that the BOLD-fMRI reductions observed in the brain are of vascular, non-neuronal origin. We further show that higher SERT occupancy strongly correlates with regional BOLD-fMRI reductions. Therefore, increased serotonin levels induced by SERT blockage may cause a neurovascular uncoupling. Correct understanding of the in vivo mechanism of MDMA not only supports ongoing research but also warrants a reassessment of previous studies on neuronal effects of psychedelics relying on neurovascular coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The impacts of anesthetic regimens on the middle cerebral artery occlusion outcomes in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was introduced more than three decades ago to simulate human stroke. Till now, it is the most common platform to investigate stroke-induced pathological changes as well as discover new drugs and treatments. Induction of general anesthesia is mandatory to induce this model, and different laboratories are using various anesthetic drugs, which might affect MCAO results. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the impacts of several widely used anesthetic regimens on the MCAO outcomes. Materials and Methods: Here, adult male rats were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate, intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine, or subcutaneous administration of ketamine-xylazine, then subjected to 30 min MCAO. Mortality rate, body weight change, infarct size, as well as cognitive and neurological performance were evaluated up to three days after the surgery. Results: Our findings revealed chloral hydrate caused the highest, while subcutaneous ketamine-xylazine led to the lowest mortality rate. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in the body weight loss, infarct size, cognitive impairments, and neurological deficits among the experimental groups. Conclusions: Based on the current results, we proposed that subcutaneous injection of ketamine-xylazine could be an effective anesthetic regimen in the rat model of MCAO with several advantages such as low mortality, cost-effectiveness, safety, ease of administration, and not requiring specialized equipment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A simple self-decoding model for neural coding</a></h4>

              
                Neural coding is an important tool to discover the inner workings of mind. In this work, we propose and consider a simple but novel self-decoding model for neural coding based on the principle that the neuron body represents ongoing stimulus while dendrites are used to store that stimulus as a memory. In particular, suppose t spiking presynaptic neurons transmit any stimulus directly to a population of suppose n postsynaptic neurons, a postsynaptic neuron spikes if it does not connect to an inhibitory presynaptic neuron, and every stimulus is represented by up to suppose d spiking postsynaptic neurons. Our hypothesis is that the brain is organized to functionally satisfy the following six criteria: (i) decoding objective, i.e., there are up to suppose r - 1 [&ge;] 0 additional spiking postsynaptic neurons in response to a stimulus along with the spiking postsynaptic neurons representing the stimulus, (ii) smoothness, i.e., similar stimuli are encoded similarly by the presynaptic neurons, (iii) optimal information transmission, i.e., suppose t is minimized, (iv) optimal energetic cost, i.e., only the suppose t presynaptic neurons and the postsynaptic neurons representing a stimulus spike, (v) low-dimensional representation, i.e., suppose d = o(n), and (vi) sparse coding, i.e., suppose t = o(n). Our finding is that some criteria cause or correlate with others. Let the characteristic set of a postsynaptic neuron be the set of the presynaptic neurons it connects with. We prove that (i) holds if and only if the union of the r characteristic sets of any r postsynaptic neurons is not included in the union of the d characteristic sets of d other postsynaptic neurons. Consequently, (ii) is attained. More importantly, we suggest that the decoding objective (i) and optimal information transmission (iii) play a fundamental role in neural computation, while (v) and (vi) correlate to each other and correlate with (iii) and (iv). We examine our hypothesis by statistically testing functional connectivity network and the presynaptic-postsynaptic connectivity in layer 2 of the medial entorhinal cortex of a rat.

                Despite tremendous unmet medical needs, there is no effective pharmacological treatment to promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Although multiple pathological events have been implicated in SCI, the development of a noninvasive pharmacological approach to simultaneously target the different mechanisms involved in SCI remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we report the development of a noninvasive nanodrug delivery system that consists of ROS-responsive amphiphilic copolymers and an encapsulated neurotransmitter-conjugated KCC2 agonist. We show that upon intravenous administration, the nanodrugs were able to enter the injured spinal cord due to blood spinal cord barrier disruption and ROS-responsive disassembly. Remarkably, once in the injured spinal cord, these nanodrugs exhibited dual functions: scavenging ROS accumulated in the lesion to protect spared connections and increasing neuronal excitability in the injured spinal cord through targeted delivery of the KCC2 agonist to inhibitory neurons. Thus, the noninvasive treatment led to significant functional recovery in the rats with contusive SCI. Together, these findings provide a much-needed translational pharmacological approach for treating severe SCI.

                The communication through coherence model posits that brain rhythms are synchronized across different frequency bands and that effective connectivity strength between interacting regions depends on their phase relation. Evidence to support the model comes mostly from electrophysiological recordings in animals while evidence from human data is limited. Here, an fMRI-EEG-TMS (fET) instrument capable of acquiring simultaneous fMRI and EEG during noninvasive single pulse TMS applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was used to test whether prefrontal EEG alpha phase moderates TMS-evoked top-down influences on subgenual, rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Results in healthy volunteers (n=11) were compared to those from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=17) collected as part of a ongoing clinical trial investigation. In both groups, TMS-evoked functional connectivity between DLPFC and subgenual ACC (sgACC) depended on the EEG alpha phase. TMS-evoked DLPFC to sgACC effective connectivity (EC) was moderated by EEG alpha phase in healthy volunteers, but not in the MDD patients. Top-down EC was inhibitory for TMS onsets during the upward slope of the alpha wave relative to TMS timed to the downward slope of the alpha wave. Prefrontal EEG alpha phase dependent effects on TMS-evoked fMRI BOLD activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex were detected in the MDD patient group, but not in the healthy volunteer group. Results demonstrate that TMS-evoked top-down influences vary as a function of the prefrontal alpha rhythm, and suggest clinical applications whereby TMS is synchronized to internal rhythms of the brain in order to more efficiently engage deep therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of receptive field tuning properties in mouse binocular primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mouse primary visual cortex is a model system for understanding the relationship between cortical structure, function, and behavior (Seabrook et al., 2017; Chaplin and Margrie, 2020; Hooks and Chen, 2020; Saleem, 2020; Flossmann and Rochefort, 2021). Binocular neurons in V1 are the cellular basis of binocular vision, which is required for predation (Scholl et al., 2013; Hoy et al., 2016; La Chioma et al., 2020; Berson, 2021; Johnson et al., 2021). The normal development of binocular responses, however, has not been systematically measured. Here, we measure tuning properties of neurons to either eye in awake mice of either sex from eye-opening to the closure of the critical period. At eye-opening, we find an adult-like fraction of neurons responding to the contralateral-eye stimulation, which are selective for orientation and spatial frequency; few neurons respond to ipsilateral eye and their tuning is immature. Fraction of ipsilateral-eye responses increases rapidly in the first few days after eye opening and more slowly thereafter, reaching adult levels by critical period closure. Tuning of these responses improves with a similar time course. The development and tuning of binocular responses parallels that of ipsilateral-eye responses. Four days after eye-opening, monocular neurons respond to a full range of orientations but become more biased to cardinal orientations. Binocular responses, by contrast, lose their cardinal bias with age. Together, these data provide an in-depth accounting of the development of monocular and binocular responses in the binocular region of mouse V1 using a consistent set of visual stimuli and measurements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral signatures of Y-like neuronal responses in human vision</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) initiating the magnocellular/Y-cell visual pathways are distinguished by responding nonlinearly to high spatial frequencies (SFs) and temporal frequencies (TFs). This nonlinearity is implicated in the processing of contrast modulation (CM) stimuli in cats and monkeys, but its contribution to human visual perception is not well understood. Here we formulated an approach to reveal the function of human Y-like RGCs by leveraging the Y-like carrier response properties of cortical neurons to CM stimuli consisting of a high SF contrast-reversing grating carrier whose contrast is modulated by a low SF drifting sinewave envelope. Subjects reported the direction of motion of CM envelopes or luminance modulation (LM) gratings, presented at different eccentricities. The dependence of task performance on SF (for LMs) or carrier SF (for CMs) was measured for different TFs (LMs) or carrier TFs (CMs). The best performance for LM stimuli was at lower TFs and SFs, which decreased systematically with eccentricity. However, performance with CM stimuli was bandpass with carrier SF, largely independent of carrier TF, and at the highest carrier TF (20 Hz) decreased minimally with eccentricity. Since the nonlinear subunits of Y-cells respond better at higher TFs compared to the linear response components, and respond best at higher SFs that are relatively independent of eccentricity, these results suggest that behavioral tasks employing CM stimuli with high spatiotemporal carrier frequencies can reveal the nonlinear contributions of retinal Y-like cells to human perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Utilising TMS-EEG to assess the response to cerebellar-brain inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cerebellar-brain inhibition (CBI) is a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm indexing excitability of cerebellar projections to motor cortex (M1). Stimulation involved with CBI is often considered to be uncomfortable, and alternative ways to index connectivity between cerebellum and the cortex would be valuable. Utilising electroencephalography in conjunction with TMS (combined TMS-EEG) to record the response to CBI has the potential to achieve this, but has not been attempted previously. Objective: To investigate the utility of TMS-EEG for characterising cerebellar-cortical interactions recruited by CBI. Methods: A total of 33 volunteers (25.7 {+/-} 4.9 years, 20 females) participated across three experiments. These investigated EEG responses to CBI induced with a figure-of-eight (F8; experiment 1) or double cone (DC; experiment 2) conditioning coil over cerebellum, in addition to multisensory sham stimulation (experiment 3). Results: Both F8 and DC coils suppressed early TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) produced by TMS to M1 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the TEP produced by CBI stimulation was related to the motor inhibitory response to CBI recorded in a hand muscle (P < 0.05), but only when using the DC coil. Multisensory sham stimulation failed to modify the M1 TEP. Conclusions: Cerebellar conditioning produced changes in the M1 TEP that were not apparent following sham stimulation, and that were related to the motor inhibitory effects of CBI. Our findings therefore suggest it is possible to index the response to CBI using TMS-EEG. In addition, while both F8 and DC coils appear to recruit cerebellar projections, the nature of these may be different.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Representations of Self-Generated Thought during Think-aloud fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Is the brain at rest during the so-called resting-state? Ongoing experiences in the resting-state vary in unobserved and uncontrolled ways across time, individuals, and populations. However, the role of self-generated thoughts in resting-state fMRI remains largely unexplored. In this study, we collected real-time self-generated thoughts during resting-state fMRI scans via the think-aloud method (i.e., think-aloud fMRI), which required participants to report whatever they were currently thinking. We first investigated brain activation patterns during a think-aloud condition and found that significantly activated brain areas included all brain regions required for speech, along with a large number of deactivated brain regions. We then calculated the relationship between divergence in thought content and brain activation during think-aloud, and found that divergence in thought content was associated with a large number of brain regions, including those that were significantly activated and deactivated during think-aloud. Finally, we explored the neural representation of self-generated thoughts by performing representational similarity analysis (RSA) at three neural scales: a voxel-wise whole-brain searchlight level; a region-level whole-brain analysis using the Schaefer 400-parcels; a system level using the Yeo seven-network systems and the language subsystems. We found that resting-state self-generated thoughts were distributed across a wide range of brain regions, involving all Yeo seven-network. This study highlights the importance of taking into account ongoing experiences during resting-state fMRI, as well as providing preliminary methodological support for think-aloud fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired dendritic spine development in a zebrafish model of Fragile X</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are the principal site of excitatory synapse formation in the human brain. Impaired formation of spines during development has been observed in several autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X is caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene encoding the RNA-binding protein FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein). While spine development has been well characterized in the mammalian CNS, spines are not unique to mammals. Pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) of the zebrafish optic tectum form an apical dendrite containing a dense array of dendritic spines. We employed a genetic labeling system to monitor in vivo dendritic spine development in larval zebrafish. Our findings identify a developmental window when PyrN dendrite growth is concurrent with spine formation. Throughout this period, motile, transient filopodia gradually transform into stable spines containing postsynaptic specializations. fmr1 mutant zebrafish larvae exhibit pronounced defects in both PyrN dendrite growth and the formation of morphologically mature spines. Live imaging of PyrN dendrites suggests these defects are caused by an inability to stabilize nascent contacts. These findings indicate spine stabilization is essential for PyrN dendritic arborization and establish zebrafish larvae as a model system to study spine development in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BK channel properties correlate with neurobehavioral severity in three KCNMA1-linked channelopathy mouse models</a></h4>

              
                KCNMA1 forms the pore of BK K+ channels, which regulate neuronal and muscle excitability. Recently, genetic screening identified heterozygous KCNMA1 variants in a subset of patients with debilitating paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting with or without epilepsy (PNKD3). However, the relevance of KCNMA1 mutations and the basis for clinical heterogeneity in PNKD3 has not been established. Here we evaluate the relative severity of three KCNMA1 patient variants in BK channels, neurons, and mice. In heterologous cells, BKN999S and BKD434G channels displayed gain-of-function (GOF) properties, whereas BKH444Q channels showed loss-of-function (LOF) properties. The relative degree of channel activity was BKN999S > BKD434G > WT > BKH444Q. BK currents and action potential firing were increased, and seizure thresholds decreased, in Kcnma1N999S/WT and Kcnma1D434G/WT transgenic mice but not Kcnma1H444Q/WT mice. In a novel behavioral test for paroxysmal dyskinesia, the more severely affected Kcnma1N999S/WT mice became immobile after stress, consistent with stress-induced immobility episodes observed in PNKD3 patients. Homozygous Kcnma1D434G/D434G mice showed similar immobility, but in contrast, homozygous Kcnma1H444Q/H444Q mice displayed hyperkinetic behavior. These data establish the relative pathogenic potential of patient alleles as N999S > D434G > H444Q and validate Kcnma1N999S/WT mice as a model for PNKD3 with increased seizure propensity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The connectional anatomy of visual mental imagery: evidence from a patient with left occipito-temporal damage</a></h4>

              
                Most of us can use their 'mind's eye' to mentally visualize things that are not in their direct line of sight, an ability known as visual mental imagery. Extensive left temporal damage can impair patients' visual mental imagery experience, but the critical locus of lesion is unknown. Our recent meta-analysis of 27 fMRI studies of visual mental imagery highlighted a well-delimited region in the left lateral midfusiform gyrus, which was consistently activated during visual mental imagery, and which we called the Fusiform Imagery Node (FIN). Here we describe the connectional anatomy of FIN in neurotypical participants and in RDS, a right-handed patient with an extensive occipitotemporal stroke in the left hemisphere. The stroke provoked right homonymous hemianopia, alexia without agraphia, and color anomia. Despite these deficits, RDS had normal subjective experience of visual mental imagery and reasonably preserved behavioral performance on tests of visual mental imagery of object shape, object color, letters, faces, and spatial relationships. We found that the FIN was spared by the lesion. We then assessed the connectional anatomy of the FIN in the MNI space and in the patient's native space, by visualizing the fibers of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) passing through the FIN. In both spaces, the ILF connected the FIN with the anterior temporal lobe, and the AF linked it with frontal regions. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the FIN is a node of a brain network dedicated to voluntary visual mental imagery. The FIN could have a specific role in integrating high-level visual representations in domain-preferring regions in the ventral temporal lobe with elements of semantic knowledge stored in the anterior temporal lobe and in the language circuits.

	<p>Recent neuroimaging research has suggested that interpreters and non-interpreters elicit different brain activation patterns during simultaneous language translation. However, whether these two groups have different functional connectivity during such a task, and how the neural coupling is among brain subregions, are still not well understood. In this study, we recruited Mandarin (L1)/English (L2) interpreters and non-interpreter bilinguals, whom we asked to perform simultaneous language translation and reading tasks. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to collect cortical brain data for participants during each task, using 68 channels that covered the prefrontal cortex and the bilateral perisylvian regions. Our findings revealed both interpreter and non-interpreter groups recruited the right dorsolateral prefrontal hub when completing the simultaneous language translation tasks. We also found different functional connectivity between the groups. The interpreter group was characterized by information exchange between the frontal cortex and Wernicke&amp;amp;rsquo;s area. In comparison, the non-interpreter group revealed neural coupling between the frontal cortex and Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area. These findings indicate expertise modulates functional connectivity, possibly because of more developed cognitive skills associated with executive functions in interpreters.</p>

	<p>Physiological studies have shown that self-body images receive unique recognition processing in a wide range of brain areas, from the frontal lobe to the parietal-occipital cortex. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that the self-referential effect on the image of a hand increases P300 components, but such studies do not evaluate brain oscillatory activity. In this study, we aimed to discover the self-specific brain electrophysiological activity in relation to hand images. ERPs on the fronto-parietal midline were elicited by a three-stimulus visual oddball task using hand images: the self-hand, another hand (most similar to the self-hand), and another hand (similar to the self-hand). We analyzed ERP waveform and brain oscillatory activity by simple averaging and time-frequency analysis. The simple averaging analysis found no significant differences between the responses for the three stimulus tasks in all time windows. However, time-frequency analysis showed that self-hand stimuli elicited high gamma ERS in 650&amp;amp;ndash;900 ms at the Cz electrode compared to other hand stimuli. Our results show that brain activity specific to the self-referential process to the self-hand image was reflected in the long latency gamma band activity in the mid-central region. This high gamma-band activity at the Cz electrode may be similar to the activity of the mirror neuron system, which is involved in hand motion.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Odour identification (OI) dysfunction is a potential predictor of developing dementia in late life depression (LLD). However, it is not clear whether patients with early onset depression (EOD) and late onset depression (LOD) may exhibit different OI dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to compare OI between EOD patients and LOD patients and its relationship with cognitive function. (2) Methods: A total of 179 patients with LLD and 189 normal controls were recruited. Participants underwent clinical assessment, olfactory testing, and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The OI scores of EOD patients and LOD patients were compared, and correlation analyses and mediation analyses were used to explore the relationship between OI and cognition. (3) Result: Both EOD patients and LOD patients exhibited lower OI scores than normal controls (NCs). Additionally, the LOD group exhibited lower OI scores and a higher percentage of OI dysfunction than the EOD group. Moreover, OI scores were associated with global cognition, memory, language, and visuospatial ability in the EOD group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) but were not associated with any cognitive score in the LOD group (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Finally, the scores of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test Immediate recall and Boston Naming Test exhibited a partially mediating effect on the difference in OI scores between the EOD and LOD groups. (4) Conclusions: LOD patients exhibited worse OI than EOD patients, and their difference in OI was mediated by their memory and language function.</p>

	<p>Theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling (TGC) plays an important role in several different cognitive processes. Although spontaneous brain activity at the resting state is crucial in preparing for cognitive performance, the functional role of resting-state TGC remains unclear. To investigate the role of resting-state TGC, electroencephalogram recordings were obtained for 56 healthy volunteers while they were in the resting state, with their eyes closed, and then when they were engaged in a retention interval period in the visual memory task. The TGCs of the two different conditions were calculated and compared. The results indicated that the modulation index of TGC during the retention interval of the visual working memory (VWM) task was not higher than that during the resting state; however, the topographical distribution of TGC during the resting state was negatively correlated with TGC during VWM task at the local level. The topographical distribution of TGC during the resting state was negatively correlated with TGC coordinates&amp;amp;rsquo; engagement of brain areas in local and large-scale networks and during task performance at the local level. These findings support the view that TGC reflects information-processing and signal interaction across distant brain areas. These results demonstrate that TGC could explain the efficiency of competing brain networks.</p>

	<p>Objectives: (1) To determine which psychosocial aspects predict tinnitus-related distress in a large self-reported dataset of patients with chronic tinnitus, and (2) to identify underlying constructs by means of factor analysis. Methods: A cohort of 1958 patients of the Charit&amp;amp;eacute; Tinnitus Center, Berlin completed a large questionnaire battery that comprised sociodemographic data, tinnitus-related distress, general psychological stress experience, emotional symptoms, and somatic complaints. To identify a construct of &amp;amp;ldquo;tinnitus-related distress&amp;amp;rdquo;, significant predictive items were grouped using factor analysis. Results: For the prediction of tinnitus-related distress (linear regression model with R2 = 0.7), depressive fatigue symptoms (concentration, sleep, rumination, joy decreased), the experience of emotional strain, somatization tendencies (pain, doctor contacts), and age appeared to play a role. The factor analysis revealed five factors: &amp;amp;ldquo;stress&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;pain experience&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;fatigue&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;autonomy&amp;amp;rdquo;, and low &amp;amp;ldquo;educational level&amp;amp;rdquo;. Conclusions: Tinnitus-related distress is predicted by psychological and sociodemographic indices. Relevant factors seem to be depressive exhaustion with somatic expressions such as sleep and concentration problems, somatization, general psychological stress, and reduced activity, in addition to higher age.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are characterized by episodes of eating large amounts of food while experiencing a loss of control. Recent studies suggest that the underlying causes of BN/BED consist of a complex system of environmental cues, atypical processing of food stimuli, altered behavioral responding, and structural/functional brain differences compared with healthy controls (HC). In this narrative review, we provide an integrative account of the brain networks associated with the three cognitive constructs most integral to BN and BED, namely increased reward sensitivity, decreased cognitive control, and altered negative affect and stress responding. We show altered activity in BED/BN within several brain networks, specifically in the striatum, insula, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and cingulate gyrus. Numerous key nodes in these networks also differ in volume and connectivity compared with HC. We provide suggestions for how this integration may guide future research into these brain networks and cognitive constructs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic hM4Di-DREADD-Mediated Chemogenetic Inhibition of Forebrain Excitatory Neurons in Postnatal or Juvenile Life Does Not Alter Adult Mood-Related Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) coupled to G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling, in particular downstream of monoaminergic neurotransmission, are posited to play a key role during developmental epochs (postnatal and juvenile) in shaping the emergence of adult anxiodepressive behaviors and sensorimotor gating. To address the role of G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling in these developmental windows, we used a CaMKII&alpha;-tTA::TRE hM4Di bigenic mouse line to express the hM4Di-DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) in forebrain excitatory neurons and enhanced G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling via chronic administration of the DREADD agonist, clozapine-<I>N</I>-oxide (CNO) in the postnatal window (postnatal days 2&ndash;14) or the juvenile window (postnatal days 28&ndash;40). We confirmed that the expression of the HA-tagged hM4Di-DREADD was restricted to CaMKII&alpha;-positive neurons in the forebrain, and that the administration of CNO in postnatal or juvenile windows evoked inhibition in forebrain circuits of the hippocampus and cortex, as indicated by a decline in expression of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos. hM4Di-DREADD-mediated inhibition of CaMKII&alpha;-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal or juvenile life did not impact the weight profile of mouse pups, and also did not influence the normal ontogeny of sensory reflexes. Further, postnatal or juvenile hM4Di-DREADD-mediated inhibition of CaMKII&alpha;-positive forebrain excitatory neurons did not alter anxiety- or despair-like behaviors in adulthood and did not impact sensorimotor gating. Collectively, these results indicate that chemogenetic induction of G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling in CaMKII&alpha;-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal and juvenile temporal windows does not appear to impinge on the programming of anxiodepressive behaviors in adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">MRI Stereoscope: A Miniature Stereoscope for Human Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stereoscopic vision enables the perception of depth. To study the brain mechanisms behind stereoscopic vision using noninvasive brain imaging (magnetic resonance brain imaging; MRI), scientists need to reproduce the independent views of the left and right eyes in the brain scanner using "dichoptic" displays. However, high-quality dichoptic displays are technically challenging and costly to implement in the MRI scanner. The novel miniature stereoscope system ("MRI stereoscope") is an affordable and open-source tool that displays high-quality dichoptic images inside the MRI scanner. The MRI stereoscope takes advantage of commonly used display equipment, the MRI head coil, and a display screen. To validate the MRI stereoscope, binocular disparity stimuli were presented in a 3T MRI scanner while neural activation was recorded using functional MRI in six human participants. The comparison of large binocular disparities compared with disparities close to zero evoked strong responses across dorsal and ventral extra-striate visual cortex. In contrast, binocularly anti-correlated stimuli, which are not perceived in depth, did not evoke comparable activation. These results are the proof-of-concept that the MRI stereoscope can deliver dichoptic images that produce the perception of stereoscopic depth during acquisition of MR responses. Application of the MRI stereoscope to neuroscience can help to address important questions in perception and consciousness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Targeting Neurons with Functional Oxytocin Receptors: A Novel Set of Simple Knock-In Mouse Lines for Oxytocin Receptor Visualization and Manipulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neuropeptide oxytocin (Oxt) plays important roles in modulating social behaviors. Oxt receptor (Oxtr) is abundantly expressed in the brain and its relationship to socio-behavioral controls has been extensively studied using mouse brains. Several genetic tools to visualize and/or manipulate Oxtr-expressing cells, such as fluorescent reporters and Cre recombinase drivers, have been generated by ES-cell based gene targeting or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis. However, these mouse lines displayed some differences in their Oxtr expression profiles probably because of the complex context and integrity of their genomic configurations in each line. Here, we apply our sophisticated genome-editing techniques to the <I>Oxtr</I> locus, systematically generating a series of knock-in mouse lines, in which its endogenous transcriptional regulations are intactly preserved and evaluate their expression profiles to ensure the reliability of our new tools. We employ the epitope tagging strategy, with which C-terminally fused tags can be detected by highly specific antibodies, to successfully visualize the Oxtr protein distribution on the neural membrane with super-resolution imaging for the first time. By using T2A self-cleaving peptide sequences, we also induce proper expressions of tdTomato reporter, codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre), and spatiotemporally inducible Cre-ERT2 in Oxtr-expressing neurons. Electrophysiological recordings from tdTomato-positive cells in the reporter mice support the validity of our tool design. Retro-orbital injections of AAV-PHP.eB vector into the Cre line further enabled visualization of recombinase activities in the appropriate brain regions. Moreover, the first-time Cre-ERT2 line drives Cre-mediated recombination in a spatiotemporally controlled manner on tamoxifen (TMX) administration. These tools thus provide an excellent resource for future functional studies in Oxt-responsive neurons and should prove of broad interest in the field.</p>

                Background: Phytomedicines are gaining a spotlight in wound management, where much research has suggested the wound healing potential of Barringtonia racemosa. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of B. racemosa kernel extract in accelerating wound healing process in animal models. Methods: B. racemosa kernel was extracted using ethanol:water (7:3) solvent and was then used as a bioactive ingredient in a Carbopol 940-based gel formulation in four different concentrations (1, 3, 5 and 7 ppm). A 3 cm diameter wound was made in the dorsal area of Rattus norvegicus rat and wound healing process was assessed up to 12 days using DESIGN (Depth, Exudate, Size of Inflammation/Infection, Granulation tissue, and Necrotic tissue) scoring system. Results: Our data suggested that the DESIGN scores were significantly different among concentration groups after the 3rd day onward suggesting B. racemosa extract accelerated the wound healing process. Rats treated with gel formulation containing 7 ppm of B. racemosa kernel extract had faster wound healing than that treated with topical Metcovazin. Conclusion: B. racemosa kernel extract was effective in accelerating wound healing on rats. Further study is warranted to purify the bioactive component and the action mechanism in wound healing process.

                In order to reduce the impact of technical variation inherent in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies on biological interpretation of experiments, rigorous preprocessing and quality control is required to transform raw sequencing reads into high-quality, gene and transcript counts. While hundreds of tools have been developed for this purpose, the vast majority of the most widely used tools are built for the R software environment. With an increasing number of new tools now being developed using Python, it is necessary to develop integrative workflows that leverage tools from both platforms. We have therefore developed, SASCRiP (Sequencing Analysis of Single-Cell RNA in Python), a modular single-cell preprocessing workflow that integrates functionality from existing, widely used R and Python packages, and additional custom features and visualizations, to enable preprocessing of scRNA-seq data derived from technologies that use unique molecular identifier (UMI) sequences in a single Python analysis workflow. We describe the utility of SASCRiP using datasets derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells sequenced using droplet-based, 3′-end sequencing technology. We highlight SASCRiP’s diagnostic visualizations and fully customizable functions, and demonstrate how SASCRiP provides a highly flexible, integrative Python workflow for preparing unprocessed UMI count-based scRNA-seq data for subsequent downstream analyses. SASCRiP is freely available through PyPi or from the GitHub page.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A close-up of the use of weblogs and blogging buddies: A case study in Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background – Peer review or evaluation has been seen as a promising approach in helping students to learn from one another instead of relying solely on their overwhelmed teachers for feedback on their written work. However, there have been mixed reviews on the effectiveness of this method. This study aims to examine the effects of peer review on blogging buddies’ writing performance as well as to suggest the groundwork needed for an effective way to pair the blogging buddies to ensure that the peers can bilaterally benefit each other.     Methods – A qualitative case study was conducted on eight students from a private university in Malaysia. The writing scores for three different essays (pre and post peer review) were tracked to observe its effects on the respective blogging buddies’ writing performance.      Results – The findings have shown that the students’ proficiency levels played an important part in pairing the students as it impacted their writing performance and the effectiveness of the peer review activity. Poor proficiency students who were paired with average proficiency students seemed to make the greatest progress and were the most prominent beneficiaries. Even though these average students benefited from being a reviewer; this pairing was a disadvantage when they reposted their essays after peer review. For high proficiency students who were paired together, they recorded either an increased score or a same score in their post-peer writing.     Conclusions – This study has shown that for peer review via weblogs to be effectively implemented in writing classes, proper groundwork needs to be laid for instructors to ensure that adequate training is provided, the peers are properly paired, and sufficient support is provided to these blogging buddies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cortical signatures of auditory object binding in children with autism spectrum disorder are anomalous in concordance with behavior and diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hari Bharadwaj, Fahimeh Mamashli, Sheraz Khan, Ravinderjit Singh, Robert M. Joseph, Ainsley Losh, Stephanie Pawlyszyn, Nicole M. McGuiggan, Steven Graham, Matti S. Hämäläinen, Tal Kenet</p>

Organizing sensory information into coherent perceptual objects is fundamental to everyday perception and communication. In the visual domain, indirect evidence from cortical responses suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have anomalous figure–ground segregation. While auditory processing abnormalities are common in ASD, especially in environments with multiple sound sources, to date, the question of scene segregation in ASD has not been directly investigated in audition. Using magnetoencephalography, we measured cortical responses to unattended (passively experienced) auditory stimuli while parametrically manipulating the degree of temporal coherence that facilitates auditory figure–ground segregation. Results from 21 children with ASD (aged 7–17 years) and 26 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children provide evidence that children with ASD show anomalous growth of cortical neural responses with increasing temporal coherence of the auditory figure. The documented neurophysiological abnormalities did not depend on age, and were reflected both in the response evoked by changes in temporal coherence of the auditory scene and in the associated induced gamma rhythms. Furthermore, the individual neural measures were predictive of diagnosis (83% accuracy) and also correlated with behavioral measures of ASD severity and auditory processing abnormalities. These findings offer new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perceptual deficits and sensory overload in ASD, and suggest that temporal-coherence-based auditory scene analysis and suprathreshold processing of coherent auditory objects may be atypical in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Public human microbiome data are dominated by highly developed countries</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard J. Abdill, Elizabeth M. Adamowicz, Ran Blekhman</p>

The importance of sampling from globally representative populations has been well established in human genomics. In human microbiome research, however, we lack a full understanding of the global distribution of sampling in research studies. This information is crucial to better understand global patterns of microbiome-associated diseases and to extend the health benefits of this research to all populations. Here, we analyze the country of origin of all 444,829 human microbiome samples that are available from the world’s 3 largest genomic data repositories, including the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The samples are from 2,592 studies of 19 body sites, including 220,017 samples of the gut microbiome. We show that more than 71% of samples with a known origin come from Europe, the United States, and Canada, including 46.8% from the US alone, despite the country representing only 4.3% of the global population. We also find that central and southern Asia is the most underrepresented region: Countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh account for more than a quarter of the world population but make up only 1.8% of human microbiome samples. These results demonstrate a critical need to ensure more global representation of participants in microbiome studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">RGMa signal in Macrophages Induces Neutrophil‐related Astrocytopathy in NMO</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein which has multiple functions including axon growth inhibition and immune regulation. However, its role in the pathophysiology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is poorly understood. Perivascular astrocytopathy, which is induced by the leakage of aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific IgG into the central nervous system parenchyma, is a key feature of NMO pathology. We investigated the RGMa involvement in the pathology of NMO astrocytopathy, and tested a therapeutic potential of humanized anti-RGMa monoclonal antibody (RGMa-mAb).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a clinically relevant NMO rat model, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of a RGMa-mAb by behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression assay. We further performed in vitro experiments to address the RGMa-signaling in macrophages.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In both NMO rats and an NMO-autopsied sample, RGMa was expressed by the spared neurons and astrocytes, whereas its receptor neogenin was expressed by infiltrating macrophages. AQP4-IgG-induced astrocytopathy and clinical exacerbation in NMO rats were ameliorated by RGMa-mAb treatment. RGMa-mAb treatment significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration, and decreased the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants. Interestingly, neogenin-expressing macrophages accumulated in the lesion expressed CXCL2, a strong neutrophil chemoattractant, and further analysis revealed that RGMa directly regulated CXCL2 expression in macrophages. Finally, we found that our NMO rats developed neuropathic pain, and RGMa-mAb treatment effectively ameliorated the severity of neuropathic pain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RGMa signaling in infiltrated macrophages is a critical driver of neutrophil-related astrocytopathy in NMO lesions, and RGMa-mAb may provide an efficient therapeutic strategy for NMO-associated neuropathic pain and motor deficits in patients with NMO.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico screening of chloroquine analogues for compounds with more affinity for the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine transporter as potential antimalarial drugs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is an acute febrile illness affecting over 229 million people worldwide. Children aged five years and below are affected the most, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Chloroquine was previously used as the first-line treatment for malaria due to its affordability and high efficacy, but resistance has developed. Resistance to chloroquine is due to a mutation in the protein Plasmodium falciparum Chloroquine Transporter (pfCRT) which effluxes the drug from the parasitic digestive vacuole, decreasing the drug concentration. Resistance has however been shown to be reversible by compounds that can bind to the protein. Methods: In silico screening for chloroquine analogues was done using SwissSimilarity, SWISSADME, SwissTargetPrediction, Pubchem sketcher, Chimera and Avogadro tools to predict pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profiles of the selected analogues. Results: About 20 compounds with a similarity index of > 95% were obtained from the ZINC database. In total, 12 of the 20 compounds showed a higher binding affinity to the mutant pfCRT protein. Overall, four of the 12 had a binding affinity less than -8.0 compared to -7.0 for chloroquine. Compound ZINC01596768 had the greatest binding strength at -8.3. The other analogues were ZINC38050614, ZINC38050617, and ZINC38050615 with binding interaction strengths of -8.0, -8.2 and -8.2 respectively. Pharmacokinetic profile prediction showed all 12 compounds inhibited the enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, followed the Lipinski rules, had a high GI absorption, were permeant to the blood brain barrier, had no alerts on the PAINS criteria and had violated the rule of XLOGP3 > 3.5 in lead likeness. Compounds ZINC38050614, ZINC38050617, and ZINC38050615 were predicted to be substrates of P-glycoprotein. The synthetic accessibility score for the twelve compounds were below 3.07. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that the compounds ZINC01596768, ZINC38050614, ZINC38050617, and ZINC38050615 were potential candidates that could be tested and developed as co-formulations of chloroquine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Rice husk and melaleuca biochar additions reduce soil CH4 and N2O emissions and increase soil physicochemical properties [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biochar is a promising material in mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from paddy fields due to its remarkable structural properties. Rice husk biochar (RhB) and melaleuca biochar (MB) are amendment materials that could be used to potentially reduce emissions in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). However, their effects on CH4 and N2O emissions and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We conducted a field experiment using biochar additions to the topsoil layer (0-20 cm). Five treatments comprising 0 t ha-1 (CT0); 5 t ha-1 (RhB5) and 10 t ha-1 (RhB10), and 5 t ha-1 (MB5) and 10 t ha-1 (MB10) were designed plot-by-plot (20 m2) in triplicates. Results: The results showed that biochar application from 5 to 10 t ha-1 significantly decreased cumulative CH4 (24.2-28.0%, RhB; 22.0-14.1%, MB) and N2O (25.6-41.0%, RhB; 38.4–56.4%, MB) fluxes without a reduction in grain yield. Increasing the biochar application rate further did not decrease significantly total CH4 and N2O fluxes but was seen to significantly reduce the global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scale GWP in the RhB treatments. Biochar application improved soil Eh but had no effects on soil pH. Whereas CH4 flux correlated negatively with soil Eh (P < 0.001; r2 = 0.552, RhB; P < 0.001; r2 = 0.502, MB). Ameliorating soil aeration and functions by adding RhB and MB resulted in improving soil physicochemical properties, especially significant SOM and AN boosting, which indicate better soil health, structure, and fertility. Conclusions: Biochar supplementation significantly reduced CH4 and N2O fluxes and improved soil mineralization and physicochemical properties toward beneficial for rice plants. The results suggest that the optimal combination of biochar-application rates and effective water-irrigation techniques for soil types in the MD should be further studied in future works.

     alt="Cross-hierarchical plasticity of corticofugal projections to dLGN after neonatal monocular enucleation"/>
<p>In this study, the effect of monocular enucleation (MoE) in the development of the first-order visual thalamic nucleus, dLGN, was examined. We reported by microarray analysis a transcriptionally immature dLGN after early MoE. Additionally, focusing on layer 5 axonal projections, we demonstrated by viral tracing that layer 5 fibers in the enucleated dLGN originate from the primary visual cortex and not from the primary somatosensory cortex. Finally, we showed that layer 5 axons reorganize while innervating the enucleated dLGN and form aberrant synapses that persist until adulthood, indicating the presence of a permanent cross-hierarchical cortico-thalamic plasticity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perception is the result of interactions between the sensory periphery, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Inputs from the retina project to the first-order dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which projects to the primary visual cortex (V1). In return, the cortex innervates the thalamus. While layer 6 projections innervate all thalamic nuclei, cortical layer 5 neurons selectively project to the higher order lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and not to dLGN. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of layer 5 (Rbp4-Cre+) projections rewires to dLGN after monocular or binocular enucleation in young postnatal mice. However, the exact cortical regional origin of these projections was not fully determined, and it remained unclear whether these changes persisted into adulthood. In this study, we report gene expression changes observed in the dLGN after monocular enucleation at birth using microarray, qPCR at P6, and in situ hybridization at P8. We report that genes that are normally enriched in dLGN, but not LP during development are preferentially downregulated in dLGN following monocular enucleation. Comparisons with developmental gene expression patters in dLGN suggest more immature and delayed gene expression in enucleated dLGN. Combined tracing and immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that the induced layer 5 fibers that innervate enucleated dLGN originate from putative primary visual cortex and they retain increased VGluT1+ synapse formation into adulthood. Our results indicate a new form of plasticity when layer 5 driver input takes over the innervation of an originally first-order thalamic nucleus after early sensory deficit.</p>

                Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, characterized by systemic inflammation, joint destruction and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is used as the primary treatment for RA patients. However, the response to MTX therapy is highly varied and difficult to predict. This study sought to determine the role of MTX by measuring the MTX polyglutamate 3 (MTX-PG3) levels and the disease activity score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) of RA patients. Method: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Rheumatology Polyclinic of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. Thirty-four patients with RA were included and followed up to 12 weeks. The RA patients were treated with MTX 10 mg per week and an increased dose of 5 mg per week every month. DAS28-CRP and MTX-PG3 level were assessed at week 8 and 12. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between MTX-PG3 and DAS28-CRP. Result: A total of 34 RA patients were followed and the MTX was well tolerated in which no increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were observed. The mean scores of DAS28-CRP decreased following the MTX-treatment: 3.93, 3.22 and 2.82 at week 0, 8 and 12, respectively. In contrast, the median concentration of MTX-PG3 increased from week 8 to week 12 followed by increasing the dose of MTX. Our analysis suggested there was a moderate positive correlation between MTX-PG3 levels and DAS28-CRP score at week 8 and week 12 post-MTX treatment. Conclusion: The level of MTX-PG3 is correlated with DAS28-CRP score suggesting that MTX-PG3 could be used as an indicator to assess the disease activity in RA patients. Nevertheless, a prospective study with a higher number of patients is needed to confirm this finding.

<p>Flavonoids slow down the death of photoreceptors in retinitis pigmentosa caused by the P23H rhodopsin mutation by stabilizing the structural conformation of the receptor mutant and decreasing the cellular stress response.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The balanced homeostasis of the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), rhodopsin (Rho), is required for vision. Misfolding mutations in Rho cause photoreceptor death, leading to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and consequently blindness. With no cure currently available, the development of efficient therapy for RP is an urgent need. Pharmacological supplementation with molecular chaperones, including flavonoids, improves stability, folding, and membrane targeting of the RP Rho mutants in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that flavonoids by binding to P23H Rho and enhancing its conformational stability could mitigate detrimental effects of this mutation on retinal health. In this work, we evaluated the pharmacological potential of two model flavonoids, quercetin and myricetin, by using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models of P23H Rho. Our computational analysis showed that quercetin could interact within the orthosteric binding pocket of P23H Rho and shift the conformation of its N-terminal loop toward the wild type (WT)-like state. Quercetin added to the NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing P23H Rho increased the stability of this receptor and improved its function. Systemic administration of quercetin to P23H Rho knock-in mice substantially improved retinal morphology and function, which was associated with an increase in levels of Rho and cone opsins. In addition, treatment with quercetin resulted in downregulation of the UPR signaling and oxidative stress-related markers. This study unravels the pharmacological potential of quercetin to slow down the progression of photoreceptor death in Rho-related RP and highlights its prospective as a lead compound to develop a novel therapeutic remedy to counter RP pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Hallucinogenic drugs and their potential for treating fear‐related disorders: Through the lens of fear extinction</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fear-related disorders, mainly phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, are highly prevalent, debilitating disorders that pose a significant public health problem. They are characterized by aberrant processing of aversive experiences and dysregulated fear extinction, leading to excessive expression of fear and diminished quality of life. The gold standard for treating fear-related disorders is extinction-based exposure therapy (ET), shown to be ineffective for up to 35% of subjects. Moreover, ET combined with traditional pharmacological treatments for fear-related disorders, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, offers no further advantage to patients. This prompted the search for ways to improve ET outcomes, with current research focused on pharmacological agents that can augment ET by strengthening fear extinction learning. Hallucinogenic drugs promote reprocessing of fear-imbued memories and induce positive mood and openness, relieving anxiety and enabling the necessary emotional engagement during psychotherapeutic interventions. Mechanistically, hallucinogens induce dynamic structural and functional neuroplastic changes across the fear extinction circuitry and temper amygdala's hyperreactivity to threat-related stimuli, effectively mitigating one of the hallmarks of fear-related disorders. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of hallucinogens' potential to alleviate symptoms of fear-related disorders by focusing on their effects on fear extinction and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We overview both preclinical and clinical studies and emphasize the advantages of hallucinogenic drugs over current first-line treatments. We highlight 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and ketamine as the most effective therapeutics for fear-related disorders and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for their potency with implications for improving hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Personalizing deep brain stimulation using advanced imaging sequences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>With a growing appreciation for interindividual anatomical variability and patient-specific brain connectivity, advanced imaging sequences offer the opportunity to directly visualize anatomical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating their clinical utility, however, has hindered their broad implementation in clinical practice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences, the present study identified a thalamic hypointensity that holds promise as a visual marker in DBS.</p>
<p>To validate the clinical utility of the identified hypointensity we retrospectively analyzed 65 patients (26 female, mean age: 69.1 ± 12.7 years) who underwent DBS in the treatment of essential tremor. We characterized its neuroanatomical substrates and evaluated the hypointensity's ability to predict clinical outcome using stimulation volume modeling and voxel-wise mapping. Finally, we determined whether the hypointensity marker could predict symptom improvement on a patient-specific level.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Anatomical characterization suggested that the identified hypointensity constituted the terminal part of the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract. Overlap between DBS stimulation volumes and the hypointensity in standard space significantly correlated with tremor improvement (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, p = 0.017) and distance to hotspots previously reported in the literature (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, p = 7.9e-4). In contrast, the amount of variance explained by other anatomical atlas structures was reduced. When accounting for interindividual neuroanatomical variability, the predictive power of the hypointensity increased further (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, p = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings introduce and validate a novel imaging-based marker attainable from FGATIR sequences that has the potential to personalize and inform targeting and programming in DBS for essential tremor.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Burrowing deeper to uncover the genetic architecture of behavioral evolution</a></h4>

              
                Allele-specific expression analysis of hybrid mice provides new insights into the genetic substrates of behavioral evolution. As a complement to QTL mapping, this approach, described by Hu et al. in this issue of Cell Reports, holds promise for identifying causative regulatory loci that influence species-specific behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">cis-Regulatory changes in locomotor genes are associated with the evolution of burrowing behavior</a></h4>

              
                Hu et al. find that burrowing behavior alters allele-specific gene expression in F1 hybrids of two deer mouse species that dig long versus short burrows. Genes for which burrowing upregulates the allele from longer-burrowing parents often affect locomotor coordination and are linked to genomic regions associated with burrow-length variation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Redox regulation of age-associated defects in generation and maintenance of T cell self-tolerance and immunity to foreign antigens</a></h4>

              
                Age-associated thymic dysfunctions increase susceptibility to infection by diminishing T cell generation and may also impair T cell tolerance. Hester et al. demonstrate age-associated declines in tolerance induction, including impaired tolerance to an atherosclerosis autoantigen. Catalase overexpression delays thymic atrophy and mitigates declines in influenza-specific T cells, but does not rescue impaired central tolerance.

                Morrison et al. show that genetic loss or pharmacological suppression of AMPK α2-S345 phosphorylation promotes accumulation of AMPK at lysosomes, a major cellular location for AMPK activation, and inhibits cell proliferation under nutrient stress conditions. Inhibiting AMPK α2-S345 phosphorylation could be a therapeutic strategy to treat certain cancers.

                Activated macrophages rely on aerobic glycolysis when mitochondrial oxidation is inhibited. Li et al. show that blocking citrate export inactivates HIF-1α-targeted genes through histone deacetylation, metabolically restraining aerobic glycolysis and inflammatory responses. Irg1 induction is controlled by HIF-1α, and blocking the Irg1/itaconate shunt ensures metabolic flux to improve mitochondrial oxidation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Input rate encoding and gain control in dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Using repetitive activation of multiple spines distributed along a dendritic branch in neocortical pyramidal neurons, Dembrow and Spain demonstrate that supralinear dendritic boosting depends upon the combined activation rate of spines along a dendritic branch. A rate-based model suggests that such supralinear integration provides amplification of slow network oscillations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">VIP interneurons regulate olfactory bulb output and contribute to odor detection and discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Wang et al. identify a population of VIP interneurons that form monosynaptic GABAergic inhibitory connections with mitral cells in the olfactory bulb and play critical roles in odor processing and olfactory behaviors.
