              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regional opportunities for tundra conservation in the next 1000 years</a></h4>

              
                The biodiversity of tundra areas in northern high latitudes is threatened by invasion of forests under global warming. However, poorly understood nonlinear responses of the treeline ecotone mean the timing and extent of tundra losses are unclear, but policymakers need such information to optimize conservation efforts. Our individual-based model LAVESI, developed for the Siberian tundra-taiga ecotone, can help improve our understanding. Consequently, we simulated treeline migration trajectories until the end of the millennium, causing a loss of tundra area when advancing north. Our simulations reveal that the treeline follows climate warming with a severe, century-long time lag, which is overcompensated by infilling of stands in the long run even when temperatures cool again. Our simulations reveal that only under ambitious mitigation strategies (relative concentration pathway 2.6) will ∼30% of original tundra areas remain in the north but separated into two disjunct refugia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression differ between primates and rodents</a></h4>

              
                During deep anesthesia, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the brain alternates between bursts of activity and periods of relative silence (suppressions). The origin of burst-suppression and its distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats, the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded—predominantly the primary visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression in unconscious states.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Inhibition of Crmp1 Phosphorylation at Ser522 Ameliorates Motor Function and Neuronal Pathology in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Model Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects upper and lower motor neurons; however, its pathomechanism has not been fully elucidated. Using a comprehensive phosphoproteomic approach, we have identified elevated phosphorylation of Collapsin response mediator protein 1 (Crmp1) at serine 522 in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS model mice overexpressing a human superoxide dismutase mutant (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>). We investigated the effects of Crmp1 phosphorylation and depletion in <I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice using Crmp1<sup>S522A</sup> (Ser522-&gt;Ala) knock-in (<I>Crmp1<sup>k</sup></I><sup>i</sup><I><sup>/ki</sup></I>) mice in which the S522 phosphorylation site was abolished and <I>Crmp1</I> knock-out (<I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice, respectively. <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice showed longer latency to fall in a rotarod test while <I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice showed shorter latency compared with <I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. Survival was prolonged in <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice but not in <I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. In agreement with these phenotypic findings, residual motor neurons and innervated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were comparatively well-preserved in <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice without affecting microglial and astroglial pathology. Pathway analysis of proteome alterations showed that the sirtuin signaling pathway had opposite effects in <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> and <I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. Our study indicates that modifying CRMP1 phosphorylation is a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A genome-scale metabolic model of Cupriavidus necator H16 integrated with TraDIS and transcriptomic data reveals metabolic insights for biotechnological applications</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicole Pearcy, Marco Garavaglia, Thomas Millat, James P. Gilbert, Yoseb Song, Hassan Hartman, Craig Woods, Claudio Tomi-Andrino, Rajesh Reddy Bommareddy, Byung-Kwan Cho, David A. Fell, Mark Poolman, John R. King, Klaus Winzer, Jamie Twycross, Nigel P. Minton</p>

Exploiting biological processes to recycle renewable carbon into high value platform chemicals provides a sustainable and greener alternative to current reliance on petrochemicals. In this regard <i>Cupriavidus necator</i> H16 represents a particularly promising microbial chassis due to its ability to grow on a wide range of low-cost feedstocks, including the waste gas carbon dioxide, whilst also naturally producing large quantities of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) during nutrient-limited conditions. Understanding the complex metabolic behaviour of this bacterium is a prerequisite for the design of successful engineering strategies for optimising product yields. We present a genome-scale metabolic model (GSM) of <i>C</i>. <i>necator</i> H16 (denoted <i>i</i>CN1361), which is directly constructed from the BioCyc database to improve the readability and reusability of the model. After the initial automated construction, we have performed extensive curation and both theoretical and experimental validation. By carrying out a genome-wide essentiality screening using a Transposon-directed Insertion site Sequencing (TraDIS) approach, we showed that the model could predict gene knockout phenotypes with a high level of accuracy. Importantly, we indicate how experimental and computational predictions can be used to improve model structure and, thus, model accuracy as well as to evaluate potential false positives identified in the experiments. Finally, by integrating transcriptomics data with <i>i</i>CN1361 we create a condition-specific model, which, importantly, better reflects PHB production in <i>C</i>. <i>necator</i> H16. Observed changes in the omics data and <i>in-silico</i>-estimated alterations in fluxes were then used to predict the regulatory control of key cellular processes. The results presented demonstrate that <i>i</i>CN1361 is a valuable tool for unravelling the system-level metabolic behaviour of <i>C</i>. <i>necator</i> H16 and can provide useful insights for designing metabolic engineering strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring the unknown: An estimator and simulation study for assessing case reporting during epidemics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher I. Jarvis, Amy Gimma, Flavio Finger, Tim P. Morris, Jennifer A. Thompson, Olivier le Polain de Waroux, W. John Edmunds, Sebastian Funk, Thibaut Jombart</p>

The fraction of cases reported, known as ‘reporting’, is a key performance indicator in an outbreak response, and an essential factor to consider when modelling epidemics and assessing their impact on populations. Unfortunately, its estimation is inherently difficult, as it relates to the part of an epidemic which is, by definition, not observed. We introduce a simple statistical method for estimating reporting, initially developed for the response to Ebola in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 2018–2020. This approach uses transmission chain data typically gathered through case investigation and contact tracing, and uses the proportion of investigated cases with a known, reported infector as a proxy for reporting. Using simulated epidemics, we study how this method performs for different outbreak sizes and reporting levels. Results suggest that our method has low bias, reasonable precision, and despite sub-optimal coverage, usually provides estimates within close range (5–10%) of the true value. Being fast and simple, this method could be useful for estimating reporting in real-time in settings where person-to-person transmission is the main driver of the epidemic, and where case investigation is routinely performed as part of surveillance and contact tracing activities.

                Background: Participating in theater has been shown to be useful for reducing cognitive decline in older adults. This study focused on the social inclusion aspect of the performing arts and aimed to examine whether participation in the theater could help prevent dementia in older adults who are vulnerable to social exclusion. Methods: Our participants were 371 community-dwelling older adults who belonged to the Gold Arts Club organized by the Saitama Arts Theatre. The change in perceived stress levels after a month and a half of theater practice were compared between older adults with and without financial strain. Results: It was revealed that older adults with financial strain had a significantly greater reduction in perceived stress levels than those without financial strain after a month and a half of theater practice. Conclusions: Since stress is one of the risk factors for cognitive decline, the results of this study suggest that participation in theater may be an effective way of reducing cognitive decline associated with dementia in the older people who feel strained financially.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with producing a scientific publication during medical training: evidence from a cross-sectional study of 40 medical schools in Latin America [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scientific publication during medical training is key to promoting enduring cutting-edge knowledge. The promotion of science among medical students in Latin America is a multisectoral issue that is hampered by the lack of governmental knowledge to invest in national research, as well as by the lack of support from local universities. This study aims to determine the factors associated with the production of a scientific publication during medical training among Latin American medical students of local scientific societies. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional study conducted in 2016 that assessed the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) among medical students from 40 local scientific societies of medical students affiliated with FELSOCEM. Teams from each local scientific society surveyed self-reported scientific publications and explored their association with socioeconomic, academic, and research training conditions. We applied nested models to identify the covariates associated with self-reported scientific publication, obtaining a parsimonious mixed-effects multilevel model grouped by medical scientific society. Results: Of 11,587 participants, the prevalence of scientific publications increased in 36% among medical students affiliated to a Scientific Society of Medical Students [parsimonious prevalence ratio (pPR)=1.36, 95%CI=1.16–1.59], 51% among medical students with advanced English proficiency [pPR=1.51, 95%CI=1.21 – 1.87], 85% among medical students who attended a scientific writing skills course [pPR=1.85, 95%CI=1.59–2.15], 81% among medical students who use Sci-Hub [pPR=1.81, 95%CI=1.50–2.20], and 108% among medical students who have access to a pirated academic account [pPR=2.08, 95%CI=1.83–2.36]. Conclusions: Producing a scientific publication among medical students is associated with being affiliated to a scientific society of medical students, English proficiency, training in scientific writing, use of Sci-Hub, and pirated academic accounts. The results will help clinical educators and medical programs improve resources for training students in high-quality research

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Post-industrial context of cassava bagasse and trend of studies towards a sustainable industry: A scoping review – Part I [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The cassava starch industry is recognized as a source of negative externalities caused by the agroindustrial waste ‘cassava bagasse’. Even though options for bioconversion of cassava bagasse have been introduced, it is also true that hundreds of tons of this waste are produced annually with the consequent negative environmental impact. This agroindustrial context highlights the need for further research in technological proposals aimed at lowering the water contained in cassava bagasse. Methods: We report a scoping review of studies from 2010–2021 that mention the uses of cassava bagasse, as well as the technological options that have become effective for drying fruits and vegetables. The method used for selecting articles was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) method. Articles selected were taken from the databases of ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus and Springer. Results: This review highlights fruit and vegetable osmotic dehydration and drying studies assisted by the combination of emerging technologies of osmotic pressure, ultrasound, and electrical pulses. Studies that take advantage of cassava bagasse have focused on biotechnological products, animal and human food industry, and development of biofilms and biomaterials. Conclusions: In this review, we found 60 studies out of 124 that show the advantages of the residual components of cassava bagasse for the development of new products. These studies do not mention any potential use of bagasse fiber for post-industrial purposes, leaving this end products’ final use/disposal unaddressed. A viable solution is osmotic dehydration and drying assisted with electrical pulse and ultrasound that have been shown to improve the drying efficiency of fruits, vegetables and tubers. This greatly improves the drying efficiency of agro-industrial residues such as husks and bagasse, which in turn, directly impacts its post-industrial use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccine among adults in Saudi Arabia and their associated factors: A cross-sectional study conducted in 2021 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is of utmost importance for the elements that influence public compliance with vaccination against COVID-19 to be assessed, including misconceptions, rumors, and conspiracy theories. Hence, in this study, we aimed to estimate the distribution of the most common misconceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccines and their predictors in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: We distributed an online questionnaire to participants aged 18 years or older. The survey included two sections. The first section comprised questions related to participants’ demographic characteristics, level of education, and their sources of information about COVID-19. The second section assessed participants' perceptions regarding 11 of the most common misconceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccines, rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Using ordinal logistic regression, we conducted an evaluation of the relationships among different predictors including age, sex, educational level, and sources of information, as well as acceptance of misconceptions about vaccination.   Results: The most widely accepted misconception was that the COVID-19 vaccine had severe side effects, with 34.8% of participants believing this misinformation. Factors that were significantly associated with acceptance or non- acceptance of misconceptions were: 1) sex, with female respondents in this survey accepting rumors significantly more often than male respondents (p<0.001); 2) educational level, especially secondary school, was associated with a significantly lower acceptance of misconceptions (p=0.001). In total, 60.5% of participants used social media as their primary source of information, which was also a significant positive predictor of acceptance of misconceptions (p=0.034).   Conclusion: It is of critical importance to increase assurance regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, the issue most likely to involve misconceptions, and to address the elements that affect belief in rumors among the population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integration of single-cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF data characterises heterogeneity of rare cell subpopulations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods: We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results: We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions: This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling computer assisted audit techniques (CAATs) in enhancing the Indonesian public sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to examine public sector auditors' tendency to use somputer assisted audit techniques (CAATs) in managing their audit works. Methods: A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed to auditors working in the public sectors in Central Java, West Java, and East Java. From the total, 225 questionnaires were returned and completed.  The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Partial Least Square (PLS) were used to analyze the data. Results: The empirical findings reveal that performance expectation and facilitating conditions have encouraged auditors to use CAATs in their works. Further, there is a positive influence between the intention to use and CAATs audit. This implies that auditors with an intention will be more open to using the CAATs optimally in achieving effective and efficient work. The utilization of CAATs in public services needs to have strong support from the government and positive attitudes from the auditors as the users of the system. Conclusion: This study covers broad areas of Central Java, West Java, and East Java. Further, the findings add to the literature on emerging markets specifically for Indonesian government auditors' intention and appropriateness of using CAATs. The use of CAATs help to provide auditors information on the highest number of auditees involved in corruption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter metabolomics signature [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media metabolites in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO2; 5%O2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO2; atmospheric O2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. Metabolomic signatures between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. Metabolite levels showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the metabolite until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of metabolites were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of metabolites observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">IL1B gene variants, but not TNF, CXCL8, IL6 and IL10, modify the course of cystic fibrosis in Polish patients. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether selected polymorphic variants in genes from the inflammatory pathway can be predictors of pulmonary or digestive manifestation of cystic fibrosis, as well as of severity of lung disease. Materials and methods: Using pyrosequencing and sequencing we have genotyped 12 variants in TNF (rs361525, rs1800629), CXCL8 (rs4073, rs2227306, rs2227307, rs188378669), IL1B (rs16944, rs1143634, rs1142639, rs1143627), IL6 (rs1800795) and IL10 (rs1800896) genes in a cohort of 55 Polish patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis and controls. In our study group, a pulmonary manifestation of disease revealed 44 of subjects (80%), and digestive symptoms dominated in 11 (20%) of analyzed individuals. Severe lung dysfunction has occurred in 20 (36.4%) of patients. Results: We proved, that two promoter variants of IL1B, rs1143627 (c.-118G > A) and rs16944 (c.-598T > C) are presented significantly more often  in patients with severe character of lung disease compared to mild (82.5% vs. 62.8%, p-value 0.030, and 87.5% vs. 64.3%, p-value 0.008, respectively) in cystic fibrosis course. Haplotype AC formed by both changes had also a higher frequency (80%) in patients with severe course compared to the mild character (61.4%) of disease. However, the frequency of promoter variant TNF c.-308C > T (rs1800629) was presented at a significantly lower level in the patient’s group compared to healthy controls (2.7% vs. 15%, p-value 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus significantly correlated with the lower FEV1% in patients (p-value 0.01). Conclusions: Genetic variants, rs1143627 and rs16944, of IL1B are promising candidates as predictors of the severe character of lung disease in Polish patients with cystic fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An empirical examination of customer advocacy influenced by engagement behaviour and predispositions of FinTech customers in India [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extensive adoption and usage of emerging technologies furthered by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has reduced direct face to face communications. New FinTech (financial technology) apps and technologies are flooding the Indian digital payments market and competitors are striving hard to attract and retain their customers. Especially when customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) are digital in nature, it is essential to gauge the intrinsically driven customer motivations which drive a positive CEB. The objective of this paper was to empirically test the influence of customer-based antecedents such as emotions, moral identity, self-concept, communal focus, perceived cost and perceived benefits on non-transactional experiential customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) and CEB’s effect on customer advocacy in the FinTech industry. Methods: Data from 380 financial app users in south India were gathered by administering a survey that captured customer predispositions, CEBs, and customer advocacy. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using smart PLS (partial least squares) 3.0 was applied to test the theoretical model. Results: Results indicate that CEB fully mediates the relationship between self-concept and customer advocacy. The positive CEBs get formed through customer predispositions leading to referral/advocacy behaviours. Conclusions: This paper provides directions for FinTech practitioners, marketers, technologists, and academicians to devise marketing strategies customized to customer needs and factors. This is one of the first research studies to demonstrate and empirically validate the CEB model for the FinTech industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background - Many factors affect student performance such as the individual’s background, habits, absenteeism and social activities. Using these factors, corrective actions can be determined to improve their performance. This study looks into the effects of these factors in predicting student performance from a data mining approach. This study presents a data mining approach in identify significant factors and predict student performance, based on two datasets collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. Methods – In this study, two datasets  are augmented to increase the sample size by merging them.  Following that, data pre-processing is performed and the features are normalized with linear scaling to avoid bias on heavy weighted attributes.  The selected features are then assigned into four groups comprising of student background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features. Next, Boruta feature selection is performed to remove irrelevant features. Finally, the classification models of Support Vector Machine (SVM) , Naïve Bayes (NB) , and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  origins are designed and their performances evaluated. Results - The models were trained and evaluated on an integrated dataset comprising 1044 student records with 33 features, after feature selection. The classification was performed with SVM, NB and MLP with 60-40 and 50-50 train-test splits and 10-fold cross validation. GridSearchCV was applied to perform hyperparameter tuning. The performance metrics were accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score. SVM obtained the highest accuracy with scores of 77%, 80%, 91% and 90% on background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features respectively in 50-50 train-test splits for binary levels classification . SVM also obtained highest accuracy for five levels  classification  with 39%, 38%, 73% and 71% for the four categories respectively. The results show that the history of grades form significant influence on the student performance.

                Background: A relationship between oral microbiota and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been extensively studied. However, the relationship between oral commensal flora and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) remains to be established. In this observational study, we collected saliva from patients with COVID-19 and evaluated the relationship between ACE2 expression and Candida albicans as well as with selected gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella parvula). We investigated how this may be directly or indirectly involved in oral dysbiosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We included 23 hospitalized patients admitted to Universitas Indonesia Hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with six healthy participants serving as controls. Saliva and tongue surface swabs were collected from patients with diabetes (DG) and without diabetes (NDG) and subject controls. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) we assessed the mRNA expression of ACE2, the abundance of C. albicans, and the transcription levels of its biofilm-associated genes, agglutinin-like protein 3 (ALS3), hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1), and yeast-form wall protein 1 (YWP1). We also counted the relative proportion of the three selected gram-negative oral bacteria in saliva. All analyses were performed to determine the relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans and gram-negative bacteria. Results: ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in tongue swab samples than in saliva. However, no significant difference was observed between the patient groups. Conversely, DG patients had a significantly higher abundance of C. albicans in saliva compared to NDG patients and control group patients. The correlation and sensitivity/specificity relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans or the selected oral bacteria were also observed. Conclusions: The data show that ACE2 expression can be detected in saliva of patients with COVID-19 and its association with C. albicans and gram-negative oral bacteria might contribute toward developing an oral dysbiosis based predictor for prognosis of COVID-19 severity.

                Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global problem and it is encountered both in community and in-hospital patients. AKI has caused very significant damage to the health sector with high morbidity and mortality rates as well as a financial burden to the family. AKI contributes to a 3% incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Sepsis and hypovolemia-associated ischemia is the most common cause of AKI.  AKI has various risk factors, modes of presentation and outcomes. Also, the prevalence varies across the different populations. There is a paucity of data about the clinical profile of AKI in the eastern part of Nepal. This study aims to assess the age, comorbid conditions, the severity of AKI, mode of treatment, and outcome of patients with AKI admitted to the Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Nepal. Methods This is a cross-sectional analytical study conducted at a Nobel Medical College Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Nepal from July 2018 to June 2019 AD. Results In this study, 192 patients diagnosed with AKI were included. Male patients accounted for 52.7%. The mean age was 48.6±18.73 years. Most of the patients (74.5%) were below <60 years of age.  The average duration of hospital stay was 8 days. The common cause of AKI was sepsis in 71.9%. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was seen in 52.6% of patients. Most of the patients (41%) were at stage III AKI at the time of admission. Hemodialysis was done in 14.6% and 85.4% were managed conservatively. Average sessions of hemodialysis were 3.61. Complete recovery was seen in 69.8% of the patients. Conclusions We observed that early diagnosis, avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, and early, aggressive, and appropriate interventions result in improved patient outcomes. However late presentations of AKI have a higher hospital mortality rate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genome of the lepidopleurid chiton Hanleya hanleyi (Mollusca, Polyplacophora) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mollusca is the second most species-rich phylum and includes animals as disparate as octopuses, clams, and chitons. Dozens of molluscan genomes are available, but only one representative of the subphylum Aculifera, the sister taxon to all other molluscs, has been sequenced to date, hindering comparative and evolutionary studies. To facilitate evolutionary studies across Mollusca, we sequenced the genome of a second aculiferan mollusc, the lepidopleurid chiton Hanleya hanleyi (Bean 1844), using a hybrid approach combining Oxford Nanopore and Illumina reads. After purging redundant haplotigs and removing contamination from this 1.3% heterozygous genome, we produced a 2.5 Gbp haploid assembly (>4X the size of the other chiton genome sequenced to date) with an N50 of 65.0 Kbp. Despite a fragmented assembly, the genome is rather complete (92.0% of BUSCOs detected; 79.4% complete plus 12.6% fragmented). Remarkably, the genome has the highest repeat content of any molluscan genome reported to date (>66%). Our gene annotation pipeline predicted 69,284 gene models (92.9% of BUSCOs detected; 81.8% complete plus 11.1% fragmented) of which 35,362 were supported by transcriptome and/or protein evidence. Phylogenomic analysis recovered Polyplacophora sister to all other sampled molluscs with maximal support. The Hanleya genome will be a valuable resource for studies of molluscan biology with diverse potential applications ranging from evolutionary and comparative genomics to molecular ecology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thrombectomy vs Medical Management in Mild Strokes due to Large Vessel Occlusion: Exploratory Analysis from the EXTEND‐IA Trials and a Pooled International Cohort</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate functional and safety outcomes for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and mild neurological deficits, stratified by perfusion imaging mismatch.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Pooled cohort of patients with NIHSS&lt;6 and ICA, M1, M2 occlusions from EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-IA-TNK I/II RCTs and prospective data from 15 EVT centers from 10/2010 to 4/2020. RAPID software estimated ischemic core and mismatch. Patients receiving primary endovascular thrombectomy (EVT<sub>pri</sub>) were compared to those who received primary MM (MM<sub>pri</sub>), including those who deteriorated and received rescue EVT, in overall and PS matched cohorts. Patients were stratified by target mismatch (mismatch-ratio≥1.8 and mismatch-volume≥15cc). Primary outcome was functional independence (90-day mRS:0-2); Secondary outcomes included safety (sICH, neurological worsening, and mortality).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 540 patients, 286/540(53%) received EVT<sub>pri</sub> and demonstrated larger critically hypoperfused tissue (Tmax&gt;6s) volumes of (64[26-96]mL vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:40[14-76]mL, p&lt;0·001) and higher presentation NIHSS (4(2-5) vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:3(2-4), p&lt;0·001). Functional independence was similar (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:77·4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:75.6%, aOR:1.29,95%CI:0.82-2.03,p=0.27). EVT had worse safety: sICH (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:8.8% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:1.3%, p&lt;0.001) and neurological worsening (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:19.6% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:6.7%, p&lt;0.001). In 414(76.7%) with target mismatch, EVT was associated with improved functional independence (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:77·4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:72.7%, aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.01-2.81,p=0.048), whereas, there was a trend toward less favorable outcomes with primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:77·4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:83.3%, aOR:0.39,95%CI:0.12-1.34,p=0.13) without target mismatch, (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.06). Similar findings were observed in a PS matched subpopulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, EVT was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in mild strokes due to LVO, and sICH was increased. However, in patients with target mismatch profile, EVT was associated with increased functional independence. Perfusion imaging may be helpful to select mild stroke patients for EVT.</p>

     alt="Changes in the peripheral and central auditory performance in the elderly—A cross-sectional study"/>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the elderly. Our cross-sectional study examined pathophysiology of ARHL and provided evidence for impaired performance of all parts of the auditory system including central auditory processing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is due to a variety of lifetime damages to the auditory system and is characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, impaired speech understanding in noise and central sound processing deficits. Despite its commonness, the pathogenesis has not been completely clarified yet; especially the existence of an independent central ARHL component still remains controversial. We present the results of a cross-sectional topodiagnostic test battery study which aimed at separating aging- and hearing loss-related effects on all parts of the auditory system by current test procedures. Three groups of 30 participants each underwent extensive topodiagnostic test procedures (otoscopy, tympanometry, questionnaires, pure-tone audiometry, DPOAE threshold measurements, auditory brainstem response, central auditory discrimination tests, and speech-in-noise test). By comparing the results of the normally hearing young (18–26 years) and healthy control group, the normally hearing elderly group (60–80 years) and the hearing-impaired elderly group (60–80 years), we deduced aging and hearing loss-related effects on auditory performance. All measurements indicated a significant deterioration of auditory performance in the elderly, partly associated with aging and partly with age-related hearing loss. Our study thereby contributes to a multifocal concept of ARHL. All parts of the auditory system are impaired by aging, age-related hearing loss, or a combination of both. Further evidence for an independent central ARHL component, not attributable to peripheral hearing loss, is provided by the results of the central auditory discrimination test.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine rates of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT), door-to-needle (DTN) time, door-to-puncture(DTP) time, and functional outcome between patients with admission MRI versus CT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Observational cohort study of consecutive patients using a target trial design within the nationwide Swiss-Stroke-Registry from 01/2014 to 08/2020. Exclusion criteria included MRI contraindications, transferred patients, and unstable or frail patients. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression with multiple imputation was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for IVT, MT, DTN, DTP, and good functional outcome (mRS 0–2) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 11049 patients included (mean [SD] age, 71 [15] years; 4811 [44%] females; 69% ischemic stroke, 16% transient ischemic attack, 8% stroke mimics, 6% intracranial hemorrhage), 3741 (34%) received MRI and 7308 (66%) CT. Patients undergoing MRI had lower NIHSS (median [IQR] 2 [0–6] versus 4 [1–11]), and presented later after symptom onset (150 versus 123 min, <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Admission MRI was associated with: lower adjusted odds of IVT (aOR 0.83, 0.73–0.96), but not with MT (aOR 1.11, 0.93–1.34); longer adjusted DTN (+22 min [13–30]), but not with longer DTP times; and higher adjusted odds of favorable outcome (aOR 1.54, 1.30–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found an association of MRI with lower rates of IVT and a significant delay in DTN, but not in DTP and rates of MT. Given the delays in workflow metrics, prospective trials are needed to show that tissue-based benefits of baseline MRI compensate for the temporal benefits of CT.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson's disease (PD) in spite of being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (IPDGC, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (COURAGE-PD, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UKBB, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; AMP-PD, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, performed MAGMA gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (Beta= -0.054, SE = 0.022; <i>P</i> = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (h<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, SE = 0.035, <i>P</i> = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.</p>

                Schneider et al. develop a marker-free movement-tracking system for holistic 3D reconstruction. They combine this approach with virtual head fixation, which enables the removal of disturbing effects of movements on rat neuronal activity. This reveals a much larger fraction of paw-tuned neurons, which were previously masked by body posture tuning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4,6 sulfation regulates sympathetic nerve regeneration after myocardial infarction</a></h4>

              
                Sympathetic denervation of the heart following ischemia/reperfusion induced myocardial infarction (MI) is sustained by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar. Denervation predicts risk of sudden cardiac death in humans. Blocking CSPG signaling restores sympathetic axon outgrowth into the cardiac scar, decreasing arrhythmia susceptibility. Axon growth inhibition by CSPGs is thought to depend on the sulfation status of the glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) attached to the core protein. Tandem sulfation of CS-GAGs at the 4<sup>th</sup> (4S) and 6<sup>th</sup> (6S) positions of n-acetyl-galactosamine inhibits outgrowth in several types of neurons within the central nervous system, but it is not known if sulfation is similarly critical during peripheral nerve regeneration. We asked if CSPG sulfation prevented sympathetic axon outgrowth. Neurite outgrowth of dissociated rat sympathetic neurons across purified CSPGs is restored <i>in vitro</i> by reducing 4S with the 4-sulfatase enzyme Arylsulfatase-B (ARSB). Additionally, we co-cultured mouse cardiac scar tissue with mouse sympathetic ganglia <i>ex vivo</i> and found that reducing 4S with ARSB restored axon outgrowth to control levels. We examined levels of the enzymes responsible for adding and removing sulfation to CS-GAGs by western blot to determine if they were altered in the left ventricle after MI. We found that CHST15 (4S dependent 6-sulfotransferase) was upregulated, and ARSB was downregulated after MI. Increased CHST15 combined with decreased ARSB suggests a mechanism for production and maintenance of sulfated CSPGs in the cardiac scar. We altered tandem sulfated 4S,6S CS-GAGs <i>in vivo</i> by transient siRNA knockdown of <i>Chst15</i> and found that reducing 4S,6S restored Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive sympathetic nerve fibers in the cardiac scar and reduced arrhythmias using a mouse model of MI. Overall, our results suggest that modulating CSPG-sulfation after MI may be a therapeutic target to promote sympathetic nerve regeneration in the cardiac scar and reduce post-MI cardiac arrhythmias.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dcp2 C-terminal cis-binding elements control selective targeting of the decapping enzyme by forming distinct decapping complexes</a></h4>

              
                A single Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme targets diverse classes of yeast mRNAs for decapping-dependent 5' to 3' decay, but the molecular mechanisms controlling mRNA selectivity by the enzyme remain elusive. Through extensive genetic analyses we reveal that Dcp2 C-terminal domain <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements control decapping enzyme target specificity by orchestrating formation of distinct decapping complexes. Two Upf1-binding motifs direct the decapping enzyme to NMD substrates, a single Edc3-binding motif targets both Edc3 and Dhh1 substrates, and Pat1-binding leucine-rich motifs target Edc3 and Dhh1 substrates under selective conditions. Although it functions as a unique targeting component of specific complexes, Edc3 is a common component of multiple complexes. Scd6 and Xrn1 also have specific binding sites on Dcp2, allowing them to be directly recruited to decapping complexes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Upf1, Edc3, Scd6, and Pat1 function as regulatory subunits of the holo-decapping enzyme, controlling both its substrate specificity and enzymatic activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contractile force assessment methods for in vitro skeletal muscle tissues</a></h4>

              
                Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in measuring the contractile force (CF) of engineered muscle tissues to evaluate their functionality. However, there are still no standards available for selecting the most suitable experimental platform, measuring system, culture protocol, or stimulation patterns. Consequently, the high variability of published data hinders any comparison between different studies. We have identified that cantilever deflection, post deflection, and force transducers are the most commonly used configurations for CF assessment in 2D and 3D models. Additionally, we have discussed the most relevant emerging technologies that would greatly complement CF evaluation with intracellular and localized analysis. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the most significant advances in CF evaluation and its critical parameters. In order to compare contractile performance across experimental platforms, we have used the specific force (sF, kN/m<sup>2</sup>), CF normalized to the calculated cross-sectional area (CSA). However, this parameter presents a high variability throughout the different studies, which indicates the need to identify additional parameters and complementary analysis suitable for proper comparison. We propose that future contractility studies in skeletal muscle constructs report detailed information about construct size, contractile area, maturity level, sarcomere length, and, ideally, the tetanus-to-twitch ratio. These studies will hopefully shed light on the relative impact of these variables on muscle force performance of engineered muscle constructs. Prospective advances in muscle tissue engineering, particularly in muscle disease models, will require a joint effort to develop standardized methodologies for assessing CF of engineered muscle tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dnmt3a knockout in excitatory neurons impairs postnatal synapse maturation and increases the repressive histone modification H3K27me3</a></h4>

              
                Two epigenetic pathways of transcriptional repression, DNA methylation and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are known to regulate neuronal development and function. However, their respective contributions to brain maturation are unknown. We found that conditional loss of the <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferase <i>Dnmt3a</i> in mouse excitatory neurons altered expression of synapse-related genes, stunted synapse maturation, and impaired working memory and social interest. At the genomic level, loss of <i>Dnmt3a</i> abolished postnatal accumulation of CG and non-CG DNA methylation, leaving adult neurons with an unmethylated, fetal-like epigenomic pattern at ~222,000 genomic regions. The PRC2-associated histone modification, H3K27me3, increased at many of these sites. Our data support a dynamic interaction between two fundamental modes of epigenetic repression during postnatal maturation of excitatory neurons, which together confer robustness on neuronal regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Osteogenic growth peptide is a potent anti-inflammatory and bone preserving hormone via cannabinoid receptor type 2</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid system consists mainly of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide, as well as cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2). Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that a circulating peptide previously identified as Osteogenic Growth Peptide (OGP) maintains a bone-protective CB2 tone. We tested OGP activity in mouse models and cells, and in human osteoblasts. We show that the OGP effects on osteoblast proliferation, osteoclastogenesis, and macrophage inflammation <i>in vitro</i>, as well as rescue of ovariectomy-induced bone loss and prevention of ear edema <i>in vivo</i> are all abrogated by genetic or pharmacological ablation of CB2. We also demonstrate that OGP binds at CB2 and may act as both an agonist and positive allosteric modulator in the presence of other lipophilic agonists. In premenopausal women, OGP circulating levels significantly decline with age. In adult mice, exogenous administration of OGP completely prevented age-related bone loss. Our findings suggest that OGP attenuates age-related bone loss by maintaining a skeletal CB2 tone. Importantly, they also indicate the occurrence of an endogenous peptide that signals via CB2 receptor in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modified viral-genetic mapping reveals local and global connectivity relationships of ventral tegmental area dopamine cells</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA<sup>DA</sup>) are critical for a variety of motivated behaviors. These cells receive synaptic inputs from over 100 anatomically-defined brain regions, which enables control from a distributed set of inputs across the brain. Extensive efforts have been made to map inputs to VTA cells based on neurochemical phenotype and output site. However, all of these studies have the same fundamental limitation that inputs local to the VTA cannot be properly assessed due to non-Cre-dependent uptake of EnvA-pseudotyped virus. Therefore, the quantitative contribution of local inputs to the VTA, including GABAergic, DAergic, and serotonergic, is not known. Here, I used a modified viral-genetic strategy that enables examination of both local as well as long-range inputs to VTA<sup>DA</sup> cells in mice. I found that nearly half of the total inputs to VTA<sup>DA</sup> cells are located locally, revealing a substantial portion of inputs that have been missed by previous analyses. The majority of inhibition to VTA<sup>DA</sup> cells arises from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, with large contributions from the VTA and the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to receiving inputs from VTA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, DA neurons are connected with other DA neurons within the VTA as well as the nearby retrorubal field. Lastly, I show that VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons receive inputs from distributed serotonergic neurons throughout the midbrain and hindbrain, with the majority arising from the dorsal raphe. My study highlights the importance of using the appropriate combination of viral-genetic reagents to unmask the complexity of connectivity relationships to defined cells in the brain.

                Controlling neuronal activity with high spatial resolution using multifunctional and minimally invasive neural interfaces constitutes an important step towards developments in neuroscience and novel treatments for brain diseases. While infrared neuromodulation is an emerging technology for controlling the neuronal circuitry, it lacks soft implantable monolithic interfaces capable of simultaneously delivering light and recording electrical signals from the brain while being mechanically brain-compatible. Here, we have developed a soft fibre-based device based on high-performance thermoplastics which are >100-fold softer than silica glass. The presented fibre-implant is capable of safely neuromodulating the brain activity in localized cortical domains by delivering infrared laser pulses in the 2 m spectral region while recording electrophysiological signals. Action and local field potentials were recorded in vivo in adult rats while immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue indicated limited microglia and monocytes response introduced by the fibre and the infrared pulses. We expect our devices to further enhance infrared neuromodulation as a versatile approach for fundamental research and clinically translatable therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroanatomical and Functional Consequences of Oxytocin Treatment at Birth</a></h4>

              
                Birth is a critical period for the developing brain, a time when surging hormone levels help prepare the fetal brain for the tremendous physiological changes it must accomplish upon entry into the extrauterine world. A number of obstetrical conditions warrant manipulations of these hormones at the time of birth, but we know little of their possible consequences on the developing brain. One of the most notable birth signaling hormones is oxytocin, which is administered to roughly 50% of laboring women in the United States prior to / during delivery. Previously, we found evidence for behavioral, epigenetic, and neuroendocrine consequences in adult prairie vole offspring following maternal oxytocin treatment immediately prior to birth. Here, we examined the neurodevelopmental consequences in adult prairie vole offspring following maternal oxytocin treatment immediately. Control prairie voles and those exposed to 0.25 mg/kg oxytocin were scanned as adults using anatomical and functional MRI, with neuroanatomy and brain function analyzed as voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional connectivity, respectively. Overall, anatomical differences brought on by oxytocin treatment, while widespread, were generally small, while differences in functional connectivity, particularly among oxytocin-exposed males, were larger. Analyses of functional connectivity based in graph theory revealed that oxytocin-exposed males in particular showed markedly increased connectivity throughout the brain and across several parameters, including closeness and degree. These results are interpreted in the context of the organizational effects of oxytocin exposure in early life and these findings add to a growing literature on how the perinatal brain is sensitive to hormonal manipulations at birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin activity in the Paraventricular and Supramammillary Nuclei of the Hypothalamus is Essential for Social Recognition Memory in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin plays an important role in modulating social recognition memory. However, the direct implication of oxytocin neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and their downstream hypothalamic targets in regulating the short- and long-term forms of social recognition memory is not fully understood. In this study, we employed a chemogenetic approach to specifically target the activity of PVH oxytocin neurons in rats and found that silencing these neurons impaired both long and short-term social recognition memory. We combined viral mediated fluorescent labeling of oxytocin neurons with immunohistochemical techniques and identified the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus, as a novel target of PVH oxytocinergic axonal projections. Furthermore, we used multiplex fluorescence in-situ hybridization and found that oxytocin receptors in the SuM are predominantly in excitatory neurons. Finally, we examined the role of the SuM in social recognition memory, by using a highly selective antagonist to block oxytocin receptors in the SuM. We found that oxytocin activity in the SuM is necessary for the formation of long- and short-term social recognition memory. This study discovered a previously undescribed role for the SuM in regulating social recognition memory via oxytocin signaling and reinforces the specific role of PVH oxytocin neurons in regulating social recognition memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lasting consequences on physiology and social behavior following cesarean delivery in prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Cesarean delivery is associated with diminished plasma levels of several birth-signaling hormones, such as oxytocin and vasopressin. These same hormones have been previously shown to exert organizational effects when acting in early life. For example, our previous work found a broadly gregarious phenotype in prairie voles exposed to oxytocin at birth. Meanwhile, cesarean delivery has been previously associated with changes in social behavior and metabolic processes related to oxytocin and vasopressin. In the present study, we investigated the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of cesarean delivery in prairie voles. After cross-fostering, vole pups delivered either via cesarean or vaginal delivery were studied throughout development. Cesarean-delivered pups responded to isolation differently in terms of their vocalizations, huddled in less cohesive groups under warmed conditions, and shed less heat. As young adults, we observed no differences in anxiety-like or alloparental behavior. However, in adulthood, cesarean-delivered voles of both sexes failed to form partner preferences with opposite sex conspecifics. In a follow-up study, we replicated this deficit in partner-preference formation among cesarean-delivered voles and were able to normalize pair-bonding behavior by treating cesarean-delivered vole pups with oxytocin (0.25 mg/kg) at delivery. We have thus far detected minor differences in regional oxytocin receptor expression within the brains of cesarean-delivered voles. These results speak to the possibility of unintended developmental consequences of a birth mode which currently accounts for 32.9% of deliveries in the U.S. and suggest that further research should be directed at whether hormone replacement at delivery could avert such effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical role for touch neurons in a skin-brain pathway for stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                Social touch can act as a stress buffer, reducing behavioral and physiological responses to stressful scenarios. However, skin-brain touch pathways that promote stress resilience remain unknown. Here, we show that mice with an early life genetic ablation of Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons display stress vulnerability behaviors in adulthood. Chemogenetic activation of these touch neurons reduced corticosterone levels under mild acute stress conditions. In addition, whole-brain c-Fos activity mapping while chemogenetically turning on these neurons uncovered differential neural activity patterns in brain areas relevant to somatosensation, reward, and affect. To gain mechanistic insight into this skin-brain touch pathway for stress susceptibility, we used multi-circuit neurophysiological recordings across seven brain regions at baseline and after stress in mice that had Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons ablated in early life. Interestingly, the Mrgprb4-lineage neuron- ablated mice have alterations in local field potential phase directionality and power in the theta frequencies in mesolimbic reward regions, which may underlie our observed stress susceptibility phenotype. Together, these studies revealed that sensory neurons in the skin engage networks across the brain to promote stress resilience.

                Functional and effective connectivity methods are essential to study the complex information flow in brain networks underlying human cognition. Only recently have connectivity methods begun to emerge that make use of the full multidimensional information contained in patterns of brain activation, rather than univariate summary measures of these patterns. To date, these methods have mostly been applied to fMRI data, and no method allows vertex-vertex transformation with the temporal specificity of EEG/MEG data. Here, we introduce time-lagged multidimensional pattern connectivity (TL-MDPC) as a novel bivariate functional connectivity metric for EEG/MEG research. TL-MDPC estimates the vertex-to-vertex transformations among multiple brain regions and across different latency ranges. It determines how well patterns in ROI X at time point t_x can linearly predict patterns of ROI Y at time point t_y. In the present study, we use simulations to demonstrate TL-MDPC increased sensitivity to multidimensional effects compared to a univariate approach across realistic choices of number of trials and signal-to-noise ratio. We applied TL-MDPC, as well as its univariate counterpart, to an existing dataset varying the depth of semantic processing of visually presented words by contrasting a semantic decision and a lexical decision task. TL-MDPC detected significant effects beginning very early on, and showed stronger task modulations than the univariate approach, suggesting that it is capable of capturing more information. With TL-MDPC only, we observed rich connectivity between core semantic representation (left and right anterior temporal lobes) and semantic control (inferior frontal gyrus and posterior temporal cortex) areas with greater semantic demands. TL-MDPC is a promising approach to identify multidimensional connectivity patterns, typically missed by univariate approaches.

                The neural computational power is determined by neuroenergetics, but how and which energy substrates are allocated to various forms of memory engram is unclear. To solve this question, we asked whether neuronal fueling by glucose or lactate scales differently upon increasing neural computation and cognitive loads. Here, using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, cognitive tasks and mathematical modeling, we show that both glucose and lactate are involved in engram formation, with lactate supporting long-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high stimulation load activity patterns and high attentional load in cognitive tasks, and glucose being sufficient for less demanding neural computation and learning tasks. Overall, these results demonstrate that glucose and lactate metabolisms are differentially engaged in neuronal fueling depending on the complexity of the activity-dependent plasticity and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Involvement of nucleus accumbens D2-MSN projections to the ventral pallidum in anxious-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial brain region for emotionally-relevant behaviors. The NAc is mainly composed of medium spiny neurons (MSN) expressing either dopamine receptor D1 (D1-MSNs) or D2 (D2-MSNs). D1-MSNs project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral pallidum (VP), while D2-MSNs project only to the VP. In this work, we selectively manipulated D1-MSN projections to the VP and VTA, and D2-MSN projections to the VP during classical anxiety behavioral paradigms in naive mice. We found that optogenetic activation of D1-MSN to VP or VTA did not trigger significant anxious-like behaviors. Interestingly, optical activation of D2-MSN-VP projections significantly increased anxious-like behavior in all of the tests performed. This phenotype was associated with a decrease in the activity of VP putative GABAergic neurons. Importantly, pre-treating D2-MSN-VP animals with the GABA modulator diazepam prevented the optically-triggered anxious-like behavior. Overall, our results suggest that D2-MSN-VP projections contribute for the development of anxious-like behavior, through modulation of GABAergic activity in the VP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An iPSC library from a family with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease caused by the E200K mutation</a></h4>

              
                Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD) caused by the E200K mutation of the prion protein (PrP) is the most common subtype of genetic prion disease. We have generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a family with the E200K mutation, comprised of 11 carriers and 11 non-carriers. A comparison of neurons derived from E200K iPSCs to those from non-carriers revealed the presence of several disease-relevant phenotypes. Although traditional proteinase K resistant, detergent-insoluble, and seed-competent PrP was not observed, neurons derived from E200K carriers were found to contain thioflavin S positive PrP puncta. At the postsynaptic site, the co-localization of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and post synaptic density 95 colocalization was disrupted in neurons expressing E200K PrP. Our study shows that iPSC-derived neurons, which express endogenous levels of mutant PrP in a human neuronal context, can model certain aspects of human prion disease, offering a powerful platform for investigating pathological mechanisms and testing potential therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tle4 controls both developmental acquisition and postnatal maintenance of corticothalamic projection neuron identity</a></h4>

              
                Identities, circuitry, and function of distinct neuron subtypes are specified during embryonic development, then maintained during postnatal maturation and potential plasticity. Mechanisms that control early acquisition of neuron subtype identities, encompassing circuitry and function, in the cerebral cortex have become increasingly understood. However, mechanisms controlling maintenance of identity, and accompanying regulation of plasticity, are largely unexplored and unknown. Here, we identify two novel functions of the co-repressor Tle4 in both acquisition and maintenance of neuron subtype identity of corticothalamic projection neurons. Embryonically, Tle4 promotes acquisition of corticothalamic molecular and cellular identity, and blocks emergence of core characteristics of subcerebral / corticospinal projection neuron identity, including morphology, gene expression, axonal connectivity, and circuitry. Postnatally, Tle4 is required to maintain corticothalamic molecular and projection identity during circuit maturation, avoiding potentially disruptive plasticity, but also limiting potentially beneficial plasticity. We identify an epigenetic mechanism by which TLE4 controls the activation state of loci regulating the level of Fezf2 expression by corticothalamic neurons during embryonic and postnatal development. This mechanism contributes importantly to distinction of cortical output (corticofugal) subtypes, and ensures appropriate maturation and maintenance of CThPN.

	<p>Social distancing norms have been promoted after the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we tested interpersonal space (IPS) in 107 subjects through a reaching-comfort distance estimation task. In the main experiment, subjects had to estimate the comfort and reach space between an avatar wearing or not wearing a face mask. We found that IPS was greater between avatars not wearing a mask with respect to stimuli with the mask on, while reaching space was not modulated. IPS increment in the NoMask condition with respect to the Mask condition correlated with anxiety traits, as shown with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, rather than with transient aspects related to the pandemic situation. In the control experiment, the avatars with a mask were removed to further explore the conditioning effect provided by the presence of the facial protection in the main experiment. We found a significant difference comparing this condition with the same condition of the main experiment, namely, the distances kept between avatars not wearing a mask in the main experiment were greater than those between the same stimuli in the control experiment. This showed a contextual adaptation of IPS when elements related to the actual pandemic situation were relevant. Additionally, no significant differences were found between the control experiment and the Mask condition of the main experiment, suggesting that participants had internalized social distancing norms and wearing a mask has become the new normal. Our results highlight the tendency of people in underestimating the risk of contagion when in the presence of someone wearing a mask.</p>

	<p>This article presents DIANA, a new, process-oriented model of human auditory word recognition, which takes as its input the acoustic signal and can produce as its output word identifications and lexicality decisions, as well as reaction times. This makes it possible to compare its output with human listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; behavior in psycholinguistic experiments. DIANA differs from existing models in that it takes more available neuro-physiological evidence on speech processing into account. For instance, DIANA accounts for the effect of ambiguity in the acoustic signal on reaction times following the Hick&amp;amp;ndash;Hyman law and it interprets the acoustic signal in the form of spectro-temporal receptive fields, which are attested in the human superior temporal gyrus, instead of in the form of abstract phonological units. The model consists of three components: activation, decision and execution. The activation and decision components are described in detail, both at the conceptual level (in the running text) and at the computational level (in the Appendices). While the activation component is independent of the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s task, the functioning of the decision component depends on this task. The article also describes how DIANA could be improved in the future in order to even better resemble the behavior of human listeners.</p>

	<p>Adiponectin exhibits pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective ones. Although some studies have documented brain expression in different rodent models of its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, their global distribution remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrated that both AdipoR are widely distributed in the brains of adult mice. Furthermore, by double immunostaining studies, we showed that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are mainly expressed in neurons and blood vessels. Then, considering the wide distribution of both receptors and the neuroprotective effects of adiponectin, we tested the therapeutic effect of a single injection of the adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRON (5 mg.kg&amp;amp;minus;1), 24 h after stroke in a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion technique (MCAO). Under our experimental conditions, we demonstrated that AdipoRON did not modulate the infarct volume, cell death, neuroinflammatory parameters including microglia activation and oxidative stress. This study suggests that a protocol based on multiple injections of AdipoRON at a higher dose after MCAO could be considered to promote the therapeutic properties of AdipoRON on the brain repair mechanism and recovery.</p>

	<p>Chronic low-level blast exposure has been linked with neurological alterations and traumatic brain injury (TBI) biomarkers. Impaired smooth-pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are often associated with TBI. The purpose of this study was to determine whether long-term operators of low-level blast exposure or high-caliber weapons use displayed oculomotor behaviors that differed from controls. Twenty-six members of an elite military unit performed a computerized oculomotor testing task using an eye tracker and completed a concussion assessment questionnaire. The participants were split into a blast exposure group and control group. The blast exposure group had a history of exposure to low-level blasts or high-caliber weapon use. The results revealed significant differences in SPEM, saccades, and fixations between the blast exposure group and control group. The blast exposure group&amp;amp;rsquo;s eye movements were slower, stopped at more frequent points when following a target, traveled further from the target in terms of both speed and direction, and showed higher rates of variation and inefficiency. Poor oculomotor behavior correlated with a higher symptom severity on the concussion assessment questionnaire. Military special operators exposed to long-term low-level blasts or high-caliber weapons usage displayed an impaired oculomotor behavior in comparison to controls. These findings further our understanding of the impact of long-term low-level blast exposure on the oculomotor behavior of military special operators and may inform practical implications for military training.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence on associations of lifestyle factors with Alzheimer's pathology and cognition are ambiguous, potentially because they rarely addressed interrelationships of factors and sex effects. While considering these aspects, we examined the relationships of lifestyle factors with brain amyloid burden and cognition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 178 cognitively normal individuals (women, 49%; 65.0 [7.6] years) and 54 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (women, 35%; 71.3 [8.3] years) enrolled in a prospective study of volunteers who completed <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography. Using structural equation modeling, we examined associations between latent constructs representing metabolic/vascular risk, physical activity, and cognitive activity with global amyloid burden and cognitive performance. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of sex in this model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, higher cognitive activity was associated with better cognitive performance and higher physical activity was associated with lower amyloid burden. The latter association was weakened to a non-significant level after excluding multivariate outliers. Examination of the moderating effect of sex in the model revealed an inverse association of metabolic/vascular risk with cognition in men whereas in women metabolic/vascular risk trended towards increased amyloid burden. Furthermore, a significant inverse association between physical activity and amyloid burden was found only in men. Inheritance of an APOE4 allele was associated with higher amyloid burden only in women.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex modifies effects of certain lifestyle-related factors on amyloid burden and cognition. Notably, our results suggest that the negative impact of metabolic/vascular risk influences the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease through distinct paths in women and men.</p>

                In order to explore the mechanism of general anesthesia emergence,based on the common clinical phenomenon--delayed emergency, we explore the role of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus in promoting sevoflurane arousal in mice model of general anesthesia. In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were selected to specifically activate or inhibit DR 5-HT neurons and different 5-HT receptors by intraperitoneal, lateral ventricle or intranuclear injection and optogenetics during the sevoflurane anesthesia, record and observe the anesthesia induction and emergence time of mice. Through intraventricular infusion and intranuclear microinjection of serotonin and 5-HT receptor agonists or antagonists, study shows that serotonin and 5-HT 1A and 2A/C receptor, especially 5-HT 1A receptor, are involved in the regulation of awakening delay mediated by DRN 5-HT neurons. This can provides a reliable theoretical basis and intervention target for clinical prevention of delayed emergency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting acetyl-CoA metabolism attenuates the formation of fear memories through reduced activity-dependent histone acetylation</a></h4>

              
                Histone acetylation is a key component in the consolidation of long-term fear memories. Epigenetic enzymes involved in histone acetylation, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, have been put forward as potential pharmacological targets in the treatment of pathological fear memories, such as those that underlie post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, these enzymes typically play a ubiquitous role in gene regulation, which precludes the clinical use of systemic manipulations. Recently, we have found that a nuclear-localized metabolic enzyme, Acetyl-coA synthetase 2 (Acss2), modulates histone acetylation during learning and memory. Loss of Acss2 is well-tolerated in mice, with no impact on general health or baseline behavior. Here, we show that an Acss2 null mouse model shows reduced acquisition of long-term fear memories in assays of contextual and cued fear conditioning. We find that loss of Acss2 leads to consolidation-specific reductions in both histone acetylation and the expression of critical learning and memory-related genes in the dorsal hippocampus. Further, we show that systemic administration of blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeable Acss2 inhibitors during the consolidation window reduces fear memory formation in mice and rats, and also reduces anxiety in a predator-scent-stress (PSS) paradigm. Our findings suggest that Acss2 plays a critical role in the formation of fear memories, and represents a potential pharmacological target in the treatment of PTSD.

	<p>Linguistic deficits are frequent symptoms among stroke survivors. The neural mechanism of post-stroke aphasia (PSA) was incompletely understood. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was widely used among several neuropsychological disorders. However, previous rs-fMRI studies of PSA were limited to very small sample size and the absence of reproducibility with different neuroimaging indexes. The present study performed comparisons with static and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) based on modest sample size (40 PSA and 37 healthy controls). Compared with controls, PSA showed significantly increased static ALFF predominantly in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and right hippocampus-parahippocampus (R HIP-ParaHip) and decreased static ALFF in right cerebellum. The increased dynamic ALFF in SMA and decreased dynamic ALFF in right cerebellum were also found in PSA. The static and dynamic ALFF in right cerebellum was positively correlated with spontaneous speech. The FC between the SMA and R HIP-ParaHip was significantly stronger in patients than controls and positively correlated with ALFF in bilateral SMA. In addition, the FC between the R HIP-ParaHip and the right temporal was also enhanced in patients and negatively correlated with repetition, naming, and comprehension score. These findings revealed consistently abnormal intrinsic neural activity in SMA and cerebellum, which may underlie linguistic deficits in PSA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Parkinson's disease derived exosomes aggravate neuropathology in SNCA*A53T mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons is a prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, researchers have considered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role in protein exportation and propagation, and α-syn-containing EVs derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have been detected in peripheral blood. However, mechanistic insights into CNS-derived EVs have not been well-described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Likely neurogenic EVs were purified from the plasma of PD patients and healthy controls using a well-established immunoprecipitation assay with anti-L1CAM-coated beads. A <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mouse model was used to evaluate the neuronal pathology induced by PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs. EV-associated microRNA (miRNA) profiling was used to screen for altered miRNAs in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD patient-derived L1CAM-purified (likely neurogenic) EVs facilitated α-syn pathology and neuron loss in <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mice. The novel miRNA, novel_miR_44438, was significantly increased in the PD group, which promoted α-syn accumulation and neuronal degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Novel _miR_44438 directly targets NDST1 mRNA and inhibits the function of heparan sulfate, thus preventing exosome biogenesis and α-syn release from exosomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel_miR_44438 in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs inhibits the α-syn efflux from neurons thereby promoting the pathological accumulation and aggregation of α-syn.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate and incidence and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women with the strict clinico-pathologically definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men December 31st 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4 years with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with mean survival of 14 years from symptom onset. Survival rate from both diagnosis date and symptom onset was decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations.</p>

<p>We have determined cuprizone demyelination and remyelination is correlated with a loss and restoration of bladder continence. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressively debilitating demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Nearly 80% of MS patients experience lower urinary tract dysfunction early in their diagnosis. This significantly affects the quality of life, and in latter stages of disease is a leading cause of hospitalization. Previously, animal models have shown that inflammatory demyelination in the CNS causes profound bladder dysfunction, but the confounding influence of systemic inflammation limits the potential interpretation of the contribution of CNS demyelination to bladder dysfunction. Since the micturition circuit has myelinated neuronal connections in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, we examined alterations in bladder function in the cuprizone model characterized by demyelinating lesions in the cortex and corpus callosum that are independent of T-cell–mediated autoimmunity. Herein, we report that a 4-week dietary cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6J mice induced alterations in voiding behavior with increased micturition frequency and reduced volume voided, similar to human MS bladder dysfunction. Subsequently, recovery from cuprizone treatment restored normal bladder function. Demyelination and remyelination were confirmed by Luxol Fast Blue staining of the corpus callosum. Additionally, we also determined that an 8-week cuprizone treatment, resulting in chronic demyelination lacking spontaneous remyelination potential, is associated with an exacerbated voiding phenotype. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged, as confirmed by urethane-anesthetized cystometry. This is the first study to show that cortical demyelination independent of inflammation can negatively impact urinary function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory interneurons within the deep dorsal horn integrate convergent sensory input to regulate motor performance</a></h4>

              
                To achieve smooth motor performance in a rich and changing sensory environment, motor output must be constantly updated in response to sensory feedback. Although proprioception and cutaneous information are known to modulate motor output, it is unclear whether they work together in the spinal cord to shape complex motor actions such as locomotion. Here we identify the medial deep dorsal horn (mDDH) as a hot zone of convergent proprioception and cutaneous input for locomotion. Due to increased responsiveness to sensory input, inhibitory interneurons in the mDDH area are preferentially recruited in locomotion. To study inhibitory interneurons in this area, we utilize an intersectional genetic strategy to isolate and ablate a population of parvalbumin-expressing glycinergic interneurons in the mDDH (dPVs). Using histological and electrophysiological methods we find that dPVs integrate proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs while targeting ventral horn motor networks, suggesting a role in multimodal sensory processing for locomotion. Consistent with this, dPVs ablation alters step cycle parameters and kinematics in a speed and phase dependent manner. Finally, we use EMG muscle recordings to directly show that dPVs are part of a cutaneous-motor pathway. Our results indicate that dPVs form a critical node in the spinal sensorimotor circuitry.

                CRISPR gene editing holds promise to cure or arrest genetic disease, if we can find and implement curative edits reliably, safely and effectively. Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in C9orf72 is the leading known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated three approaches to editing the mutant C9orf72 gene for their ability to correct pathology in neurons derived from patient iPSCs: excision of the repeat region, excision of the mutant allele, and excision of regulatory region exon 1A. All three approaches normalized RNA abnormalities and TDP-43 pathology, but only repeat excision and mutant allele excision completely eliminated pathologic dipeptide repeats. Our work sheds light on the complex regulation of the C9orf72 gene and suggests that because of sense and anti-sense transcription, silencing a single regulatory region may not reverse all pathology. Our work also provides a roadmap for evaluating CRISPR gene correction using patient iPSCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased GABA transmission to GnRH neurons after intrahippocampal kainic acid injection in mice is sex-specific and associated with estrous cycle disruption</a></h4>

              
                Patients with epilepsy develop reproductive endocrine comorbidities at a rate higher than that of the general population. Clinical studies have identified disrupted luteinizing hormone (LH) release patterns in patients of both sexes, suggesting potential epilepsy-associated changes in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron function. In previous work, we found that GnRH neuron firing is increased in diestrous females and males in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Notably, GABAA receptor activation is depolarizing in adult GnRH neurons. Therefore, here we tested the hypothesis that increased GnRH neuron firing in IHKA mice is associated with increased GABAergic drive to GnRH neurons. When ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) were blocked to isolate GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs), no differences in PSC frequency were seen between GnRH neurons from control and IHKA diestrous females. In the absence of iGluR blockade, however, GABA PSC frequency was increased in GnRH neurons from IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles, but not saline-injected controls nor IHKA females without estrous cycle disruption. GABA PSC amplitude was also increased in IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles. These findings suggest the presence of an iGluR-dependent increase in feed-forward GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons specific to IHKA females with comorbid cycle disruption. In males, GABA PSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged but PSC duration was reduced. Together, these findings suggest that increased GABA transmission helps drive elevated firing in IHKA females on diestrus and indicate the presence of a sex-specific hypothalamic mechanism underlying reproductive endocrine dysfunction in IHKA mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellum Directly Modulates the Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Activity</a></h4>

              
                Evidence of direct reciprocal connections between the cerebellum and basal ganglia has challenged the long-held notion that these structures function independently. While anatomical studies have suggested the presence of cerebellar projections to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the nature and function of these connections (Cb-SNc) is unknown. Here we show that the Cb-SNc form monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Optogenetic activation Cb-SNc axons in the SNc rapidly increases SNc activity, elevates striatal dopamine levels, and increases the probability of locomotion. During ongoing behavior, Cb-SNc axons are bilaterally activated prior to ambulation and unilateral lever manipulation. The Cb-SNc axons show prominent activation to water reward, and higher activation for sweet water, suggesting that the pathway also encodes reward value. Thus, the cerebellum directly, rapidly, and effectively modulates basal ganglia dopamine levels and conveys information related to movement initiation, vigor, and possibly reward processing.

                Vocalizations provide a means of communication with high fidelity and information rate for many species. Male mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during female courtship. Diencephalon and brainstem neural circuits have been shown to control the production of USVs, however, the role of cortical circuits in this process is debatable. We show that male mice produced USVs following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in a specific location of their anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, ACC Ca2+-imaging showed an increase in Ca2+ dynamics preceding USV initiation. Optogenetically suppressing ACC activity caused mice to emit fewer USVs during courtship. Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings in head-restrained male mice indicated a differential increase in neural activity in response to female social exposure (SE). The firing rate in SE trials where USVs were emitted was significantly higher when compared to SE leading to silence. Taken together, these results indicate that the ACC is a key node in the neuronal circuits controlling USV production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divergent projections from Locus Coeruleus to the cortico-basal ganglia system and ventral tegmental area of the zebra finch.</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem nucleus that is the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) throughout the vertebrate brain. Understanding the anatomical organization of the LC is important because NA plays a central role in regulating arousal, attention, and performance. In the mammalian brain, individual LC neurons make highly divergent axonal projections to different brain regions, which are distinguished in part by which NA receptor subtypes they express. Here we sought to determine whether similar organizational features - divergent LC projections acting regionally through different receptor subtypes - characterize cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry important to birdsong learning and performance. Single and dual retrograde tracer injections reveal that single LC-NA neurons make divergent projections to both cortical and basal ganglia components of this circuit, as well as to dopaminergic nuclei that innervate this circuit. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed that differential expression of the 2A and 2C adrenoreceptor distinguish LC-recipient song nuclei. Therefore, LC - NA signaling in the songbird CBG circuit could employ a similar strategy as in mammals, which allows a relatively small number of LC neurons to exert widespread yet distinct effects across multiple brain regions.

Key PointsO_LIThe locus coeruleus projects to most of the song system (HVC, RA, LMAN, Area X, DLM).
C_LIO_LINoradrenergic receptors are regionally specialized in BG despite divergent connectivity of LC neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local synaptic inhibition mediates cerebellar pattern separation necessary for learned sensorimotor associations</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellar cortex plays a key role in generating predictive sensorimotor associations. To do so, the granule cell layer is thought to establish unique sensorimotor representations for learning. However, how this is achieved, and how granule cell population responses contribute to behavior, has remained unclear. To address these questions, we have used in vivo calcium imaging and granule cell specific pharmacological manipulation of synaptic inhibition in awake, behaving mice. We find that inhibition sparsens and thresholds sensory responses, limiting overlap between sensory ensembles, and preventing spiking in many granule cells that receive excitatory input. Moreover, we find that inhibition can be recruited in a stimulus-specific manner to powerfully decorrelate multisensory ensembles. Consistent with these results, we find that granule cell inhibition is required for sensory discrimination in a cerebellum-dependent behavior. These data thus reveal new mechanisms for granule cell layer pattern separation beyond those envisioned by classical models.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that is increasingly becoming a global threat to the health and life of the elderly worldwide. Although there are some drugs clinically available for treating PD, these treatments can only alleviate the symptoms of PD patients but cannot completely cure the disease. Therefore, exploring other potential mechanisms to develop more effective treatments that can modify the course of PD is still highly desirable. Over the last two decades, histone deacetylases, as an important group of epigenetic targets, have attracted much attention in drug discovery. This review focused on the current knowledge about histone deacetylases involved in PD pathophysiology and their inhibitors used in PD studies. Further perspectives related to small molecules that can inhibit or degrade histone deacetylases to treat PD were also discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: Inflammation, particularly cytokine release, contributes to epileptogenesis by influencing the cerebral tissue remodeling and neuronal excitability that occurs after a precipitating epileptogenic insult. While several cytokines have been explored in this process, release kinetics are less well investigated. Determining the time course of cytokine release in the epileptogenic zone is necessary for precisely timed preventive or therapeutic anti-inflammatory interventions. Methods: Hippocampal extracellular levels of six cytokines and chemokines (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) were quantified at various time points during epileptogenesis in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) using microdialysis (MD). Results: The analysis of microdialysates demonstrated consistent elevation at all time points during epileptogenesis for IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-10. IL-10 release was maximal on day 1, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; release peaked at day 8. No correlation between local hippocampal IL-1&amp;amp;beta; concentrations and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; blood levels was found. Conclusion: The release kinetics of IL-1&amp;amp;beta; are consistent with its established pro-epileptogenic properties, while the kinetics of IL-10 suggest a counter-regulatory effect. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of intraindividual longitudinal monitoring of hippocampal molecular inflammatory processes via repetitive MD over several weeks and sheds light on the kinetics of hippocampal cytokine release during epileptogenesis.</p>

	<p>Pain is a minor problem compared with other Huntington Disease (HD) symptoms. Nevertheless, in HD it is poorly recognized and underestimated. So far, no study evaluated the presence of chronic pain in HD. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the presence and features of chronic pain in a cohort of HD gene carriers. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in a cohort of HD gene carriers compared to not gene carriers (n.134 HD subjects, n.74 not gene mutation carriers). A specific pain interview, alongside a neurological, cognitive and behavioural examination, was performed in order to classify the type of pain, subjective intensity. A significant prevalence of &amp;amp;ldquo;no Pain&amp;amp;rdquo; in HD was found, which tended to increase with HD progression and a reduced frequency of pain in the last 3 months. A clear difference was found between manifest and premanifest HD in terms of intensity of pain, which did not change significantly with HD progression; however, a tendency emerges to a progressive reduction. No significant group difference was present in analgesic use, type and the site of pain. These findings could support a lower prevalence of chronic pain in manifest HD. Prevalence and intensity of chronic pain seem directly influenced by the process of neurodegeneration rather than by an incorrect cognitive and emotional functioning.</p>

	<p>Objective: Although some meta-analyses have shown a correlation between a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and low survival in patients with gliomas, their conclusions are controversial, and no study has specifically explored the relationship between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Therefore, we further investigated this correlation through meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Metstr, and Cochrane databases in March 2022 for published literature related to high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with GBM. The literature was rigorously searched according to inclusion and exclusion criteria to calculate the overall hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) corresponding to a high NLR using a random effects model. Results: The total HR for the pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.17&amp;amp;ndash;1.75, p = 0.000, I2 = 76.5%), indicating a significant association between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR, and low overall survival in patients with GBM. Sub-group analysis was performed because of the high heterogeneity. The results for the sub-group with a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.65, p = 0.000, I2 = 22.2%), with significantly low heterogeneity, whereas those for the sub-group without a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;1.89, p = 0.000, I2 = 83.3%). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR suggests low survival in patients with GBM based on data from a large sample. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis results indicate that underlying data, such as age and extent of surgical resection, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity, providing a theoretical basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Motor coordination abilities are related to cognitive abilities and academic achievement in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the similarities and differences of these relationships in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) have not been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between motor coordination abilities, cognitive abilities, and academic achievement in Japanese children with ASD and AD/HD. Participants included 20 children with ASD, 20 children with AD/HD, and 20 typically developing children, matched for age and gender. Their motor coordination abilities were assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2). Furthermore, cognitive ability and academic achievement were assessed with the Kauffman Assessment Battery for Children-II (K-ABCII). Results demonstrated that the MABC-2 Total score significantly correlated with the K-ABCII Simultaneous processing, Planning, Total cognitive ability, Writing and Arithmetic scores in children with ASD. However, in children with AD/HD, there was no significant correlation between MABC-2 and K-ABCII subscale scores. The results of this study indicated that the relationship between motor coordination ability, cognitive ability, and academic achievement differs between ASD and AD/HD. This difference might indicate the non-similarity of neurological characteristics and encourage consideration for an approach that accommodates the features of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p>

                Hydroxyurea (HU) alone has the potential to prevent one out of every three deaths due to sickle cell disease (SCD) and almost all forms of disabilities caused by SCD. However, in Tanzania, only one out of every six registered SCD patients in the SPARCO-Tanzania Sickle Cell Cohort use HU. We conducted studies to understand factors influencing utilization of HU in Tanzania and discovered that among the reason for low utilization of HU include HU is classified as anticancer medication, only hematologists are supposed to prescribe HU, limited HU prescription to only National and Specialized hospitals, a special permit is required to access HU using National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) scheme and limited importation and absence of local manufacturing of HU limit availability of this important drug in Tanzania. Therefore, with this brief, the government should allow prescription of HU to the district hospitals level, should allow all clinicians with a minimum of a Bachelor of Medicine to prescribe HU, and accessibility of HU through NHIF should be friendly.

                Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that has been linked to enhanced risks for atherosclerosis. The impact of asthma on cardiovascular disease risk in children is less well established. Asthma is defined by a history of respiratory symptoms and accompanied by airflow limitation, with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, and variability in the intensity of airway inflammation and remodeling. Endothelial microparticles (EMP) are biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in several chronic diseases. Endothelial microparticles initiate an event of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our study aimed to evaluate the role of endothelial microparticles in children with asthma. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 50 children with asthma aged seven‒17 years. Children with asthma exacerbations, infections, and steroid use were excluded. Endothelial microparticles were measured with beads, and the fluorescence signal was measured using a flow cytometer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: Based on the results from 50 asthmatic children, it was found that most children had a normal nutritional status, intermittent, and allergic asthma. The results of this study also showed that the circulation of asthmatic children found that the mean levels (µL) of CD31+/CD62E+, CD31+/CD62E-, and CD62E+/CD31- were 2,392.99 ± 7,787.94; 922.14 ± 1,554.03; 198.97 ± 387.68, with the average ratio of CD31+/CD62E+, which was ≤1.0 and identifies apoptosis. Path analysis results found that IL-6, TNF-α, and CD31+/CD62E- EMP played a role in peak expiratory flow rate (%PEFR, p = 0.02; p = 0.003; p = 0.04) in children with allergic asthma. Conclusions: Endothelial microparticles play a role on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in children with allergic asthma. Further study is needed to investigate the role of these biomarkers and their correlation with pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A juxtamembrane basolateral targeting motif regulates signaling through a TGF-β pathway receptor in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aidan J. Peterson, Stephen J. Murphy, Melinda G. Mundt, MaryJane Shimell, Edward B. Leof, Michael B. O’Connor</p>

In polarized epithelial cells, receptor–ligand interactions can be restricted by different spatial distributions of the 2 interacting components, giving rise to an underappreciated layer of regulatory complexity. We explored whether such regulation occurs in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc, an epithelial tissue featuring the TGF-β family member Decapentaplegic (Dpp) as a morphogen controlling growth and patterning. Dpp protein has been observed in an extracellular gradient within the columnar cell layer of the disc, but also uniformly in the disc lumen, leading to the question of how graded signaling is achieved in the face of 2 distinctly localized ligand pools. We find the Dpp Type II receptor Punt, but not the Type I receptor Tkv, is enriched at the basolateral membrane and depleted at the junctions and apical surface. Wit, a second Type II receptor, shows a markedly different behavior, with the protein detected on all membrane regions but enriched at the apical side. Mutational studies identified a short juxtamembrane sequence required for basolateral restriction of Punt in both wing discs and mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. This basolateral targeting (BLT) determinant can dominantly confer basolateral localization on an otherwise apical receptor. Rescue of <i>punt</i> mutants with transgenes altered in the targeting motif showed that flies expressing apicalized Punt due to the lack of a functional BLT displayed developmental defects, female sterility, and significant lethality. We also show that apicalized Punt does not produce an ectopic signal, indicating that the apical pool of Dpp is not a significant signaling source even when presented with Punt. Instead, we find that basolateral presentation of Punt is required for optimal signaling. Finally, we present evidence that the BLT acts through polarized sorting machinery that differs between types of epithelia. This suggests a code whereby each epithelial cell type may differentially traffic common receptors to enable distinctive responses to spatially localized pools of extracellular ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multiple molecular events underlie stochastic switching between 2 heritable cell states in fungi</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naomi Ziv, Lucas R. Brenes, Alexander Johnson</p>

Eukaryotic transcriptional networks are often large and contain several levels of feedback regulation. Many of these networks have the ability to generate and maintain several distinct transcriptional states across multiple cell divisions and to switch between them. In certain instances, switching between cell states is stochastic, occurring in a small subset of cells of an isogenic population in a seemingly homogenous environment. Given the scarcity and unpredictability of switching in these cases, investigating the determining molecular events is challenging. White-opaque switching in the fungal species <i>Candida albicans</i> is an example of stably inherited cell states that are determined by a complex transcriptional network and can serve as an experimentally accessible model system to study characteristics important for stochastic cell fate switching in eukaryotes. In standard lab media, genetically identical cells maintain their cellular identity (either “white” or “opaque”) through thousands of cell divisions, and switching between the states is rare and stochastic. By isolating populations of white or opaque cells, previous studies have elucidated the many differences between the 2 stable cell states and identified a set of transcriptional regulators needed for cell type switching and maintenance of the 2 cell types. Yet, little is known about the molecular events that determine the rare, stochastic switching events that occur in single cells. We use microfluidics combined with fluorescent reporters to directly observe rare switching events between the white and opaque states. We investigate the stochastic nature of switching by beginning with white cells and monitoring the activation of Wor1, a master regulator and marker for the opaque state, in single cells and throughout cell pedigrees. Our results indicate that switching requires 2 stochastic steps; first an event occurs that predisposes a lineage of cells to switch. In the second step, some, but not all, of those predisposed cells rapidly express high levels of Wor1 and commit to the opaque state. To further understand the rapid rise in Wor1, we used a synthetic inducible system in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> into which a controllable <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> Wor1 and a reporter for its transcriptional control region have been introduced. We document that Wor1 positive autoregulation is highly cooperative (Hill coefficient > 3), leading to rapid activation and producing an “all or none” rather than a graded response. Taken together, our results suggest that reaching a threshold level of a master regulator is sufficient to drive cell type switching in single cells and that an earlier molecular event increases the probability of reaching that threshold in certain small lineages of cells. Quantitative molecular analysis of the white-opaque circuit can serve as a model for the general understanding of complex circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Diet-responsive transcriptional regulation of insulin in a single neuron controls systemic metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ava Handley, Qiuli Wu, Tessa Sherry, Rebecca Cornell, Roger Pocock</p>

Metabolic homeostasis is coordinated through a robust network of signaling pathways acting across all tissues. A key part of this network is insulin-like signaling, which is fundamental for surviving glucose stress. Here, we show that <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> fed excess dietary glucose reduce insulin-1 (INS-1) expression specifically in the BAG glutamatergic sensory neurons. We demonstrate that INS-1 expression in the BAG neurons is directly controlled by the transcription factor ETS-5, which is also down-regulated by glucose. We further find that INS-1 acts exclusively from the BAG neurons, and not other INS-1-expressing neurons, to systemically inhibit fat storage via the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Together, these findings reveal an intertissue regulatory pathway where regulation of insulin expression in a specific neuron controls systemic metabolism in response to excess dietary glucose.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unleashing frugal innovation in private higher education institutions via intellectual capital and Information technology capability: a systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given the persistent challenges to the higher education business model, private higher education institutions (PHEIs) are exploring myriad ways to increase enrolment and income, while aggressively managing spending. Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield’s five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored.   Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review of retinoic acid in the journey of spermatogonium to spermatozoa: From basic to clinical application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinoic acid plays an essential role in testicular development and functions, especially spermatogenesis. We have reviewed the role of retinoic acid from basic (molecular) to clinical application. Methods: A search was conducted in the online database including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus for English studies published in the last eight years about this issue. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in assessing the studies we are going to investigate. Results: Studies indicated that retinoic acid plays an essential role during pluripotent stem cell migration and lineage commitment, cell differentiation, apoptosis, stem cell number regulation, and maturation arrest in spermatogenic cells. Retinoic acid can also affect related protein expression and signaling pathways at different stages of spermatogenesis. Four studies have applied retinoic acid to humans, all of them in the single-arm observational study. The results look promising but need further research with more controlled study methods, randomization, and large samples. Conclusions: This current systematic review emphasizes a novel retinoic acid mechanism that has not been well described in the literature previously on its functions during the first seven days of spermatogenesis, leading to new directions or explanations of male infertility cause and treatments as a part of reproductive health care.

<p>NURR1 regulates the production of dopamine. Dopamine is present in dopaminergic neurons to regulate movement and emotion and in blood to control cardiac functions. Here, we demonstrated motor impairment, increased brain DA level and heart rate in old NURR1-deficient mice independently from sex, although sex affects their spontaneous locomotion.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transcription factor NURR1 is essential to the generation and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons and its deregulation is involved in the development of dopamine (DA)-associated brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The old male NURR1 heterozygous knockout (NURR1-KO) mouse has been proposed as a model of PD due to its altered motor performance that was, however, not confirmed in a subsequent study. Based on these controversial results, we explored the effects of the NURR1 deficiency on locomotor activity, motor coordination, brain and plasma DA levels, blood pressure and heart rate of old mice, also focusing on the potential effect of sex. As a probable consequence of the role of NURR1 in DA pathway, we observed that the old NURR1-KO mouse is characterized by motor impairment, and increased brain DA level and heart rate, independently from sex. However, we also observed an alteration in spontaneous locomotor activity that only affects males. In conclusion, NURR1 deficiency triggers sex- and age-specific alterations of behavioral responses, of DA levels and cardiovascular abnormalities. Further studies in simplified systems will be necessary to dissect the mechanism underlying these observations.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, Discovery-Replication-Validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which PD individuals will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 Discovery Cohort PD individuals and 83 Replication Cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associating with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which PD patients showed fast (&gt;=1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) vs. slow (&lt;1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the Discovery Cohort, testing it in the Replication Cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top three proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a Validation Cohort of 118 PD individuals. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only three proteins (Melanoma Inhibitory Activity Protein (MIA), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin) separated Fast vs. Slow cognitive decline subgroups with an AUC of 0.80 in the Validation Cohort. Validation Cohort PD individuals in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at <i>MIA</i> SNP rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily-obtained plasma-based predictor identifies PD individuals at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline.</p>

     alt="Resveratrol inhibits the activity of acid-sensing ion channels in male rat dorsal root ganglion neurons"/>
<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. Once ASICs are activated by H<sup>+</sup>, cation influx (largely Na<sup>+</sup>) will cause depolarization of membrane potentials and bursts of action potentials (APs), then resulting in pain. Resveratrol can inhibit ASICs, so that H<sup>+</sup> produces reduced responses in the amplitude of membrane currents and the number of APs, leading to a relief of acid-induced pain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resveratrol can relieve pain under various pain conditions. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol analgesia is the regulation of ion channels. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed predominantly in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. ASICs are important players in pain associated with tissue acidification. However, it is still unclear whether ASICs are resveratrol targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that resveratrol decreased acid-induced and ASIC-mediated currents in male rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Resveratrol downwardly shifted the concentration–response curve for protons, suggesting that it inhibited ASICs not by changing the pH<sub>0.5</sub>, but by suppressing the proton-induced maximum response. It also suppressed acid-triggered action potentials in the rat DRG neurons. Finally, intraplantar pretreatment with resveratrol relieved acid-induced nociceptive responses in male rats in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that resveratrol inhibited ASIC-mediated electrophysiological activity and nociception, suggesting a novel peripheral mechanism underlying its analgesic effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI EVALUATION OF PERIVASCULAR SPACE ABNORMALITIES IN NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes outline the perivascular space (PVS) and regulate fluids exchange through the aquaporin-4 water channel. Since neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune astrocytopathy targeting aquaporin-4, we hypothesize that it could be associatied with PVS abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-four patients and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from two independent cohorts (exploratory- and validation-dataset) underwent a standardized 3.0 T MRI protocol including conventional and diffusion-tensor imaging. Susceptibility-weighted imaging was also acquired in the exploratory-dataset. We evaluated macroscopic and microstructural abnormalities of PVS in terms of enlargement and water diffusivity (DTI-ALPS index). In the exploration-dataset, susceptibility-weighted sequence was used to draw the regions of interest for the DTI-ALPS index calculation in areas having veins perpendicular to lateral ventricles. Between-group comparisons, correlations and regression models were run to assess associations between PVS abnormalities, clinical and MRI variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients had higher frequency of severe PVS enlargement in the centrum semiovale (29.4% <i>vs</i>. 8.7%), which correlated with brain, deep grey matter atrophy and poorer cognitive performance (r values range: -0.44, -0.36; p values: 0.01-0.046).</p>
<p>In both datasets, patients had reduced DTI-ALPS index compared to controls (p values: 0.004-0.038). Lower DTI-ALPS index, deep grey matter volume and cortical volume could discriminate between patients and controls (R<sup>2</sup>=0.62), while lower DTI-ALPS index, higher number of myelitis, and higher T2-lesion volume associated with worse disability (R<sup>2</sup>=0.55).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are characterized by abnormal enlargement and impaired water diffusion along PVS, whose clinical implications suggest a direct correlation with disease pathogenesis and its severity.</p>

                <b>Background:</b> Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) electrode implant trajectories are stereotactically defined using preoperative neuroimaging. To validate the correct trajectory, microelectrode recordings (MER) or local field potential recordings (LFP) can be used to extend neuroanatomical information (defined by magnetic resonance imaging) with neurophysiological activity patterns recorded from micro- and macroelectrodes probing the surgical target site. Currently, these two sources of information (imaging vs. electrophysiology) are analyzed separately, while means to fuse both data streams have not been introduced.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">WhyD tailors surface polymers to prevent premature bacteriolysis and direct cell elongation in Streptococcus pneumoniae</a></h4>

              
                Penicillin and related antibiotics disrupt cell wall synthesis in bacteria causing the downstream misactivation of cell wall hydrolases called autolysins to induce cell lysis. Despite the clinical importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the factors that control autolysins and how penicillins subvert this regulation to kill cells. In the pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (<i>Sp</i>), LytA is the major autolysin responsible for penicillin-induced bacteriolysis. We recently discovered that penicillin treatment of <i>Sp</i> causes a dramatic shift in surface polymer biogenesis in which cell wall-anchored teichoic acids (WTAs) increase in abundance at the expense of lipid-linked teichoic acids (LTAs). Because LytA binds to both species of teichoic acids, this change recruits the enzyme to its substrate where it cleaves the cell wall and elicits lysis. In this report, we identify WhyD (SPD_0880) as a new factor that controls the level of WTAs in <i>Sp</i> cells to prevent LytA misactivation during exponential growth and premature lysis. We show that WhyD is a WTA hydrolase that restricts the WTA content of the wall to areas adjacent to active PG synthesis. Our results support a model in which the WTA tailoring activity of WhyD during exponential growth directs PG remodeling activity required for proper cell elongation in addition to preventing autolysis by LytA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping brain-wide excitatory projectome of primate prefrontal cortex at submicron resolution and comparison with diffusion tractography</a></h4>

              
                Resolving trajectories of axonal pathways in the primate prefrontal cortex remains crucial to gain insights into higher-order processes of cognition and emotion, which requires a comprehensive map of axonal projections linking demarcated subdivisions of prefrontal cortex and the rest of brain. Here, we report a mesoscale excitatory projectome issued from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) to the entire macaque brain by using viral-based genetic axonal tracing in tandem with high-throughput serial two-photon tomography, which demonstrated prominent monosynaptic projections to other prefrontal areas, temporal, limbic, and subcortical areas, relatively weak projections to parietal and insular regions but no projections directly to the occipital lobe. In a common 3D space, we quantitatively validated an atlas of diffusion tractography-derived vlPFC connections with correlative green fluorescent protein-labeled axonal tracing, and observed generally good agreement except a major difference in the posterior projections of inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These findings raise an intriguing question as to how neural information passes along long-range association fiber bundles in macaque brains, and call for the caution of using diffusion tractography to map the wiring diagram of brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visceral organ morphogenesis via calcium-patterned muscle constrictions</a></h4>

              
                Organ architecture is often composed of multiple laminar tissues arranged in concentric layers. During morphogenesis, the initial geometry of visceral organs undergoes a sequence of folding, adopting a complex shape that is vital for function. Genetic signals are known to impact form, yet the dynamic and mechanical interplay of tissue layers giving rise to organs' complex shapes remains elusive. Here, we trace the dynamics and mechanical interactions of a developing visceral organ across tissue layers, from sub-cellular to organ scale in vivo. Combining deep tissue light-sheet microscopy for in <i>toto</i> live visualization with a novel computational framework for multilayer analysis of evolving complex shapes, we find a dynamic mechanism for organ folding using the embryonic midgut of <i>Drosophila</i> as a model visceral organ. Hox genes, known regulators of organ shape, control the emergence of high-frequency calcium pulses. Spatiotemporally patterned calciumpulses triggermuscle contractions via myosin light chain kinase. Muscle contractions, in turn, induce cell shape change in the adjacent tissue layer. This cell shape change collectively drives a convergent extension pattern. Through tissue incompressibility and initial organ geometry, this in-plane shape change is linked to out-of-plane organ folding. Our analysis follows tissue dynamics during organ shape change in vivo, tracing organ-scale folding to a high-frequency molecular mechanism. These findings offer a mechanical route for gene expression to induce organ shape change: genetic patterning in one layer triggers a physical process in the adjacent layer - revealing post-translational mechanisms that govern shape change.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Individualized discovery of rare cancer drivers in global network context</a></h4>

              
                Late advances in genome sequencing expanded the space of known cancer driver genes several-fold. However, most of this surge was based on computational analysis of somatic mutation frequencies and/or their impact on the protein function. On the contrary, experimental research necessarily accounted for functional context of mutations interacting with other genes and conferring cancer phenotypes. Eventually, just such results become 'hard currency' of cancer biology. The new method, NEAdriver employs knowledge accumulated thus far in the form of global interaction network and functionally annotated pathways in order to recover known and predict novel driver genes. The driver discovery was individualized by accounting for mutations' co-occurrence in each tumour genome - as an alternative to summarizing information over the whole cancer patient cohorts. For each somatic genome change, probabilistic estimates from two lanes of network analysis were combined into joint likelihoods of being a driver. Thus, ability to detect previously unnoticed candidate driver events emerged from combining individual genomic context with network perspective. The procedure was applied to ten largest cancer cohorts followed by evaluating error rates against previous cancer gene sets. The discovered driver combinations were shown to be informative on cancer outcome. This revealed driver genes with individually sparse mutation patterns that would not be detectable by other computational methods and related to cancer biology domains poorly covered by previous analyses. In particular, recurrent mutations of collagen, laminin, and integrin genes were observed in the adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma cancers. Considering constellation patterns of candidate drivers in individual cancer genomes opens a novel avenue for personalized cancer medicine.

                Skillful, voluntary movements are underpinned by computations performed by networks of interconnected neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1). Computations are reflected by patterns of co-activity between neurons. Using spike time correlations, co-activity can be represented as functional networks (FNs). Here, we show that the structure of FNs constructed from instructed-delay reach trials in non-human primates are behaviorally specific: low dimensional embedding and graph alignment scores show that FNs constructed from closer target reach distances are also closer in network space. We next constructed temporal FNs using short intervals across a trial. We find that temporal FNs traverse a low-dimensional subspace in a reach-specific trajectory. Alignment scores show that FNs become separable and correspondingly, decodable shortly after the instruction cue. Finally, we observe that reciprocal connections in FNs transiently decrease following the instruction cue, suggesting the network momentarily switches from a recurrent system to one that is more feedforward.

                Beta oscillations in human sensorimotor cortex are hallmark signatures of healthy and pathological movement. In single trials, beta oscillations include bursts of intermittent, transient periods of high-power activity. These burst events have been linked to a range of sensory and motor processes, but their precise spatial, spectral, and temporal structure remains unclear. Specifically, a role for beta burst activity in information coding and communication suggests spatiotemporal patterns, or travelling wave activity, along specific anatomical gradients. We here show in human magnetoencephalography recordings that burst activity in sensorimotor cortex occurs in planar spatiotemporal wave-like patterns that dominate along two axes either parallel or perpendicular to the central sulcus. Moreover, we find that the two propagation directions are characterised by distinct anatomical and physiological features. Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor beta bursts occurring before and after a movement share the same generator but can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.

                Graph matching algorithms attempt to find the best correspondence between the nodes of two networks. These techniques have previously been used to match individual neurons in nanoscale connectomes - in particular, to find pairings of neurons across hemispheres. However, since graph matching techniques deal specifically with two isolated networks, they have only utilized the ipsilateral (same hemisphere) subgraphs when performing the matching. Here, we present a modification to a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm which allows it to solve what we call the bisected graph matching problem. This modification allows us to also use connections between the brain hemispheres when predicting neuron pairs. Via simulations and real connectome datasets we show that when edge correlation is present between the contralateral (between hemisphere) subgraphs, this approach improves matching accuracy. We expect that our proposed method will improve future endeavors to accurately match neurons across hemispheres in connectomes, and be useful in other applications where the bisected graph matching problem arises.

                Failures in mitophagy, a process by which damaged mitochondria are cleared, results in neurodegeneration, while enhancing mitophagy promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Using an artificial intelligence platform, we employed a natural language processing approach to evaluate the semantic similarity of candidate molecules to a set of well-established mitophagy enhancers. Top candidates were screened in a cell-based mitochondrial clearance assay. Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug, was validated across several orthogonal mitophagy assays. In vivo, probucol improved survival, locomotor function and dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish and fly models of mitochondrial damage. Probucol functioned independently of PINK1/Parkin but its effects on mitophagy and in vivo depended on ABCA1, which negatively regulated mitophagy following mitochondrial damage. Autophagosome and lysosomal markers were elevated under basal conditions by probucol treatment in addition to increased contact between lipid droplets and mitochondria. Conversely, lipid droplet expansion, which occurs following mitochondrial damage was suppressed by probucol and probucol-mediated mitophagy enhancement required lipid droplets. Probucol-mediated lipid droplet dynamics changes may prime the cell for a more efficient mitophagic response to mitochondrial damage.

                The encoding of touch in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) and its influence on tactile representations in the brain are poorly understood. Using a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin, large scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations, here we show that neurons in the mouse spinal cord DH receive convergent inputs from both low- and high-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes and exhibit one of six functionally distinct mechanical response profiles. Genetic disruption of DH feedforward or feedback inhibitory motifs, comprised of interneurons with distinct mechanical response profiles, revealed an extensively interconnected DH network that enables dynamic, flexible tuning of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) output neurons and dictates how neurons in primary somatosensory cortex respond to touch. Thus, mechanoreceptor subtype convergence and nonlinear transformations at the earliest stage of the somatosensory hierarchy shape how touch of the skin is represented in the brain.

                Animals constantly perceive and integrate information across sensory modalities, and their nervous systems must select behavioral responses appropriate to the current situation and prior experience. Genetic factors supporting this behavioral flexibility are often disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions, and our previous work revealed the disease-associated ap2s1 critically supports habituation learning in acoustically-evoked escape behavior of zebrafish. ap2s1 encodes a subunit of the AP2 endocytosis adaptor complex and has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, though its mechanism and direct behavioral importance have not been established. Here, we show that multiple domains and subunits of the AP2 complex regulate acoustically-evoked behavior selection and habituation learning. Furthermore, ap2s1 biases the choice between distinct escape behaviors in sensory modality-specific manners, and more broadly regulates action selection across different sensory contexts. Using tissue-specific and inducible transgenic rescue, we demonstrate that the AP2 complex functions acutely and in the nervous system to modulate acoustically-evoked habituation, identifying at least three spatially and temporally distinct mechanisms through which AP2 regulates different aspects of escape behavior selection and performance. Altogether, we demonstrate that the AP2 complex coordinates action selection across stimulus modalities and contexts, providing a new vertebrate model for the role of ap2s1 in human conditions including autism spectrum disorder.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe AP2S1 gene has been linked to learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), though the mechanisms underlying its impact on human behavior are unknown. We explored how, when, and where this gene regulates vertebrate behavior, developing a zebrafish model to identify the roles and mechanisms through which ap2s1 modulates behavior. We find that ap2s1 regulates simple acoustically-evoked learning, as well as how individuals bias behavioral choice in a wide variety of contexts. We show that ap2s1 acts at multiple distinct time periods and locations both within and outside of neuronal tissues, revealing the diverse mechanisms and pathways through which it modulates vertebrate behavior.

                An altered neuronal excitability of spinal motoneurones has consistently been implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) leading to several investigations of synaptic input to these motoneurones. One such input that has repeatedly been shown to be affected is a population of large cholinergic synapses terminating mainly on the soma of the motoneurones referred to as C-boutons. Most research on these synapses during disease progression has used transgenic Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) mouse models of the disease which have not only produced conflicting findings, but also fail to recapitulate the key pathological feature seen in ALS; cytoplasmic accumulations of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Additionally, they fail to distinguish between slow and fast motoneurones, the latter of which have more C-boutons but are lost earlier in the disease.

To circumvent these issues, we quantified the frequency and volume of C-boutons on traced soleus and gastrocnemius motoneurones, representing predominantly slow and fast motor pools respectively. Experiments were performed using the TDP-43{Delta}NLS mouse model that carries a transgenic construct of TDP-43 devoid of its nuclear localization signal, preventing its nuclear import. This results in the emergence of pathological TDP-43 inclusions in the cytoplasm, modelling the main pathology seen in this disorder, accompanied by a severe and lethal ALS phenotype.

Our results confirmed changes in both the number and volume of C-boutons with a decrease in number on the more vulnerable, predominantly fast gastrocnemius motoneurones and an increase in number on the less vulnerable, predominantly slow soleus motoneurones. Importantly, these changes were only found in male mice. However, both sexes and motor pools showed a decrease in C-bouton volume. Our experiments confirm that cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation is sufficient to drive C-bouton changes.

                Neurological symptoms are increasingly associated with COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive. Although studies have focused on neuroinvasion through infection of olfactory neurons and supporting cells or hematogenous spread, little attention has been paid to the susceptibility of the peripheral nervous system to infection or to alternative routes of neural invasion. We show that neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, and primary neuronal cultures demonstrates viral RNA, protein, and infectious virus in peripheral nervous system neurons, spinal cord, specific brain regions, and satellite glial cells. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infects neurons at least in part via neuropilin-1. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades and establishes productive infection in previously unassessed sites in the nervous system via direct invasion of neurons before viremia, which may underlie some cognitive and sensory symptoms associated with COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial memory training reverses GirK channels modulation in the transgenic APPSw,Ind Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a dementia characterized by progressive memory decline and neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides. Last findings point to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission as the initial impairment in early stages, and the hippocampus as one of the most susceptible brain areas.

The G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GirK) channel has been proposed as a potential target to restore excitatory/inhibitory balance in amyloidosis models. Moreover, cognitive training may counteract early AD symptoms, although its effect on GirK channels remains unknown.

Here, the effect of genotype, age, and training in a hippocampal-dependent memory task on the protein expression of GirK subunits and modulators were studied using APPSw,Ind mice. Results showed a reduction of GirK2 expression as well as an increased expression of SNX27 in the hippocampus of 6-month-old APPSw,Ind mice. Training in a memory task restored GirK2 and SNX27 levels. Thus, the effect of A{beta} on GirK2 could account for the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance transmission found in AD models, and training in a cognitive hippocampal-dependent task reverses this effect and lessens early A{beta}-dependent AD deficits.

Summary statementA{beta} decreases hippocampal GirK2 expression in APPSw,Ind mice, which could contribute to early hyperexcitability found in Alzheimers disease models. Training in spatial memory tasks has shown to counteract this reduction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic evaluation of high level visual deficits and lesions in posterior cerebral artery stroke</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge about the consequences of stroke on high level vision comes primarily from single case studies of patients selected based on their behavioural profiles with deficits in the recognition of a specific visual category such as faces or words. There are, however, no systematic, detailed, large-scale evaluations of the more typical clinical behavioural and lesion profiles of impairments in high level vision that may follow posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. These goals were met by the current study through the data collected in the Back of the Brain (BoB) project: to date, the largest (N=64) and most detailed examination of patients with cortical PCA strokes selected based on lesion location rather than behavioural symptoms.

We present here two complementary analyses of the structural neuroimaging data and key indices of behavioural performance with the visual processing words, objects and faces: (1) a multivariate multiple regression analysis to establish the relationships between lesion volume, lesion laterality or the presence of a bilateral lesion with performance on words, objects and faces; and, (2) a voxel-based correlational method (VBCM) analysis to establish whether there are distinct or separate regions within the PCA territory that underpin the visual processing of these categories.

In contrast to the characterization of specific stroke syndromes like pure alexia or prosopagnosia in the literature, most patients in our cohort showed more general deficits in high level vision (n=22) or no deficits at all (n=21). Category-selective deficits were rare (n=6), and were only found for words, which, interestingly could follow left or right hemisphere lesions. The lesion analyses mainly confirmed the pattern reported in more selective cases: word recognition impairments are associated with a left-sided pattern of damage and face recognition deficits with a bilateral albeit right-dominant lesion pattern. Importantly, however, both general and more selective impairment may follow from left or right unilateral as well as bilateral lesions.

While the findings provide partial support for the relative laterality of posterior brain regions supporting reading in the left and, to a lesser extent, face processing in the right hemisphere, the results suggest that both hemispheres are involved in the visual processing of faces, words and objects. This has ramifications for researchers studying the healthy brain and for clinicians working with patients with PCA stroke. Clinicians are recommended to carry out formal assessment of face, word and object recognition as most patients are expected to present with a mixed picture of deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for different greater-persistence strategies under lower and higher challenge for alcohol in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Problem alcohol drinking is a substantial social and economic burden. Studies show that the misuse of alcohol is increasing in women, and that women can face higher consequences from alcohol exposure, but females have historically been understudied. Thus, there is considerable interest in understanding potential sex-different and -similar cognitive/emotional strategies, and underlying mechanisms, for alcohol responding, which would inform more effective, personalized treatments. Here, we used large cohorts of adult Wistar rats (28 females, 30 males) to provide robust assessment of potential sex differences in responding for alcohol-only and under compulsion-like drinking with moderate or higher challenge (since intake despite negative consequences can be a major obstacle to human treatment). Females had similar total licking but higher intake for all drinking conditions. However, females had significantly longer bouts under alcohol-only and moderate challenge, but not higher challenge. Further, under higher challenge, females retained several aspects of responding not seen in males, including more efficient lick volume and earlier onset of longer bouts. In addition, females overall licked slightly faster, but licking speed averaged within-bout showed no sex differences, and female intake level under alcohol-only and moderate challenge was unlinked from licking speed (unlike males, where slower licking predicted lower intake). We interpret these differences as greater persistence-like responding but not vigor per se in females, and with different strategies under lower versus higher challenge. Finally, drinking levels did not differ across the estrous cycle, although ovariectomy reduced alcohol-only and moderate-challenge intake. Together, while many aspects were sex-similar, suggesting some common drinking mechanisms, there was clear evidence for (perhaps more nuanced) sex-different alcohol strategies, which might make an outsized contribution to excessive drinking since women can have more drinking problems. Thus, our studies provide important context for future work examining sex differences in pathological drinking mechanisms.

                Parkinsons Disease (PD) associated state of neuroinflammation due to the aggregation of aberrant proteins is widely reported. One type of post-translational modification involved in protein stability is glycosylation. Here, we aimed to spatially characterise the human Parkinsonian nigro-striatal N-glycome, and related transcriptome/proteome, and its correlation with endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), providing a comprehensive characterisation of the PD molecular signature.

Significant changes were seen upon PD: 3% increase in sialylation and 5% increase in fucosylation in both regions, and 2% increase in oligomannosylated N-glycans in the substantia nigra. In the latter, a decrease in the mRNA expression of sialidases and an upregulation in the UPR pathway were also seen.

This complete characterisation of the human nigro-striatal N-glycome provides an insight into the glycomic profile of PD through a transversal approach while combining the other PD "omics" pieces, which can potentially assist in the development of glyco-focused therapeutics.

                This paper analyzes the behaviour of Alzheimers disease simulation in artificial neural networks and thereby suggests a new possible diagnosis for Alzheimer. Alzheimers disease is one of the most common diseases, increasing severity over time. Despite its high prevalence and thousands of yearly publications in this area, no cure has been found to date and early detection is one of the most important factor towards fighting the disease and possibly finding a cure. This paper analyses the behaviour of simulated Alzheimer in Hopfield memories and observes that the main factor influenced by the loss of connections is the time needed to recognize distorted symbols - while the recognition performance stays surprisingly high for a long time. Hence, I suggest a new early diagnosis approach which is based on slightly distorted elements (e.g., characters) and measures the time needed to perform the task, instead of just focusing on the subjects recognition performance. This insight could have a large impact to future diagnose setups, once being validated in a clinical study.

                Synaptic plasticity is a process that shapes neuronal connections during neurodevelopment, learning, and memory. Autophagy is a mechanism that allows cells to degrade their unnecessary or dysfunctional components. Autophagosomes appear at dendritic spines in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli. Autophagy defects contribute to altered dendritic spine development, autistic-like behavior in mice, and neurological disease. While several studies explored the involvement of autophagy in synaptic plasticity, the steps preceding autophagosome emergence at the postsynapse remain unknown. Here we show a postsynaptic association of autophagy-related protein 9A (Atg9A), known to be involved in the initial stages of autophagosome formation, with Rab11, a small GTPase that regulates endosomal trafficking. Rab11 activity is necessary for the maintenance of Atg9A-positive structures at dendritic spines. Inhibition of mTOR increased Rab11 and Atg9A interaction and increased the emergence of autophagosomes in dendritic spines when coupled to NMDA receptor stimulation. Dendritic spines with newly formed autophagosomes were more resistant to NMDA-induced morphologic change. These results collectively suggest that autophagy initiation in dendritic spines depends on an activity-dependent Rab11a-Atg9A interaction regulated by mTOR.

                The blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) tightly regulates molecular transport from the blood to the spinal cord. Herein, we present a novel approach for transient modulation of BSCB permeability and localized delivery of peptides into the spinal cord for behavior modulation with high spatial resolution. This approach utilizes optical stimulation of vasculature-targeted nanoparticles and allows delivery of BSCB-nonpermeable molecules into the spinal cord without significant glial activation or impact on animal locomotor behavior. We demonstrate minimally invasive light delivery into the spinal cord using an optical fiber and BSCB permeability modulation in the lumbar region. Our method of BSCB modulation allows delivery of bombesin, a centrally-acting and itch-inducing peptide, into the spinal cord and induces a rapid and transient increase in itching behaviors in mice. This minimally invasive approach enables behavior modulation without genetic modifications and is promising for delivering a wide range of biologics into the spinal cord for behavior modulation and potentially therapy.

                The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is the largest neurogenic region of the postnatal forebrain, containing neural stem cells (NSCs) that emerge from both the embryonic pallium and subpallium. Despite of this dual origin, glutamatergic neurogenesis declines rapidly after birth, while gabaergic neurogenesis persists throughout life. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of the postnatal dorsal V-SVZ for unravelling the mechanisms leading to pallial lineage germinal activity silencing. We identify cell lineage-specific NSCs primed for the generation of neurons or glial cells, as well as a large population of so far uncharacterized quiescent NSCs (qNSC). Pallial qNSCs enter a state of deep quiescence, characterized by persistent TGFbeta/BMP signalling, reduced transcriptional activity and Hopx expression, whilst in contrast, subpallial qNSCs remain transcriptionally primed for activation. Induction of deep pallial quiescence is paralleled by a rapid blockade of glutamatergic neuron production and differentiation. Finally, manipulation of the TGFbeta/BMP receptor Bmpr1a demonstrate its key role in mediating these effects at early postnatal times. Together, our results highlight a central role of TGFbeta/BMP-signalling in synchronizing quiescence induction and blockade of neuronal differentiation to rapidly silence pallial germinal activity after birth.

                Predictive and reactive behaviors represent two mutually exclusive strategies for successfully completing a sensorimotor task. It is thought that predictive actions are based on the medial premotor system, in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and reactive stimulus-response behaviors rely on a lateral premotor system, in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The frontal aslant tract (FAT), a white matter tract connecting SFG and IFG, is a possible neural substrate of the predictive/reactive interactions. We used diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of 17 male and female healthy human volunteers, to dissect 3 sub-bundles of fibers belonging to the left FAT (bundles 1, 2 and 3), arising ventrally from 1) the ventral precentral gyrus, 2) midway between the PCG and pars opercularis (POp) and 3) the POp and terminating dorsally in 3 different parts of the SFG, in a caudal-rostral order. We applied online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to 6 spots, corresponding to the medial and lateral terminations of bundles 1-3 during the fixed-duration set period of a delayed reaction task, that can be solved using a predictive (anticipatory) strategy or with a reactive strategy. Results showed that TMS changed the frequency of predictive/reactive strategies only when applied over 2 spots, the SFG and IFG terminations of bundle 2. Importantly, the effects of TMS were opposite when applied to the SFG or to the IFG. Our data show that the SFG and the IFG have opposite roles in producing predictive or reactive behavior and that reciprocal integration or competition is probably mediated by the FAT.

Significance StatementAs is well-known by athletes at starting blocks, interaction with the world can occur with a predictive strategy (anticipating a GO-signal) or a reactive strategy (waiting for the GO-signal to be manifest) and they are mutually exclusive. Here we showed, by using non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS), that two specific cortical regions in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) have opposite roles in facilitating a predictive or a reactive strategy. Importantly these two very distant regions but with highly interconnected functions are specifically connected by a small white matter bundle, which probably mediates the competition between predictive and reactive strategies. More generally, we show that the implementing anatomical connectivity in TMS studies strongly reduces spatial noise.

                Rhythmic oscillations of neural activity permeate sensory systems. Studies in the visual system propose that broadband gamma oscillations (30 - 80 Hz) facilitate neuronal communication underlying visual perception. However, broadband gamma oscillations within and across visual areas show widely varying frequency and phase, providing constraints for synchronizing spike timing. Here, we analyzed data from the Allen Brain Observatory and performed new experiments that show narrowband gamma (NBG) oscillations (50 - 70 Hz) propagate and synchronize throughout the awake mouse thalamocortical visual system. Lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons fired with millisecond precision relative to NBG phase in primary visual cortex (V1) and multiple higher visual areas (HVAs). NBG in HVAs depended upon retinotopically aligned V1 activity, and neurons that fired at NBG frequencies showed enhanced functional connectivity within and across visual areas. Remarkably, LGN ON versus OFF neurons showed distinct and reliable spike timing relative to NBG oscillation phase across LGN, V1, and HVAs. Taken together, NBG oscillations may serve as a novel substrate for precise coordination of spike timing in functionally distinct subnetworks of neurons spanning multiple brain areas during awake vision

                We describe the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain (QTAB) dataset and provide a detailed methodology and technical validation to facilitate data usage. The QTAB dataset comprises multimodal neuroimaging, as well as cognitive and mental health data collected in adolescent twins over two sessions (session 1: N = 422, age 9-14 years; session 2: N = 304, 10-16 years). The MRI protocol consisted of T1-weighted (MP2RAGE), T2-weighted, FLAIR, high-resolution TSE, SWI, resting-state fMRI, DWI, and ASL scans. Two fMRI tasks were added in session 2 to probe emotion-relevant neural processes (emotional conflict task) and evoke activity in the Theory of Mind network (passive movie watching task). Outside of the scanner, we assessed cognitive function using standardised tests. We also obtained self-reports of symptoms for anxiety and depression, perceived stress, sleepiness, pubertal development measures, and risk and protective factors. We additionally collected several biological samples for genomic and metagenomic analysis. The QTAB project was established to promote health-related research in adolescence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model metamers illuminate divergences between biological and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural network models of sensory systems are often proposed to learn representational transformations with invariances like those in the brain. To reveal these invariances we generated "model metamers" -- stimuli whose activations within a model stage are matched to those of a natural stimulus. Metamers for state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised neural network models of vision and audition were often completely unrecognizable to humans when generated from deep model stages, suggesting differences between model and human invariances. Targeted model changes improved human-recognizability of model metamers, but did not eliminate the overall human-model discrepancy. The human-recognizability of a model's metamers was well predicted by their recognizability by other models, suggesting that models learn idiosyncratic invariances in addition to those required by the task. Metamer recognition dissociated from both traditional brain-based benchmarks and adversarial vulnerability, revealing a distinct failure mode of existing sensory models and providing a complementary benchmark for model assessment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variational and phase response analysis for limit cycles with hard boundaries, with applications to neuromechanical control problems</a></h4>

              
                Motor systems show an overall robustness, but because they are highly nonlinear, understanding how they achieve robustness is difficult. In many rhythmic systems, robustness against perturbations involves response of both the shape and the timing of the trajectory. This makes the study of robustness even more challenging. To understand how a motor system produces robust behaviors in a variable environment, we consider a neuromechanical model of motor patterns in the feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica {shaw2015,lyttle2017}. We established in {WGCT2021} the tools for studying combined shape and timing responses of limit cycle systems under sustained perturbations and here apply them to study robustness of the neuromechanical model against increased mechanical load during swallowing. Interestingly, we discover that nonlinear biomechanical properties confer resilience by immediately increasing resistance to applied loads. In contrast, the effect of changed sensory feedback signal is significantly delayed by the firing rates' hard boundary properties. Our analysis suggests that sensory feedback contributes to robustness in swallowing primarily by shifting the timing of neural activation involved in the power stroke of the motor cycle (retraction). This effect enables the system to generate stronger retractor muscle forces to compensate for the increased load, and hence achieve strong robustness. The approaches that we are applying to understanding a neuromechanical model in Aplysia, and the results that we have obtained, are likely to provide insights into the function of other motor systems that encounter changing mechanical loads and hard boundaries, both due to mechanical and neuronal firing properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gpr88 deletion impacts motivational control independently of striatal dopamine function</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disrupted motivational control is a common, but poorly treated, feature of psychiatric disorders. Aberrant mesolimbic dopamine signalling is implicated in motivational symptoms, however direct manipulations to these pathways have yielded suboptimal therapeutic effects. GPR88 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the striatum on medium spiny neurons, and therefore well-placed to modulate striatal signalling. While the phenotype of Gpr88 knockout mice supports a disruption of motivational pathways, it is unclear whether GPR88 is involved in reward valuation and/or effort-based decision making in a sex-dependent manner, and if this involves altered dopamine function. Methods: In male and female Gpr88 knockout mice, we used touchscreen-based progressive ratio, with and without reward devaluation, and effort-related choice tasks to assess motivation and cost/benefit decision making, respectively. To explore whether these motivational behaviours were related to altered striatal dopamine, we quantified expression of dopamine-related genes and/or proteins, and used [18F]DOPA PET and GTP{gamma}[35S] binding to assess pre- and postsynaptic dopamine function, respectively. Results: We show that male and female Gpr88 knockout mice display greater motivational drive than wild-type mice, which was maintained following reward devaluation. Further, we show that cost/benefit decision making is impaired in male, but not female, Gpr88 knockout mice. Surprisingly, we found that Gpr88 deletion had no effect on striatal dopamine by any of the measures assessed. Conclusion: Our results highlight that GPR88 regulates motivational control of behaviour through a dopaminergic-independent mechanism, providing further support for GPR88 as target for mood symptoms in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A single closed head injury in mice induces chronic, progressive white matter atrophy and increased phospho-tau expressing oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) acutely damages the brain; this injury can evolve into chronic neurodegeneration. While much is known about the chronic effects arising from multiple mild TBIs, far less is known about the long-term effects of a single moderate to severe TBI. We found that a single moderate closed head injury to mice induces diffuse axonal injury within 1-day post-injury (DPI). At 14 DPI, injured animals have atrophy of ipsilesional cortex, thalamus, and corpus callosum, with bilateral atrophy of the dorsal fornix. Atrophy of the ipsilesional corpus callosum is accompanied by decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean and radial diffusivity that remains unchanged between 14 and 180 DPI. Injured animals increased density of phospho-tau immunoreactive (pTau+) cells in the ipsilesional cortex and thalamus, and bilaterally in corpus callosum. Between 14 and 180 DPI, atrophy occurs in the ipsilesional ventral fornix, contralesional corpus callosum, and bilateral internal capsule. Diffusion tensor MRI parameters remain unchanged in white matter regions with delayed atrophy. Between 14 and 180 DPI, pTau+ cell density increases bilaterally in corpus callosum, but decreases in cortex and thalamus. The location of pTau+ cells within the ipsilesional corpus callosum changes between 14 and 180 DPI; density of all cells increases including pTau+ or pTau- cells. Greater than 90% of the pTau+ cells are in the oligodendrocyte lineage in both gray and white matter. Density of thioflavin-S+ cells in thalamus increases by 180 DPI. These data suggest a single closed head impact produces multiple forms of chronic neurodegeneration. Gray and white matter regions proximal to the impact site undergo rapid atrophy. More distal white matter regions undergo chronic, progressive white matter atrophy with an increasing density of oligodendrocytes containing pTau. These data suggest that the chronic neurodegeneration arising from a single moderate CHI differs greatly from the chronic traumatic encephalopathy produced by multiple mild head injuries.

HighlightsGray and white matter atrophy begins within 14 days after a single closed head injury

White matter atrophy progresses between 14 and 180 days post injury with minimal changes in diffusion tensor MRI parameters.

CHI increases the density of oligodendrocytes with perinuclear accumulation of phosphorylated tau

Thioflavin-S+ cells increase in thalamus at 180 days post injury

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prelimbic cortex neural encoding dynamically tracks expected outcome value</a></h4>

              
                Animals must modify their behavior based on updated expected outcomes in a changing environment. Prelimbic cortex (PrL) neural encoding during learning predicts and is necessary for appropriately altering behavior based on new expected outcome value following devaluation. We aimed to determine how PrL neural activity encodes reward predictive cues after the expected outcome value of those cues is decreased following conditioned taste aversion. In one post- devaluation session, rats were tested under extinction to determine their ability alter their behavior to the expected outcome values (i.e., extinction test). In a second post-devaluation session, rats were tested with the newly devalued outcome delivered so that the rats experienced the updated outcome value within the session (i.e., re-exposure test). We found that PrL neural encoding to the cue associated with the devalued reward predicted the ability of rats to suppress behavior in the extinction test session, but not in the re-exposure test session. While all rats were able to successfully devalue the outcome during conditioned taste aversion, a subset of rats continued to consume the devalued outcome in the re-exposure test session. We found differential patterns of PrL neural encoding in the population of rats that did not avoid the devalued outcome during the re-exposure test compared to the rats that successfully avoided the devalued outcome. Our findings suggest that PrL neural encoding dynamically tracks expected outcome values, and differential neural encoding in the PrL to reward predictive cues following expected outcome value changes may contribute to distinct behavioral phenotypes.

                Patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases often lose the ability to communicate, detrimentally affecting their quality of life. One promising solution to restore communication is to decode signals directly from the brain to enable neural speech prostheses. However, decoding has been limited by coarse recordings, which inadequately capture the rich spatio-temporal structure of human brain signals. To resolve this limitation, we performed novel high-resolution, micro-electrocorticographic (uECoG) neural recordings during speech production. We obtained neural signals with 56x spatial resolution and 2.5x higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to standard invasive recordings. This increased signal quality nearly doubled decoding accuracy compared to standard intracranial signals. Accurate decoding was dependent on the high-spatial resolution of the neural interface. Further, non-linear decoding models designed to utilize enhanced spatio-temporal neural information produced better results than standard techniques. We show for the first time that micro-scale neural interfaces can enable high-quality speech decoding for neural speech prostheses.

                Microglia is one of the major immune cell types in the human brain and plays pivotal roles in regulating inflammatory and immune response in healthy as well as disease states. By analyzing whole transcriptomic data derived from a large cohort of postmortem cortex tissues, we identified two distinct microglial subtypes within the population. The main difference between the two subtypes lies in the differential expression levels of the C1q complex components, Fc {gamma} receptor (CD16) components and CD14. We validated our discovery in independent cohorts of brain autopsy tissues as well as in RNA-seq data generated from isolated microglia. Future investigations into the causes and physiological implications of these subtypes may shed more light on the homeostasis and regulation of the immune related processes in the brain.

The sensory capacity of a neuron depends on the elaboration of its dendritic arbor and the delivery of sensory ion channels to the dendritic membrane. However, it is not well understood how ion channels are trafficked to sensory dendrites and whether their delivery is coordinated with dendrite growth. We investigated the trafficking of the DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel Pickpocket (Ppk) in peripheral sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering to tag endogenous Ppk1 and visualize it live, including monitoring Ppk1 membrane localization via a novel secreted split-GFP approach. Strikingly, Ppk1 is present throughout the membrane of actively growing dendrites, and Ppk1 density scales in proportion to dendritic membrane, even when dynein-mediated transport to dendrites is disrupted. Our data suggest that Ppk1 is integral to the membrane of growing dendrites and implicate the recycling endosome GTPase Rab11 in the forward trafficking of Ppk1 to dendrites. Together, our results suggest that Ppk channel transport is coordinated with dendrite morphogenesis, thus ensuring proper ion channel levels and distribution in sensory dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maximum a posteriori natural scene reconstruction from retinal ganglion cells with deep denoiser priors</a></h4>

              
                A fraction of the visual information arriving at the retina is transmitted to the brain by signals in the optic nerve, and the brain must rely solely on these signals to make inferences about the visual world. Previous work has probed the visual information contained in retinal signals by reconstructing images from retinal activity using linear regression and nonlinear regression with neural networks. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction offers a more general and principled approach. We develop a novel method for approximate MAP reconstruction by combining a generalized linear model of light responses in retinal neurons and their dependence on spike history and spikes of neighboring cells, with an image prior implicitly embedded in a deep convolutional neural network trained for image denoising. We use this method to reconstruct natural images from ex vivo simultaneously- recorded spikes of hundreds of ganglion cells uniformly sampling a region of the retina. The method produces reconstructions that match or exceed the state-of-the-art in perceptual similarity and exhibit additional fine detail, while using substantially fewer model parameters than previous approaches. The use of more rudimentary encoding models (a linear-nonlinear-Poisson cascade) or image priors (a 1/F spectral model) significantly reduces reconstruction performance, indicating the essential role of both components in achieving high-quality reconstructed images from the retinal signal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus as a generative circuit for predictive coding of future sequences</a></h4>

              
                The interaction between hippocampus and cortex is key to memory formation and representation learning. Based on anatomical wiring and transmission delays, we proposed a self-supervised recurrent neural network (PredRAE) with a predictive reconstruction loss to account for the cognitive functions of hippocampus. This framework extends predictive coding in the time axis and incorporates predictive features in Bayes filters for temporal prediction. In simulations, we were able to reproduce characteristic place cell features such as one-shot plasticity, localized spatial representation and replay, which marks the trace of memory formation. The simulated place cells also exhibited precise spike timing, evidenced by phase precession. Trained on MNIST sequences, PredRAE learned the underlying temporal dependencies and a spontaneous representation of digit labels and rotation dynamics in the linear transformation of its hidden unit activities. Such learning is robust against 16 different image corruptions. Inspired by the brain circuit, the simple and concise framework has great potential to approximate human performance with its capacity to robustly disentangle representations and generalize temporal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extended practice improves the accuracy and efficiency of goal-directed reaching guided by supplemental kinesthetic vibrotactile feedback</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies have shown that providing task-specific vibrotactile feedback (VTF) during reaching and stabilizing with the arm can immediately improve the accuracy and efficiency. However, such studies typically evaluate performance after less than 1 hour of practice using VTF. Here we tested the effects of extended practice using supplemental kinesthetic VTF on goal-directed reaching with the arm. Healthy young adults performed a primary reaching task and a secondary choice reaction task individually and as a dual-task. The reaching task was performed under three feedback conditions: visual feedback, proprioceptive feedback, and with supplemental kinesthetic VTF applied to the non-moving arm. We compared performances before, during, and after approximately 10 hours of practice on the VTF-guided reaching task, distributed across 20 practice sessions. Upon initial exposure to VTF-guided reaching, participants were immediately able to use the VTF to improve reaching accuracy. Performance improvements were retained from one practice session to the next. After 10 hours of practice, the accuracy and temporal efficiency of VTF-guided reaching were equivalent to or better than reaching performed without vision or VTF. However, hand paths during VTF-guided reaching exhibited a persistent strategy whereby movements were decomposed into discrete sub-movements along the cardinal axes of the VTF interface. Dual-tasking capability also improved, such that the primary and secondary tasks we performed more concurrently after extended practice. Our results demonstrate that extended practice on VTF-guided reaching can yield performance improvements that accrue in a manner increasingly resistant to dual-task interference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal origin of mouse claustrum and development of its cortical projections</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is known for its extensive connectivity with many other forebrain regions, but its elongated shape and deep location have made further study difficult. We have sought to understand when mouse claustrum neurons are born, where they are located in developing brains and when they develop their widespread connections to cortex. We established that a well-characterised parvalbumin-plexus, which identifies the claustrum in adults, is only present from postnatal day (P)21. A myeloarchitectonic outline of the claustrum can be derived from a triangular fibre arrangement from P15. A dense patch of Nurr1+ cells is present at its core, and is already evident at birth. BrdU-birthdating of forebrain progenitors reveals that the majority of claustrum neurons are born during a narrow time window centred on embryonic day (E)12.5, which is later than the adjacent subplate and endopiriform nucleus. Retrograde tracing revealed that claustrum projections to anterior cingulate (ACA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) follow distinct developmental trajectories. Claustrum-ACA connectivity matures rapidly, and reaches adult-like innervation density by P10, whereas claustrum-RSP innervation emerges later over a protracted time window. This work establishes the timeline of claustrum development, and provides a framework for understanding how the claustrum is built and develops its unique connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain morphometric changes in congenitally blind subjects: a 7 Tesla MRI study</a></h4>

              
                We used ultra-high field (7 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at submillimeter resolution to assess structural brain changes in congenitally blind (CB) compared to matched normal sighted control (SC) subject groups. Region-of-interest analysis revealed grey matter (GM) volumetric reductions in the CB group in left cuneus and occipital pole, right posterior collateral sulcus and right occipito-temporal medial lingual sulcus. Non-visual areas with GM reductions in CB included the left central, postcentral and superior frontal gyri, and the right subcallosal gyrus. In contrast, there were no significant group differences in cortical thickness when using stringent statistical criteria. Regional differences in white matter (WM) showed an overall pattern similar as that of GM changes, characterized by volume reductions in occipital, parietal and temporal areas, but with additional reductions in precuneus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Differences in cortical curvature were mostly situated in the occipital cortex and bore a close relationship with areas showing GM alterations; they may be indicative of increased cortico-cortical connectivity of the visually-deprived occipital cortex. The CB group had GM reductions in the basal ganglia, i.e., caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and thalamus. Within the cerebellum, GM and WM volumes were also reduced in the CB. Segmentation of the thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala into anatomic divisions revealed GM reductions in a number of thalamic nuclei, a few hippocampal regions, but not within amygdala. There were no findings of increased volume or cortical thickness in the CB group. Together, these data reveal a multitude of GM and WM reductions in CB, comprising not only the occipital cortex, but also temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as well as the basal ganglia and cerebellum. These findings in the CB stand may seem at odds with the large literature showing that the visually-deprived occipital cortex becomes a multimodal cortex responding to diverse non-visual sensory and cognitive inputs. The seeming mismatch between morphological atrophy and enhanced multimodality of occipital areas combined with superior performance by the CB in various non-visual tasks poses a challenge for our understanding of brain plasticity.

                Many recent studies have documented links between circuit-, network-, and brain-level mechanisms supporting the initiation of working memory-guided behaviors. However, few have examined how sensorimotor representations stored in working memory are used to plan future behaviors. We leverage the high temporal resolution of human EEG recordings to show that when planning future memory-guided behaviors the brain switches from an initial joint visuomotor code to a subsequent motor-only code.

	<p>Male predominance is a known feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although ASD mouse models can be useful for elucidating mechanisms underlying abnormal behaviors relevant to human ASD, suitable models to analyze sex differences in ASD pathogenesis remain insufficient. Herein, we used collapsin response mediator protein 4 (Crmp4)-knockout (KO) mice exhibiting ASD-like phenotypes in a male-predominant manner and analyzed ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to detect potential differences between genotypes and sexes during the early postnatal period. We recorded isolation-induced USVs emitted from wild-type (WT) and Crmp4-KO littermates and compared the total number of USVs between genotypes and sexes. We classified USVs into 10 types based on internal pitch changes, lengths, and shapes and compared the number of USVs in each type by genotypes and sex. Male Crmp4-KO mice exhibited a reduction in the total number of USVs. Crmp4-KO decreased the number of USVs in 7 out of 10 USV types, and male KO mice exhibited a greater reduction than females in 3 of the 7 types. This study offers a suitable ASD animal model and tool for assessing sex-based communication deficits during the early postnatal period, both of which would be valuable for elucidating the underlying mechanism.</p>

	<p>Models on L3/Ln acquisition differ with respect to how they envisage degree (holistic vs. selective transfer of the L1, L2 or both) and/or timing (initial stages vs. development) of how the influence of source languages unfolds. This study uses EEG/ERPs to examine these models, bringing together two types of bilinguals: heritage speakers (HSs) (Italian-German, n = 15) compared to adult L2 learners (L1 German, L2 English, n = 28) learning L3/Ln Latin. Participants were trained on a selected Latin lexicon over two sessions and, afterward, on two grammatical properties: case (similar between German and Latin) and adjective&amp;amp;ndash;noun order (similar between Italian and Latin). Neurophysiological findings show an N200/N400 deflection for the HSs in case morphology and a P600 effect for the German L2 group in adjectival position. None of the current L3/Ln models predict the observed results, which questions the appropriateness of this methodology. Nevertheless, the results are illustrative of differences in how HSs and L2 learners approach the very initial stages of additional language learning, the implications of which are discussed.</p>

	<p>The pathological basis of migraine is not fully understood. Familial hemiplegic migraines (FHM) are monogenic forms of severe migraine, caused by mutations in genes encoding various neuronal and/or astrocytic ion transporting proteins. The leading hypothesis regarding the mechanism underlying migraine in FHM is that enhanced electrical excitability leads to increased extracellular potassium levels with subsequent cortical spreading depression. In this short commentary we would like to propose an additional mechanism distinct from enhanced electrical excitability per se. Rather, we propose that FHM mutations cause substantially increased energy expenditure of neurons for re-establishing ion gradients and/or for increased synaptic activity, a mechanism we call neuronal fatigue. Such a metabolic mechanism had been proposed earlier for common migraine and has received recent experimental evidence in particular for the case of FHM3. The hypothesis could be tested in future studies of FHM related models that would need to take metabolic parameters into account.</p>

	<p>Depressive disorders are common among people with epilepsy (PwE). We here aimed to report an unbiased automatic classification of epilepsy comorbid depressive disorder cases via training a linear support vector machine (SVM) model using the interictal heart rate variability (HRV) data. One hundred and eighty-six subjects participated in this study. Among all participants, we recorded demographic information, epilepsy states and neuropsychiatric features. For each subject, we performed simultaneous electrocardiography and electroencephalography recordings both in wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage. Using these data, we systematically explored the full parameter space in order to determine the most effective combinations of data to classify the depression status in PwE. PwE with depressive disorders exhibited significant alterations in HRV parameters, including decreased time domain and nonlinear domain values both in wakefulness and NREM sleep stage compared with without depressive disorders and non-epilepsy controls. Interestingly, PwE without depressive disorder showed the same level of HRV values as the non-epilepsy control subjects. The SVM classification model of PwE depression status achieved a higher classification accuracy with the combination of HRV parameters in wakefulness and NREM sleep stage. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the SVM classification model showed a satisfying area under the ROC curve (AUC: 0.758). Intriguingly, we found that the HRV measurements during NREM sleep are particularly important for correct classification, suggesting a mechanistic link between the dysregulation of heart rate during sleep and the development of depressive disorders in PwE. Our classification model may provide an objective measurement to assess the depressive status in PwE.</p>

	<p>Sitting ability in the early post-stroke phase affects functional balance ability and other prognoses. We investigated whether dynamic sitting exercise with delayed visual feedback in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions affected postural control in the early post-stroke phase. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 27 hemiparetic stroke patients were randomized to experimental (n = 13) and control (n = 14) groups. Dynamic sitting exercise (30 times/day, 5 days/week) in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions, with 500-ms-delayed (experimental group) or real-time (control group) visual feedback on a computer, was added to usual physical therapy. We evaluated the postural assessment scale for stroke (PASS), static and dynamic sitting balance tasks, the five-times sit-to-stand test, trunk impairment scale, functional ambulation category, and functional independence measure&amp;amp;ndash;motor items. In intention-to-treat analysis, the experimental group demonstrated a significant intervention effect on the PASS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The mean percentage of body weight on the moving side in the lateral sitting task and the number of successes in the five-times sit-to-stand test were significantly higher in the experimental group than those in the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Thus, the proposed exercise improves postural control, dynamic sitting balance, and sit-to-stand ability in early post-stroke patients.</p>

	<p>This paper a novel core-strengthening intervention (CSI) delivered using the AllCore360&amp;amp;deg;, a device that targets trunk muscles through a systematic, high-intensity rotating-plank exercise. Three individuals (age: 61.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.2 years; range: 58&amp;amp;ndash;64 years) with post-stroke hemiplegia participated in 12-sessions of the CSI. The participants completed up to 142 rotating planks at inclination angles (IAs) that ranged from 40&amp;amp;deg; to 65&amp;amp;deg;, over 12 sessions. The interventional effects on the functional outcomes of trunk performance, balance and mobility were assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test, the 10-m walk test (10MWT), and the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Postural outcomes were assessed using the center of pressure (CoP) data recorded during quiet standing on a balance platform, and neuromuscular outcomes were assessed using electromyography (EMG) during AllCore360&amp;amp;deg; rotations. All participants completed the CSI (minimum of 120 rotations), demonstrating the feasibility of the CSI in chronic stroke. The CoP data suggested improved lateral control of posture during standing across participants (averaging an over 30% reduction in lateral sway), while the EMG data revealed the ability of the CSI to systematically modulate trunk muscle responses. In summary, the current investigation presents the feasibility of a novel delivery method for core strengthening to maximize rehabilitation outcomes in the chronic phase of stroke.</p>

	<p>Plants and animals are among the most behaviorally significant superordinate categories for humans. Visually assigning objects to such high-level classes is challenging because highly distinct items must be grouped together (e.g., chimpanzees and geckos) while more similar items must sometimes be separated (e.g., stick insects and twigs). As both animals and plants typically possess complex multi-limbed shapes, the perceptual organization of shape into parts likely plays a crucial rule in identifying them. Here, we identify a number of distinctive growth characteristics that affect the spatial arrangement and properties of limbs, yielding useful cues for differentiating plants from animals. We developed a novel algorithm based on shape skeletons to create many novel object pairs that differ in their part structure but are otherwise very similar. We found that particular part organizations cause stimuli to look systematically more like plants or animals. We then generated other 110 sequences of shapes morphing from animal- to plant-like appearance by modifying three aspects of part structure: sprouting parts, curvedness of parts, and symmetry of part pairs. We found that all three parameters correlated strongly with human animal/plant judgments. Together our findings suggest that subtle changes in the properties and organization of parts can provide powerful cues in superordinate categorization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus between the tonsillar fibrous capsule and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis, whereas bilateral peritonsillar abscess is rare. The incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess remains unknown but is estimated to be 4.9% of all peritonsillar abscess cases. Case report: A 20-year-old man came to the emergency room with bilateral peritonsillar abscess and complaining of shortness of breath for two weeks. Physical examination showed muffled voice, 82% oxygen saturation, and inspiratory stridor. The isthmus faucium was narrow, with approximately 30% remaining. Peritonsillar puncture revealed pus mixed with blood. The treatment for this patient included bilateral peritonsillar incision and drainage and intravenous antibiotics of levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient came to the Ear, Nose, Throat, Head, and Neck (ENTHN) Outpatient Unit eight days after the procedure for a control checkup and was in good condition. Conclusion: We have reported a bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction, in which we performed incision and drainage. Prompt and appropriate management is needed to avoid unwanted morbidity and mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ALL-IN meta-analysis: breathing life into living systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Science is justly admired as a cumulative process (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), yet scientific knowledge is typically built on a patchwork of research contributions without much coordination. This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations for living systematic reviews and against research waste. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides statistical methodology for a meta-analysis that can be updated at any time—reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error guarantees, live—no need to prespecify the looks, and leading—in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information. We illustrate the method for time-to-event data, showing how synthesizing data at interim stages of studies can increase efficiency when studies are slow in themselves to provide the necessary number of events for completion. The meta-analysis can be performed on interim data, but does not have to. The analysis design requires no information about the number of patients in trials or the number of trials eventually included. So it can breathe life into living systematic reviews, through better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

                Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 was first documented in Indonesia in 2017. It has become prevalent in chickens in many provinces of Indonesia as a result of reassortment in live bird markets. Low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H9N2 virus-infected poultry provides a new direction for influenza virus. According to the latest research, the Indonesian H9N2 viruses may have developed through antigenic drift into new genotype, posing a significant hazard to poultry and public health. The latest proof of interspecies transmission proposes that, the next human pandemic variant will be avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. Manipulation and elimination of H9N2 viruses in Indonesia, constant surveillance of viral mutation, and vaccines updates are required to achieve effectiveness. The current review examines should be investigates/assesses/report on the development and evolution of newly identified H9N2 viruses in Indonesia and their vaccination strategy.
