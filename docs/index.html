              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter microstructural and morphometric alterations in autism: Implications for intellectual and verbal capabilities</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuroimage literature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a moderate-to-high risk of bias, partially because those combined with intellectual impairment (II) and/or minimally verbal (MV) status are generally ignored. We aimed to provide more comprehensive insights into white matter alterations of ASD, inclusive of individuals with II (ASD-II-Only) or MV expression (ASD-MV). Methods: Sixty-five participants with ASD (ASD-Whole; 16.6{+/-}5.9 years; comprising 34 intellectually able youth, ASD-IA, and 31 intellectually impaired youth, ASD-II, including 24 ASD-II-Only plus 7 ASD-MV) and 38 demographic-matched typically developing controls (TDC; 17.3{+/-}5.6 years) were scanned in accelerated diffusion-weighted MRI. Fixel-based analysis was undertaken to investigate the categorical differences in fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and a combined index (FDC), and brain-symptom/cognition associations. Results: ASD-Whole had reduced FD in the anterior and posterior corpus callosum and left cerebellum Crus I, and smaller FDC in right cerebellum Crus II, compared to TDC. ASD-II, relative to TDC, showed almost identical alterations to those from ASD-Whole vs. TDC. ASD-II-Only had greater FD/FDC in the isthmus-splenium of callosum than ASD-MV. Autistic severity negatively correlated with FC in right Crus I. Non-verbal full-scale IQ positively correlated with FC/FDC in cerebellum VI. FD/FDC of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed a diagnosis-by-executive function interaction. Conclusions: ASD-associated white matter alterations appear driven by individuals combined with II and/or MV. Results suggest that changes in the corpus callosum and cerebellum are key for psychopathology and cognition associated with ASD. Our work highlights an essential to include understudied sub-populations on the spectrum in research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking functional connectivity by the structure and geometry of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structural connectivity supports the propagation of electrical impulses, manifesting as patterns of co-activation, termed functional connectivity. Functional connectivity emerges from the underlying sparse structural connections, particularly through poly-synaptic communication. As a result, functional connections between brain regions without direct structural links are numerous, but their organization is not completely understood. Here we investigate the organization of functional connections without direct structural links. We develop a simple, data-driven method to benchmark functional connections with respect to their underlying structural and geometric embedding. We then use this method to re-weigh and re-express functional connectivity. We find evidence of unexpectedly strong functional connectivity within the canonical intrinsic networks of the brain. We also find unexpectedly strong functional connectivity at the apex of the unimodal-transmodal hierarchy. Our results suggest that both phenomena -- functional modules and functional hierarchies -- emerge from functional interactions that transcend the underlying structure and geometry. These findings also potentially explain recent reports that structural and functional connectivity gradually diverge in transmodal cortex. Collectively, we show how structural connectivity and geometry can be used as a natural frame of reference with which to study functional connectivity patterns in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representations of temporal community structure in hippocampus and precuneus predict inductive reasoning decisions</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the world is shaped by inferences about underlying structure. For example, at the gym, you might notice that the same people tend to arrive around the same time and infer that they are friends that work out together. Consistent with this idea, after participants are presented with a temporal sequence of objects that follows an underlying community structure, they are biased to infer that objects from the same community share the same properties. Here, we used fMRI to measure neural representations of objects after temporal community structure learning and examine how these representations support inference about object relationships. We found that community structure learning affected inferred object similarity: when asked to spatially group items based on their experience, participants tended to group together objects from the same community. Neural representations in perirhinal cortex predicted individual differences in object grouping, suggesting that high-level object representations are affected by temporal community learning. Furthermore, participants were biased to infer that objects from the same community would share the same properties. Using computational modeling of temporal learning and inference decisions, we found that inductive reasoning is influenced by both detailed knowledge of temporal statistics and abstract knowledge of the temporal communities. The fidelity of temporal community representations in hippocampus and precuneus predicted the degree to which temporal community membership biased reasoning decisions. Our results suggest that temporal knowledge is represented at multiple levels of abstraction, and that perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and precuneus may support inference based on this knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus-striatum wiring diagram revealed by directed stepwise polysynaptic tracing</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and the striatum represent two major systems in the brain for learning, memory and navigation. Although they were traditionally considered as two parallel systems responsible for distinct types of learning or navigation, increasing evidence indicates a close synergetic or competitive interaction between them. Both the hippocampus and the striatum consist of multiple anatomical and functional domains. Besides the limited direct projection from the hippocampus to the ventral striatum, most of the functional interaction between them may be mediated by polysynaptic projections. Polysynaptic connectivity has been difficult to examine due to a lack of methods to continuously track the pathways in a controlled manner. Here we developed a novel approach for directed stepwise polysynaptic tracing by reconstituting a replication-deficient retrograde transneuronal virus - pseudorabies virus lacking gene IE180 (PRV{Delta}IE. We minimized PRV neurotoxicity by temporally restricting viral replication; and enabled both anatomical tracing and functional analysis of the circuits. With these tools, we delineated a hippocampus striatum wiring diagram, which consists of pathways from specific functional domains in the hippocampus to corresponding domains in the striatum via distinct intermediate regions. This polysynaptic wring diagram provides a structural foundation for further elucidation of the interaction between the hippocampus and the stratum in multiple brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-based binding as a solution to and a limitation for flexible cognition</a></h4>

              
                Why can't we keep as many items as we want in working memory? It has long been debated whether this resource limitation is a bug (a downside of our fallible biological system) or instead a feature (an optimal response to a computational problem). We propose that the resource limitation is a consequence of a useful feature. Specifically, we propose that flexible cognition requires time-based binding, and time-based binding necessarily limits the number of (bound) memoranda that can be stored simultaneously. Time-based binding is most naturally instantiated via neural oscillations, for which there exists ample experimental evidence. We report simulations that illustrate this theory and that relate it to empirical data. We also compare the theory to several other (feature and bug) resource theories.

	<p>The ability to efficiently recognize the emotions on others’ faces is something that most of us take for granted. Children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits and impulsivity/conduct problems (ICP), such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, have been previously described as being “fear blind”. This is also associated with looking less at the eye regions of fearful faces, which are highly diagnostic. Previous attempts to intervene into emotion recognition strategies have not had lasting effects on participants’ fear recognition abilities. Here we present both (a) additional evidence that there is a two-part causal chain, from personality traits to face recognition strategies using the eyes, then from strategies to rates of recognizing fear in others; and (b) a pilot intervention that had persistent effects for weeks after the end of instruction. Further, the intervention led to more change in those with the highest CU traits. This both clarifies the specific mechanisms linking personality to emotion recognition and shows that the process is fundamentally malleable. It is possible that such training could promote empathy and reduce the rates of antisocial behavior in specific populations in the future.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a common mental illness and a large number of researchers have been still devoted to exploring effective biomarkers for the identification of depression. Few researches have been conducted on functional connectivity (FC) during sleep in depression. In this paper, a novel depression characterization is proposed using specific spatial FC features of sleep electroencephalography (EEG). Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 26 healthy individuals and 25 patients with depression. The weighted phase lag indexes (WPLIs) of four frequency bands and five sleep periods were obtained from 16 EEG channels. The high discriminative connections extracted via feature evaluation and the cross-within variation (CW)—the spatial feature constructed to characterize the different performances in inter- and intra-hemispheric FC based on WPLIs, were utilized to classify patients and normal controls. The results showed that enhanced average FC and spatial differences, higher inter-hemispheric FC and lower intra-hemispheric FC, were found in patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in the inter-hemispheric connections of the temporal lobe in the theta band should be important indicators of depression. Finally, both CW and high discriminative WPLI features performed well in depression screening and CW was more specific for characterizing abnormal cortical EEG performance of depression. Our work investigated and characterized the abnormalities in sleep cortical activity in patients with depression, and may provide potential biomarkers for assisting with depression identification and new insights into the understanding of pathological mechanisms in depression.</p>

                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Team Flow Is a Unique Brain State Associated with Enhanced Information Integration and Interbrain Synchrony</a></h4>

              
                <p>Team flow occurs when a group functions in a high task engagement to achieve a goal, commonly seen in performance and sports. Team flow can enable enhanced positive experiences, as compared with individual flow or regular socializing. However, the neural basis for this enhanced behavioral state remains unclear. Here, we identified neural correlates (NCs) of team flow in human participants using a music rhythm task with electroencephalogram hyperscanning. Experimental manipulations held the motor task constant while disrupting the corresponding hedonic music to interfere with the flow state or occluding the partner&rsquo;s positive feedback to impede team interaction. We validated these manipulations by using psychometric ratings and an objective measure for the depth of flow experience, which uses the auditory-evoked potential (AEP) of a task-irrelevant stimulus. Spectral power analysis at both the scalp sensors and anatomic source levels revealed higher &beta;- power specific to team flow in the left middle temporal cortex (L-MTC). Causal interaction analysis revealed that the L-MTC is downstream in information processing and receives information from areas encoding the flow or social states. The L-MTC significantly contributes to integrating information. Moreover, we found that team flow enhances global interbrain integrated information (II) and neural synchrony. We conclude that the NCs of team flow induce a distinct brain state. Our results suggest a neurocognitive mechanism to create this unique experience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of Trigeminal Sensory Neuronal Types Innervating Masseter Muscle</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Understanding masseter muscle (MM) innervation is critical for the study of cell-specific mechanisms of pain induced by temporomandibular disorder (TMDs) or after facial surgery. Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to non-peptidergic IB-4<sup>+</sup>/TRPA1<sup>&ndash;</sup> or IB-4<sup>+</sup>/TRPA1<sup>+</sup> groups, while two TRPV1<sup>+</sup> small-sized neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP<sup>+</sup>. One small-sized CGRP<sup>+</sup> neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from Nav1.8<sup>&ndash;</sup> or trkC<sup>+</sup> neurons. The remaining CGRP<sup>+</sup> neurons were medium-sized, could be divided into Nav1.8<sup>&ndash;</sup>/trkC<sup>&ndash;</sup> and Nav1.8<sup>low</sup>/trkC<sup>+</sup> clusters, and showed large 5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC<sup>+</sup> and had no Nav1.8 and CGRP. Among MM TG neurons, TRPV1<sup>+</sup>/CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup> (somatostatin<sup>+</sup>), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)<sup>+</sup> (C-LTMR), TRPM8<sup>+</sup>, MrgprA3<sup>+</sup>, or trkB<sup>+</sup> (A-LTMR) subtypes have not been detected. Masseteric muscle fibers, tendons and masseteric fascia in mice and the common marmoset, a new world monkey, were exclusively innervated by either CGRP<sup>+</sup>/NFH<sup>+</sup> or CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup>/NFH<sup>+</sup> medium-to-large neurons, which we found using a Nav1.8-YFP reporter, and labeling with CGRP, TRPV1, neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) and pgp9.5 antibodies. These nerves were mainly distributed in tendon and at junctions of deep-middle-superficial parts of MM. Overall, the data presented here demonstrates that MM is innervated by a distinct subset of TG neurons, which have unique characteristics and innervation patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Individual bacteria in structured environments rely on phenotypic resistance to phage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erin L. Attrill, Rory Claydon, Urszula Łapińska, Mario Recker, Sean Meaden, Aidan T. Brown, Edze R. Westra, Sarah V. Harding, Stefano Pagliara</p>

Bacteriophages represent an avenue to overcome the current antibiotic resistance crisis, but evolution of genetic resistance to phages remains a concern. In vitro, bacteria evolve genetic resistance, preventing phage adsorption or degrading phage DNA. In natural environments, evolved resistance is lower possibly because the spatial heterogeneity within biofilms, microcolonies, or wall populations favours phenotypic survival to lytic phages. However, it is also possible that the persistence of genetically sensitive bacteria is due to less efficient phage amplification in natural environments, the existence of refuges where bacteria can hide, and a reduced spread of resistant genotypes. Here, we monitor the interactions between individual planktonic bacteria in isolation in ephemeral refuges and bacteriophage by tracking the survival of individual cells. We find that in these transient spatial refuges, phenotypic resistance due to reduced expression of the phage receptor is a key determinant of bacterial survival. This survival strategy is in contrast with the emergence of genetic resistance in the absence of ephemeral refuges in well-mixed environments. Predictions generated via a mathematical modelling framework to track bacterial response to phages reveal that the presence of spatial refuges leads to fundamentally different population dynamics that should be considered in order to predict and manipulate the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of bacteria–phage interactions in naturally structured environments.

                Background: Major Depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous, multi-etiological disorder that is associated with chronic medical conditions and a high somatic treatment burden. A better understanding of the somatic diseases and treatment burden in MDD can be provided through a mapping of the somatic drug utilization patterns over time. The objective of this study is therefore to characterize the somatic drug profiles and their transitions over time (i.e. trajectories) among MDD patients.    Methods: This descriptive study will be a nationwide register-based study including all Danish patients with an incident MDD diagnosis between 2011 and 2015. Using Latent Class Analysis, we will identify homogenous MDD patient subgroups according to somatic drug utilization (i.e. drug profiles). The development in somatic drug profiles will be depicted in four different time intervals from three years prior to the MDD diagnosis to three years after the diagnosis. Patients will be assigned to the latent class (drug profile) to which they have the highest probability of belonging using modal assignment. The treatment trajectories will be performed by cross tabulating these assignments.  Discussion: Profiles and trajectories of somatic drug use will provide a new perspective on patterns of somatic drug burden in MDD patients. Moreover, identifying homogenous subgroups of MDD patients regarding somatic drug use can contribute to a deeper understanding of MDD etiology. In the future, this knowledge could help optimizing MDD treatment by studying if different antidepressants will show different efficacy and safety depending on the profiles and trajectories of somatic diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Deep supervised hashing for gait retrieval [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gait recognition is perceived as the most promising biometric approach for future decades especially because of its efficient applicability in surveillance systems. Due to recent growth in the use of gait biometrics across surveillance systems, the ability to rapidly search for the required data has become an emerging need. Therefore, we addressed the gait retrieval problem, which retrieves people with gaits similar to a query subject from a large-scale dataset. Methods: This paper presents the deep gait retrieval hashing (DGRH) model to address the gait retrieval problem for large-scale datasets. Our proposed method is based on a supervised hashing method with a deep convolutional network. We use the ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the semantic gait features for feature representation and learn the compact hash codes with the compatible hash function. Therefore, our DGRH model combines gait feature learning with binary hash codes. In addition, the learning loss is designed with a classification loss function that learns to preserve similarity and a quantization loss function that controls the quality of the hash codes Results: The proposed method was evaluated against the CASIA-B, OUISIR-LP, and OUISIR-MVLP benchmark datasets and received the promising result for gait retrieval tasks. Conclusions: The end-to-end deep supervised hashing model is able to learn discriminative gait features and is efficient in terms of the storage memory and speed for gait retrieval.

                Background: Lack of reproducibility in preclinical research is a problem posing ethical and economic challenges for biomedical science. Various institutional activities from society stakeholders of leading industry nations are currently underway to improve the situation. Such initiatives usually attempt to tackle high-level organisational issues and do not typically focus on improving experimental approaches per se. Addressing these is necessary in order to increase consistency and success rates of lab-to-lab repetitions. Methods: In this project, we statistically evaluated repetitive data of a very basic and widely applied lab procedure, namely quantifying the number of viable cells. The purpose of this was to appreciate the impact of different parameters and instrumentations that may constitute sources of variance in this procedure. Conclusion: By comparing the variations of data acquired under two different procedures, featuring improved stringency of protocol adherence, our project attempts to propose guidelines on how to reduce such variations. We believe our work can contribute to tackling the repeatability crisis in biomedical research.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Ultrastructure of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar projections in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins defines two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

                <p>Difficulty retrieving proper names is common in older adults, coinciding with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in mid-life. We investigated the ability of healthy older adults to retrieve the names of famous faces in relation to positron emission tomography measurements of amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Development of astrocyte morphology and function in mouse visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labelled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheath retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">50 years of mnemonic persistent activity: quo vadis?</a></h4>

              
                Half a century ago persistent spiking activity in the neocortex was discovered to be a neural substrate of working memory. Since then scientists have sought to understand this core cognitive function across biological and computational levels. Studies are reviewed here that cumulatively lend support to a synaptic theory of recurrent circuits for mnemonic persistent activity that depends on various cellular and network substrates and is mathematically described by a multiple-attractor network model.

                Gastrulation in humans and non-rodent mammals occurs in bilaminar-disc embryos, unlike egg cylinders in rodents. Using stem cells and single-cell cellular and molecular approaches, Kobayashi et al. show the germline origin in bilaminar-disc rabbit embryos. The evident similarity with human embryos underlines the significance of the rabbit model.

This change in epithelial mechanics appears to compensate for the permanent loss of muscle fibers, which is necessary for efficient abdominal bending in the fruit fly.

                tDCS delivers a weak current across the brain. Vasu and Kaphzan show that a weak electrical field modifies the opening/closing dynamics of voltage-dependent sodium channels in axon terminals. The modified sodium channels nonlinearly amplify the terminal polarization. Thus, the amplified terminal polarization further modulates presynaptic vesicles release from axon terminals.

                Heterogeneity undermines PNEN management. Yang et al. identify and characterize four subgroups of PNENs with mutational, transcriptomic, and proteomic differences. They report dysregulation in cellular signaling axes that may be further exploited to facilitate patient stratification and treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Secondary metabolites of Hülle cells mediate protection of fungal reproductive and overwintering structures against fungivorous animals</a></h4>

              
                Fungal Hülle cells with nuclear storage and developmental backup functions are reminiscent of multipotent stem cells. In the soil, Hülle cells nurse the overwintering fruiting bodies of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>. The genome of <i>A. nidulans</i> harbors genes for the biosynthesis of xanthones. We show that enzymes and metabolites of this biosynthetic pathway accumulate in Hülle cells under the control of the regulatory velvet complex, which coordinates development and secondary metabolism. Deletion strains blocked in the conversion of anthraquinones to xanthones accumulate emodins and are delayed in maturation and growth of fruiting bodies. Emodin represses fruiting body and resting structure formation in other fungi. Xanthones are not required for sexual development but exert antifeedant effects on fungivorous animals such as springtails and woodlice. Our findings reveal a novel role of Hülle cells in establishing secure niches for <i>A. nidulans</i> by accumulating metabolites with antifeedant activity that protect reproductive structures from animal predators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Utility of polygenic embryo screening for disease depends on the selection strategy</a></h4>

              
                Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been offered since 2019 to screen in vitro fertilization embryos for genetic liability to adult diseases, despite a lack of comprehensive modeling of expected outcomes. Here we predict, based on the liability threshold model, the expected reduction in complex disease risk following <i>polygenic embryo screening</i> for a single disease. A strong determinant of the potential utility of such screening is the <i>selection strategy</i>, a factor that has not been previously studied. When only embryos with a very high PRS are excluded, the achieved risk reduction is minimal. In contrast, selecting the embryo with the lowest PRS can lead to substantial relative risk reductions, given a sufficient number of viable embryos. We systematically examine the impact of several factors on the utility of screening, including: variance explained by the PRS, number of embryos, disease prevalence, parental PRSs, and parental disease status. We consider both relative and absolute risk reductions, as well as population-averaged and per-couple risk reductions, and also examine the risk of pleiotropic effects. Finally, we confirm our theoretical predictions by simulating ‘virtual’ couples and offspring based on real genomes from schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease case-control studies. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of our model, as well as the potential emerging ethical concerns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative theory for the diffusive dynamics of liquid condensates</a></h4>

              
                Key processes of biological condensates are diffusion and material exchange with their environment. Experimentally, diffusive dynamics are typically probed via fluorescent labels. However, to date, a physics-based, quantitative framework for the dynamics of labeled condensate components is lacking. Here we derive the corresponding dynamic equations, building on the physics of phase separation, and quantitatively validate the related framework via experiments. We show that by using our framework we can precisely determine diffusion coefficients inside liquid condensates via a spatio-temporal analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We showcase the accuracy and precision of our approach by considering space- and time-resolved data of protein condensates and two different polyelectrolyte-coacervate systems. Interestingly, our theory can also be used to determine a relationship between the diffusion coefficient in the dilute phase and the partition coefficient, without relying on fluorescence measurements in the dilute phase. This enables us to investigate the effect of salt addition on partitioning and bypasses recently described quenching artifacts in the dense phase. Our approach opens new avenues for theoretically describing molecule dynamics in condensates, measuring concentrations based on the dynamics of fluorescence intensities, and quantifying rates of biochemical reactions in liquid condensates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogen clonal expansion underlies multiorgan dissemination and organ-specific outcomes during murine systemic infection</a></h4>

              
                The dissemination of pathogens through blood and their establishment within organs lead to severe clinical outcomes. However, the within-host dynamics that underly pathogen spread to and clearance from systemic organs remain largely uncharacterized. In animal models of infection, the observed pathogen population results from the combined contributions of bacterial replication, persistence, death, and dissemination, each of which can vary across organs. Quantifying the contribution of each these processes is required to interpret and understand experimental phenotypes. Here, we leveraged STAMPR, a new barcoding framework, to investigate the population dynamics of extraintestinal pathogenic <i>E. coli</i>, a common cause of bacteremia, during murine systemic infection. We show that while bacteria are largely cleared by most organs, organ-specific clearance failures are pervasive and result from dramatic expansions of clones representing less than 0.0001% of the inoculum. Clonal expansion underlies the variability in bacterial burden between animals, and stochastic dissemination of clones profoundly alters the pathogen population structure within organs. Despite variable pathogen expansion events, host bottlenecks are consistent yet highly sensitive to infection variables, including inoculum size and macrophage depletion. We adapted our barcoding methodology to facilitate multiplexed validation of bacterial fitness determinants identified with transposon mutagenesis and confirmed the importance of bacterial hexose metabolism and cell envelope homeostasis pathways for organ-specific pathogen survival. Collectively our findings provide a comprehensive map of the population biology that underlies bacterial systemic infection and a framework for barcode-based high-resolution mapping of infection dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decreased recent adaptation at human mendelian disease genes as a possible consequence of interference between advantageous and deleterious variants</a></h4>

              
                Advances in genome sequencing have dramatically improved our understanding of the genetic basis of human diseases, and thousands of human genes have been associated with different diseases. Despite our expanding knowledge of gene-disease associations, and despite the medical importance of disease genes, their recent evolution has not been thoroughly studied across diverse human populations. In particular, recent genomic adaptation at disease genes has not been characterized as well as purifying selection and long-term adaptation. Understanding the relationship between disease and adaptation at the gene level in the human genome is hampered by the fact that we don’t know whether disease genes have experienced more, less, or as much adaptation as non-disease genes during the last ~50,000 years of recent human evolution. Here, we compare the rate of strong recent adaptation in the form of selective sweeps between mendelian, non-infectious disease genes and non-disease genes across 26 distinct human populations from the 1,000 Genomes Project. We find that mendelian disease genes have experienced far less selective sweeps compared to non-disease genes especially in Africa. This sweep deficit at mendelian disease genes is less visible in East Asia or Europe. Investigating further the possible causes of the sweep deficit at disease genes, we find that this deficit is very strong at disease genes with both low recombination rates and with high numbers of associated disease variants, but is almost non-existent at disease genes with higher recombination rates or lower numbers of associated disease variants. Because segregating recessive deleterious variants have the ability to interfere with adaptive ones, these observations strongly suggest that adaptation has been slowed down by the presence of interfering recessive deleterious variants at disease genes.  This is further supported by population simulations that show that interference at disease genes is expected to be lower in East Asia and Europe. These results clarify the evolutionary relationship between disease genes and recent genomic adaptation, and suggest that disease genes suffer not only from a higher load of segregating deleterious mutations, but also from a transient inability to adapt as much, and/or as fast as the rest of the genome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Linking functional and molecular mechanisms of host resilience to malaria infection</a></h4>

              
                It remains challenging to understand why some hosts suffer severe illnesses, while others are unscathed by the same infection. We fitted a mathematical model to longitudinal measurements of parasite and red blood cell density in murine hosts from diverse genetic backgrounds to identify aspects of within-host interactions that explain variation in host resilience and survival during acute malaria infection. Among eight mouse strains that collectively span 90% of the common genetic diversity of laboratory mice, we found that high host mortality was associated with either weak parasite clearance, or a strong, yet imprecise response that inadvertently removes uninfected cells in excess. Subsequent cross-sectional cytokine assays revealed that the two distinct functional mechanisms of poor survival were underpinned by low expression of either pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. By combining mathematical modelling and molecular immunology assays, our study uncovered proximate mechanisms of diverse infection outcomes across multiple host strains and biological scales.

                Regnase-1 is an endoribonuclease crucial for controlling inflammation by degrading mRNAs encoding cytokines and inflammatory mediators in mammals. However, it is unclear how Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay is controlled in interleukin (IL)-1β- or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-stimulated cells. Here, by analyzing the Regnase-1 interactome, we found that IL-1β or TLR stimulus dynamically induced the formation of Regnase-1-β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTRCP) complex. Importantly, we also uncovered a novel interaction between Regnase-1 and 14-3-3 in both mouse and human cells. In IL-1R/TLR-stimulated cells, the Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction is mediated by IRAK1 through a previously uncharacterized C-terminal structural domain. Phosphorylation of Regnase-1 at S494 and S513 is critical for Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction, while a different set of phosphorylation sites of Regnase-1 is known to be required for the recognition by βTRCP and proteasome-mediated degradation. We found that Regnase-1-14-3-3 and Regnase-1-βTRCP interactions are not sequential events. Rather, 14-3-3 protects Regnase-1 from βTRCP-mediated degradation. On the other hand, 14-3-3 abolishes Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay by inhibiting Regnase-1-mRNA association. In addition, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Regnase-1 is abrogated by 14-3-3 interaction. Taken together, the results suggest that a novel inflammation-induced interaction of 14-3-3 with Regnase-1 stabilizes inflammatory mRNAs by sequestering Regnase-1 in the cytoplasm to prevent mRNA recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathway dynamics can delineate the sources of transcriptional noise in gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell expression profiling opens up new vistas on cellular processes. Extensive cell-to-cell variability at the transcriptomic and proteomic level has been one of the stand-out observations. Because most experimental analyses are destructive we only have access to snapshot data of cellular states. This loss of temporal information presents significant challenges for inferring dynamics, as well as causes of cell-to-cell variability. In particular, we typically cannot separate dynamic variability from within cells ('intrinsic noise') from variability across the population ('extrinsic noise'). Here we make this non-identifiability mathematically precise, allowing us to identify new experimental set-ups that can assist in resolving this non-identifiability. We show that multiple generic reporters from the same biochemical pathways (e.g. mRNA and protein) can infer magnitudes of intrinsic and extrinsic transcriptional noise, identifying sources of heterogeneity. Stochastic simulations support our theory, and demonstrate that 'pathway-reporters' compare favourably to the well-known, but often difficult to implement, dual-reporter method.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status</a></h4>

              
                While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection influence the immune defense they elicit, and whether they protect against variants. Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">USP28 deletion and small molecule inhibition destabilises c-MYC and elicits regression of squamous cell lung carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a considerable global health burden, with an incidence of over 600,000 cases per year. Treatment options are limited, and patient 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. The ubiquitin specific protease 28 (USP28) has been implicated in tumorigenesis through its stabilization of the oncoproteins c-MYC, c-JUN and Dp63. Here, we show that genetic inactivation of <i>Usp28</i> induced regression of established murine LSCC lung tumours. We developed a small molecule that inhibits USP28 activity in the low nanomole range. While displaying cross-reactivity against the closest homologue USP25, this inhibitor showed a high degree of selectivity over other deubiquitinases. USP28 inhibitor treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in c-MYC, c-JUN and Dp63 proteins levels and consequently induced substantial regression of autochthonous murine LSCC tumors and human LSCC xenografts, thereby phenocopying the effect observed by genetic deletion. Thus, USP28 may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of squamous cell lung carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Switch-like and persistent memory formation in individual Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning allows animals to use past experience to predict future events. The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function, often in response to a single example. Larval <i>Drosophila</i> is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals, and it has been difficult to form long-lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic reorganization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). We confirm that when coupled to CO<sub>2</sub> presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO<sub>2</sub>. We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states. Memories can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> but are stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation. Finally, we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamic activity during scalp slow waves in humans</a></h4>

              
                Slow waves are major pacemakers of NREM sleep oscillations. While slow waves themselves are mainly generated by cortical neurons, it is not clear what role thalamic activity plays in the generation of some oscillations grouped by slow waves, and to what extent thalamic activity during slow waves is itself driven by corticothalamic inputs. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded both scalp EEG and local field potentials from six thalamic nuclei (bilateral anterior, mediodorsal and ventral anterior) in fifteen epileptic patients (age-range: 17-64 years, 7 females) undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation Protocol and assessed the temporal evolution of thalamic activity relative to scalp slow waves using time-frequency analysis. We found that thalamic activity in all six nuclei during scalp slow waves is highly similar to what is observed on the scalp itself. Slow wave downstates are characterized by delta, theta and alpha activity and followed by beta, high sigma and low sigma activity during subsequent upstates. Gamma activity in the thalamus is not significantly grouped by slow waves. Theta and alpha activity appeared first on the scalp, but sigma activity appeared first in the thalamus. These effects were largely independent from the scalp region in which SWs were detected and the precise identity of thalamic nuclei. Our results indicate that while small thalamocortical neuron assemblies may initiate cortical oscillations, especially in the sleep spindle range, the large-scale neuronal activity in the thalamus which is detected by field potentials is principally driven by global cortical activity, and thus it is highly similar to what is observed on the scalp.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MicroPET evidence for a hypersensitive neuroinflammatory profile of gp120 mouse model of HIV</a></h4>

              
                Despite increased survivability for people living with HIV (PLWH), HIV-related cognitive and behavioral abnormalities persist. Determining the biological mechanism(s) underlying these abnormalities is critical to minimize the long-term impact of HIV. Human positron emission tomography (PET) studies reveal that PLWH exhibit higher neuroinflammation, which may contribute to cognitive and behavioral problems. PLWH are hypersensitive to environmental insults that drive elevated inflammatory profiles. Gp120 is an envelope glycoprotein exposed on the surface of the HIV envelope which enables HIV virus entry into a cell and contributes to HIV-related neurotoxicity. Gp120 overexpression in mice enables delineating its impact, including on neuroinflammation. In vivo evidence for gp120 transgenic (Tg) mice exhibiting neuroinflammation has yet to be determined. Here, we conducted microPET imaging in male gp120 Tg and wildtype mice, using the radiotracer [(18)F]FEPPA which binds to the translocator protein expressed by activated microglial and serves as a marker of neuroinflammation. Imaging was performed at baseline and 24 hours after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 mg/kg), endotoxin that triggers an immune response. Gp120 Tg mice exhibited elevated [(18F)]FEPPA in response to LPS vs. wildtype mice throughout the brain including dorsal and ventral striata, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, but not prefrontal cortex. Gp120 Tg mice are hypersensitive to environmental inflammatory insults, consistent with PLWH, measurable in vivo. It remains to-be-determined whether this heightened sensitivity is connected to the behavioral abnormalities of these mice or is sensitive to antiretroviral or other treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Forward simulations of walking on a variable surface-impedance treadmill: A comparison of two methods</a></h4>

              
                Recent experiments with a variable stiffness treadmill (VST) suggest that modulating foot-ground contact dynamics during walking may offer an effective new paradigm for gait rehabilitation. How gait adapts to extended perturbations of asymmetrical surface stiffness is still an open question. In this study, we simulated human gait with prolonged asymmetrical changes in ground stiffness using two methods: (1) forward simulation of a muscle-reflex model and (2) optimal control via direct collocation. Simulation results showed that both models could competently describe the biomechanical trends observed in human experiments with a VST which altered the walking surface stiffness for one step. In addition, the simulations revealed important considerations for future experiments studying the effect of asymmetric ground stiffness on gait behavior. With the muscle-reflex model, we observed that although subtle, there was a difference between gait biomechanics before and after the prolonged asymmetric stiffness perturbation, showing the behavioral signature of an aftereffect despite the lack of supraspinal control in the model. In addition, the optimal control simulations showed that damping has a large effect on the overall lower-body muscle activity, with the muscle effort cost function used to optimize the biomechanics increasing 203% between 5 Ns/m and 2000 Ns/m at a stiffness of 10 kN/m. Overall, these findings point to new insights and considerations for advancing our understanding of human neuromotor control of locomotion and enhancing robot-aided gait rehabilitation.

                The temporal activity of many biological systems, including neural circuits, exhibits fluctuations simultaneously varying over a large range of timescales. The mechanisms leading to this temporal heterogeneity are yet unknown. Here we show that random neural networks endowed with a distribution of self-couplings, representing functional neural clusters of different sizes, generate multiple timescales activity spanning several orders of magnitude. When driven by a time-dependent broadband input, slow and fast neural clusters preferentially entrain slow and fast spectral components of the input, respectively, suggesting a potential mechanism for spectral demixing in cortical circuits.

                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a pediatric genetic disorder, is characterized by the profound loss of spinal cord motor neurons and subsequent muscle atrophy and death. Although the mechanisms underlying motor neuron loss are not entirely clear, data from our work and others support the idea that glial cells contribute to disease pathology. GATA6, a transcription factor that we have previously shown to be upregulated in SMA astrocytes, is negatively regulated by SMN and can increase the expression of the inflammatory regulator NF{kappa}B. In this study, we identified upregulated GATA6 as a contributor to increased activation, pro-inflammatory ligand production, and neurotoxicity in spinal-cord patterned astrocytes differentiated from SMA patient induced pluripotent stem cells. Reducing GATA6 expression in SMA astrocytes via lentiviral infection ameliorated these effects to healthy control levels. Additionally, we found that SMA astrocytes contribute to SMA microglial phagocytosis, which was again decreased by lentiviral-mediated knockdown of GATA6. Together these data identify a role of GATA6 in SMA astrocyte pathology and further highlight glia as important targets of therapeutic intervention in SMA.

                Magneto- and/or electro-encephalography (M/EEG) are non-invasive clinically-relevant tools that have long been used to measure electromagnetic fields in somatosensory cortex evoked by non-painful and painful somatosensory stimuli. Two commonly applied stimulation paradigms that produce distinct responses in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) linked to non-painful and painful sensations are electrical median nerve (MN) stimulation and cutaneous laser-evoked (LE) stimulation to the dorsum of the hand, respectively. Despite their prevalence, the physiological mechanisms that produce stereotypic macroscale MN and LE responses have yet to be fully articulated, limiting their utility in understanding brain dynamics associated with non-painful or painful somatosensation. We examined the neocortical circuit mechanisms contributing to MN and LE responses in SI using the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) neural modeling software tool. HNN was specifically designed for biophysically principled interpretation of the cell and circuit origin of M/EEG signals (Neymotin et al., 2020). Detailed analysis of the timing and orientation of peaks in source localized SI current dipole responses from MN and laser-evoked (LE) stimulation showed that these features were robust and conserved across prior studies. The first peak in the MN response at ~20 ms corresponds to outward-directed deep-to-superficial electrical current flow through the cortical laminae, while the initial LE response occurs later at ~170 ms and is oriented in the opposite direction. Historically, these peaks have both been labeled N20 and N1, despite their opposite current orientations. Simulating the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms accounting for these and later peaks with HNN's detailed laminar neocortical column model revealed that the MN response can be simulated with a sequence of layer-specific exogenous excitatory feedforward and feedback synaptic drive. This sequence was similar to that previously reported for tactile evoked responses (Jones et al., 2007; Neymotin et al., 2020), with the novel discovery of an early excitatory feedback input to superficial layers at ~30 ms post-stimulus that facilitated generation of the MN response's first prominent inward-oriented deflection, known historically as the P30. Simulations of the LE response revealed that the initial ~170 ms inward-deflection required a burst of repetitive gamma-frequency (~40 Hz) excitatory supragranular feedback drives, consistent with prior reports of LE gamma-frequency activity. These results make novel and detailed multiscale predictions about the dynamic laminar circuit mechanisms underlying temporal and spectral features of MN and LE responses in SI, and can guide further investigations in follow-up studies. Ultimately, these findings may help with the development of targeted therapeutics for pathological somatosensation, such as chronic and neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examining opioid withdrawal scoring and adaptation of global scoring systems to male and female C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a chronic and relapsing psychiatric condition which is currently the leading cause of accidental death in the US. Symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal resemble a flu-like illness which is accompanied by a dysphoric state. Psychological comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and disordered sleep can persist for months or years, well into the abstinence period. These symptoms are thought to drive further opioid intake in order to alleviate this unpleasant internal state. Many differences in OUD have been documented between male and female patients, with females at higher risk for relapse and overdose. This study sets out to characterize sex differences in symptoms and behavioral adaptations in mice during early withdrawal. Using our moderate dose, three day precipitated withdrawal paradigm, we discovered significant effects of sex, time, and drug treatment on early withdrawal behaviors, locomotor activity, and gut motility in C57BL/6J mice. Here I will discuss previous methods of condensing behavioral phenotypes into one global withdrawal score, and propose a new methodology. This method increases the ability to detect nuanced effects and allows for more accurate translation across strain, sex, paradigm, and experimental context. Classification of opioid withdrawal-induced behavioral adaptations will allow for improved behavioral analysis of pharmacological manipulations, and investigations of brain circuitry involved in opioid withdrawal, as well as future screening of compounds with potential therapeutic benefit for the treatment of OUD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of TBK1 activity leads to TDP-43 proteinopathy through lysosomal dysfunction in human motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss accompanied by cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43 proteins and their insoluble accumulations. Haploinsufficiency of TBK1 has been found to associate with or cause ALS. However, the cell-autonomous mechanisms by which reduced TBK1 activity contributes to human motor neuron pathology remain elusive. Here, we generated a human cellular model harboring loss-of-function mutations of TBK1 by gene editing and found that TBK1 deficiency was sufficient to cause TDP-43 pathology in human motor neurons. In addition to its functions in autophagy, we found that TBK1 interacted with endosomes and was required for normal endosomal maturation and subsequent lysosomal acidification. Surprisingly, TDP-43 pathology resulted more from the dysfunctional endo-lysosomal pathway than the previously recognized autophagy inhibition mechanism. Restoring TBK1 levels ameliorated lysosomal dysfunction and TDP-43 pathology and maintained normal motor neuron homeostasis. Notably, using patient-derived motor neurons, we found that haploinsufficiency of TBK1 sensitized neurons to lysosomal stress, and chemical regulators of endosomal maturation rescued the neurodegenerative process. Together, our results revealed the mechanism of TBK1 in maintaining TDP-43 and motor neuron homeostasis and suggested that modulating endosomal maturation was able to rescue neurodegenerative disease phenotypes caused by TBK1 deficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Addicted or not? A new machine learning-assisted tool for the diagnosis of addiction-like behavior in individual rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: The transition from controlled to compulsive drug use occurs in a small proportion of individuals characterizing substance use disorder (SUD). The "3-Criteria" model developed on the operationalization of key DSM diagnostic criteria of SUD has helped to shed light on behavioural and biological factors involved in these divergent trajectories. However, the classification strategy on which the model has hitherto relied puts as much weight on the cohort to which the individual belongs as on their own characteristics, thereby limiting its construct validity with regards to the individual-based diagnostic approach in humans. Methods: Large datasets resulting from the combination of behavioral data from several of our previous studies on addiction-like behavior for cocaine or alcohol were fed to a variety of machine learning algorithms (each consisting of an unsupervised clustering method combined with a supervised machine learning algorithm) in order to develop a classifier that identifies resilient and vulnerable rats with high precision and reproducibility irrespective of the cohort to which they belong. Results: A classifier based on K-median or K-mean clustering (for cocaine or alcohol, respectively) followed by Artificial Neural Networks emerged as the best tool reliably and accurately to predict if a single rat is vulnerable or resilient to addiction as operationalized in the 3-Criteria model. Thus, all the rats previously characterized as 0 or 3crit in individual cohorts were correctly labelled as Resilient or Vulnerable, respectively, by this classifier. Conclusion: The present machine learning-based classifier objectively labels single individuals as resilient or vulnerable to develop addiction-like behaviour in multisymptomatic preclinical models of cocaine or alcohol addiction in rats, thereby increasing their heuristic value with regards to the human situation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes derived from ASD patients alter behavior and destabilize neuronal activity through aberrant Ca2+ signaling</a></h4>

              
                The cellular mechanisms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are poorly understood. Cumulative evidence suggests that abnormal synapse function underlies many features of this disease. Astrocytes play in several key neuronal processes, including the formation of synapses and the modulation of synaptic plasticity. Astrocyte abnormalities have also been identified in the postmortem brain tissue of ASD patients. However, it remains unclear whether astrocyte pathology plays a mechanistic role in ASD, as opposed to a compensatory response. To address this, we strategically combined stem cell culturing with transplantation techniques to determine disease specific properties inherent to patient derived astrocytes. We demonstrate that ASD astrocytes induce repetitive behavior as well as impair memory and long-term potentiation when transplanted into the healthy mouse brain. These in vivo phenotypes were accompanied by reduced neuronal network activity and spine density caused by ASD astrocytes in hippocampal neurons in vitro. Transplanted ASD astrocytes also exhibit exaggerated Ca2+ fluctuations in chimeric brains. Genetic modulation of evoked Ca2+ responses in ASD astrocytes modulates behavior and neuronal activity deficits. Thus, we determine that ASD patient astrocytes are sufficient to induce repetitive behavior as well as cognitive deficit, suggesting a previously unrecognized primary role for astrocytes in ASD.

                Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) are aggregation-prone polypeptides encoded by the pathogenic G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). In this study, we focus on the role of poly-GA DPRs in disease spread. We demonstrate that recombinant poly-GA oligomers can directly convert into solid-like aggregates and form characteristic {beta}-sheet fibrils in vitro. To dissect the process of cell-to-cell DPR transmission, we closely follow the fate of poly-GA DPRs in either their oligomeric or fibrillized form after administration in the cell culture medium. We observe that poly-GA DPRs are taken up via dynamin-dependent and -independent endocytosis, eventually converging at the lysosomal compartment and leading to axonal swellings in neurons. We then use a co-culture system to demonstrate astrocyte-to-motor neuron DPR propagation, showing that astrocytes may internalise and release aberrant peptides in disease pathogenesis. Overall, our results shed light on the mechanisms of poly-GA cellular uptake and cell-to-cell propagation, suggesting lysosomal impairment as a possible feature underlying the cellular pathogenicity of these DPR species.

                Substance use disorders are more prevalent in schizophrenia, worsening its course and prognosis. Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining maternal immune activation (MIA) and peripubertal stress (PUS), to study cocaine addiction and the underlying neurobehavioural alterations. We injected lipopolysaccharide or saline on gestational days 15 and 16 to pregnant rats. Their male offspring were then subjected to 5 episodes of unpredictable stress every other day during adolescence (from postnatal day 28 to 38). When rats reached adulthood, we studied cocaine addiction-like behaviour, impulsivity, conditioning processes and several aspects of brain structure and function by MRI, PET and RNAseq. MIA facilitated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration while PUS reduced cocaine intake, an effect that was reversed by MIA. MIA increased motivation for cocaine and reversed the effects of PUS during extended access. Incubation of seeking was unaffected. Neither hit alone nor their combination impacted Pavlovian or instrumental conditioning or impulsiveness. At the brain level, PUS reduced hippocampal volume and hyperactivated the dorsal subiculum. MIA+PUS altered the structure and function of the dorsal striatum increasing its volume and interfering with glutamatergic dynamics. MIA did not affect the gene expression of the nucleus accumbens but, when combined with PUS, modulated specific genes that could account for the restored cocaine intake. PUS had a profound effect on the dorsal striatal transcriptome however, this was obliterated when PUS occurred in animals with MIA. These results describe a complex interplay between MIA and stress on neurodevelopment and in the susceptibility to develop cocaine addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Global and Local Head Direction Coding in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Orientation-specific head direction (HD) cells increase their firing rate to indicate ones facing direction in the environment. Rodent studies suggest HD cells in distinct areas of thalamus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) code either for global (relative to the wider environment) or local (e.g., room-specific) reference frames. To investigate whether similar neuroanatomical dissociations exist in humans, we reanalysed functional magnetic resonance imaging data in which participants learned the orientation of unique images in separate local environments relative to distinct global landmarks (Shine, Valdes-Herrera, Hegarty, & Wolbers, 2016). The environment layout meant that we could establish two separate multivariate analysis models in which the HD on individual trials was coded relative either to global (North, South, East, West) or local (Front, Back, Right, Left) reference frames. Examining the data first in key regions of interest (ROI) for HD coding, we replicated our previous results and found that global HD was decodable in the thalamus and precuneus; the RSC, however, was sensitive only to local HD. Extending recent findings in both humans and rodents, V1 was sensitive to both HD reference frames. Additional small volume-corrected searchlight analyses supported the ROI results and indicated that the anatomical locus of the thalamic global HD coding was located in the medial thalamus, bordering the anterior thalamus, a region critical for global HD coding in rodents. Our findings elucidate further the putative neural basis of HD coding in humans, and suggest that distinct brain regions code for different frames of reference in HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosophila tachykininergic neurons modulate the activity of two groups of receptor-expressing neurons to regulate aggressive tone</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides influence animal behaviors through complex molecular and cellular mechanisms, many of which are difficult to predict solely from synaptic connectivity. Here, we uncovered two separate downstream targets that are differentially modulated by the neuropeptide tachykinin, which promotes Drosophila aggression. Tachykinin from a single sexually dimorphic group of neurons recruits two separate downstream groups of neurons. One downstream group, synaptically connected to the tachykinergic neurons, expresses the receptor TkR86C and is necessary for aggression. Tachykinin supports the strength of cholinergic excitatory synaptic transmission between the tachykinergic and TkR86C downstream neurons. The other downstream group expresses the TkR99D receptor and is recruited primarily when tachykinin is over-expressed in the source neurons. This circuit reconfiguration correlates with the quantitative and qualitative enhancement of aggression observed when tachykinin is present in excess. Our data highlight how the amount of neuropeptide released from a small number of neurons can reshape the activity patterns of multiple downstream neural populations.

                Humans and other animals tend to systematically repeat (or alternate) their previous choices, even when judging sensory stimuli presented in a random sequence. Choice history biases may arise from action preparation in motor circuits, or from perceptual or decision processing in upstream areas. Here, we combined source-level magnetoencephalographic (MEG) analyses of cortical population dynamics with behavioral modeling of a visual decision process. We disentangled two neural history signals in human motor and posterior parietal cortex. Gamma-band activity in parietal cortex tracked previous choices throughout the trial and biased evidence accumulation toward choice repetition. Action-specific beta-band activity in motor cortex also carried over to the next trial and biased the accumulation starting point toward alternation. The parietal, but not motor, history signal predicted the next trial's choice as well as individual differences in choice repetition. Our results are consistent with a key role of parietal cortical signals in shaping choice sequences.

                In highly developed visual systems, spatial- and feature-based attentional modulation interact to prioritize relevant information and suppress irrelevant details. We investigated the specific role and integration of these two attentional mechanisms in visual cortical area MST of rhesus monkeys. We show that spatial attention acts as a gate for information processing by providing unimpeded high-gain pass-through processing for all sensory information from attended visual locations. Feature-based attentional enhancement does not only show the known dependency on a match between the attended feature and a given cells selectivity, but surprisingly is restricted to those features for which a given cell contributes to perception. This necessitates a refinement of the feature-similarity gain model of attention and documents highly optimized attentional gating of sensory information for cortical processing. This gating is shaped by neuronal sensory preferences, behavioral relevance, and the causal link to perception of neurons that process this visual input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Is there magnocellular facilitation of early neural processes underlying visual word recognition? Evidence from masked repetition priming with ERPs</a></h4>

              
                An influential theory in the field of visual object recognition proposes that fast magnocellular (M) information facilitates neural processing of spatially more fine-grained but slower parvocellular (P) information. While written words can be considered as a special type of visual objects, it is unknown whether magnocellular facilitation also plays a role in reading. We used a masked priming paradigm that has been shown to result in neural facilitation in visual word processing and tested whether these facilitating effects are mediated by the magnocellular system. In two experiments, we manipulated the influence of magnocellular and parvocellular systems on visual processing of a contextually predictable target character by contrasting high versus low spatial frequency and luminance versus color contrast, respectively. In addition, unchanged (normal) primes were included in both experiments as a manipulation check. As expected, unchanged primes elicited typical repetition effects in the N1, N250 and P3 components of the ERP in both experiments. In the experiment manipulating spatial contrast, we obtained repetition effects only for the N1 component for both M- and P-biased primes. In the luminance versus color contrast experiment, repetition effects were found in N1 and N250 for both M- and P- biased primes. Furthermore, no interactions were found between M- vs. P-biased prime types and repetition. Together these results indicate that M- and P- information contributes jointly to early neural processes underlying visual word recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related intrinsic functional connectivity changes of locus coeruleus from childhood to older adults</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus is critical for selective information processing by modulating brain connectivity configuration. Increasingly studies have suggested that LC controls sensory inputs at the sensory gating stage. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has examined that young children and older adults are more prone to distraction and filter out irrelevant information less efficiently, possibly due to the impaired LC connectivity. However, the LC connectivity pattern across the life span is not fully examined yet, hampering our ability to understand the relationship between LC development and the distractibility. In this study, we examined the intrinsic network connectivity of the LC using resting-state fMRI from the enhanced NKI dataset with wide-range age samples. Based on LC-seed functional connectivity maps, we examined the age-related variation in the LC connectivity with a quadratic model. The analyses revealed two connectivity patterns explicitly. The sensory-related brain regions showed a positive quadratic age effect (u-shape), and the frontal regions for the cognitive control showed a negative quadratic age effect (inverted u-shape). Our results imply that such age-related distractibility is possibly due to the impaired sensory gating by the LC and the insufficient top-down controls by the frontal regions. We discuss the underlying neural mechanisms and limitations of our study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal Dot1l is a broad mitochondrial gene-repressor associated with human brain aging via H3K79 hypermethylation</a></h4>

              
                Methylation of histone 3 at lysine 79 (H3K79) and its catalyst, disrupter of telomeric silencing (Dot1l), have been coupled to multiple forms of stress like bioenergetic and ER challenges. However, studies on H3K79 methylation and Dot1l in the aging brain and neurons are very limited. This together with increasing evidence of a dynamic neuroepigenome made us wonder if H3K79 methylation and Dot1l could play unknown roles in brain aging and associated disorders. In aged humans, we found strong and consistent hypermethylation of H3K79 in neurons that accumulate lipofuscine, while neuronal Dot1l transcript abundance reacts to bioenergenic and oxidative challenges. Indeed, in dopaminergic neurons we found rapid global H3K79me turnover (<12h). While shortly after reduction of H3K79 methylation, synaptic transcripts decreased while mitochondrial genes, particularly respiratory chain transcripts increased. Strikingly, 6 months after reduction of Dot1l levels, almost solely a variety of mitochondrial genes linked to aging and Parkinsons disease remained increased. These profiles are in much detail inverse to those described in hallmark PD and aging studies and associate Dot1l and H3K79me with neuronal stress in the aging brain while putting Dot1l forward as dynamic master regulator of mitochondrial transcription in dopamine neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of human identity by computer vision and neuronal vision</a></h4>

              
                Extracting meaning from a dynamic and variable flow of incoming information is a major goal of both natural and artificial intelligence. Computer vision (CV) guided by deep learning (DL) has made significant strides in recognizing a specific identity despite highly variable attributes. This is the same challenge faced by the nervous system and partially addressed by the concept cells--neurons exhibiting selective firing in response to specific persons/places, described in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). Yet, access to neurons representing a particular concept is limited due to these neurons' sparse coding. It is conceivable, however, that the information required for such decoding is present in relatively small neuronal populations. To evaluate how well neuronal populations encode identity information in natural settings, we recorded neuronal activity from multiple brain regions of nine neurosurgical epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes, while the subjects watched an episode of the TV series "24". We implemented DL models that used the time-varying population neural data as inputs and decoded the visual presence of the main characters in each frame. Before training and testing the DL models, we devised a minimally supervised CV algorithm (with comparable performance against manually-labelled data) to detect and label all the important characters in each frame. This methodology allowed us to compare "computer vision" with "neuronal vision"--footprints associated with each character present in the activity of a subset of neurons--and identify the brain regions that contributed to this decoding process. We then tested the DL models during a recognition memory task following movie viewing where subjects were asked to recognize clip segments from the presented episode. DL model activations were not only modulated by the presence of the corresponding characters but also by participants' subjective memory of whether they had seen the clip segment, and by the associative strengths of the characters in the narrative plot. The described approach can offer novel ways to probe the representation of concepts in time-evolving dynamic behavioral tasks. Further, the results suggest that the information required to robustly decode concepts is present in the population activity of only tens of neurons even in brain regions beyond MTL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strategic Leadership Coaching supports Young Executives decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making is central to daily function for executives in any organisation. Strategic leadership coaching (SLC) is an effective way to support complex decision-making, yet empirical neuroscientific data to support is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of SLC on young executives cortical arousal and their neural circuitry activation during the completion of computerized tasks which require activation of decision-making circuitry. We hypothesised SLC would improve cortical arousal when engaged with decision-making tasks, specifically increased electroencephalography (EEG) relative alpha band activity and improved neural circuitry engagement, measured as increased amplitude of event-related potential wave components. This study included thirty-one young male executives, of which eighteen underwent 8 sessions of SLC over two months. EEG records were collected thrice from those who underwent SLC (prior, post, and two months post), and twice from the control group (two months apart). The EEG recording session included completion of two decision-making tasks, an Iowa gambling task and Stroop colour-word conflict task. Finding, SLC increased alpha band activity over left frontal and central electrodes, and increased right parietal N170 amplitude and left parietal P300 amplitude. These findings support our hypothesis, as SLC improved cognitive cortical resources (enhanced alpha) which in turn permitted greater efficiency within decision-making circuitry (increased wave component amplitudes). This study provides the first and necessary neurobiological evidence to support and develop this line of research in SLC, and other forms of coaching, as it adds significant value.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Data Standards Ontology: A data-driven ontology of transcriptomically defined cell types in the primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Large scale single cell omics profiling is revolutionising our understanding of cell types, especially in complex organs like the brain. This presents both an opportunity and a challenge for cell ontologies. Annotation of cell types in single cell 'omics data typically uses unstructured free text, making comparison and mapping of annotation between datasets challenging. Annotation with cell ontologies is key to overcoming this challenge, but this will require meeting the challenge of extending cell ontologies representing classically defined cell types by defining and classifying cell types directly from data. Here we present the Brain Data Standards Ontology (BDSO), a data driven ontology that is built as an extension to the Cell Ontology (CL). It supports two major use cases: cell type annotation, and navigation, search, and organisation of a web application integrating single cell omics datasets for the mammalian primary motor cortex. The ontology is built using a semi-automated pipeline that interlinks cell type taxonomies and necessary and sufficient marker genes, and imports relevant ontology modules derived from external ontologies. Overall, the BDS ontology provides an underlying structure that supports these use cases, while remaining sustainable and extensible through automation as our knowledge of brain cell type expands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing The Repeatability of Multi-Frequency Multi-Layer Brain Network Topologies Across Alternative Researchers Choice Paths</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing interest in the neuroscience community on the advantages of multimodal neuroimaging modalities. Functional and structural interactions between brain areas can be represented as a network (graph) allowing us to employ graph-theoretic tools in multiple research directions. Researchers usually treated brain networks acquired from different modalities or different frequencies separately. However, there is strong evidence that these networks share complementary information while their interdependencies could reveal novel findings. For this purpose, neuroscientists adopt multilayer networks, which can be described mathematically as an extension of trivial single-layer networks. Multilayer networks have become popular in neuroscience due to their advantage to integrate different sources of information. We can incorporate this information from different modalities (multi-modal case), from different frequencies (multi-frequency case), or a single modality following a dynamic functional connectivity analysis (multi-layer, dynamic case). Researchers already used multi-layer networks to model brain disorders, to detect key hubs related to a specific function, to reveal structural-functional relationships, and to define more precise connectomic biomarkers related to brain disorders. However, the construction of a multilayer network depends on the selection of multiple preprocessing steps that can affect the final network topology. Here, we analyzed the fMRI dataset from a single human performing scanning over a period of 18 months (84 scans in total). We focused on assessing the reproducibility of multi-frequency multilayer topologies exploring the effect of two filtering methods for extracting frequencies from BOLD activity, three connectivity estimators, with or without a topological filtering scheme, and two spatial scales. Finally, we untangled specific combinations of researchers choices that yield repeatable topologies, giving us the chance to recommend best practices over consistent topologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting brain activity emerges from wave propagating along spatiotemporal varying hyper-structural connectome</a></h4>

              
                How spontaneous brain activities emerge from the structural connectivity (SC) has puzzled researchers for a long time. The underlying mechanism still remains largely unknown. Previous studies on modeling the resting-state human brain functional connectivity (FC) are normally based on the relatively static structural connectome directly and very few of them concern about the dynamic spatiotemporal variability of FC. Here we establish an explicit wave equation to describe the spontaneous cortical neural activities based on the high-order hypergraph representation of SC. Theoretical solution shows that the dynamic couplings between brain regions fluctuates in the form of an exponential wave regulated by the spatiotemporal varying Laplacian of the hyper-structural connectome (hSC), which orchestrates the cortical activities propagating in both space and time. Ultimately, we present a possible mechanism of how negative correlations emerge during the fluctuation of the hypergraph Laplacian of SC, which helps to further understand the fundamental role of SC in shaping the entire pattern of FC with a new perspective. Comprehensive tests on four connectome datasets with different resolutions confirm our theory and findings.

                Male mating harassment may occur when females and males do not have the same mating objectives. Communal animals need to manage the costs of male mating harassment. Here, we demonstrate how desert locusts in dense populations reduce such conflicts through behaviors. In transient populations (of solitarious morphology but gregarious behavior),...

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While cortical injuries such as traumatic brain injury and neocortical stroke acutely disrupt the neocortex, most of their consequent disabilities reflect secondary injuries that develop over time. Thalamic neuroinflammation has been proposed to be a biomarker of cortical injury and of the long-term cognitive and neurological deficits that follow. However, the extent to which thalamic neuroinflammation depends on the type of cortical injury or its location remains unknown. Using two mouse models of focal neocortical injury that do not directly damage subcortical structures ‒ controlled cortical impact and photothrombotic ischemic stroke ‒ we found that chronic neuroinflammation in the thalamic region mirrors the functional connections with the injured cortex, and that sensory corticothalamic regions may be more likely to sustain long-term damage than non-sensory circuits. Currently, heterogeneous clinical outcomes complicate treatment. Understanding how thalamic inflammation depends on the injury site can aid in predicting features of subsequent deficits and lead to more effective, customized therapies.</p>
<p>Focal cortical TBI or stroke in various cortical areas leads to gliosis in the functionally connected thalamocortical nuclei and of the <i>nucleus reticularis thalami</i> (nRT). The dotted line in the prefrontal cortex-injured section indicates that the top and bottom halves of the brain are sourced from different bregma positions in order to display cortical injury and relevant thalamic nuclei together.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cortical feedback and gating in odor discrimination and generalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaia Tavoni, David E. Chen Kersen, Vijay Balasubramanian</p>

A central question in neuroscience is how context changes perception. In the olfactory system, for example, experiments show that task demands can drive divergence and convergence of cortical odor responses, likely underpinning olfactory discrimination and generalization. Here, we propose a simple statistical mechanism for this effect based on unstructured feedback from the central brain to the olfactory bulb, which represents the context associated with an odor, and sufficiently selective cortical gating of sensory inputs. Strikingly, the model predicts that both convergence and divergence of cortical odor patterns should increase when odors are initially more similar, an effect reported in recent experiments. The theory in turn predicts reversals of these trends following experimental manipulations and in neurological conditions that increase cortical excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Frank-Starling mechanism, fluid responsiveness, and length-dependent activation: Unravelling the multiscale behaviors with an in silico analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Kosta, Pierre C. Dauby</p>

The Frank-Starling mechanism is a fundamental regulatory property which underlies the cardiac output adaptation to venous filling. Length-dependent activation is generally assumed to be the cellular origin of this mechanism. At the heart scale, it is commonly admitted that an increase in preload (ventricular filling) leads to an increased cellular force and an increased volume of ejected blood. This explanation also forms the basis for vascular filling therapy. It is actually difficult to unravel the exact nature of the relationship between length-dependent activation and the Frank-Starling mechanism, as three different scales (cellular, ventricular and cardiovascular) are involved. Mathematical models are powerful tools to overcome these limitations. In this study, we use a multiscale model of the cardiovascular system to untangle the three concepts (length-dependent activation, Frank-Starling, and vascular filling). We first show that length-dependent activation is required to observe both the Frank-Starling mechanism and a positive response to high vascular fillings. Our results reveal a dynamical length dependent activation-driven response to changes in preload, which involves interactions between the cellular, ventricular and cardiovascular levels and thus highlights fundamentally multiscale behaviors. We show however that the cellular force increase is not enough to explain the cardiac response to rapid changes in preload. We also show that the absence of fluid responsiveness is not related to a saturating Frank-Starling effect. As it is challenging to study those multiscale phenomena experimentally, this computational approach contributes to a more comprehensive knowledge of the sophisticated length-dependent properties of cardiac muscle.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The information theory of developmental pruning: Optimizing global network architectures using local synaptic rules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carolin Scholl, Michael E. Rule, Matthias H. Hennig</p>

During development, biological neural networks produce more synapses and neurons than needed. Many of these synapses and neurons are later removed in a process known as neural pruning. Why networks should initially be over-populated, and the processes that determine which synapses and neurons are ultimately pruned, remains unclear. We study the mechanisms and significance of neural pruning in model neural networks. In a deep Boltzmann machine model of sensory encoding, we find that (1) synaptic pruning is necessary to learn efficient network architectures that retain computationally-relevant connections, (2) pruning by synaptic weight alone does not optimize network size and (3) pruning based on a locally-available measure of importance based on Fisher information allows the network to identify structurally important vs. unimportant connections and neurons. This locally-available measure of importance has a biological interpretation in terms of the correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, and implies an efficient activity-driven pruning rule. Overall, we show how local activity-dependent synaptic pruning can solve the global problem of optimizing a network architecture. We relate these findings to biology as follows: (I) Synaptic over-production is necessary for activity-dependent connectivity optimization. (II) In networks that have more neurons than needed, cells compete for activity, and only the most important and selective neurons are retained. (III) Cells may also be pruned due to a loss of synapses on their axons. This occurs when the information they convey is not relevant to the target population.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improved prediction of smoking status via isoform-aware RNA-seq deep learning models</a></h4>

Most predictive models based on gene expression data do not leverage information related to gene splicing, despite the fact that splicing is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic gene expression. Cigarette smoking is an important environmental risk factor for many diseases, and it has profound effects on gene expression. Using smoking status as a prediction target, we developed deep neural network predictive models using gene, exon, and isoform level quantifications from RNA sequencing data in 2,557 subjects in the COPDGene Study. We observed that models using exon and isoform quantifications clearly outperformed gene-level models when using data from 5 genes from a previously published prediction model. Whereas the test set performance of the previously published model was 0.82 in the original publication, our exon-based models including an exon-to-isoform mapping layer achieved a test set AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) of 0.88, which improved to an AUC of 0.94 using exon quantifications from a larger set of genes. Isoform variability is an important source of latent information in RNA-seq data that can be used to improve clinical prediction models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Enhancing breakpoint resolution with deep segmentation model: A general refinement method for read-depth based structural variant callers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yao-zhong Zhang, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano, Rui Yamaguchi</p>

Read-depths (RDs) are frequently used in identifying structural variants (SVs) from sequencing data. For existing RD-based SV callers, it is difficult for them to determine breakpoints in single-nucleotide resolution due to the noisiness of RD data and the bin-based calculation. In this paper, we propose to use the deep segmentation model UNet to learn base-wise RD patterns surrounding breakpoints of known SVs. We integrate model predictions with an RD-based SV caller to enhance breakpoints in single-nucleotide resolution. We show that UNet can be trained with a small amount of data and can be applied both in-sample and cross-sample. An enhancement pipeline named RDBKE significantly increases the number of SVs with more precise breakpoints on simulated and real data. The source code of RDBKE is freely available at https://github.com/yaozhong/deepIntraSV.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">qc3C: Reference-free quality control for Hi-C sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew Z. DeMaere, Aaron E. Darling</p>

Hi-C is a sample preparation method that enables high-throughput sequencing to capture genome-wide spatial interactions between DNA molecules. The technique has been successfully applied to solve challenging problems such as 3D structural analysis of chromatin, scaffolding of large genome assemblies and more recently the accurate resolution of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Despite continued refinements, however, preparing a Hi-C library remains a complex laboratory protocol. To avoid costly failures and maximise the odds of successful outcomes, diligent quality management is recommended. Current wet-lab methods provide only a crude assay of Hi-C library quality, while key post-sequencing quality indicators used have—thus far—relied upon reference-based read-mapping. When a reference is accessible, this reliance introduces a concern for quality, where an incomplete or inexact reference skews the resulting quality indicators. We propose a new, reference-free approach that infers the total fraction of read-pairs that are a product of proximity ligation. This quantification of Hi-C library quality requires only a modest amount of sequencing data and is independent of other application-specific criteria. The algorithm builds upon the observation that proximity ligation events are likely to create <i>k</i>-mers that would not naturally occur in the sample. Our software tool (qc3C) is to our knowledge the first to implement a reference-free Hi-C QC tool, and also provides reference-based QC, enabling Hi-C to be more easily applied to non-model organisms and environmental samples. We characterise the accuracy of the new algorithm on simulated and real datasets and compare it to reference-based methods.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS-CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral genomic RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with homopolymeric RNA substrates that do not form base pairing interactions, it forms asymmetric condensates with viral RNA strands. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) identified a region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. We also identified small molecules that alter the formation of N protein condensates and inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells. These results suggest that the N protein may utilize biomolecular condensation to package the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome into a viral particle.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Corollary discharge enables proprioception from lateral line sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dimitri A. Skandalis, Elias T. Lunsford, James C. Liao</p>

Animals modulate sensory processing in concert with motor actions. Parallel copies of motor signals, called corollary discharge (CD), prepare the nervous system to process the mixture of externally and self-generated (reafferent) feedback that arises during locomotion. Commonly, CD in the peripheral nervous system cancels reafference to protect sensors and the central nervous system from being fatigued and overwhelmed by self-generated feedback. However, cancellation also limits the feedback that contributes to an animal’s awareness of its body position and motion within the environment, the sense of proprioception. We propose that, rather than cancellation, CD to the fish lateral line organ restructures reafference to maximize proprioceptive information content. Fishes’ undulatory body motions induce reafferent feedback that can encode the body’s instantaneous configuration with respect to fluid flows. We combined experimental and computational analyses of swimming biomechanics and hair cell physiology to develop a neuromechanical model of how fish can track peak body curvature, a key signature of axial undulatory locomotion. Without CD, this computation would be challenged by sensory adaptation, typified by decaying sensitivity and phase distortions with respect to an input stimulus. We find that CD interacts synergistically with sensor polarization to sharpen sensitivity along sensors’ preferred axes. The sharpening of sensitivity regulates spiking to a narrow interval coinciding with peak reafferent stimulation, which prevents adaptation and homogenizes the otherwise variable sensor output. Our integrative model reveals a vital role of CD for ensuring precise proprioceptive feedback during undulatory locomotion, which we term external proprioception.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dynamic large-scale connectivity of intrinsic cortical oscillations supports adaptive listening in challenging conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohsen Alavash, Sarah Tune, Jonas Obleser</p>

In multi-talker situations, individuals adapt behaviorally to the listening challenge mostly with ease, but how do brain neural networks shape this adaptation? We here establish a long-sought link between large-scale neural communications in electrophysiology and behavioral success in the control of attention in difficult listening situations. In an age-varying sample of <i>N =</i> 154 individuals, we find that connectivity between intrinsic neural oscillations extracted from source-reconstructed electroencephalography is regulated according to the listener’s goal during a challenging dual-talker task. These dynamics occur as spatially organized modulations in power-envelope correlations of alpha and low-beta neural oscillations during approximately 2-s intervals most critical for listening behavior relative to resting-state baseline. First, left frontoparietal low-beta connectivity (16 to 24 Hz) increased during anticipation and processing of spatial-attention cue before speech presentation. Second, posterior alpha connectivity (7 to 11 Hz) decreased during comprehension of competing speech, particularly around target-word presentation. Connectivity dynamics of these networks were predictive of individual differences in the speed and accuracy of target-word identification, respectively, but proved unconfounded by changes in neural oscillatory activity strength. Successful adaptation to a listening challenge thus latches onto 2 distinct yet complementary neural systems: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state and an alpha-tuned posterior network supporting attention to speech.

The intestine is lined with isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) that facilitate sampling of luminal antigens to elicit immune responses. Technical challenges related to the scarcity and small sizes of ILFs and their follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) impeded the characterization of their spatial gene expression programs. Here, we combined RNA sequencing of laser capture microdissected tissues with single-molecule transcript imaging to obtain a spatial gene expression map of the ILF and its associated FAE in the mouse small intestine. We identified zonated expression programs in both follicles and FAEs, with a decrease in enterocyte antimicrobial and absorption programs and a partial induction of expression programs normally observed at the villus tip. We further identified Lepr+ subepithelial telocytes at the FAE top, which are distinct from villus tip Lgr5+ telocytes. Our analysis exposes the epithelial and mesenchymal cell states associated with ILFs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and whether this association differs after risk stratification based on the Age, Blood Pressure, Clinical Features, Duration of Symptoms, Diabetes (ABCD<sup>2</sup>) score.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>INSPiRE-TMS was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with minor stroke or TIA to an intensified support program or conventional care. In this post hoc analysis, participants were categorized using hs-cTnT levels (5th generation; Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany; 99th percentile upper reference limit [URL] = 14ng/l). Vascular risk was stratified using the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score (lower risk = 0–5 vs higher risk = 6–7). Cox proportional hazard regression was performed using covariate adjustment and propensity score matching (PSM) for the association between hs-cTnT and MACE (stroke/nonfatal coronary event/vascular death).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 889 patients (mean age = 70 years, 37% female), MACE occurred in 153 patients (17.2%) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. hs-cTnT was associated with MACE (9.3%/yr, &gt;URL vs 4.4%/yr, ≤URL, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–2.35], adjusted HR [Q<sub>4</sub> vs Q<sub>1</sub>] = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.35–4.97], adjusted HR [log-transformed] = 2.31 [95% CI = 1.37–3.89]). This association remained after PSM (adjusted HR = 1.76 [95% CI = 1.14–2.72]). There was a significant interaction between hs-cTnT and ABCD<sup>2</sup> category for MACE occurrence (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.04). In the lower risk category, MACE rate was 9.5%/yr in patients with hs-cTnT &gt; URL, which was higher than in those ≤URL (3.8%/yr) and similar to the overall rate in the higher risk category.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with incident MACE within 3 years after minor stroke or TIA and may help to identify high-risk individuals otherwise deemed at lower risk based on the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score. If confirmed in independent validation studies, this might warrant intensified secondary prevention measures and cardiac diagnostics in stroke patients with elevated hs-cTnT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Do Maya women have the chance to improve their quality of life? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Maya families suffered greatly during the henequen industry in the Yucatan, but the lives of the Maya women at the time were perhaps worse than anywhere in the world. Changes in Maya body height over the 20th century were assessed in order to show secular changes. The use of the sexual dimorphism index (SDI) allowed for the evaluation of the living conditions prevailing during the existence of the henequen haciendas to the Mexican revolution and a gradual improvement of these conditions by the end of the 20th century. Methods: In 1994, 364 men and 320 women aged 20-98 years were studied in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. They were divided into six age groups and by gender: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70+ years. Stature for both genders, and age at menarche for women were considered. SDI in stature was calculated to assess living conditions. Results: There were smaller (0.25 cm/10 years) changes in height in men than in women (0.9 cm/10 years) and no significant changes in acceleration of maturation. SDI results showed changes from 9.9 to 7.6, and this may indicate a constant, but very small improvement of living conditions. The age at menarche of women did not show statistically significant acceleration with age. Conclusions: In the colonial period of the late 19th century until the Mexican Revolution, women were worse off than men. Previous research has shown that when living conditions change, men always react faster than women, e.g. by lowering or increasing body height. Our study of the Maya population in the 20th century showed otherwise; female height increased more than male height. This may reflect that the living conditions of Maya men have not changed over the 20th century, but have improved for women.

                Background: Since the emergence of HIV and the AIDS pandemic, the majority of risk-reduction interventions have been centred on the use of condoms in sex workers. Methods: This qualitative study recruited 25 male migrant sex workers in London to understand their risk perception and condomless sex experiences within the context of sex work and private life. The data was collected using face-to-face interviews, analysed using thematic analysis, and the findings interpreted through the theory of planned behaviour. Results: The themes explain that condomless sex with clients occurred when participants consciously accepted to perform this service deploying a risk assessment of clients, faulty strategies, and sexual practices to reduce their risk; or when they lost control because of recreational drugs, feeling attraction to clients, in precarious circumstances, or were victims of violence. Conversely, condomless sex with non-commercial partners occurred according to the type of relationship, with formal partners it was rationalised through emotional aspects attached to this kind of relationship, while with casual partners it was connected to sexual arousal and the use of alcohol and drugs.  Conclusions: Reinforce educational interventions to deliver STI-HIV information, enhance the use of condoms, and to address specific contextual factors that facilitate condomless practice with commercial and non-commercial sexual partners.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantifying endothelial cell proliferation in the zebrafish embryo [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Endothelial cell (EC) proliferation is a fundamental determinant of vascular development and homeostasis, and contributes to cardiovascular disease by increasing vascular permeability to blood-borne lipoproteins. Rodents have been traditionally used to analyse EC proliferation mechanisms in vascular health and disease; however, alternative models such as the zebrafish embryo allow researchers to conduct small scale screening studies in a physiologically relevant vasculature whilst reducing the use of mammals in biomedical research. In vitro models of EC proliferation are valuable but do not fully recapitulate the complexity of the in vivo situation. Several groups have used zebrafish embryos for vascular biology research because they offer the advantages of an in vivo model in terms of complexity but are also genetically manipulable and optically transparent. Methods: Here we investigated whether zebrafish embryos can provide a suitable model for the study of EC proliferation. We explored the use of antibody, DNA labelling, and time-lapse imaging approaches. Results: Antibody and DNA labelling approaches were of limited use in zebrafish due to the low rate of EC proliferation combined with the relatively narrow window of time in which they can label proliferating nuclei. By contrast, time-lapse imaging of fluorescent proteins localised to endothelial nuclei was a sensitive method to quantify EC proliferation in zebrafish embryos. Discussion: We conclude that time-lapse imaging is suitable for analysis of endothelial cell proliferation in zebrafish, and that this method is capable of capturing more instances of EC proliferation than immunostaining or cell labelling alternatives. This approach is relevant to anyone studying endothelial cell proliferation for screening genes or small molecules involved in EC proliferation. It offers greater biological relevance than existing in vitro models such as HUVECs culture, whilst reducing the overall number of animals used for this type of research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Status of self-esteem in medical students of a college in Kathmandu: A descriptive cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Self-esteem is vital to living a happy, confident and content life. Medical students experience various forms of stress due to academic, financial and social pressures which could affect their levels of self-esteem. This study aims to study the status of self-esteem among undergraduates of a medical college at Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Methods: After receiving the ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC) of NAIHS; we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among the first- to fifth-year medical students from December 2020 to April 2021. 190 were selected for the study using a stratified random sampling technique. This study used the Rosenberg self-esteem scale to measure self–esteem of the participants. A Google Forms questionnaire was sent to the participants via email. Then, the data obtained were entered in the Google sheet and later analyzed using SPSS 27. A Chi-square test was used to identify potential differences in self-esteem scores among different variables. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results: This study included a total of 180 participants, among which, 18.9% (13.19% to 24.61%; at 95% CI) students showed low self -esteem. 74.4% (68.02% to 80.78%; at 95% CI) students had normal self-esteem and 6.7% (3.05% to 10.35%; at 95% CI) students had high self-esteem. The mean self-esteem score was 19.19 (15.01 to 23.37; at 95% CI). Female participants suffered more than males from low self-esteem, and third-year students had the highest percentage of low self-esteem (30.77%). Conclusion: The majority (74.4%) of medical students had normal self-esteem. However, 18.9% students had low self-esteem, among which, third-year students suffered the most (30.77%). Likewise, females exhibited higher prevalence of low self-esteem compared to males. Interventions to boost the level of self-esteem should be carried out to help medical students become confident and efficient doctors.

                Background - 3D printing is a dynamic process with many process parameters influencing the product, including the type of the material; it is often difficult to understand the combined influence of these parameters.   Purpose - The tensile strength of 3D printed parts is important for the functionality of components. The effects of process parameters on tensile strength must therefore be examined. The objective of this study is to develop a response surface model (RSM) to predict the final quality of a 3D printed bronze part from a different set of input parameters.   Methods - The tensile test specimen was built in a Makerbot 3D printer with bronze polylactic acid (PLA) material. The three controllable input parameters were; thickness of layers, number of shells, and infill density. The three levels of layer thickness were 0.1mm, 0.2mm and 0.3mm. The number of shells was 2, 3 and 4. The infill densities were 20%, 30% and 40%. A tensile experiment tested the strength of the specimens. RSM is a statistical approach for modelling and analyzing how different variables affect the response of interest, and for optimizing it.   Results - The result obtained shows that the specimen with a high layer thickness of 0.3mm and infill density of 40% is the best among all the other parameters. Finally, the regression equation produced was used for random values of layer thickness, the number of shells, and infill density, to see whether the values obtained from the tests fall into the range of experimental data.   Conclusion - Infill density and layer thickness are the two criteria that significantly influence the tensile property. The number of shells has the least influence on the tensile property. However, the best tensile strength is the part printed with higher infill density, a greater number of shells, and higher layer thickness.

     alt="Constitutive tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficiency causes a reduction in spine density in mouse dentate granule cells accompanied by homeostatic adaptations of spine head size"/>
<p>TNF plays a role in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the CNS. To investigate whether constitutive TNF-deficiency affects the number and geometry of dendritic spines, dentate granule cells of TNF-deficient mice and controls were intracellularly filled and immunolabeled for the plasticity-related protein Synaptopodin (SP), which marks strong and stable spines. Spine head area, density, presence of SP and SP cluster size were analyzed blindly. Constitutively TNF-deficient granule cells had ∼20% fewer spines compared to controls and exhibited a homeostatic increase in head size of large SP+ spines. These changes are similar to those reported after entorhinal denervation of granule cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The majority of excitatory synapses terminating on cortical neurons are found on dendritic spines. The geometry of spines, in particular the size of the spine head, tightly correlates with the strength of the excitatory synapse formed with the spine. Under conditions of synaptic plasticity, spine geometry may change, reflecting functional adaptations. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to influence synaptic transmission as well as Hebbian and homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity, we speculated that TNF-deficiency may cause concomitant structural changes at the level of dendritic spines. To address this question, we analyzed spine density and spine head area of Alexa568-filled granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult C57BL/6J and TNF-deficient (TNF-KO) mice. Tissue sections were double-stained for the actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein synaptopodin (SP), a molecular marker for strong and stable spines. Dendritic segments of TNF-deficient granule cells exhibited ∼20% fewer spines in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus compared to controls, indicating a reduced afferent innervation. Of note, these segments also had larger spines containing larger SP-clusters. This pattern of changes is strikingly similar to the one seen after denervation-associated spine loss following experimental entorhinal denervation of granule cells: Denervated granule cells increase the SP-content and strength of their remaining spines to homeostatically compensate for those that were lost. Our data suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in TNF-deficient granule cells in response to a reduction in their afferent innervation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Motion and Geometric Feature Analysis for Real-time Automatic Micro-expression Recognition Systems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The trend of real-time micro-expression recognition systems has increased with recent advancements in human-computer interaction (HCI) in security and healthcare. Several studies in this field contributed towards recognition accuracy, while few studies look into addressing the computation costs. In this paper, two approaches for micro-expression feature extraction are analyzed for real-time automatic micro-expression recognition. Firstly, motion-based approach, which calculates motion of subtle changes from an image sequence and present as features. Then, secondly, a low computational geometric-based feature extraction technique, a very popular method for facial expression recognition in real-time. These approaches were integrated in a developed system together with a facial landmark detection algorithm and a classifier for real-time analysis. Moreover, the recognition performance were evaluated using SMIC, CASME, CAS(ME)2 and SAMM datasets. The results suggest that the optimized Bi-WOOF (leveraging on motion-based features) yields the highest accuracy of 68.5%, while the full-face graph (leveraging on geometric-based features) yields 75.53% on the SAMM dataset. On the other hand, the optimized Bi-WOOF processes sample at 0.36 seconds and full-face graph processes sample at 0.10 seconds with a 640x480 image size. All experiments were performed on an Intel i5-3470 machine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of EMR implementation regarding reducing documentation errors and waiting time for patients in outpatient clinics: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electronic medical records (EMRs) refer to the digital copies of paper notes prepared in the physician’s office, outpatient clinics and other departments in health care institutes. EMRs are considered to be significant and preferable to paper records because they allow providers to keep accurate track of patient data and monitoring over time, thus reducing errors, and enhance overall health care quality. The aim of this systematic review was to highlight the significance of EMRs and the effectiveness of implementation regarding reducing documentation errors and waiting time for patients in outpatient clinics. Methods: PubMed, Central, Ovid, Scopus, Science Direct, Elsevier, Cochrane , WHO website and the McMaster University Health Evidence website from 2005-2020 were searched to identify studies that investigated the association between the EMR implementation and documentation error and waiting time for patients. A reviewer screened identified citations and extracted data according to the PRISMA guidelines and data was synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: After full text examination of the articles selected for this literature review, the major themes of relevance that were identified in the context of reducing documentation errors and waiting time for patients in outpatient clinic include: reduction of medical errors because of fewer documentation errors resulting from EMR implementation and reduction of waiting time for patients due to overall improvement of system workflow after use of EMRs. Conclusion: In summary of the reviewed evidence from published material, the implementation of an EMR system in any outpatient setting appears to reduce documentation errors (medication dose errors, issues of prescription errors). It was also seen that in many settings, waiting time for patients in outpatient clinics was reduced with EMR use, while in other settings it was not possible to determine if any significant improvement was seen in this aspect after EMR implementation.

                Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the commonest indirect medical cause of maternal deaths worldwide, both in high-income and low and middle-income countries. To minimize the effects of CVD in pregnancy, proper risk assessment and appropriate referral is required. In Sri Lanka, cardiovascular disease complicating pregnancy is a significant cause of maternal mortality, second only to postpartum hemorrhage. Screening for CVD in pregnancy in Sri Lanka is limited to a routine clinical assessment. Evidence-based guidelines are yet to be developed, and this deficit may have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the CVD burden. This study aims to determine the burden of CVD in early pregnancy and develop a risk prediction model to be used in field pregnancy clinics in Sri Lanka to reduce CVD effects in pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in the Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Following registration to the antenatal care, pregnant women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were invited to attend a special clinic at their relevant Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Risk assessment was done through history and a clinical examination, and suspected/probable cases were referred for an echocardiogram by a consultant cardiologist. All the recruited participants in the first trimester were prospectively followed up and screened again between 24–28 weeks of the period of amenorrhoea (POA). Antenatal ward admissions with CVD complicating pregnancy will be extracted, and a telephone interview will be carried out between 6–12 weeks after the expected delivery date to cover postpartum morbidities.  Discussion This proposed study will be the largest of its kind carried out in the local setting. The study's findings will be beneficial for policymakers to develop guidelines to reduce maternal cardiovascular disease morbidities and mortalities in Sri Lanka.

                Background: Bacteria can adhere and grow on any surface due to their chemical and physical interaction, leading to the development of biofilms. Essential oils have a great potential for use in the food industry, as they can effectively prevent the presence of some pathogenic microorganisms.  Species such as those in the Bacillus genus have the ability to produce toxins. Some strains of Bacillus subtilis have been related to cases of food‐borne diseases. In the bakery industry, B. subtilis also has been related to “rope” disease, linked to bread preservation processes. Methods: The aim of the study was to analyse the antibacterial properties of 24 chemotyped essential oils against the growth of B. subtilis. The biological activity study was carried out using disk diffusion in agar and broth dilution methods. Results: The essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii var. motia had a high geraniol content (>80.53%) and showed a high antimicrobial effect against the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis. Binary combinations of Cymbopogon martinii var. motia oil with Eugenia caryophyllus showed antagonistic effects on B. subtilis. Conclusions:  The essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii var. motia has an interesting potential use in the bakery industry as a preservative, in applications such as nano encapsulation for bakery doughs, active packaging of baked products, or surface disinfectants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation associated with aerobic exercise on the autonomic modulation of hemiparetic individuals due to stroke: a study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved wi</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individuals after a stroke have an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, which increases the risk of death or recurrent episodes of stroke. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) combined with aerobic exercise has shown an effect on the modulation of this system. Objective: The Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and the distance traveled on the exercise bike will be assessed to verify the additional impact of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on individuals with chronic stroke sequelae. Methods: The 34 adult individuals with diagnoses of chronic stroke will be randomized into two aerobic exercise intervention groups: G1 (with active tDCS) and G2 (with sham tDCS), three times a week, for 12 weeks. Procedures: tDCS will be implemented during the aerobic exercise with the anodal electrode positioned over the lateral dorsal prefrontal left cortex, and the cathodal electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region, with 2mA, for 20 minutes. Assessments will be carried out pre, immediately after the intervention, and on the 12th, 24th, 36th interventions, and 30 days later. The HRV data that are pulse interval (PI), square root of the mean of the squares of the differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), absolute high frequency (HF), absolute low frequency (LF), high and low frequency ratio (LF / HF) will be collected using a cardio frequency meter. The analysis of the distance traveled on the exercise bike before and after interventions will be analyzed in meters. Discussion: The autonomic control via brain networks after a stroke can be altered and can promote an increase in sympathetic tone, and a higher risk of sudden death or relapse of stroke.  It is crucial to demonstrate the effectiveness of available treatments to improve the autonomic function. Trial registration: The study is registered as a BRAZILIAN CLINICAL TEST RECORD (ReBEC): U1111-1222-4588 on the 2018/10/16

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A mechanism for inter-areal coherence through communication based on connectivity and oscillatory power</a></h4>

              
                Schneider et al. establish a mechanism for inter-areal coherence between field potentials, where it is the result and not the cause of communication. Consequently, coherence depends in a lawful manner on connectivity and power and does not require spiking entrainment. This mechanism explains behavior-related changes in fronto-parietal and LGN-V1 coherence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A pre-screening strategy to assess resected tumor margins by imaging cytoplasmic viscosity and hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                To assure complete tumor removal, frozen section analysis is the most common procedure for intraoperative pathological assessment of resected tumor margins. However, during one operation, multiple biopsies may be sent for examination, but only few of them are made into cryosections because of the complex preparation protocols and time-consuming pathological analysis, which potentially increases the risk of overlooking tumor involvement. Here, we propose a fluorescence-based pre-screening strategy that allows high-throughput, convenient, and fast gross assessment of resected tumor margins. A dual-activatable cationic fluorescent molecular rotor was developed to specifically illuminate live tumor cells’ cytoplasm by emitting two different fluorescence signals in response to elevations in hypoxia-induced nitroreductase (a biochemical marker) and cytoplasmic viscosity (a biophysical marker), two characteristics of cancer cells. The ability of the fluorescent molecular rotor in detecting tumor cells was evaluated in mouse and human specimens of multiple tissues by comparing with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Importantly, the fluorescent molecular rotor achieved 100% specificity in discriminating lung and liver cancers from normal tissue, allowing pre-screening of the tumor-free surgical margins and promoting clinical decision. Altogether, this type of fluorescent molecular rotor and the proposed strategy may serve as a new option to facilitate intraoperative assessment of resected tumor margins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A beta-glucosidase of an insect herbivore determines both toxicity and deterrence of a dandelion defense metabolite</a></h4>

              
                Gut enzymes can metabolize plant defense compounds and thereby affect the growth and fitness of insect herbivores. Whether these enzymes also influence feeding preference is largely unknown. We studied the metabolization of taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), a sesquiterpene lactone of the common dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>) that deters its major root herbivore, the common cockchafer larva (<i>Melolontha melolontha</i>). We have demonstrated that TA-G is rapidly deglucosylated and conjugated to glutathione in the insect gut. A broad-spectrum <i>M. melolontha</i> β-glucosidase, Mm_bGlc17, is sufficient and necessary for TA-G deglucosylation. Using cross-species RNA interference, we have shown that Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G toxicity. Furthermore, Mm_bGlc17 is required for the preference of <i>M. melolontha</i> larvae for TA-G-deficient plants. Thus, herbivore metabolism modulates both the toxicity and deterrence of a plant defense compound. Our work illustrates the multifaceted roles of insect digestive enzymes as mediators of plant-herbivore interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcription initiation at a consensus bacterial promoter proceeds via a 'bind-unwind-load-and-lock' mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Transcription initiation starts with unwinding of promoter DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP) to form a catalytically competent RNAP-promoter complex (RP<sub>O</sub>). Despite extensive study, the mechanism of promoter unwinding has remained unclear, in part due to the transient nature of intermediates on path to RPo. Here, using single-molecule unwinding-induced fluorescence enhancement to monitor promoter unwinding, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor RNAP clamp conformation, we analyze RPo formation at a consensus bacterial core promoter. We find that the RNAP clamp is closed during promoter binding, remains closed during promoter unwinding, and then closes further, locking the unwound DNA in the RNAP active-centre cleft. Our work defines a new, 'bind-unwind-load-and-lock' model for the series of conformational changes occurring during promoter unwinding at a consensus bacterial promoter and provides the tools needed to examine the process in other organisms and at other promoters.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fibrinogen αC-subregions critically contribute blood clot fibre growth, mechanical stability and resistance to fibrinolysis</a></h4>

              
                Fibrinogen is essential for blood coagulation. The C-terminus of the fibrinogen α-chain (αC-region) is composed of an αC-domain and αC-connector. Two recombinant fibrinogen variants (α390 and α220) were produced to investigate the role of subregions in modulating clot stability and resistance to lysis. The α390 variant, truncated before the αC-domain, produced clots with a denser structure and thinner fibres. In contrast, the α220 variant, truncated at the start of the αC-connector, produced clots that were porous with short, stunted fibres and visible fibre ends. These clots were mechanically weak and susceptible to lysis. Our data demonstrate differential effects for the αC-subregions in fibrin polymerisation, clot mechanical strength, and fibrinolytic susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the αC-subregions are key for promoting longitudinal fibre growth. Together, these findings highlight critical functions of the αC-subregions in relation to clot structure and stability, with future implications for development of novel therapeutics for thrombosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">IFN-γ mediates Paneth cell death via suppression of mTOR</a></h4>

              
                Paneth cells constitutively produce antimicrobial peptides and growth factors that allow for intestinal homeostasis, host protection and intestinal stem cell replication. Paneth cells rely heavily on the glycolytic metabolic program, which is in part controlled by the kinase complex Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1). Yet, little is known about mTOR importance in Paneth cell integrity under steady state and inflammatory conditions. Our results demonstrate that IFN-γ, a crucial mediator of the intestinal inflammation, acts directly on murine Paneth cells to alter their mitochondrial integrity and membrane potential, resulting in an mTORC1-dependent cell death mechanism distinct from canonical cell death pathways including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. These results were established with the purified cytokine and a physiologically relevant common Th1-inducing human parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Given the crucial role for IFN-γ, which is a cytokine frequently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compromised Paneth cell functions, the identified mechanisms underlying mTORC1-dependent Paneth cell death downstream of IFN-γ may provide promising novel approaches for treating intestinal inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein Phosphatase 1 in association with Bud14 inhibits mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Mitotic exit in budding yeast is dependent on correct orientation of the mitotic spindle along the cell polarity axis. When accurate positioning of the spindle fails, a surveillance mechanism named the Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC) prevents cells from exiting mitosis. Mutants with a defective SPOC become multinucleated and lose their genomic integrity. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the SPOC mechanism is missing. In this study, we identified the type 1 protein phosphatase, Glc7, in association with its regulatory protein Bud14 as a novel checkpoint component. We further showed that Glc7-Bud14 promotes dephosphorylation of the SPOC effector protein Bfa1. Our results suggest a model in which two mechanisms act in parallel for a robust checkpoint response: first, the SPOC kinase Kin4 isolates Bfa1 away from the inhibitory kinase Cdc5 and second, Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 to fully activate the checkpoint effector.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subcellular localization of mutant P23H rhodopsin in an RFP fusion knockin mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                The P23H mutation in rhodopsin (Rho), the visual pigment protein in rod photoreceptor neurons, is the most common genetic cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a retinal disease that causes blindness. Despite multiple studies in animal models, the subcellular details of the fate of misfolded mutant Rho in rod photoreceptors have not been completely defined. We generated a new mouse model of adRP, in which the P23H-Rho mutant allele is fused to Tag-RFP-T (P23HhRhoRFP). In heterozygotes, outer segments formed, and WT rhodopsin was properly localized there, but mutant P23H-Rho protein was specifically mislocalized in the inner segments of rods. Despite this cellular phenotype, the P23HhRhoRFP heterozygous mice exhibited only slowly progressing retinal degeneration; in ERG recordings, scotopic a-wave amplitudes were reduced by 24% and 26% at 30 days and 90 days respectively, and the corresponding scotopic b-waves by 18% and 24%. Outer nuclear layer thickness was still 80% of WT at 90 days, but at 364 days had declined to 40% of WT. Transmission electron microscopy revealed greatly expanded membrane lamellae in the inner segment, and by fluorescence imaging, we determined that the mislocalized P23HhRhoRFP was contained in greatly expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. TUNEL staining revealed a slow pace of cell death involving chromosomal endonucleolytic degradation. Quantification of mRNA for markers of ER stress and the unfolded protein response revealed little or no increases in levels of messages encoding the proteins BiP, CHOP, ATF6, XBP1, PERK, Eif2 and Derlin-1, but a decreased level of total Rhodopsin (mouse + human) mRNA levels. The decline in the rate of cell death after an initial burst suggests that P23HhRhoRFP mutant rods undergo an adaptative process that prolongs survival despite gross P23HhRhoRFP protein accumulation in the ER. Because of its slowly progressing nature, and easy visualization of the mutant protein, the P23H-Rho-RFP mouse may represent a useful tool for the future study of the pathology and treatment of P23H-Rho and adRP.

	<p>Correct blinding is essential for preventing potential biases. The aim of this study was to assess the blinding of participants and a therapist following treatment with transcranial direct current stimulation in subjects with fibromyalgia using James’ and Bang’s blinding indexes. Eighty subjects were randomly allocated either active or sham stimulation groups in an intervention of five sessions lasting 20 min each. A questionnaire was delivered to both the therapist and patients after the last session to record their guess of which treatment had been applied. No differences between the groups were noted at baseline in terms of demographic or clinical data. James’ BI was 0.83 (CI 95%: 0.76–0.90) for the patients and 0.55 (CI 95%: 0.45–0.64) for the therapist. Bang’s BI for subjects was −0.08 (CI 95%: −0.24–0.09) and −0.8 (CI 95%: −0.26–0.1) for the active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation groups, respectively. Bang’s BI for the therapist was 0.21 (CI 95%: −0.02–0.43) and 0.13 (CI 95%: −0.09–0.35) for the active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation groups, respectively. Protocols of active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation applied in this study have shown satisfactory blinding of the therapist and subjects with fibromyalgia.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Complement system activation has been proposed as one of the different factors that contribute to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to describe the potential effects of eculizumab, an anticomplement therapy, on MS disease activity in a cohort of relapsing–remitting (RR) MS patients who discontinued IFN-β therapy due to IFN-β-related thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) onset. (2) Methods: In this retrospective observational multicentric study, we searched for all patients with MS treated by eculizumab with a survey of several nephrological and neurological centers (over 45 centers). (3) Results: Nine patients were included. The mean follow-up time under eculizumab was 3.72 ± 2.58 years. There were no significant differences in disease activity (EDSS, relapses, new T2, and/or Gd-enhancing lesions at MRI) considering the two years before and after eculizumab therapy. No adverse events potentially related to eculizumab therapy were reported during follow-up. (4) Conclusions: In this preliminary study, we described a good safety profile for eculizumab therapy in MS. However, the available data are not sufficient to make firm conclusions about the possible efficacy of eculizumab as a disease-modifying therapy for MS patients.</p>

	<p>Few systematic evaluations have been performed of the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a relapse prevention strategy in major depressive disorder (MDD). This is a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy plus maintenance ECT (M-Pharm/ECT) versus pharmacotherapy alone (M-Pharm) in the prevention of MDD relapse. Subjects with MDD who had remitted with bilateral acute ECT (n = 37) were randomly assigned to receive M-Pharm/ECT (n = 19, 14 treatments) or M-Pharm (n = 18) for nine months. The subjects were followed up for 15 months. The main outcome was relapse of depression, defined as a score of 18 or more on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. At nine months, 35% of the subjects treated with M-Pharm/ECT relapsed as compared with 61% of the patients treated with M-Pharm. No statistically significant differences between groups were indicated by either Kaplan–Meier or Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The subjects without psychotic features were at higher risk of relapse. There were no statistically significant differences in the MMSE scores of the two groups at the end of the study. Further studies are needed to better define the indications for M-ECT in order to improve its efficacy as a relapse prevention strategy.</p>

	<p>Inter-individual and sex differences in pain responses are recognized but their mechanisms are not well understood. This study was intended to provide the behavioral framework for analyses of pain mechanisms using fear extinction learning as a predictor of phenotypic and sex differences in sensory (mechanical withdrawal thresholds) and emotional-affective aspects (open field tests for anxiety-like behaviors and audible and ultrasonic components of vocalizations) of acute and chronic pain. In acute arthritis and chronic neuropathic pain models, greater increases in vocalizations were found in females than males and in females with poor fear extinction abilities than females with strong fear extinction, particularly in the neuropathic pain model. Female rats showed higher anxiety-like behavior than males under baseline conditions but no inter-individual or sex differences were seen in the pain models. No inter-individual and sex differences in mechanosensitivity were observed. The data suggest that vocalizations are uniquely suited to detect inter-individual and sex differences in pain models, particularly in chronic neuropathic pain, whereas no such differences were found for mechanosensitivity, and baseline differences in anxiety-like behaviors disappeared in the pain models.</p>

	<p>The restraining measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak deeply affected the general population’s sleep health and psychological status. The current literature proposes young and older people as two particularly at-risk groups. However, the differential impact of the lockdown period in these specific age categories needs to be disentangled. Through a web-based survey adopting validated questionnaires, we evaluated and compared sleep quality/habits, insomnia, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms of Italian late adolescents (n = 670; mean age ± SD, 19.38 ± 0.74, 18–20 years) and elderly (n = 253; 68.18 ± 2.79, 65–75 years). Young respondents reported more severe insomnia symptoms, worse subjective sleep quality, longer sleep latency, higher daytime dysfunction, and a more prevalent disruption of sleep habits (bedtime, get-up time, nap) than the elderly. On the other hand, older participants showed shorter sleep duration, lower habitual sleep efficiency, and greater use of sleep medications. Finally, the younger population displayed higher levels of depression and perceived stress. Our findings indicate that the lockdown period had more pervasive repercussions on sleep and the mental health of late adolescents. The implementation of supportive strategies is encouraged for this vulnerable population group.</p>

	<p>Microglia, the immune cells in the brain involved in both homeostasis and injury/infection control, play a predominant role in neurodegenerative diseases. In vivo studies on microglia are limited due to the requirement of surgical intervention, which can lead to the destruction of the tissues. Over the last few years, multiple protocols—presenting a variety of strategies—have described microglia differentiation issued from human pluripotent stem cells. Herein, we have reanalyzed the transcriptomes released on six different microglia differentiation protocols and revealed a consensus core of master transcription regulatory circuitry defining microglia identity. Furthermore, we have discussed the major divergencies among the studied protocols and have provided suggestions to further enhance microglia differentiation assays.</p>

	<p>There is evidence that abnormalities in eye movements exist during reading in dyslexic individuals. A few recent studies applied Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to such eye movement data to predict dyslexia. A general problem with these studies is that eye movement data sets are limited to reading saccades and fixations that are confounded by reading difficulty, e.g., it is unclear whether abnormalities are the consequence or the cause of reading difficulty. Recently, Ward and Kapoula used LED targets (with the REMOBI &amp;amp;amp; AIDEAL method) to demonstrate abnormalities of large saccades and vergence eye movements in depth demonstrating intrinsic eye movement problems independent from reading in dyslexia. In another study, binocular eye movements were studied while reading two texts: one using the “Alouette” text, which has no meaning and requires word decoding, the other using a meaningful text. It was found the Alouette text exacerbates eye movement abnormalities in dyslexics. In this paper, we more precisely quantify the quality of such eye movement descriptors for dyslexia detection. We use the descriptors produced in the four different setups as input to multiple classifiers and compare their generalization performances. Our results demonstrate that eye movement data from the Alouette test predicts dyslexia with an accuracy of 81.25%; similarly, we were able to predict dyslexia with an accuracy of 81.25% when using data from saccades to LED targets on the Remobi device and 77.3% when using vergence movements to LED targets. Noticeably, eye movement data from the meaningful text produced the lowest accuracy (70.2%). In a subsequent analysis, ML algorithms were applied to predict reading speed based on eye movement descriptors extracted from the meaningful reading, then from Remobi saccade and vergence tests. Remobi vergence eye movement descriptors can predict reading speed even better than eye movement descriptors from the meaningful reading test.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14-16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 hours post-inoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using In situ Hybridization and/or Immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt;50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker TpH2. Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated GABA transporter VGAT with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early evoked brain activity underlies auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                ObjectivesPeople with Schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits in auditory and audiovisual speech recognition. It is possible that these deficits are related to aberrant early sensory processing, combined with an impaired ability to utilize visual cues to improve speech recognition. In this electroencephalography study we tested this by having SZ and healthy controls (HC) identify different unisensory auditory and bisensory audiovisual syllables at different auditory noise levels.

MethodsSZ (N = 24) and HC (N = 21) identified one of three different syllables (/da/, /ga/, /ta/) at three different noise levels (no, low, high). Half the trials were unisensory auditory and the other half provided additional visual input of moving lips. Task-evoked mediofrontal N1 and P2 brain potentials triggered to the onset of the auditory syllables were derived and related to behavioral performance.

ResultsIn comparison to HC, SZ showed speech recognition deficits for unisensory and bisensory stimuli. These deficits were primarily found in the no noise condition. Paralleling these observations, reduced N1 amplitudes to unisensory and bisensory stimuli in SZ were found in the no noise condition. In HC the N1 amplitudes were positively related to the speech recognition performance, whereas no such relationships were found in SZ. Moreover, no group differences in multisensory speech recognition benefits and N1 suppression effects for bisensory stimuli were observed.

ConclusionOur study shows that reduced N1 amplitudes relate to auditory and audiovisual speech processing deficits in SZ. The findings that the amplitude effects were confined to salient speech stimuli and the attenuated relationship with behavioral performance, compared to HC, indicates a diminished decoding of the auditory speech signals in SZs. Our study also revealed intact multisensory benefits in SZs, which indicates that the observed auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits were primarily related to aberrant auditory speech processing.

HighlightsSpeech processing deficits in schizophrenia related to reduced N1 amplitudes Audiovisual suppression effect in N1 preserved in schizophrenia Schizophrenia showed weakened P2 components in specifically audiovisual processing

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human pluripotent stem cell-derived photoreceptors switch from cell autonomous axon extension to non-cell autonomous process pulling during synaptic marker redistribution.</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptors (PRs) are the primary visual sensory cells, and their loss leads to blindness that is currently incurable. Cell replacement therapy holds promise as a therapeutic approach to restore vision to those who have lost PRs through damage or disease. While PR transplant research is ongoing in animal models, success is hindered by our limited understanding of PR axon growth during development and regeneration. Using a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter line that labels PRs (WA09 CRX+/tdTomato), we generated retinal organoids in order to study mechanisms of PR process extension. We found that the earliest born PRs exhibit autonomous axon extension from dynamic terminals that appear similar to projection neuron growth cones. However, as hPSC-derived PRs age from 40 to 80 days of differentiation, they lose dynamic terminals in 2D plated cultures and within 3D retinal organoids, which does not correlate with cell birth date. Using a rod-specific hPSC reporter line (WA09 NRL+/eGFP), we further determined that rod PRs never form motile growth cones. Interestingly, PRs without motile terminals are still capable of extending axons, but neurites are generated from process stretching via their attachment to motile non-PR cells, which underlies the observed differences in PR neurite lengths on different substrata. While immobile PR terminals express actin, it is less polymerized and less organized than actin present in motile terminals. However, immobile PRs do localize synaptic proteins to their terminals, suggesting a normal developmental progression. These findings help inform the development of PR transplant therapies to treat blinding diseases and provide a platform to test treatments that restore autonomous PR axon extension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Walking strides direct rapid and flexible recruitment of visual circuits for course control in </a></h4>

              
                Flexible mapping between activity in sensory systems and movement parameters is a hallmark of successful motor control. This flexibility depends on continuous comparison of short-term postural dynamics and the longer-term goals of an animal, thereby necessitating neural mechanisms that can operate across multiple timescales. To understand how such body-brain interactions emerge to control movement across timescales, we performed whole-cell patch recordings from visual neurons involved in course control in Drosophila. We demonstrate that the activity of leg mechanosensory cells, propagating via specific ascending neurons, is critical to provide a clock signal to the visual circuit for stride-by-stride steering adjustments and, at longer timescales, information on speed-associated motor context to flexibly recruit visual circuits for course control. Thus, our data reveal a stride-based mechanism for the control of high-performance walking operating at multiple timescales. We propose that this mechanism functions as a general basis for adaptive control of locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early mitochondrial stress and metabolic imbalance lead to photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit extensive genetic heterogeneity and complex etiology with varying onset and severity. To deduce the mechanism leading to retinal degeneration, we adopted a temporal multi-omics approach and examined molecular and cellular events before the onset of photoreceptor cell death in the widely-used Pde6brd1/rd1 (rd1) mouse model. Transcriptome profiling of neonatal and developing rods revealed early downregulation of genes associated with anabolic pathways and energy metabolism. Quantitative proteomics of rd1 retina showed early changes in calcium signaling and oxidative phosphorylation, with specific partial bypass of complex I electron transfer, which precede the onset of cell death. Concurrently, we detected alterations in central carbon metabolism, including dysregulation of components associated with glycolysis, pentose phosphate and purine biosynthesis. Ex vivo assays of oxygen consumption and transmission electron microscopy validated early and progressive mitochondrial stress and abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function of rd1 rods. These data uncover mitochondrial over-activation and related metabolic alterations as early determinants of pathology and implicate dysregulation of calcium signaling as the initiator of higher mitochondrial stress, which then transitions to mitochondrial damage and photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration. Our studies support the one hit model arguing against the cumulative damage hypothesis but suggest that cell death in neurodegenerative disease is initiated by specific rather than a random event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating Emotion Dynamics and Its Association with Multimedia Content During Video Watching Through EEG Microstate Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Emotions dynamically change in response to ever-changing environments. It is of great importance, both clinically and scientifically, to investigate the neural representation and evoking mechanism of emotion dynamics. But, there are many unknown places in this stream of research, such as consistent and conclusive findings are still lacking. In this work, we perform an in-depth investigation of emotion dynamics under a video-watching task by gauging the dynamic associations among evoked emotions, electroencephalography (EEG) responses, and multimedia stimulation. Here, we introduce EEG microstate analysis to study emotional EEG signals, which provides a spatial-temporal neural representation of emotion dynamics. To investigate the temporal characteristics of evoking emotions during video watching with its neural mechanism, we conduct two studies from the perspective of EEG microstates. In Study 1, the dynamic microstate activities under different emotion states and emotion levels are explored to identify EEG spatial-temporal correlates of emotion dynamics. In Study 2, the stimulation effects of multimedia content (visual and audio) on EEG microstate activities are examined to learn about the involved affective information and investigate the emotion-evoking mechanism. The results show that emotion dynamics could be well reflected by four EEG microstates (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4). Specifically, emotion tasks lead to an increase in MS2 and MS4 coverage but a decrease in MS3 coverage, duration, and occurrence. Meanwhile, there exists a negative association between valence and MS4 occurrence as well as a positive association between arousal and MS3 coverage and occurrence. Further, we find that MS4 and MS3 activities are significantly affected by visual and audio content, respectively. In this work, we verify the possibility to reveal emotion dynamics through EEG microstate analysis from sensory and stimulation dimensions, where EEG microstate features are found to be highly correlated to different emotion states (emotion task effect and level effect) and different affective information involved in the multimedia content (visual and audio). Our work deepens the understanding of the neural representation and evoking mechanism of emotion dynamics, which can be beneficial for future development in the applications of emotion decoding and regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type specific induction of cyclo-oxygenase-2 in layer II/III prefrontal cortical neurons mediates stress-induced anxiety phenotypes in mice.</a></h4>

              
                The ability of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to exert top-down control of behavior is affected by stress. The molecular response of mPFC to stress is incompletely understood, however, in part because of the region's cellular heterogeneity. Here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to map specific molecular cell types within the mPFC and to detect cell-type specific transcriptional changes to foot-shock stress. We identified Ptgs2, encoding cyclo-oxygenase 2, as an important candidate that is upregulated in layer II/III excitatory neurons after stress. Specifically, Ptgs2 was transiently upregulated with shock-induced fear learning and fear expression, along with Bdnf, Nptx2, and Lingo1, in a layer II/III neuronal population marked by the neuronal excitatory gene Slc17a7 and cell-type specific neuropeptide Penk. These dynamic cell-type specific expression patterns identified with snRNAseq were validated with quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization. Using a pharmacological approach, we found that systemic lumiracoxib, a selective Ptgs2-inhibitor, led to a significant reduction in fear expression. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Ptgs2 in excitatory Camk2a-expressing neurons led to reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Together these findings suggest that Ptgs2 is expressed in a dynamic, cell-type specific way in Layer II/III Penk+ neurons in mPFC, and that its role in prostaglandin and /or endocannabinoid regulation within these neurons may be an important mediator of stress-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes encode complex behaviorally relevant information</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes, glial cells of the central nervous system, help to regulate neural circuit operation and adaptation. They exhibit complex forms of chemical excitation, most prominently calcium transients, evoked by neuromodulator and -transmitter receptor activation. However, whether and how astrocytes contribute to cortical processing of complex behavior remains unknown. One of the puzzling features of astrocyte calcium transients is the high degree of variability in their spatial and temporal patterns under behaving conditions. Here, we provide mechanistic links between astrocytes' activity patterns, molecular signaling, and behavioral cognitive and motor activity variables by employing a visual detection task that allows for in vivo calcium imaging, robust statistical analyses, and machine learning approaches. We show that trial type and performance levels deterministically shape astrocytes' spatial and temporal response properties. Astrocytes encode the animals' decision, reward, and sensory properties. Our error analysis confirms that astrocytes carry behaviorally relevant information depending on and complementing neuronal coding. We also report that cell-intrinsic mechanisms curb astrocyte calcium activity. Additionally, we show that motor activity-related parameters strongly impact astrocyte responses and must be considered in sensorimotor study designs. Our data inform and constrain current models of astrocytes' contribution to complex behavior and brain computation beyond their established homeostatic and metabolic roles.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuropathological Variability within a Spectrum of NMDAR‐Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe the neuropathological features of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-encephalitis in an archival autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined four autopsies from patients with NMDAR-encephalitis; two patients were untreated, three had comorbidities: small cell lung cancer, brain post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and overlapping demyelination.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two untreated patients had inflammatory infiltrates predominantly composed of perivascular and parenchymal CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>−</sup> T cells and CD79a<sup>+</sup> B cells/plasma cells in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus with surrounding white matter. The hippocampi showed a significant decrease of NMDAR-immunoreactivity that correlated with disease severity. The patient with NMDAR-encephalitis and immunosuppression for kidney transplantation developed a brain monomorphic PTLD. Inflammatory changes were compatible with NMDAR-encephalitis. Additionally, plasma cells accumulated in the vicinity of the necrotic tumor along with macrophages and activated microglia that strongly expressed pro-inflammatory activation markers HLA-DR, CD68, and IL18. The fourth patient developed demyelinating lesions in the setting of a relapse 4 years after NMDAR-encephalitis. These lesions exhibited the hallmarks of classic multiple sclerosis with radially expanding lesions and remyelinated shadow plaques without complement or immunoglobulin deposition, compatible with a pattern I demyelination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The topographic distribution of inflammation in patients with NMDAR-encephalitis reflects the clinical symptoms of movement disorders, abnormal behavior, and memory dysfunction with inflammation dominantly observed in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, and loss of NMDAR-immunoreactivity correlates with disease severity. Co-occurring pathologies influence the spatial distribution, composition, and intensity of inflammation, which may modify patients’ clinical presentation and outcome.

                <p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody (Ab)–associated diseases (MOGADs) account for a substantial proportion of pediatric and adult patients who present with acquired demyelinating disorders. Its pathogenesis and optimal therapy are incompletely understood. We profiled systemic complement activation in adult and pediatric patients with MOGAD compared with patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and pediatric control and adult healthy donors. Proteins indicative of systemic classical and alternative complement activation were substantially increased in patients with MOGAD compared to control groups. Elevated levels were detected in both adult and pediatric cases and across all clinical syndromes. Complement inhibition should be explored for its therapeutic merit in patients with MOGAD.

                Although originally implicated in appetite and sleep/wakefulness, the hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system has now been demonstrably linked with motivated behavior. This highly plastic system responds to reward-associated environmental stimuli and becomes pathologically overactive in addicted states. Here, we provide a brief overview of the roles of the orexin system in reward-seeking and addiction, as well as potential therapeutic opportunities for substance use disorders based on normalizing orexin function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability and Stability Challenges in ABCD Task fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Trait stability of measures is an essential requirement for individual differences research. Functional MRI has been increasingly used in studies that rely on the assumption of trait stability, such as attempts to relate task related brain activation to individual differences in behavior and psychopathology. However, recent research using adult samples has questioned the trait stability of task-fMRI measures, as assessed by test-retest correlations. To date, little is known about trait stability of task fMRI in children. Here, we examined within-session reliability and longitudinal stability of task-fMRI using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using its tasks focused on reward processing, response inhibition, and working memory. We also evaluated the effects of factors potentially affecting reliability and stability. Reliability and stability [quantified via an intraclass correlation (ICC) that focuses on rank consistency] was poor in virtually all brain regions, with an average ICC of .078 and .054 for short (within-session) and long-term (between-session) ICCs, respectively, in regions of interest (ROIs) historically-recruited by the tasks. ICC values in ROIs did not exceed the  poor cut-off of .4, and in fact rarely exceeded .2 (only 5.9%). Motion had a pronounced effect on estimated ICCs, with the lowest motion quartile of participants having a mean reliability/stability three times higher (albeit still  poor) than the highest motion quartile. Regions with stronger activation tended to show higher ICCs, with the absolute value of activity and reliability/stability correlating at .53. Across regions, the magnitude of age-related longitudinal (between-session) changes positively correlated with the longitudinal stability of individual differences, which suggests developmental change was not necessarily responsible for poor stability. Poor reliability and stability of task-fMRI, particularly in children, diminishes potential utility of fMRI data due to a drastic reduction of effect sizes and, consequently, statistical power for the detection of brain-behavior associations. This essential issue needs to be addressed through optimization of preprocessing pipelines and data denoising methods.
