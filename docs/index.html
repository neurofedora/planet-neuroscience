<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an autoimmune condition associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive deficits. Changes in the cingulate cortex may be central to this disorder. This study investigates subregional alterations in the cingulate cortex of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and their relationship to cognitive deficits using functional and perfusion imaging. Thirty-eight patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 30 healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state MRI and neuropsychological assessments. We measured low-frequency amplitude (fALFF), degree centrality (DC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cingulate cortex, and performed functional connectivity (FC) and CBF connectivity analyses. We also analyzed the relationship between subregional changes and cognitive impairment. Finally, we applied support vector machines (SVM) to classify patients and controls based on functional and perfusion features. Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis showed significant cognitive impairments in memory and executive function, along with anxiety symptoms. Neuroimaging revealed decreased fALFF, DC, and CBF in the left pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC.L). FC between pgACC.L and several brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus, was reduced. Additionally, pgACC.L exhibited altered CBF connectivity patterns with other brain regions. Moreover, the changes of fALFF, DC, and FC are related to the impaired cognitive function of patients. SVM classification based on fALFF, DC, and CBF features successfully distinguished patients from controls. Our findings suggest that pgACC abnormalities play a key role in the pathomechanism of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and may serve as biomarkers for disease monitoring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18915">Automatic Depression Assessment using Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society. Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012. However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

                arXiv:2506.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm of the local percept-perceiver phenomenon to formalize certain observations in neuroscientific theories of consciousness. Using this model, a set-theoretic formalism is developed for artificial systems, and the existence of machine consciousness is proved by invoking Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The article argues for the possibility of a reductionist form of epistemic consciousness within machines.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19057">How brains build higher order representations of uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order representations (HORs) are neural or computational states that are "about" first-order representations (FORs), encoding information not about the external world per se but about the agent's own representational processes -- such as the reliability, source, or structure of a FOR. These HORs appear critical to metacognition, learning, and even consciousness by some accounts, yet their dimensionality, construction, and neural substrates remain poorly understood. Here, we propose that metacognitive estimates of uncertainty or noise reflect a read-out of "posterior-like" HORs from a Bayesian perspective. We then discuss how these posterior-like HORs reflect a combination of "likelihood-like" estimates of current FOR uncertainty and "prior-like" learned distributions over expected FOR uncertainty, and how various emerging engineering and theory-based analytical approaches may be employed to examine the estimation processes and neural correlates associated with these highly under-explored components of our experienced uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094">Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.

                arXiv:2506.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between lifestyle choices, subjective experiences and objective biometric data in a single individual. The participant, at the time a male in his twenties, used the EliteHRV app to perform Heart Rate Variability Readings across twenty-six months accompanied by logs about the previous days activity as well as current emotional and physical state. The study will use a mixed-methods approach to analyze the data, including quantitative analysis of the biometric data and correlation analysis between the biometric data and subjective experience tags. Qualitative analysis of the daily logs will also be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the participant's experiences and to identify keywords, people, or ideas that affect biometric output. The results of this study will provide insights into the relationship between subjective and objective measures, and the potential benefits or drawbacks of certain lifestyle choices and ways of thinking. The findings could have implications for the development of wearable-based personalized interventions for improving mental health and well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19266">Convergent and divergent connectivity patterns of the arcuate fasciculus in macaques and humans</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing - using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum, and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19314">Increasing Efficiency of the Chain of Contagion Task</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chain of contagion task (CCT) is a pychological test to measure the amount of contagious beliefs in individuals. Contagious beliefs thereby refer to the perception that certain objects, people, or substances can transmit contamination through mere contact or proximity (Rozin et al., 1986). In the CCT, a neutral object (usually a pen) is rubbed against an inherently disgusting object (e.g. a toilet paper with feces) and participants are asked how contaminated this pen is on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very contaminated). Afterwards, this pen is rubbed against another pen, and again, the experienced degree of contamination is assessed. This is repeated 12 times. The CCT has first been experimentally investigated by Tolin et al. (2004) in an in vivo procedure with real disgusting objects. The authors could show that contagious beliefs measured with the CCT show a strong bias for people with contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (C-OCD) compared to anxious individuals and non-anxious controls. Fink-Lamotte et al. (2024) replicated these findings with an online version of the CCT using audio-imagery-based and video-based stimuli and instructions. Both studies used 12 pens to assess the degree of contagious beliefs. Within this brief report, we show that after 8 pens, hardly any additional variance is explained between participants and after the tenth pen, no new information is gained. Thus, we recommend only using 8 pens instead of 12 when using the CCT to assess contagious beliefs.

                arXiv:2506.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human visual system provides us with a rich and meaningful percept of the world, transforming retinal signals into visuo-semantic representations. For a model of these representations, here we leveraged a combination of two currently dominating approaches: vision deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Using large-scale human electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during object image viewing, we built encoding models to predict EEG responses using representations from a vision DNN, an LLM, and their fusion. We show that the fusion encoding model outperforms encoding models based on either the vision DNN or the LLM alone, as well as previous modelling approaches, in predicting neural responses to visual stimulation. The vision DNN and the LLM complemented each other in explaining stimulus-related signal in the EEG responses. The vision DNN uniquely captured earlier and broadband EEG signals, whereas the LLM uniquely captured later and low frequency signals, as well as detailed visuo-semantic stimulus information. Together, this provides a more accurate model of the time course of visuo-semantic processing in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19800">Modeling the influences of non-local connectomic projections on geometrically constrained cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The function and dynamics of the cortex are fundamentally shaped by the specific wiring configurations of its constituent axonal fibers, also known as the connectome. However, many dynamical properties of macroscale cortical activity are well captured by instead describing the activity as propagating waves across the cortical surface, constrained only by the surface's two-dimensional geometry. It thus remains an open question why the local geometry of the cortex can successfully capture macroscale cortical dynamics, despite neglecting the specificity of Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections (FNPs) which are known to mediate the rapid and non-local propagation of activity between remote neural populations. Here we address this question by developing a novel mathematical model of macroscale cortical activity in which cortical populations interact both by a continuous sheet and by an additional set of FNPs wired independently of the sheet's geometry. By simulating the model across a range of connectome topologies, external inputs, and timescales, we demonstrate that the addition of FNPs strongly shape the model dynamics of rapid, stimulus-evoked responses on fine millisecond timescales ($\lessapprox 30~\text{ms}$), but contribute relatively little to slower, spontaneous fluctuations over longer timescales ($> 30~\text{ms}$), which increasingly resemble geometrically constrained dynamics without FNPs. Our results suggest that the discrepant views regarding the relative contributions of local (geometric) and non-local (connectomic) cortico-cortical interactions are context-dependent: While FNPs specified by the connectome are needed to capture rapid communication between specific distant populations (as per the rapid processing of sensory inputs), they play a relatively minor role in shaping slower spontaneous fluctuations (as per resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging).

                arXiv:2506.05794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics (including the minimization of variational and expected free energy) naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.

                arXiv:2410.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce BrainSAIL, a method for linking neural selectivity with spatially distributed semantic visual concepts in natural scenes. BrainSAIL leverages recent advances in large-scale artificial neural networks, using them to provide insights into the functional topology of the brain. To overcome the challenge presented by the co-occurrence of multiple categories in natural images, BrainSAIL exploits semantically consistent, dense spatial features from pre-trained vision models, building upon their demonstrated ability to robustly predict neural activity. This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings without requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising process that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random augmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual features and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we enable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex. This provides a powerful tool for dissecting the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic visual processing for natural images. We validate BrainSAIL on cortical regions with known category selectivity, demonstrating its ability to accurately localize and disentangle selectivity to diverse visual concepts. Next, we demonstrate BrainSAIL's ability to characterize high-level visual selectivity to scene properties and low-level visual features such as depth, luminance, and saturation, providing insights into the encoding of complex visual information. Finally, we use BrainSAIL to directly compare the feature selectivity of different brain encoding models across different regions of interest in visual cortex. Our innovative method paves the way for significant advances in mapping and decomposing high-level visual representations in the human brain.

                arXiv:2506.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/ZBX05/Temporal-Regularization-Training.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes, learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

                arXiv:2506.19037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores. Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10 oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

Abstract: This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO), addressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world MV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables, requiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently, stochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in mixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot handle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose CatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that jointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is developed by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a mixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer handling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and following the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer problems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence performance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM effectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply incorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.

                <p>Early life stress (ELS) increases susceptibility to cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction by disrupting the neurobiological systems that regulate these behaviors. Animal models provide a valuable tool for investigating the underlying mechanisms, enabling precise manipulation of stress exposure during development. The limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model, which induces maternal stress by restricting access to bedding and nesting materials in rodents, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of chronic ELS. While this paradigm has been widely adopted, variations in apparatus designs and subtle differences in methodologies could impact consistency across studies. Here, we provide standardized guidelines for a cost-effective open&ndash;source mouse LBN apparatus design, which could further enhance the model's utility while supporting pup survival. We additionally present our findings observed during the duration of the LBN paradigm, which spans from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 10, for both dams and pups. We observe comparable corticosterone in control and LBN dams from PND 3 to 5. However, from PND 6 to 10, corticosterone remains elevated in LBN dams, while control dams show a decline. Notably, the LBN paradigm disrupts maternal care, as LBN dams exhibit more frequent nest exits and stereotypic behaviors during the dark phase. At PND 10, pups exhibit significantly reduced blood serum corticosterone levels and lower body weight compared with those reared under control conditions. By providing open-source equipment and detailed experimental protocols, our work aims to build on existing LBN paradigms to further enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of chronic ELS models.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/6/ENEURO.0132-24.2025?rss=1">Neural Speech Tracking during Selective Attention: A Spatially Realistic Audiovisual Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paying attention to a target talker in multitalker scenarios is associated with its more accurate neural tracking relative to competing non-target speech. This "neural bias" to target speech has largely been demonstrated in experimental setups where target and non-target speech are acoustically controlled and interchangeable. However, in real-life situations this is rarely the case. For example, listeners often look at the talker they are paying attention to while non-target speech is heard (but not seen) from peripheral locations. To enhance the ecological-relevance of attention research, here we studied whether neural bias toward target speech is observed in a spatially realistic audiovisual context and how this is affected by switching the identity of the target talker. Group-level results show robust neural bias toward target speech, an effect that persisted and generalized after switching the identity of the target talker. In line with previous studies, this supports the utility of the speech-tracking approach for studying speech processing and attention in spatially realistic settings. However, a more nuanced picture emerges when inspecting data of individual participants. Although reliable neural speech tracking could be established in most participants, this was not correlated with neural bias or with behavioral performance, and &gt;50% of participants showed similarly robust neural tracking of both target and non-target speech. These results indicate that neural bias toward the target is not a ubiquitous, or necessary, marker of selective attention (at least as measured from scalp-EEG), and suggest that individuals diverge in their internal prioritization among concurrent speech, perhaps reflecting different listening strategies or capabilities under realistic conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1037/v2?src=rss">Resilience in the Face of Uncertainty: Navigating Supply Chain Challenges Through Proactive Risk Surveillance and Mitigation Strategies among SMEs in ASEAN countries [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Supply chain risk management is crucial for the consumer products industry, given its susceptibility to uncertainties and risks. This research investigates the relationship between supply chain risks and performance within this sector, based on a sample of 385 entrepreneurs from Small Medium Sized enterprises (SMEs) in the consumer goods industry across ASEAN countries. Supply chain performance, defined as the ability to meet end-customer demands, involves ensuring commodity availability, on-time deliveries, and maintaining sufficient inventory and capacity across organizational boundaries, from raw materials to the final consumer. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the study establishes a strong correlation between supply chain performance and risks, highlighting the necessity for effective supply chain risk management to enhance overall performance in the consumer products industry. Understanding the diverse economic development, infrastructure, and regulatory environments across ASEAN nations is crucial. Leveraging the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) for economic integration and regional trade agreements can mitigate supply chain risks and improve performance. Entrepreneurs in the consumer products industry are encouraged to collaborate with governmental organizations, considering the challenges posed by regulatory landscapes, cross-border logistics, and geopolitical risks within ASEAN. Adapting strategies to the specific characteristics of each ASEAN country, optimizing logistics, and addressing cultural nuances are essential for successful supply chain risk management. By aligning with regional and national governments, businesses can proactively address risks, seize opportunities, and contribute to the resilience and growth of the ASEAN consumer products industry.

                <p>by Christian Leibold, Sebastian Groß</p>

The inferior colliculus (IC) is a central hub in the ascending auditory brainstem. It hosts many neurons tuned to interaural time differences (ITDs). ITD tuning, however, is already observed and generated one synapse upstream in the superior olivary complex and the physiological mechanisms as well as the functional purpose of the IC projection remain partially unresolved. Here, we argue that combining ITD sensitive inputs from medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO) requires a temporally well adjusted delay of cross-hemispheric fibers from LSO to IC, given the fast synaptic kinetics of IC neurons. We present a normative model of the midbrain auditory circuitry that finds an optimal cross-hemispheric delay of 0.3 cycles and optimal synaptic strengths by maximizing the firing rate of IC neurons for a stimulus at a given ITD. The model suggests that, by varying the relative synaptic weight of MSO and LSO input, individual neurons are optimized to transmit information of all sound sources in a complex auditory scene. ITD tuning of IC neurons would then results as a side effect. The model focuses on the low-frequency range, is consistent with the distribution of best ITDs observed in experimental recordings and performs close to optimal in sound source reconstruction.

                <p>by Alexander P. Browning, Rebecca M. Crossley, Chiara Villa, Philip K. Maini, Adrianne L. Jenner, Tyler Cassidy, Sara Hamis</p>

Phenotypic plasticity contributes significantly to treatment failure in many cancers. Despite the increased prevalence of experimental studies that interrogate this phenomenon, there remains a lack of applicable quantitative tools to characterise data, and importantly to distinguish between resistance as a discrete phenotype and a continuous distribution of phenotypes. To address this, we develop a stochastic individual-based model of plastic phenotype adaptation through a continuously-structured phenotype space in low-cell-count proliferation assays. That our model corresponds probabilistically to common partial differential equation models of resistance allows us to formulate a likelihood that captures the intrinsic noise ubiquitous to such experiments. We apply our framework to assess the identifiability of key model parameters in several population-level data collection regimes; in particular, parameters relating to the adaptation velocity and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Significantly, we find that cell-to-cell heterogeneity is practically non-identifiable from both cell count and proliferation marker data, implying that population-level behaviours may be well characterised by homogeneous ordinary differential equation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that population-level data are insufficient to distinguish resistance as a discrete phenotype from a continuous distribution of phenotypes. Our results inform the design of both future experiments and future quantitative analyses that probe phenotypic plasticity in cancer.

                <p>by Lilach Schneor, Dafna Tussia-Cohen, Evgeny Fraimovitch, Sivan Friedman, Tzachi Hagai</p>

Hundreds of genes are upregulated in response to pathogen infection. These genes’ sequences often diverge across mammals, to counteract rapid pathogen evolution. However, the transcriptional divergence of these genes, their relative levels before and after infection in different host species, remains poorly understood. We studied this divergence by comparing gene expression before and after viral stimulation in cells from primates and rodents. We developed a method to identify orthologs strongly upregulated in one species that are unchanged in response to stimulus in another species. Using human and mouse data, we detected 578 transcriptionally divergent orthologous genes. For example, genes related to the NFκB complex are only upregulated in mouse. While most divergent genes do not belong to the same cellular process, several pathways and protein complexes are enriched in this set, suggesting that divergence in immune responses between closely related mammals is limited to specific modules rather than involving entire pathways. Transcriptional divergence between human and mouse orthologs was also observed when ortholog expression from different primates and rodents were compared, when responses were studied in several other cell types, and was recapitulated at the chromatin level, using histone mark patterns that denote active promoter regions. Surprisingly, these transcriptional changes were associated with evolutionary changes in coding sequences only when the genes are lowly expressed. In summary, we found genes whose orthologs diverge between primates and rodents in response to immune stimulation. Some of these genes are constitutively expressed in one species even before infection, potentially facilitating rapid antiviral activity that may be linked to clade-specific adaptation to confer greater resistance against pathogens. Further studies are required to test which of these transcriptional changes are adaptive, and what are their functional consequences. Moreover, comparative studies on diverse infections can point to additional species-specific responses and how they enable different species to overcome infection.

                <p>by Valerie J. Rodriguez-Irizarry, Robert W. Maples, Julie K. Pfeiffer</p>

Viruses encounter a range of selective pressures, but inefficiencies during replication can be masked. To uncover factors that limit viral replication, we used forward genetics to enrich for a murine norovirus (MNV) mutant with faster replication. We sequentially harvested the earliest progeny in cultured cells and identified a single amino acid change in the viral NS3 protein, K40R, that was sufficient to enhance replication speed. We found that the NS3-K40R virus induced earlier cell death and viral egress compared with wild-type virus. Mechanistically, NS3-K40R protein disrupted membranes more efficiently than wild-type NS3 protein, potentially contributing to increased mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Immunodeficient mice infected with NS3-K40R virus had increased titers, suggesting that increasing egress did not reduce fitness in vivo. Overall, by using a forward genetic approach, we identified a previously unknown inefficiency in norovirus egress and provide new insights into selective pressures that influence viral replication and evolution.

                <p>by Nick Peoples, Michalis Mihalitsis, Peter C. Wainwright</p>

Innovations often shape the trajectory of macroevolution, yet their effects are usually considered independently, thus ignoring the functional and evolutionary interactions between them. Two innovations that have underpinned the ecological and evolutionary success of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) are large teeth and highly protrusible jaws, which independently expanded the diversity of prey capture strategies. Here, we explore the functional relationship between these innovations across actinopterygians using high-speed videography and phylogenetic comparative methods. We find that these two innovations are functionally and evolutionarily incompatible because there is an overarching tradeoff between jaw protrusion and tooth size. Having large teeth decreases the kinematic diversity of prey capture by restricting species to overtake prey predominantly by swimming, while highly protrusible jaws are only found in species with small teeth. The space within tooth-bearing bones may impose this constraint, by limiting the maximum tooth size of species with gracile jaws adapted for high mobility and jaw protrusion. Nevertheless, some species break this constraint on tooth size through novel adaptations that accommodate exceptionally large teeth, unlocking new feeding modes which may have expanded the nature of aquatic feeding and influenced the ecosystems themselves. Although both high jaw protrusion and large teeth separately expanded prey capture strategies in fishes, they are generally not found in combination and are evolutionarily incompatible.

Mutations in the mitochondrial genome can cause maternally inherited diseases, cancer, and aging-related conditions. Recent technological progress now enables the creation and correction of mutations in the mitochondrial genome, but it remains relatively unknown how patients with primary mitochondrial disease can benefit from this technology. Here, we demonstrate the potential of the double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE) to develop disease models and therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disease in primary human cells. Introduction of the m.15150G > A mutation in liver organoids resulted in organoid lines with varying degrees of heteroplasmy and correspondingly reduced ATP production, providing a unique model to study functional consequences of different levels of heteroplasmy of this mutation. Correction of the m.4291T > C mutation in patient-derived fibroblasts restored mitochondrial membrane potential. DdCBE generated sustainable edits with high specificity and product purity. To prepare for clinical application, we found that mRNA-mediated mitochondrial base editing resulted in increased efficiency and cellular viability compared to DNA-mediated editing. Moreover, we showed efficient delivery of the mRNA mitochondrial base editors using lipid nanoparticles, which is currently the most advanced non-viral in vivo delivery system for gene products. Our study thus demonstrates the potential of mitochondrial base editing to not only generate unique <i>in vitro</i> models to study these diseases, but also to functionally correct mitochondrial mutations in patient-derived cells for future therapeutic purposes.

Ovulation is a spatiotemporally coordinated process that involves several tightly controlled events, including oocyte meiotic maturation, cumulus expansion, follicle wall rupture and repair, and ovarian stroma remodeling. To date, no studies have detailed the precise window of ovulation at single-cell resolution. Here, we performed parallel single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics on paired mouse ovaries across an ovulation time course to map the spatiotemporal profile of ovarian cell types. We show that major ovarian cell types exhibit time-dependent transcriptional states enriched for distinct functions and have specific localization profiles within the ovary. We also identified gene markers for ovulation-dependent cell states and validated these using orthogonal methods. Finally, we performed cell–cell interaction analyses to identify ligand-receptor pairs that may drive ovulation, revealing previously unappreciated interactions. Taken together, our data provides a rich and comprehensive resource of murine ovulation that can be mined for discovery by the scientific community.

                <p>by Robert J. Brocklehurst, Magdalen Mercado, Kenneth D. Angielczyk, Stephanie E. Pierce</p>

The ‘sprawling-parasagittal’ postural transition is a key part of mammalian evolution, associated with sweeping reorganization of the postcranial skeleton in mammals compared to their forebears, the non-mammalian synapsids. However, disputes over forelimb function in fossil synapsids render the precise nature of the ‘sprawling-parasagittal’ transition controversial. We shed new light on the origins of mammalian posture, using evolutionary adaptive landscapes to integrate 3D humerus shape and functional performance data across a taxonomically comprehensive sample of fossil synapsids and extant comparators. We find that the earliest pelycosaur-grade synapsids had a unique mode of sprawling, intermediate between extant reptiles and monotremes. Subsequent evolution of synapsid humerus form and functional traits showed little evidence of a direct progression from sprawling pelycosaurs to parasagittal mammals. Instead, posture was evolutionarily labile, and the ecological diversification of successive synapsid radiations was accompanied by variation in humerus morphofunctional traits. Further, synapsids frequently evolve toward parasagittal postures, diverging from the reconstructed optimal evolutionary path; the optimal path only aligns with becoming increasingly mammalian in derived cynodonts. We find the earliest support for habitual parasagittal postures in stem therians, implying that synapsids evolved and radiated with distinct forelimb trait combinations for most of their recorded history.

                Abstract Industrialization and the overuse of natural resources have led to severe environmental degradation. Social and economic inequalities have widened, especially during the global pandemic, which intensified existing disparities. These conditions have prompted global leaders to seek solutions, as climate change and environmental damage directly affect both human and planetary health. They also limit the ability of vulnerable populations to exercise their right to food sovereignty. This article aims to identify perspectives on food sovereignty in the context of climate change through a bibliometric analysis. The findings show that research in this field is growing, with the United States playing a key role. The study concludes that developed countries are focused on tackling the effects of climate change on food sovereignty. It also finds a correlation between regional CO₂ emissions and malnutrition, suggesting a link between environmental harm and food insecurity.

                The Raman effect originates from spontaneous inelastic scattering of photons by matter. These photons provide a characteristic fingerprint of this matter, and are extensively utilized for chemical and biological sensing. However, the phenomenon do not hold potential for its direct use in sensing applications, since the generation of the Raman scattered photons is inherently low. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) overcomes the low sensitivity associated with Raman spectroscopy and assists the sensing of diverse analytes, including ions, small molecules, inorganics, organics, radionucleotides, and cells. Plasmonic nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and when they are closely spaced, they create hotspots where the electromagnetic field is significantly enhanced. This amplifies the Raman signal and may offer up to a 1014-fold SERS signal enhancement. The development of SERS active substrates requires further consideration and optimization of several critical features such as surface periodicity, hotspot density, mitigation of sample or surface autofluorescence, tuning of surface hydrophilicities, use of specific (bio) recognition elements with suitable linkers and bioconjugation chemistries, and use of appropriate optics to obtain relevant sensing outcomes in terms of sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, limit of detection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stability, shelf-life, and disposability. This article comprehensively reviews the recent advancements on the use of disposable materials such as commercial grades of paper, textiles, glasses, polymers, and some specific substrates such as blue-ray digital versatile discs (DVDs) for use as SERS-active substrates for point-of-use (POU) sensing applications. The advancements in these technologies have been reviewed and critiqued for analyte detection in resource-limited settings, highlighting the prospects of applications ranging from single-molecule to single-cell detection. We conclude by highlighting the prospects and possible avenues for developing viable field deployable sensors holding immense potential in environmental monitoring, food safety and biomedical diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-439/v4?src=rss">Paying reviewers and regulating the number of papers may help fix the peer-review process [version 4; peer review: 4 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating scientific peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. This paper also reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy and unsustainable culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dentatorubral–pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of cytosine–adenine–guanine repeats in <i>ATN1</i>. Most studies on DRPLA to date are limited to case reports. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical, genetic, biological, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of DRPLA using cross-sectional baseline data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a cross-sectional observational cohort study. We used an extensive battery of assessments, included clinical phenotypes, genotypes, cognitive performance, biological markers, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We enrolled 116 DRPLA patients, including 96 manifest patients and 20 prodromal patients. We identified a previously unreported <i>ATN1</i> haplotype consisting of 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Cognitive assessments revealed that 51 manifest patients (96%) and 4 prodromal patients (29%) scored &lt;26 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Manifest patients showed impairments across all cognitive domains, whereas prodromal patients showed deficits only in phonemic fluency. Biological analyses showed significantly elevated plasma neurofilament light levels in manifest patients compared with prodromal patients (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and healthy controls (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed widespread gray matter loss across the whole brain in manifest patients, whereas prodromal patients showed gray matter loss localized to the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first DRPLA cohort study to comprehensively report clinical, genetic, cognitive, imaging, and plasma neurofilament light data. This study provides robust data to enhance our understanding of the overall features of DRPLA. We also propose clear definitions for the preclinical stage of DRPLA, and demonstrate the high diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light as a biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spinal cord (SC) atrophy correlates with and predicts the underlying progressive biology in active and non-active multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby providing a biomarker for clinical trials and patient management. Initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) may be followed by early pronounced central nervous system (CNS) volume loss due to resolution of inflammation (pseudoatrophy) and confounding the interpretation of atrophy. High-dose glucocorticoids (HDGs) reduce inflammation and might therefore modify pseudoatrophy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred twenty-three newly diagnosed and DMT-naïve MS participants (relapsing–remitting, 70% female participants, median age = 36 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 2.0) were followed for up to 3 years. Forty-two participants received HDG before baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; DMT-HDG; median = 52 days, interquartile range [IQR] = 37–71), whereas 60 did not (DMT/no-HDG). Twenty-one participants remained untreated (no-DMT), and 102 started DMT after baseline MRI. SC total cervical cord cross-sectional area (TCA), gray matter area (GMA), and white matter area (WMA) and regional brain volumes were analyzed using mixed effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The DMT-HDG, DMT/no-HDG, and no-DMT groups had similar demographic, clinical, and radiological features. Pronounced SC pseudoatrophy was observed based on more year 1 versus year 2 volume loss for DMT/no-HDG (−2.06% vs. 0.83%; <i>P</i> = 0.02) but not DMT-HDG (−0.51% vs. 0.66%; <i>P</i> = 0.8) and more year 1 volume loss for DMT/no-HDG compared to DMT-HDG (−2.06% vs. 0.51%; <i>P</i> = 0.02).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HDG preceding baseline MRI suppresses CNS white matter (WM) pseudoatrophy after DMT initiation, most conspicuously for the SC. Suppression of pseudoatrophy with HDG may improve the fidelity of clinical trials and enhance the feasibility for short-term trials with SC and brain MRI outcomes in active MS by pretreatment with HDG.

<p>While BDNF and lactate concentrations are responsive to a submaximal graded exercise test in a healthy population, lactate cannot be used as an alternative to BDNF and subsequently may not be an indication of BDNF-associated neuroplasticity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between BDNF and lactate concentration, accounting for genotype and sex, before and after a submaximal graded exercise test in 31 adults (37.5 ± 14.0 years, 54.8% female). The presence of the Val66Met polymorphism was identified at baseline, and BDNF and lactate concentrations were measured before and after exercise. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between BDNF and lactate concentration at pre- and post-exercise, and change in concentration (post- minus pre-exercise). The Val66Met polymorphism was identified in 11 participants (35%, seven females). An increase in BDNF and lactate concentration was observed from pre- to post-exercise (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but no significant correlation between the two measures was observed at pre-exercise (<i>r</i> = −0.256, <i>p</i> = 0.164), post-exercise (<i>r</i> = 0.112, <i>p</i> = 0.549), and change in concentration (<i>r</i> = 0.019, <i>p</i> = 0.921). A moderate inverse correlation was observed in participants with the Val66Met polymorphism (<i>r</i> = −0.744, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and males (<i>r</i> = −0.695, <i>p</i> = 0.006) at pre-exercise. The results show that while BDNF and lactate concentrations increased following a submaximal graded exercise test, there is little evidence to suggest a relationship exists between BDNF and lactate.</p>

                Grande et al. found HCMV infection reorganizes cellular m6A modification factors into distinctive DIVA nuclear bodies (NBs). As sites where virus genomes and RNA accumulate, DIVA NBs require transcription, METTL3 activity, and YTHDC1 m6A recognition to maintain integrity. Thus, consolidating m6A modification factors with infecting genomes promotes HCMV gene expression and replication.

                Nutrient and growth factor depletion induces cellular quiescence, which is traditionally considered a transcriptionally inactive state. Secchia et al. show that starvation instead activates numerous genes and enhancers, including those linked to ECM remodeling. This work suggests that starvation acts as a signal for inducing ECM remodeling in fibroblasts.

Rap1-induced stalling depends on array length and protein density and leads to a local chromatin decompaction during anaphase, revealing how protein arrays can regulate SMC-driven genome organization.

Here, Shen et al. tracked the dynamics of a unique retrotransposon in live ovaries, showing that upon activation, this retrotransposon forms large RNP compartments, which not only protect the transposon products but also obstruct host transportation, consequently resulting in prolonged oogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101531">The triad interaction of ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200 is required for ULK complex formation and autophagy</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, autophagosome formation, a central event in autophagy, is initiated by the ULK complex comprising ULK1/2, FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101. However, the structural basis and mechanism underlying the ULK complex assembly have yet to be fully clarified. Here, we predicted the core interactions organizing the ULK complex using AlphaFold, which proposed that the intrinsically disordered region of ATG13 engages the bases of the two UBL domains in the FIP200 dimer via two phenylalanines and also binds the tandem microtubule-interacting and transport domain of ULK1, thereby yielding the 1:1:2 stoichiometry of the ULK1–ATG13–FIP200 complex. We validated the predicted interactions by point mutations and demonstrated direct triad interactions among ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200 in vitro and in cells, wherein each interaction was additively important for autophagic flux. These results indicate that the ULK1–ATG13–FIP200 triadic interaction is crucial for autophagosome formation and provides a structural basis and insights into the regulation mechanism of autophagy initiation in mammals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99848">CellSeg3D, Self-supervised 3D cell segmentation for fluorescence microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the complex three-dimensional structure of cells is crucial across many disciplines in biology and especially in neuroscience. Here, we introduce a set of models including a 3D transformer (SwinUNetR) and a novel 3D self-supervised learning method (WNet3D) designed to address the inherent complexity of generating 3D ground truth data and quantifying nuclei in 3D volumes. We developed a Python package called CellSeg3D that provides access to these models in Jupyter Notebooks and in a napari GUI plugin. Recognizing the scarcity of high-quality 3D ground truth data, we created a fully human-annotated mesoSPIM dataset to advance evaluation and benchmarking in the field. To assess model performance, we benchmarked our approach across four diverse datasets: the newly developed mesoSPIM dataset, a 3D platynereis-ISH-Nuclei confocal dataset, a separate 3D Platynereis-Nuclei light-sheet dataset, and a challenging and densely packed Mouse-Skull-Nuclei confocal dataset. We demonstrate that our self-supervised model, WNet3D – trained without any ground truth labels – achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, paving the way for broader applications in label-scarce biological contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104894">TRPV4 activation by TGFβ2 enhances cellular contractility and drives ocular hypertension</a></h4>

              
                The risk for developing primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) correlates with the magnitude of ocular hypertension (OHT) and the concentration of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) in the aqueous humor. Effective treatment of POAG requires a detailed understanding of the interaction between pressure sensing mechanisms in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and biochemical risk factors. Here, we employed molecular, optical, electrophysiological, and tonometric strategies to establish the role of TGFβ2 in transcription and functional expression of mechanosensitive channel isoforms alongside studies of TM contractility in biomimetic hydrogels and intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation in a mouse model of TGFβ2-induced OHT. TGFβ2 upregulated expression of <i>Trpv4</i> and <i>Piezo1</i> transcripts and time-dependently augmented functional TRPV4 activation. TRPV4 agonists induced contractility of TM-seeded hydrogels, whereas pharmacological inhibition suppressed TGFβ2-induced hypercontractility and abrogated OHT in eyes overexpressing TGFβ2. <i>Trpv4</i>-deficient mice resisted TGFβ2-driven increases in IOP, but nocturnal OHT was not additive to TGFβ-evoked OHT. Our study establishes the fundamental role of TGFβ as a modulator of mechanosensing in nonexcitable cells, identifies the TRPV4 channel as the final common mechanism for TM contractility and circadian and pathological OHT, and offers insights for future treatments that can lower IOP in the sizeable cohort of hypertensive glaucoma patients that resist current treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102184">Striatal cholinergic interneuron pause response requires Kv1 channels, is absent in dyskinetic mice, and is restored by dopamine D5 receptor inverse agonism</a></h4>

              
                Striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) exhibit pause responses conveying information about rewarding events, but the mechanisms underlying these pauses remain elusive. Thalamic inputs induce a pause mediated by intrinsic mechanisms and regulated by dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), though the underlying membrane currents remain unknown. Moreover, the role of D5 receptors (D5Rs) has not been addressed so far. Here, we performed ex vivo studies showing that glutamate released by thalamic inputs in the dorsolateral striatum induces a burst in SCINs, followed by a pause mediated by the activation of a Kv1-dependent delayed rectifier current. Endogenous dopamine promotes this pause through D2R stimulation, while pharmacological stimulation of D5Rs suppresses it. Remarkably, this pause is absent in parkinsonian mice rendered dyskinetic by chronic L-DOPA treatment but can be reinstated acutely by the inverse D5R agonist clozapine. Blocking the Kv1 current eliminates the pause reinstated by the D5R inverse agonist. In contrast, the D2-type receptor agonists quinpirole and sumanirole failed to reinstate a pause in dyskinetic mice. In conclusion, stimulation of thalamic inputs induces excitation followed by a pause in SCINs, which is lost in parkinsonian mice that have been rendered dyskinetic. This pause is mediated by delayed rectifier Kv1 channels, which are tonically blocked in dyskinetic mice by a mechanism depending on D5R ligand-independent activity. Targeting these alterations may have therapeutic value in Parkinson’s disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101990">Hypothermia protects against ventilator-induced lung injury by limiting IL-1β release and NETs formation</a></h4>

              
                Although mechanical ventilation is a critical intervention for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it can trigger an IL-1β-associated complication known as ventilator-induced lung injury. In mice, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and high-volume ventilation, LPS-HVV, lead to hypoxemia with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the alveoli. Furthermore, <i>Il1r1<sup>-/-</sup></i> LPS-HVV mice did not develop hypoxemia and had reduced NETs, indicating that IL-1R1 signaling is important for NETs formation and hypoxemia. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is known to reduce the release of inflammatory mediators. In LPS-HVV mice, TH (32°C body temperature) prevented hypoxemia development, reducing albumin leakage, IL-1β, gasdermin D (GSDMD), and NETs formation. We also observed that LPS-primed macrophages, when stimulated at 32°C with ATP or nigericin, release less IL-1β associated with reduced GSDMD cleavage. Thus, hypothermia is an important modulating factor in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1β release, and NETs formation, preventing LPS-HVV-induced acute respiratory failure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97098">Distinct neural bases of subcomponents of the attentional blink</a></h4>

              
                The attentional blink reflects a ubiquitous bottleneck with selecting and processing the second of two targets that occur in close temporal proximity. An extensive literature has examined the attention blink as a unitary phenomenon. As a result, which specific component of attention – perceptual sensitivity, choice bias, or both – is compromised during the attentional blink, and their respective neural bases, remains unknown. Here, we address this question with a multialternative task and novel signal detection model, which decouples sensitivity from bias effects. We find that the attentional blink impairs specifically one component of attention – sensitivity – while leaving the other component – bias – unaffected. Distinct neural markers of the attentional blink were mapped onto distinct subcomponents of the sensitivity deficits. Parieto-occipital N2p and P3 potential amplitudes characterized target detection deficits, whereas long-range high-beta band (20–30 Hz) coherence between frontoparietal electrodes signaled target discrimination deficits. We synthesized these results with representational geometry analysis. The analysis revealed that detection and discrimination deficits were encoded along separable neural dimensions, whose configural distances robustly correlated with the neural markers of each. Overall, these findings provide detailed insights into the subcomponents of the attentional blink and reveal dissociable neural bases underlying its detection and discrimination bottlenecks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100192">Sigh generation in preBötzinger complex</a></h4>

              
                We explored neural mechanisms underlying sighing in mice. Photostimulation of parafacial (pF) neuromedin B (NMB) or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), or preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) NMBR or GRPR neurons elicited ectopic sighs with latency inversely related to time from preceding endogenous sigh. Of particular note, ectopic sighs could be produced without involvement of these peptides or their receptors in preBötC. Moreover, chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of preBötC SST neurons induced sighing, even in the presence of NMBR and/or GRPR antagonists. We propose that an increase in the excitability of preBötC NMBR or GRPR neurons not requiring activation of their peptide receptors activates partially overlapping pathways to generate sighs, and that preBötC SST neurons are a downstream element in the sigh generation circuit that converts normal breaths into sighs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99290">Neural dynamics of visual working memory representation during sensory distraction</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have provided evidence for the concurrent encoding of sensory percepts and visual working memory (VWM) contents across visual areas; however, it has remained unclear how these two types of representations are concurrently present. Here, we reanalyzed an open-access fMRI dataset where participants memorized a sensory stimulus while simultaneously being presented with sensory distractors. First, we found that the VWM code in several visual regions did not fully generalize between different time points, suggesting a dynamic code. A more detailed analysis revealed that this was due to shifts in coding spaces across time. Second, we collapsed neural signals across time to assess the degree of interference between VWM contents and sensory distractors, specifically by testing the alignment of their encoding spaces. We find that VWM and feature-matching sensory distractors are encoded in coding spaces that do not fully overlap, but the separation decreases when distractors negatively impact behavioral performance in recalling the target. Together, these results indicate a role of dynamic coding and temporally stable coding spaces in helping multiplex perception and VWM within visual areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104276">Nonequilibrium polysome dynamics promote chromosome segregation and its coupling to cell growth in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Chromosome segregation is essential for cellular proliferation. Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria lack cytoskeleton-based machinery to segregate their chromosomal DNA (nucleoid). The bacterial ParABS system segregates the duplicated chromosomal regions near the origin of replication. However, this function does not explain how bacterial cells partition the rest (bulk) of the chromosomal material. Furthermore, some bacteria, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, lack a ParABS system. Yet, <i>E. coli</i> faithfully segregates nucleoids across various growth rates. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that polysome production during chromosomal gene expression helps compact, split, segregate, and position nucleoids in <i>E. coli</i> through nonequilibrium dynamics that depend on polysome synthesis, degradation (through mRNA decay), and exclusion from the DNA meshwork. These dynamics inherently couple chromosome segregation to biomass growth across nutritional conditions. Halting chromosomal gene expression and thus polysome production immediately stops sister nucleoid migration, while ensuing polysome depletion gradually reverses nucleoid segregation. Redirecting gene expression away from the chromosome and toward plasmids causes ectopic polysome accumulations that are sufficient to drive aberrant nucleoid dynamics. Cell width enlargement experiments suggest that limiting the exchange of polysomes across DNA-free regions ensures nucleoid segregation along the cell length. Our findings suggest a self-organizing mechanism for coupling nucleoid compaction and segregation to cell growth without the apparent requirement of regulatory molecules.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100000">Group identification drives brain integration for collective performance</a></h4>

              
                Group identification may influence collective behaviors and result in variations in collective performance. However, the evidence for this hypothesis and the neural mechanisms involved remain elusive. To this end, we conducted a study using both single-brain activation and multi-brain synchronization analyses to investigate how group identification influences collective problem-solving in a murder mystery case. Our results showed that groups with high levels of identification performed better individually compared to those with low identification, as supported by single-brain activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, high-identification groups also showed enhanced collective performance, supported by within-group neural synchronization in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The DLPFC–OFC connectivity played a crucial role in linking individual and collective performance. Overall, our study provides a two-in-one neural model to explain how group identification affects collective decision-making processes, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of group interactions.

However, despite accumulating evidence that supports a crucial role for these receptor populations in brain physiology and pathology, the implications of astrocyte CB1R signaling in MS initiation and progression remain uncertain. Using complementary in vivo disease models, here we investigated the effects of targeted genetic deletion of astrocytes CB1R on the expression of MS-like pathology in mice. Interestingly, astrocyte-specific deletion of CB1R reduced demyelinating neuropathology, attenuated astrocyte reactivity and improved clinical deficits during the time-course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice with astrocyte CB1R inactivation displayed unaltered oligodendrocyte populations both in EAE lesions and in lysolecithin-induced remyelinating spinal cord lesions, likely excluding that astrocyte CB1R modulate myelin repair processes. Conversely, inactivation of CB1R in astroglial cells restricted humoral and leukocyte parenchymal infiltration and reduced the expression of vascular effectors in EAE lesions. Finally, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function induced by cortical microinjection of VEGF-A was less severe in GFAP-CB1R-KO mice. These results show that astrocyte CB1R signaling constitutes a significant pro-inflammatory mechanism in MS and bring to light a deleterious role for endocannabinoid-mediated modulation of astroglial cells with potential implications in the etiopathology and therapy of neuroinflammatory disorders.

">Repetition-related gamma plasticity in macaque V1 and V2 is highly stimulus specific and robust to stimulus set size</a></h4>

              
                When a visual stimulus is repeated, the cortex has the opportunity to adjust its processing. Indeed, repeated stimuli induce reduced neuronal spike rates and increased neuronal gamma-band synchronization. Previous studies found the repetition-related gamma increase to occur both in human and non-human primates, for artificial and natural stimuli, to persist for minutes and to not transfer between strongly differing stimuli. Here, we further investigated the repetition-related effects using laminar recordings of multi-unit activity and local field potentials from awake macaque areas V1 and V2. We find that the effects on spike rate and gamma occur in all laminar compartments of V1 and V2. We quantify the degree of stimulus specificity with oriented gratings and find that the repetition-related gamma increase does not transfer to gratings differing by merely 10 degrees, the smallest difference tested. Furthermore, we find that the repetition-related effects are robust to stimulus set size, occurring both when one stimulus was repeated and when eighteen different interleaved stimuli were repeated. Finally, we show that alpha-beta activity increases and remains elevated when a stimulus is repeated, and decreases sharply when an unexpected stimulus is presented. These results suggest that repetition-related plasticity leads to changes in spike rates and rhythmic neuronal synchronization in different frequency bands that adjust the cortical processing of repeated stimuli.

">Hierarchical systems in the default mode network when reasoning about self and other mental states</a></h4>

              
                Humans spend time contemplating the minds of others. But this ability is not limited to external agents - we also turn the lens for reading minds inward, reflecting on our own thoughts, emotions, and sense of self. Some processes involved in reasoning about minds may rely on shared mechanisms, while others may be specific to the agent under consideration. We developed a paradigm where participants performed either a mental state inference task or a control task targeting either another person presented onscreen or their own mind. Using fMRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we replicate a well-established self-other axis along the medial wall of prefrontal cortex: ventral regions selectively decoded mental state inference patterns for self, but not other, whereas more dorsal regions decoded mental state inference for both self and other, compared to control conditions. Posterior cingulate cortex, on the other hand, differentiated the target of mental state inference. Using a cross-classification analysis, we also found patterns in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and right temporoparietal junction were sensitive to mental state reasoning in general, regardless of the target agent. These findings highlight one process reflecting reasoning specific to the agent and another reflecting the reasoning process itself.

">Single Cell Proteomics in the Developing Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Proteins are the functional effectors of virtually all biological processes, and accurately measuring their abundance and dynamics is essential for understanding development and disease. Although mRNA levels have historically been used as proxies for protein expression, growing evidence, especially from studies of the human cerebral cortex, has revealed widespread discordance between transcript and protein abundance. To directly address this limitation, we developed a rigorously optimized workflow that combines single-cell mass spectrometry with precise sample preparation to resolve, for the first time, quantitative proteomes of individual cells from the developing human brain. Our platform achieved deep proteomic coverage (~800 proteins per cell) even in immature prenatal human neurons (5-10um diameter, ~100pg of protein per cell), capturing major brain cell types and enabling proteome-wide characterization at single-cell resolution. This approach revealed extensive transcriptome-proteome discordance across cell types, with particularly strong discrepancies in genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, a finding validated through orthogonal experiments. Proteins exhibited markedly higher cell-type specificity than their mRNA counterparts, underscoring the importance of proteomic-level analysis for resolving cellular identity and function. By reconstructing developmental trajectories from radial glia to excitatory neurons at the proteomic level, we identified dynamic stage-specific protein co-expression modules and pinpointed the intermediate progenitor-to-neuron transition as a molecularly vulnerable phase linked to autism. Altogether, by enabling single cell proteomics, this study establishes a foundational resource and technological advance for developmental neuroscience. It demonstrates that single-cell proteomics can capture critical developmental events and disease mechanisms that are undetectable at the transcript level. As this technology continues to improve in sensitivity and scalability, single-cell proteomics will become an indispensable tool for uncovering the molecular logic of brain development and for illuminating pathophysiological processes underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Spatially and non-spatially tuned hippocampal neurons are linear perceptual and nonlinear memory encoders</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus has long been regarded as a neural map of physical space, with its neurons categorized as spatially or non-spatially tuned according to their response selectivity. However, growing evidence suggests that this dichotomy oversimplifies the complex roles hippocampal neurons play in integrating spatial and non-spatial information. Through computational modeling and in-vivo electrophysiology in macaques, we show that neurons classified as spatially tuned primarily encode linear combinations of immediate behaviorally relevant factors, while those labeled as non-spatially tuned rely on nonlinear mechanisms to integrate temporally distant experiences. Furthermore, our findings reveal a temporal gradient in the primate CA3 region, where spatial selectivity diminishes as neurons encode increasingly distant past events. Finally, using artificial neural networks, we demonstrate that nonlinear recurrent connections are crucial for capturing the response dynamics of non-spatially tuned neurons, particularly those encoding memory-related information. These findings challenge the traditional dichotomy of spatial versus non-spatial representations and instead suggest a continuum of linear and nonlinear computations that underpin hippocampal function. This framework provides new insights into how the hippocampus bridges perception and memory, informing on its role in episodic memory, spatial navigation, and associative learning.

">Maternal singing synchronizes the preterm infants' brain</a></h4>

              
                Singing to infants is a universal human practice that has beneficial effects on infant's cognitive and affective development. Children born preterm have impaired brain development, and their perception of maternal speech is known to be affected by the atypical hospital auditory environment. Understanding how preterm infants perceive maternal singing is of critical importance, yet it remains largely unexplored. Using high-density EEG, we examined neural responses to the same melody presented through maternal singing, stranger singing, and instrument, and compared the responses in 12 preterm infants. Moreover, to examine their processing of spatialisation, auditory stimuli were presented under monaural and binaural conditions. Preterm newborns are able to discriminate the same melody when sung by their mother, a stranger, or played by an instrument. When presented monaurally, the mother's singing voice enhances widespread brain synchrony across the entire scalp. In contrast, this synchrony diminishes with binaural spatialization. These findings suggest that maternal singing constitutes a highly salient auditory stimulus for preterm newborns, eliciting a distinct neural signature. Given that brain synchrony is a critical component of healthy brain function and development, harnessing maternal singing may offer a promising, natural intervention to support neurodevelopment-particularly in vulnerable populations such as preterm infants.

">Gradual sensory maturation promotes abstract representation learning</a></h4>

              
                Human infants begin life with limited visual capacities, such as low acuity and poor color sensitivity, due to gradual sensory maturation. In contrast, machine learning models are trained on high-fidelity inputs from the outset, often leading to shortcut learning and overfitting to spurious correlations. Here, we show that early sensory immaturity plays a critical role in shaping bias-resistant, abstract visual representations that conventional models struggle to develop. Using neural network simulations and human psychophysics experiments, we demonstrate that gradual sensory development supports the emergence of robust and generalizable internal representations, reduces reliance on superficial cues, and promotes disentangled representations that enable compositional reconstruction and visual imagination. Comparative analyses of human and model behavior reveal shared patterns of bias resistance and adaptive generalization, including resilience to misleading information. Our findings suggest that gradual sensory maturation is not merely a developmental constraint, but rather a key mechanism that enables abstract representation learning.

">Comparative Analysis of Neonatal Hypomyelination Models Using Spatial Transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                White matter injury (WMI) is a major cause of morbidity in premature infants, contributing to 5% to 10% of cerebral palsy cases and up to 50% of cognitive and behavioral deficits in the United States. Two commonly used preclinical models, intermittent hypoxia (IH) and hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are widely employed to investigate the effects of WMI. The internal capsule (IC) and corpus callosum (CC) are major white matter tracts undergoing active myelination during the neonatal period, making them particularly vulnerable to hypoxic insults. This study aims to compare the effects of IH and HI models on myelination as well as the involvement of inflammatory cells in the IC and CC. We evaluated five oligodendrocyte (OL) subtypes, along with astrocytes, microglia, and activated microglia in IC and CC at postnatal day 12 (P12) and day 20 (P20) using spatial transcriptomics (CosMx, Novogene). For the HI model, C57BL/6 mice at P10 underwent permanent ligation of the left carotid artery followed by 45 minutes of hypoxia (8% O2 / 92% N2). For the IH model, P3 mice were exposed to 5% O2 / 95% N2, twice daily for five consecutive days. Animals were euthanized at P12 and P20, perfused transcardially, and brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in an ethanol series, embedded in paraffin, and coronally sectioned at 7 m. Slides were submitted for CosMx spatial transcriptomic analysis (NanoString Technologies), and data analysis was performed using the Seurat package in RStudio. Our results demonstrate that IH and HI models affect OL populations differently, and these effects vary by brain region. In the IC, the IH model caused earlier and more pronounced changes in OL differentiation-related gene expression compared to HI. In contrast, the CC was more affected by HI. Moreover, in the HI group, mature OL s in both regions showed reduced expression of myelination-associated genes. This was accompanied by greater activation of inflammatory cells and increased intercellular communication between these cells and mature OLs, potentially contributing to the observed hypomyelination. Overall, our study provides critical insights into how each model of neonatal hypoxia differentially impacts white matter development. This knowledge can help refine preclinical strategies and guide therapeutic research tailored to the underlying pathology of each model.

">Stimulus effects dwarf task effects in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Task context affects stimulus representations in human visual cortex, suggesting that visual representations are flexible. However, this interpretation is at odds with a major computational goal of the human visual system: creating a perceptually stable representation of the external visual environment. How does the visual system balance stability and flexibility? Here, human participants (71 percent females) categorized object images and written words according to different task rules, while brain responses were measured with fMRI. Using an ANOVA-based modeling strategy, we precisely quantified the relative contributions of stimulus, task, and their interaction in explaining representational variance across the cortical hierarchy. Our results show that stimulus effects account for the overwhelming majority of explainable representational variance across the ventral visual system: > 95 percent in V1 and V2, and > 90 percent in higher-level visual cortex. In prefrontal cortex, the relative contributions reverse: task effects dominate stimulus effects, accounting for 80 percent of explainable representational variance. In parietal cortex, contributions of stimulus and task are approximately equal. Our findings suggest that population coding in sensory cortex is optimized for representational stability to allow a consistent interpretation of the external environment. Population coding in parietal and frontal multiple-demand cortex, by contrast, is optimized for representational flexibility to accommodate changing behavioral goals and support flexible cognition and action.

">The cost of cognition: Measuring the energy consumption of non-equilibrium computation</a></h4>

              
                In biological systems, survival is predicated on an animal being able to perform computations quickly on a minimal energy budget. What is the energy consumption of non-equilibrium brain computation, i.e., what is the cost of cognition? Previous literature has estimated the metabolic cost using neuroimaging measures of glucose consumption but complementary to these findings, here we directly estimate the computational costs by combining the new field of stochastic thermodynamics with whole-brain modelling. We developed the COCO (COst of COgnition) framework using an analytical expression quantifying the links between energy cost, non-equilibrium and information processing for any given brain state measured with neuroimaging. Importantly, this key relationship also holds at the level of individual brain regions. We used this to quantify the benefits of information processing on the highly anatomically, interconnected hierarchical systems of the brain. Crucially, in empirical neuroimaging data we demonstrate that the human brain uses significantly less energy overall than other mammals (including non-human primates and mice), suggestive of an evolutionary optimisation of the effectiveness of computation. Focusing on the cost of cognition, using large-scale human neuroimaging data of 970 healthy human participants, we show that the resting state uses significantly less energy that seven different cognitive tasks. Furthermore, different kinds of tasks require different amounts of non-equilibrium, information processing and energy consumption. We found that tasks requiring more distributed computation also use more energy. Overall, these results directly quantify the cost of cognition, i.e., the non-equilibrium and energetic demands of information processing, allowing a deeper understanding of how the brain compute in a way that is far more energy efficient than current generations of digital computers and artificial intelligence.

">Xylazine exacerbates fentanyl-induced respiratory depression and prevents rescue by naloxone in mice</a></h4>

              
                Xylazine is a veterinary sedative and widespread adulterant of illicit opioids, where it is commonly combined with the highly potent synthetic mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist fentanyl. Xylazine adulteration of fentanyl is associated with increased risk of lethal overdose and decreased efficacy of reversal by the MOR antagonist naloxone. Here we use whole body plethysmography in mice to show that xylazine produces profound respiratory depression at subanesthetic doses. Xylazine rapidly and dose-dependently suppressed minute ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory frequency. These effects were dependent on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and were fully blocked by coadministration of the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist atipamezole. Atipamezole, administered alone, produced only modest reversal of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. Xylazine, when combined with a dose of fentanyl with modest respiratory effects, suppressed breathing with greater efficacy than when administered alone. Strikingly, doses of naloxone sufficient to completely reverse fentanyl-induced respiratory depression were ineffective in reversing the respiratory suppression induced by xylazine-adulterated fentanyl. By contrast, combinations of naloxone with atipamezole rapidly and fully reversed the suppression of breathing induced by xylazine-adulterated fentanyl. Our results show that xylazine suppresses breathing via activation of MORs, an effect enhanced by coadministration with the MOR agonist fentanyl. Respiratory suppression inflicted by the mixture of xylazine and fentanyl resisted reversal by naloxone but was fully reversible by subsequent coadministration of both naloxone and atipamezole. These observations have profound implications for the current opioid epidemic.

">Benefits of dual-tasking on implicit sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Attention plays a crucial role in maintaining precision and effectiveness in goal-directed actions. Although there is evidence that dividing attention across tasks impairs performance in various domains, the impact of attention on sensorimotor adaptation remains inconclusive, with some studies reporting deficits and others showing no effects. Because sensorimotor adaptation arises from the interaction of explicit and implicit processes, this discrepancy may reflect differential effects of attention on each process. Here, we investigate how divided attention influences implicit sensorimotor adaptation using an error-clamp paradigm, coupled with a random dot kinematogram (RDK) motion coherence discrimination task. We also assessed whether the timing of the secondary task affects error processing during sensorimotor adaptation by presenting the RDK either during the outward movement (coinciding with error feedback), or the inward movement (following error feedback). We observed that attentional manipulation influenced implicit sensorimotor adaptation only when the RDK was presented on the outward movement, not the inward movement. Remarkably, implicit sensorimotor adaptation was enhanced when attention was divided, compared to when attention was focused entirely on the adaptation task. This suggests that implicit sensorimotor adaptation is sensitive to attentional demand, particularly during the time window where error feedback is received.

">Neural Predictors of Functional Genomic Responses to Negative Social Evaluation in Adolescent Females</a></h4>

              
                Background Social stress, particularly when experienced during adolescence, can have a lasting impact on health and well-being. Among other key biological pathways, inflammatory and innate immune signaling appear to play important roles in linking stress to physical and mental health problems. Individual differences in sensitivity to social threats may leave certain people more vulnerable to stress and its harmful sequelae than others, and a growing body of research has found that stress sensitivity is reflected in neural activity throughout the threat network. However, few studies have investigated whether heightened neural sensitivity to social threats is related to acute changes in immune and neuroendocrine pathways relevant to health, particularly among those for whom the effects of stress may be especially impactful. Method In the current research, 52 adolescent females (MAge = 14.90, SD = 1.35) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to examine brain activity and functional connectivity during a social evaluation task. Nearly half of the sample (n = 22) were identified as having a maternal history of depression. Blood samples were collected prior to the task, as well as 35 and 65 min. after the task began, and were used for transcriptional profiling. Results The primary analyses tested whether threat network activity and connectivity predicted the magnitude of change in gene expression from baseline to the follow-up time points. Results revealed robust shifts in expression of genes in innate immune pathways in response to the task (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor-1, interferon signaling). Although activity across the entire threat network was related to individual differences in gene expression, anterior cingulate cortex-insula and insula-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity were most consistently related to up- and down-regulation of immune pathways, respectively. These patterns were further moderated by differences in maternal depression history. Conclusion Results demonstrate that individual differences in threat network activity may have important implications for biological responses to social threat among adolescent females. In turn, these findings both provide insights into neural signatures of social stress vulnerability and the biological pathways that may contribute to poorer health outcome among those most vulnerable to stress.

">Botulinum Neurotoxin A1 Signaling in Pain Modulation within Human Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Botulinum neurotoxin type A1 (BoNT/A1) is an effective treatment for chronic migraine, but its direct mechanism of action on human sensory neurons has not been fully elucidated. While rodent studies on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion (TG) show that BoNT/A1 inhibits neurotransmission, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release, by cleaving SNAP-25, only one previous study has assessed its effect on human DRG neurons. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanism of action of BoNT/A1 in cultured human sensory neurons and assess, using RNA sequencing, the transcriptomic consequences of BoNT/A1 treatment. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors the expression of key targets, including SNAP25, SV2C, & CALCA, was validated by mining existing transcriptomic datasets as well as immunohistochemistry. Cultured dissociated human DRG neurons treated with BoNT/A1 were used to examine cleavage of SNAP25, release of CGRP and transcriptomic changes after BoNT/A1 treatment. SV2C was found to be widely expressed in human DRG neurons in a pattern that completely overlapped with CGRP expression. Consistent with this finding, BoNT/A1 disrupted SNARE protein complexes in human DRG neurons as demonstrated by SNAP-25 cleavage in most somatosensory neurons and a reduction in capsaicin-evoked CGRP release, indicating impaired vesicle fusion. Moreover, Bulk RNA sequencing experiments revealed downregulated expression of a large subset of genes responsible for neurotransmitter and neuropeptide release from neurons suggesting a novel mechanism through which BoNT/A regulates neurotransmission. These results provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which BoNT/A may exert its pain-relieving effects in humans.

">Comparing Brain-Score and ImageNet performance with responses to the scintillating grid illusion</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual illusions are widely used to study brain processing, and are essential for elucidating underlying function. Successful brain models should then also be able to reproduce these illusions. Some of the most successful models for vision are several variants of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These models can classify images with human-level accuracy, and many behavioral and activation measurements correlate well with humans and animals. For several networks it was also shown that they can reproduce some human illusions. However, this was typically done for a limited number of networks. In addition, it remains unclear whether the presence of illusions is linked to either how accurate or brain-like the DNNs are. Here, we consider the scintillating grid illusion, to which two DNNs have been shown to respond as if they are impacted by the illusion. We develop a measure for measuring Illusion Strength based on model activation correlations, which takes into account the difference in Illusion Strength between illusion and control images. We then compare the Illusion Strength to both model performance (top-1 ImageNet), and how well the model explains brain activity (Brain-score). We show that the illusion was measurable in a wide variety of networks (41 out of 51). However, we do not find a strong correlation between Illusion Strength and Brain-Score, nor performance. Some models have strong illusion scores but not Brain-Score, or vice-versa, but no model does both well. Finally, this differs strongly between model types, particularly between convolutional and transformer-based architectures, with transformers having low illusion scores. Overall, our work shows that Illusion Strength measures an important metric to consider for assessing brain models, and that some models could still be missing out on some processing important for brain functioning.

">Modular Inter-brain Synchrony Network Associated with Social Difficulty in Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Graph Neural Network-Driven Hyperscanning Study</a></h4>

              
                Understanding social difficulties in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains challenging due to its neurobiological heterogeneity and the limited ecological validity of conventional neuroimaging methods in capturing dynamic social interactions. Hyperscanning analysis based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which measures inter-brain synchrony (IBS) during dyadic interaction, offers a novel avenue to address these challenges. However, prior studies on ASD have reported inconsistent findings, primarily focusing on intra-regional synchronization while overlooking cross-regional network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we proposed an interpretable graph neural network (GNN) model to systematically identify ASD-specific IBS modular network between child-caregiver dyads during naturalistic cooperative puzzle-solving and free-talking tasks. We identified distinctive key IBS sub-networks for the cooperative puzzle-solving task and free-talking task, with the frontal eye field (FEF) of caregivers, the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the motor region of children highlighted. Furthermore, the key IBS sub-networks were found to be able to predict multiple domains of the core ASD symptoms. By integrating hyperscanning with GNN-driven analysis, this work uncovers task-dependent inter-brain neural mechanisms underlying social difficulties in ASD. These findings advance the field by proposing a data-driven framework to identify IBS biomarkers tied to clinical profiles, paving the way for personalized interventions that integrate computational neuroscience with clinical practice.

">Predictive modeling of TMS-evoked responses: Unraveling instantaneous excitability states</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) provides a unique window into instantaneous cortical and corticospinal excitability states. We investigated 50 healthy participants to determine how fluctuations in pre-stimulus brain activity influence single-trial TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). We developed a novel automated source-level TEP extraction method using individualized spatiotemporal priors that is robust against poor single trial signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and ongoing oscillations. TEP and MEP amplitudes were predicted with linear mixed-effects models based on pre-stimulation EEG band-powers (theta to gamma), while accounting for temporal drifts (within-session trends), coil control, and inter-subject differences. We found that higher pre-stimulus sensorimotor alpha, beta, and gamma power were each associated with larger TEPs, indicating a more excitable cortical state. Increases in alpha and gamma power immediately before stimulation specifically predicted larger MEPs, reflecting increased corticospinal excitability. These results reveal relationships between ongoing oscillatory brain states and TMS response amplitudes, identifying EEG biomarkers of high- and low-excitability states. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the feasibility of single-trial source-level TMS-EEG analysis and shows that spontaneous alpha-, beta-, and gamma-band oscillations modulate motor cortical and corticospinal responsiveness. These findings pave the way for EEG-informed, brain-state-dependent TMS protocols to optimize neuromodulatory interventions in clinical and research applications.

">TNF-α-induced type I IFN signalling decreases neurogenesis and drives T cell chemotaxis</a></h4>

              
                Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is essential for learning, memory, and mood regulation, and its disruption is implicated in ageing, neurodegeneration, and mood disorders. However, the mechanisms linking inflammation to AHN impairment remain unclear. Here, we identify chronic tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) signalling as a key driver of neurogenic dysregulation via a previously unrecognized type I interferon (IFN) autocrine/paracrine loop in human hippocampal progenitor cells (HPCs). Using a human in vitro neurogenesis model, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional T cell migration assays, we show that TNF- induces a robust type I IFN response in HPCs, promoting chemokine and CXCR3-dependent T cell recruitment and suppressing neurogenesis. This inflammatory signalling cascade drives a fate switch in HPCs from a neurogenic trajectory towards an immune-defensive phenotype, with critical implications for infectious and inflammatory disease pathogenesis. These findings uncover a key inflammatory checkpoint regulating human AHN and highlight potential therapeutic targets to restore neurogenesis in chronic inflammatory states.

">Toward Crosstalk-free All-optical Interrogation of Neural Circuits</a></h4>

              
                All-optical interrogation, based on high-resolution two-photon stimulation and imaging, has emerged as a potentially transformative approach in neuroscience, allowing for the simultaneous precise manipulation and monitoring of neuronal activity across various model organisms. However, the unintended excitation of light-gated ion channels such as channelrhodopsin (ChR) during two-photon calcium imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) introduces artifactual neuronal perturbation and contaminates neural activity measurements. In this study, we propose an active pixel power control (APPC) approach, which dynamically adjusts the imaging laser power at each scanning pixel, to address the challenge. We aim to achieve simultaneous two-photon optogenetic manipulation and calcium imaging with a single femtosecond laser, while minimizing the crosstalk between manipulation and imaging. To study this technology's capabilities, we applied it to the larval zebrafish brain in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the APPC approach preserves GECI signal quality while suppressing optogenetic artifacts significantly. This enhances the accuracy of neural circuit dissection and advances the precision of all-optical interrogation, offering a robust framework for probing neural circuit dynamics and causality in vivo with high fidelity, potentially across various model organisms. Importantly, this technology can be seamlessly integrated with commonly used two-photon microscope systems in laboratories worldwide.

">Attention is all you need (in the brain): semantic contextualization in human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                In natural language, word meanings are contextualized, that is, modified by meanings of nearby words. Inspired by self-attention mechanisms in transformer-based large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that contextualization in the brain results from a weighted summation of canonical neural population responses to words with those of the words that contextualize them. We examined single unit responses in the human hippocampus while participants listened to podcasts. We first find that neurons encode the position of words within a clause, that they do so at multiple scales, and that they make use of both ordinal and frequency-domain positional encoding (which are used in some transformer models). Critically, neural responses to specific words correspond to a weighted sum of that words non-contextual embedding and the embedding of the words that contextualize it. Moreover, the relative weighting of the contextualizing words is correlated with the magnitude of the LLM-derived estimates of self-attention weighting. Finally, we show that contextualization is aligned with next-word prediction, which includes prediction of multiple possible words simultaneously. Together these results support the idea that the principles of self-attention used in LLMs overlap with the mechanisms of language processing within the human hippocampus, possibly due to similar prediction-oriented computational goals.

">The origins of time: a systematic review of the neural signatures of temporal prediction in infancy</a></h4>

              
                From birth, individuals' interpersonal dimension is underpinned by progressive learning of social interaction rules, their variations rooted in the temporal prediction of sensory events, and the inferences made about the organization of the social world. How this dimension is structured during infancy and articulated at the neural level is a critical question for cognitive and affective neurosciences. This systematic review aims to define the neural signatures of temporal prediction in newborns and infants and to discuss them in the context of the development of proximal cognitive and affective neural functions. Eight peer-reviewed studies were included, with 228 infants from birth to 9 months of age. Studies have evidenced that neural signatures of temporal prediction in infants present a broad cerebral localization, including the anterior and medial parts of the brain, especially in the frontal and central areas. Temporal prediction mechanisms emerge well before birth and evolve from early sensory-driven responses to complex top-down processing within the first year, shaped by both innate and experience-dependent factors, with influences like wakefulness and musical exposure that modulate neural integration across sensory and higher-order brain regions.

">Two-Point Calibration Protocol for the FRET Indicator Pyronic in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Pyruvate is a nodal intermediate in cellular metabolism, positioned at the crossroads between glycolysis and fermentative metabolism. It is exchanged between the intracellular and extracellular compartments through the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters and between the cytosol and mitochondria through the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, where it serves as a primary carbon source for respiration. Aim: Our goal is to present a detailed protocol for quantifying cytosolic pyruvate concentration in neurons at single-cell resolution using a minimally invasive, two-point calibration approach with the FRET-based genetically-encoded fluorescent indicator Pyronic. Approach: This protocol is based on a non-invasive pharmacological two-point calibration approach, where Pyronic s dynamic range ({Delta}RMAX) is established by using trans-acceleration exchange to deplete intracellular pyruvate (RMIN), and by inducing Pyronic saturation (RMAX) through the combination of inhibition of pyruvate export, stimulation of its production, and blockade of its mitochondrial consumption. The protocol also incorporates the previously published KD values for Pyronic obtained from in vitro experiments. This procedure does not require the use of detergents to permeabilize the cells. Results: Implementing this protocol enables the measurement of absolute cytosolic pyruvate concentrations. This quantitative parameter facilitates comparisons of pyruvate metabolism across different cells, samples and experimental batches, thereby enabling the comparison between a plethora of experimental conditions. Conclusions: The FRET-based fluorescent indicator Pyronic can be reliably calibrated using a minimally invasive, pharmacology-based two-point calibration protocol in neurons, thus providing a robust and quantitative method to study pyruvate metabolism under various physiological and pathological scenarios.

">A connectomics-based analysis of lamina monopolar cells reveals mechanisms of spatial processing in insect motion vision</a></h4>

              
                Many animals strongly rely on their sense of vision, as it provides information about the natural world with particularly high dimensionality. In insects, the first visual processing stage of the brain, the lamina, plays an important role in parallel processing of this complex information. Its main relay neurons, lamina monopolar cells (LMCs), receive information directly from the photoreceptors and shape the contrast, luminance, spatial and temporal tuning of the insect visual system in a cell-type specific manner. One of their best-investigated downstream targets is the motion vision pathway. However, how LMC types that feed into motion processing delineate contrast and luminance is only known from fruit flies, while the contribution of LMCs to spatial processing has only been described in hawkmoths. Here, we provide a novel characterization of hawkmoths lamina monopolar cells, to integrate the contrast, luminance and spatial processing properties of LMCs in the motion pathway. We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the anatomical fine structure of LMCs in a focal lamina cartridge, including their pre- and post- synaptic connections. Combining our novel LMC classification with intracellular recordings, we further investigated the functional role of hawkmoth L1 and L2 in terms of contrast and spatial processing. We show that unlike in flies, L1 and L2, the main relay neurons to the motion pathway, process contrast and luminance information in a similar manner. We further demonstrated that the spatial processing properties of these cells are highly similar as well, and can be explained by the density and the distribution of their synapses across different lamina layers. Based on these findings, we propose that the different lamina layers support distinct connectivity and functional roles in spatial processing.

">Specific anterior-posterior brain-wide input patterns support specialized visuospatial processing in the mouse retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key integrative hub involved in spatial orientation, navigation, and diverse cognitive and mnemonic processes. In rodents, RSC neurons carry rich sensory and navigational signals and are interconnected with sensory, motor, thalamic, and hippocampal circuits, supporting multimodal integration. However, the cellular circuit mechanisms that underlie this integration remain poorly understood. Here, we combined two-photon calcium imaging in navigating mice with brain-wide retrograde tracing to investigate how visual and positional signals are encoded and distributed across the RSC, with functional data covering both the medial-to-lateral and anterior-to-posterior dimensions of the RSC. We found that anterior and posterior RSC neurons exhibit distinct encoding properties and afferent connectivity. While anterior RSC neurons preferentially encode high-speed visual motion and display sharp, reliable position tuning, posterior RSC neurons are more responsive to low-speed stimuli and exhibit broader, weaker position-related activity. These functional specializations are paralleled by distinct long-range input patterns: anterior RSC receives dense projections from motor, parietal, and hippocampal-related areas, regions associated with strong position-related signals, whereas posterior RSC is more strongly innervated by visual cortices. Together, our results reveal a topographic organization of visual and navigational signals in the RSC, with anatomically distinct subregions potentially supporting different roles in visuospatial integration during navigation.

                The barcoded connectomics tool MAPseq enables highly multiplexed projection mapping of individual neurons by translating neuroanatomy into a DNA sequencing problem. Here we present MAPseq2, a user-friendly protocol with 3-4 fold increased barcode detection sensitivity and ~10 fold decreased cost relative to the current MAPseq protocol. As MAPseq workflows are used across a range of barcoded connectomics methods, including BARseq, BRICseq, and ConnectID, all improvements in MAPseq2 directly transfer to these technologies.

">Multisensory integration for active mechanosensation in Drosophila flight</a></h4>

              
                To support robust behaviors in highly variable environments, animals rely on active sampling of their sensory surroundings. Here, we use tethered, flying Drosophila melanogaster and a multisensory behavioral apparatus simulating forward flight to determine how visual and mechanosensory information are integrated and control active movements of an important multimodal sensory organ, the antennae. We found that flies perform active antennal movements in response to varying airflow, and that the direction of these movements changes depending on the visual environment. Next, we found that antennal movements are amplified in the presence of visual motion, but only when the fly was flying. Through mechanical and optogenetic manipulation of mechanosensory input, we found that mechanosensory feedback is vital to antennal positioning at flight onset. Additionally, we observed unexpected changes in wingbeat frequency when the antenna was mechanically stabilized, suggesting that multiple antennal mechanosensors contribute to flight regulation. Finally, we show that integration of mechanosensory and visual cues for controlling antennal motion follows in a "winner-takes-all" paradigm dependent on the stimulus frequency, mirroring visuo-mechanosensory guided behaviors in other species. Together, these results reveal novel behavioral gating of sensory information and expand our understanding of the efferent control of active sensing.

">Lie Detectors for Face Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Lie detection is important for government law enforcement. Current lie detection methods such as the polygraph test have been found to be unreliable (Meijer et al. 2017). New lie detection technology is currently arising that is based on fMRI; however, single subject tests have only been successful in detecting lies 88% of the time (Langleben et al., 2005; Wild, 2005). One of the main problems with most fMRI-based approaches is that they assume that various acts of deception involve common brain regions, (Ganis et al., 2003). In this work I propose a much more accurate fMRI lie detection method that does not make this assumption and is domain based. In my investigation, rather than trying to localize brain regions that are indicative of lying in general, I localize brain regions that indicate lying specifically about face recognition. In criminal investigations one frequently needs to establish familiar relations between a suspect, victim and/or witness. This type of information can be used as circumstantial evidence in a crime. In this work I propose to use fMRI to detect whether a suspect has any familiarity with an individual face. I find that activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus was a reliable discriminator for face familiarity.

">High-resolution whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in youth at risk for psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in acquisition and reconstruction of 3-dimensional magnetic-resonance spectroscopic imaging (3D-MRSI) enable the high-resolution mapping of multiple neurometabolites in the whole-brain, in vivo. Leveraging this capability, we created a voxel-based pipeline that corrects and spatially normalizes whole-brain maps of total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), myo-inositol (Ins), choline compounds, glutamate + glutamine, and creatine + phosphocreatine. We examined a clinical cohort of adolescents and young adults at risk for psychosis (n= 21) (meeting DSM-5 criteria for Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS) or Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SCZT)) and age-/sex-matched healthy controls (n =13), as well as an independent non-clinical sample of adolescents (n = 61). We first aimed at assessing the reproducibility of MRSI measures across datasets and scanning sites, then validate the feasibility of a whole-brain voxel-based analyses on 3D-MRSI data and eventually test the sensitivity of this approach. Metabolite distributions showed reproducible regional variation in standard space between the two independent samples and scanning sites (r ranging from 0.82 to 0.99). Relative to controls, at-risk participants exhibited higher tNAA in frontal grey matter; the SCZT subgroup additionally displayed widespread cortical and subcortical Ins elevations compared with both APS and controls. Voxel-based analyses of structural (i.e., gray and white matter volumes or densities) and diffusion (i.e., generalized fractional anisotropy) parameters yielded no significant differences between risk participants and controls. These findings suggest the sensitivity of high-resolution 3D-MRSI for detecting subtle neurometabolic alterations at the group level in the early stages of psychotic disorders. Detailed brain metabolic mapping has the potential to help with early identification of young people at risk for psychosis or other mental disorders.

">Abnormal Elevated Connectivity During Language Processing is Associated with Poor Cognitive Performance in Children with Self-limited Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes</a></h4>

              
                Self-Limited Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (SeLECTS) is associated with language impairments despite seizures originating in the motor cortex, suggesting aberrant cross-network interactions. Here we tested whether functional connectivity in SeLECTS during language tasks predicts language performance. We recorded high-density EEG from right-handed children with SeLECTS (n=31) and age-matched controls (n=32) during verb generation, repetition, and resting tasks. Phonological awareness was assessed using the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing-2. Connectivity between bilateral motor cortices and language regions (the left inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices and their right hemisphere homologues) was measured using weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI). Children with SeLECTS demonstrated significantly elevated connectivity between motor and language regions during language processing. Motor-to-frontal connectivity was higher in SeLECTS during both verb generation and repetition tasks. Frontal-to-temporal connectivity was elevated specifically during verb generation. Higher interhemispheric connectivity (between the left and right hemispheres) during language tasks strongly predicted worse phonological awareness in children with SeLECTS ({beta} = -40 to -61, all p<0.005), but not controls. Together, we found that children with SeLECTS exhibited pathologically elevated connectivity between motor and language networks that was strongly associated with impaired phonological awareness. These findings identify aberrant interhemispheric connectivity as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying language dysfunction and establish EEG-based connectivity measures as a potential biomarker for guiding targeted neuromodulation therapies to treat cognitive impairments in pediatric epilepsy.

                <p>Recent research shows that the intention to act on an object alters its neural representation in ways as afforded by underlying sensorimotor processes. For example, the intention to grasp and pick up an object results in representations of the object's weight. But these representations become grasp-specific only immediately before object lift if weight information is relayed through object material. This feature triggers earlier representations regardless of intention probably because material&ndash;weight contingencies are overlearned. In contrast, recently learned weight cues should be recalled deliberately during grasp planning resulting in early grasp-specific representations. Here, we examined how action intentions affect the representation of newly acquired color&ndash;weight contingencies. We recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in shape and density as indicated by their color. Multivariate analyses revealed a grasp-specific reactivation of color during planning that was mirrored in beta band. This suggests that task relevancy influences the representation of color such that previously encoded color&ndash;weight contingencies may be reactivated as required for grasping, mediated top-down via working memory. Grasp-specific representations of shape and color were also present in theta band, perhaps reflecting attentional activity. These results provide novel insights into the interplay between cognition and motor planning processes.</p>

                <p>The genetic role and specific effects of primary familial cerebral calcification (PFBC) are still unclear. We aim to analyze bibliometric features in studies related to PFBC, investigate variant detection rates in patients with brain calcifications, and examine the phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients. A comprehensive search of studies on the genetic effects of PFBC up until December 31, 2024, was conducted across Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. A random-effects meta-analysis combined variant detection rates for genes <I>SLC20A2</I>, <I>PDGFRB</I>, <I>PDGFB</I>, <I>XPR1</I>, <I>MYORG</I>, <I>JAM2</I>, <I>CMPK2</I>, and <I>NAA60</I>. Data on total calcification scores (TCS), age of onset, and the prevalence of various phenotypes in PFBC patients were also aggregated. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's linear regression, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed. Of 1,267 records, 224 were included in the bibliometric analysis. Keywords "primary familial brain calcification" and "<I>SLC20A2</I>" were most prominent. Eighteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, revealing higher variant rates for <I>SLC20A2</I> (16.7%, 95% CI: 10.0&ndash;24.6) and <I>MYORG</I> (16.8%, 95% CI: 0.0&ndash;54.0), which were associated with higher TCS. The average age of onset was 43.69&nbsp;years (95% CI: 36.17&ndash;51.21). Cognitive impairment (45.3%, 95% CI: 35.7&ndash;55.1) and psychiatric symptoms (30.8%, 95% CI: 17.2&ndash;46.2) had relatively higher prevalence rates. No significant publication bias was found (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05), and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the results&rsquo; robustness. <I>SLC20A2</I> and <I>MYORG</I> variants had higher detection rates, with cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms being common in PFBC patients. Continued research is essential to further explore these genetic variants.</p>

                <p>&alpha;-Synuclein is a synaptic protein that accumulates primarily in synucleinopathies and secondarily in certain lysosomal storage disorders. However, its physiological roles in health and disease are not fully understood. In part, this has been hampered by the inability to visualize &alpha;-synuclein and its cellular localization, due to the lack of specific antibodies and faithful reporters. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to generate human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines in which the &alpha;-synuclein (<I>SNCA</I>) gene has been tagged with the short HA peptide either at the N-terminus or C-terminus or with the fluorescent protein mCherry at the C-terminus of the protein. These diverse strategies revealed the C-terminus HA-tag as the best option. C-Terminus HA-tagged &alpha;-synuclein had unchanged protein expression and did not generate degradation by-products. Importantly, we show that following differentiation to neurons, the C-terminus HA-tagged iPSC line had unaffected electrophysiological properties and could be used to visualize accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein upon inhibition of lysosomal function and under physiological protein levels. It is our expectation that this line and tagging approach will be very useful in further studies examining &alpha;-synuclein aggregation and its role in cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background UAV-based power line inspections offer a safer, more efficient alternative to traditional methods, but insulator detection presents key challenges: multiscale object detection and intra-class variance. Insulators vary in size due to UAV altitude and perspective changes, while their visual similarities across types (e.g., glass, porcelain, composite) complicate classification. Methods To address these issues, we introduce APF-YOLO, an enhanced YOLOv8-based model integrating the Adaptive Path Fusion (APF) neck and the Adaptive Feature Alignment Module (AFAM). AFAM balances fine-grained detail extraction for small objects with semantic context for larger ones through local and global pathways by integrating advanced attention mechanisms. This work also introduces the Merged Public Insulator Dataset (MPID), a comprehensive dataset designed for insulator detection, representing diverse real-world conditions such as occlusions, varying scales, and environmental challenges. Results Evaluations on MPID demonstrate that APF-YOLO surpasses state-of-the-art models with different neck configurations, achieving at least a +2.71% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.9 and a +1.24% increase in recall, while maintaining real-time performance in server-grade environments. Although APF-YOLO adds computational requirements, these remain within acceptable limits for real-world applications. Future work will optimize APF-YOLO for edge devices through techniques such as model pruning and lightweight feature extractors, enhancing its adaptability and efficiency. Conclusion Combined with MPID, APF-YOLO establishes a strong foundation for advancing UAV-based insulator detection, contributing to safer and more effective power line monitoring.

Prognostic Score [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aimed to determine the preoperative factors that may contribute to the occurrence of residual stones after X-ray-free ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (XFUS PCNL) and to develop a user-friendly prognostic tool for daily practice. Methods This study developed a scoring system to identify patients with a higher risk of residual stones after XFUS PCNL. A prospective cohort study of patients with XFUS PCNL in an Indonesian tertiary referral hospital was conducted between November 2019 and November 2023. Potential factors were analyzed using (chi-square test), and significant variables were further analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Risk scores were calculated for each patient in the cohort, model discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and model calibration was performed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. Multiple logistic regression analyses with bootstrapped standard errors were used to compare the odds of residual stones. Results This study included a consecutive cohort of 162 patients. The P.O.N.C.O. prognostic score, consisting of five independent risk factors (p-value<0.05), namely, proportion/size, obstruction status, number of stones, contour, and obesity, was then established and calculated for each patient scoring 3.51 ± 2.2 with an average. The scoring model showed excellent discrimination with an AUCs of 0.924 (95%CI 0.87-0.97; P-value<0.001). The model also had good calibration with a non-significant Hosmer–Lemeshow chi-square of P = 0.95. Conclusion This study presents the first prognostic scoring tool for residual stones in XFUS PCNL with good discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility using five easily accessible predictive factors in daily practice

                Despite the increasing exploitation of nanomaterials (NMs) in an array of consumer products, there are uncertainties regarding their potential adverse impact on human health. Investigation of whether NMs activate a pro-inflammatory response is routinely used to assess their toxicity in in vitro and in vivo (rodent) studies. The use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate inflammatory responses to chemicals, pathogens and injury has increased considerably over recent years. Zebrafish have also been used to investigate the role of inflammation in disease pathogenesis and for drug discovery. Availability of transgenic strains which express fluorescent proteins in immune cells (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils) enables the visualization and quantification of immune cell accumulation in the target site(s) of interest. We therefore propose that non protected life stages of transgenic zebrafish have great utility for screening the toxicity of NMs via investigation of inflammatory responses. Indeed, we have successfully used non-protected life stages of transgenic zebrafish with fluorescent neutrophils (TgBAC(mpx:GFP)i114) to investigate inflammatory responses to NMs. The more widespread use of transgenic zebrafish in nanotoxicology could reduce the reliance placed on rodents and thereby promote implementation of the 3Rs principles. As zebrafish continue to grow in popularity it is timely to offer guidance to new users on their use. Here we will reflect on: exposure routes that can adopted  to mimic human/rodent exposure, what transgenic strains and life stages are best suited to investigate inflammatory responses, selection criteria for zebrafish embryos/larvae, the inclusion of appropriate controls, the importance of dose selection and sample size, and how the (inflammatory) response can be quantified. It is hoped that our recommendations will support the development of standard protocols that can be used to assess whether NMs activate inflammatory responses. Importantly, the themes discussed are not restricted to NMs but relevant also to zebrafish application in ecotoxicology or human health focused studies.

                Background Exercise therapy is recommended for patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) who are candidates for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). How this patient group perceives and experiences a simplified approach to pre-surgical exercise (non-surgical care) with a systematic re-assessment of the need for surgery (surgical care) after exercise has not been well explored. The aim of this study was to explore perceived (before) and experienced (after) facilitators and barriers (determinants) towards 12 weeks of home-based exercise therapy using a simple 1-exercise program in patients with severe knee OA who were eligible for TKA. Methods A qualitative design was employed from 2018 to 2019, involving 10 patients recruited through purposive sampling for semi-structured interviews conducted before and after a 12-week exercise therapy program. The collected data were categorized through inductive content analysis. Results Through abstraction, the data material was condensed into three interrelated categories: 1) Less-is-more unless it is too “less”, 2) Feedback-loops to motivation and adherence, and 3) Comprehensive re-assessment and universal healthcare-support empowers patient-centered care; and six sub-categories. These three categories reflect the complex interplay of barriers and facilitators that impacts the success of home-based exercise programs, highlighting the importance of personalized patient-centered care in this context. Conclusion The determinants of exercise adherence differed among participants, with some determinants serving as facilitators for some but barriers to others. These differences in perceptions and experiences suggest that adherence to the 1-exercise program could be enhanced by accommodating individual preferences. The participants had positive perceptions and experiences of the coordination of non-surgical and surgical care. Knowing that their need for surgery was systematically re-assessed after non-surgical care provided a sense of security and safety. QUADX-1 trial registration identifier: NCT02931058.

                Background Postoperative immobilizatiton for patients with lower extremity fractures causes constipation, which usually affects 50–70% of patients. When it comes to nursing interventions for postoperative constipation, Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are two possible options. Aim The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage on constipation scores on post-operative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-posttest design without control group design was applied. 30 respondents used simple random sampling technique. The Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) questionnaire was used to assess the patient’s constipation levels before and after the intervention. The data analysis used independent t-test. Results The mean score of constipation of drinking water group after the intervention was 4.60 while abdominal Swedish massage was 3.56. Although both significantly reduced the constipation score, the p-value was 0.00. Conclusion The protocol of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage immediately after waking up effectively reduced constipation scores on postoperative lower extremity fracture patients and can be use to adjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate postoperative constipation patients with immobility and the use of strong analgetics.

                <p>by Alexander C. Murph, G. Casey Gibson, Elizabeth B. Amona, Lauren J. Beesley, Lauren A. Castro, Sara Y. Del Valle, Dave Osthus</p>

The Method of Analogues (MOA) has gained popularity in the past decade for infectious disease forecasting due to its non-parametric nature. In MOA, the local behavior observed in a time series is matched to the local behaviors of several historical time series. The known values that directly follow the historical time series that best match the observed time series are used to calculate a forecast. This non-parametric approach leverages historical trends to produce forecasts without extensive parameterization, making it highly adaptable. However, MOA is limited in scenarios where historical data is sparse. This limitation was particularly evident during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the emerging global epidemic had little-to-no historical data. In this work, we propose a new method inspired by MOA, called the <i>Synthetic Method of Analogues</i> (sMOA). sMOA replaces historical disease data with a library of <i>synthetic</i> data that describe a broad range of <i>possible</i> disease trends. This model circumvents the need to estimate explicit parameter values by instead matching segments of ongoing time series data to a comprehensive library of synthetically generated segments of time series data. We demonstrate that sMOA has competitive performance with state-of-the-art infectious disease forecasting models, out-performing 78% of models from the COVID-19 Forecasting Hub in terms of averaged Mean Absolute Error and 76% of models from the COVID-19 Forecasting Hub in terms of averaged Weighted Interval Score. Additionally, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification methodology designed for the onset of emerging epidemics. Developing versatile approaches that do not rely on historical data and can maintain high accuracy in the face of novel pandemics is critical for enhancing public health decision-making and strengthening preparedness for future outbreaks.

                <p>by Xuexin Yu, Jing Hu, Yuhao Tan, Mingyao Pan, Hongyi Zhang, Bo Li</p>

Mitochondrial (MT) mutations serve as natural genetic markers for inferring clonal relationships using single cell sequencing data. However, the fundamental challenge of MT mutation-based lineage tracing is automated identification of informative MT mutations. Here, we introduced an open-source computational algorithm called “MitoTracer”, which accurately identified clonally informative MT mutations and inferred evolutionary lineage from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq samples. We benchmarked MitoTracer using the ground-truth experimental lineage sequencing data and demonstrated its superior performance over the existing methods measured by high sensitivity and specificity. MitoTracer is compatible with multiple single cell sequencing platforms. Its application to a cancer evolution dataset revealed the genes related to primary BRAF-inhibitor resistance from scRNA-seq data of BRAF-mutated cancer cells. Overall, our work provided a valuable tool for capturing real informative MT mutations and tracing the lineages among cells.

                <p>by Janis Keck, Caswell Barry, Christian F. Doeller, Jürgen Jost</p>

In spatial cognition, the Successor Representation (SR) from reinforcement learning provides a compelling candidate of how predictive representations are used to encode space. In particular, hippocampal place cells are hypothesized to encode the SR. Here, we investigate how varying the temporal symmetry in learning rules influences those representations. To this end, we use a simple local learning rule which can be made insensitive to the temporal order. We analytically find that a symmetric learning rule results in a successor representation under a symmetrized version of the experienced transition structure. We then apply this rule to a two-layer neural network model loosely resembling hippocampal subfields CA3 - with a symmetric learning rule and recurrent weights - and CA1 - with an asymmetric learning rule and no recurrent weights. Here, when exposed repeatedly to a linear track, neurons in our model in CA3 show less shift of the centre of mass than those in CA1, in line with existing empirical findings. Investigating the functional benefits of such symmetry, we employ a simple reinforcement learning agent which may learn symmetric or classical successor representations. Here, we find that using a symmetric learning rule yields representations which afford better generalization, when the agent is probed to navigate to a new target without relearning the SR. This effect is reversed when the state space is not symmetric anymore. Thus, our results hint at a potential benefit of the inductive bias afforded by symmetric learning rules in areas employed in spatial navigation, where there naturally is a symmetry in the state space.

                <p>by Giulio Filippi, James Knight, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

Many insects use memories of their visual environment to adaptively drive spatial behaviours. In ants, visual memories are fundamental for navigation, whereby foragers follow long visually guided routes to foraging sites and return to the location of their nest. Whilst we understand the basic visual pathway to the memory centres (Optic Lobes to Mushroom Bodies) involved in the storage of visual information, it is still largely unknown what type of representation of visual scenes underpins view-based navigation in ants. Several experimental studies have suggested ants use “higher-order” visual information – that is features extracted across the whole extent of a visual scene – which raises the question as to how these features might be computed. One such experimental study showed that ants can use the proportion of a shape experienced left of their visual centre to learn and recapitulate a route, a feature referred to as “fractional position of mass” (FPM). In this work, we use a simple model constrained by the known neuroanatomy and information processing properties of the Mushroom Bodies to explore whether the apparent use of the FPM could be a resulting factor of the bilateral organisation of the insect brain, all the whilst assuming a simple “retinotopic” view representation. We demonstrate that such bilaterally organised memory models can implicitly encode the FPM learned during training. We find that balancing the “quality” of the memory match across left and right hemispheres allows a trained model to retrieve the FPM defined direction, even when the model is tested with novel shapes, as demonstrated by ants. The result is shown to be largely independent of model parameter values, therefore suggesting that some aspects of higher-order processing of a visual scene may be emergent from the structure of the neural circuits, rather than computed in discrete processing modules.

                <p>by Xuan Wen, Adam Neumann, Seema Dhungana, Thilo Womelsdorf</p>

Intelligent behavior involves mentally arranging learned information in novel ways and is particularly well developed in humans. While nonhuman primates (NHP) will learn to arrange new items in serial order and re-arrange neighboring items within that order, it has remained contentious whether they are capable to re-assign items more flexibly to non-adjacent serial positions. Such mental re-indexing is facilitated by inferring the sequential structure of experiences as opposed to learning serial chains of item-item associations. Here, we tested the ability for flexible mental re-indexing in rhesus macaques. Subjects learned to choose five objects in a predetermined sequential order. A change of the background context indicated when the object order changed, probing the subjects to mentally re-arrange objects to non-adjacent positions of the learned serial structure. Subjects successfully used the context cue to pro-actively re-index items to new, non-adjacent positions. Mental re-indexing was more likely when the initial order had been learned at a higher level, improved with more experience of the re-indexing rule and correlated with working memory performance in a delayed match-to-sample task. These findings suggest that NHPs inferred the sequential structure of experiences beyond a chaining of item-item associations and mentally re-arrange items within that structure. The pattern of results indicates that NHPs form non-spatial cognitive maps of their experiences, which is a hallmark for flexible mental operations in many serially ordered behaviors including communication, counting or foraging.

                <p>by Tong Zhang, Amarender R. Bogadhi, Ziad M. Hafed</p>

Across saccades, neurons in retinotopically organized visual representations experience drastically different images, but visual percepts remain stable. Here we investigated whether such stability can be mediated, in part, via prediction-error signaling by neurons processing post-saccadic visual images. We specifically recorded from foveal superior colliculus (SC) neurons when a visual image only overlapped with their response fields (RF’s) after foveating saccades but not pre-saccadically. When we rapidly changed the target features intra-saccadically, the foveal neurons’ post-saccadic visual reafferent responses were elevated, even though the neurons did not directly sample the pre-saccadic extrafoveal target features. This effect did not occur in the absence of saccades, and it also scaled with the extent of the introduced intra-saccadic image feature discrepancies. These results suggest that foveal SC neurons may signal a trans-saccadic prediction error when the foveated image stimulating them is inconsistent with that expected from pre-saccadic extrafoveal representations, a potential perceptual stability mechanism.

                <p>by Craig R. McClain</p>

STEM is profoundly shaped by wealth, yet financial privilege is rarely acknowledged in discussions of diversity and inclusion. Wealth influences participation, persistence, and recognition in science, affecting not just who enters the pipeline but also who can afford to stay.

From student to researcher, a career in science can come with a high price tag. This Perspective explores how persistent financial barriers limit who can succeed in science, revealing how wealth shapes opportunity in STEM, and proposes structural changes to support equity and inclusion.

                <p>by Jianting Han, Meinai Song, Yijia Cheng, Wei Gong, Fei Zhang, Qin Cao</p>

Glycoprotein 2 (GP2) and Uromodulin (UMOD) are considered as paralogs that share high sequence similarity and have similar antibacterial functions. UMOD are abundant as filaments in the urinary tract, and a high-mannose N-glycosylation site located on the N-terminal region protruding from UMOD filament core (referred to as branch) acts as an adhesion antagonist against pathogenic bacterial infections. The antibacterial function of UMOD can be eliminated by proteases, as the UMOD branch is susceptible to proteolytic activity. GP2 is expressed in the pancreas and secreted into the digestive tract. Whether GP2 executes its function in filament form and how it remains functional in the protease-enriched digestive tract is unclear. In this study, we extract GP2 filaments from surgically excised human pancreas and determined their cryo-EM structure. Our structure analysis unveiled that GP2 forms filaments with its ZP modules, composing the ZPN and ZPC domains along with a linker that connects these two domains. The N-terminal region (branch) of GP2 does not constitute the filament core and appears flexible in the cryo-EM structure. Our biochemical experiments suggested that although the GP2 branch is also protease-susceptible, additional high-mannose N-glycans were identified on the protease-resistant GP2 filament core. Consequently, the branch-free GP2 filaments retain their binding ability to the bacterial adhesin FimH, ensuring GP2’s antibacterial function unaffected in the proteolytic environment. Our study provides the first experimental evidence of GP2 filament formation and reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying GP2’s adaptation to a different environment compared to UMOD.

                <p>by Aubrey Converse, Madeline J. Perry, Shweta S. Dipali, Jose V. V. Isola, Emmett B. Kelly, Joseph M. Varberg, Mary B. Zelinski, Michael B. Stout, Michele T. Pritchard, Francesca E. Duncan</p>

The ovary is one of the first organs to exhibit signs of aging, characterized by reduced tissue function, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis. Multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), formed by macrophage fusion, typically occur in chronic immune pathologies, including infectious and non-infectious granulomas and the foreign body response, but are also observed in the aging ovary. The function and consequence of ovarian MNGCs remain unknown as their biological activity is highly context-dependent, and their large size has limited their isolation and analysis through technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. In this study, we define ovarian MNGCs through a deep analysis of their presence across age and species using advanced imaging technologies as well as their unique transcriptome using laser capture microdissection. MNGCs form complex interconnected networks that increase with age in both mouse and nonhuman primate ovaries. MNGCs are characterized by high <i>Gpnmb</i> expression, a putative marker of ovarian and non-ovarian MNGCs. Pathway analysis highlighted functions in apoptotic cell clearance, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, immune processes, and increased oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidant activity. Thus, MNGCs have signatures related to degradative processes, immune function, and high metabolic activity. These processes were enriched in MNGCs compared to primary ovarian macrophages, suggesting discrete functionality. MNGCs express CD4 and colocalize with T-cells, which were enriched in regions of MNGCs, indicative of a close interaction between these immune cell types. These findings implicate MNGCs in modulation of the ovarian immune landscape during aging given their high penetrance and unique molecular signature that supports degradative and immune functions.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a persistent infectious inflammatory condition that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune ailment that has been linked with raised periodontal disease severity. This study aimed to assess the clinical and immunological characteristics of PD in individuals with and without RA and to compare these characteristics with a healthy control group. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers, including human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results The current findings showed that salivary level of HLA-DR4 was decreased in patients’ groups as compared to healthy control group. Whilst, salivary levels of MMP-8 and ACPA were elevated in patients’ groups in comparison to control group, with no substantial differences found across both patient groups. On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls, with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to determine patient, disease, and treatment characteristics associated with outcome in patients with primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) in a large multicenter German cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a retrospective, observational cohort study, we analyzed 163 adult patients who met the diagnostic criteria for PACNS. Data were collected from January 2004 to December 2018 in 13 tertiary care centers in Germany. Survival, recurrence-free survival and long-term global disability were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 163 patients with PACNS (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age 48 [39–59.5] years; 73 [45%] women), 29 (18%) died, 84 (52%) had a poor outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 3–6 at last follow-up), and 82 (50%) patients relapsed. Poorer survival was associated with patient age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41–2.74] per 10 years), longer time between initial manifestation and diagnosis (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00–1.01] per month), and necrotizing subtype (HR, 10.2 [95% CI, 2.18–48.2]). Long-term disability was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.07–1.86] per 10 years), and worse mRS score at diagnosis (OR, 4.43 [95% CI, 1.97–10.4]). Patients treated with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with steroids had a lower incidence of relapse than untreated patients (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.22–0.86]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.92]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with PACNS, the long-term outcome depends on several patient and disease characteristics. Our results favor treatment with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with steroids, because this was associated with a reduction in the relapse rate. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>This illustration demonstrates how resveratrol reduces cerebral aneurysm growth by activating SIRT1. Activation of SIRT1 suppresses NFKB1 inflammatory gene transcription through p65 unit deacetylation, which ultimately decreases the expression of inflammatory cells in the aneurysm wall.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Resveratrol is a polyphenol and potent antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory effects in conditions such as atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory effects and protects against intracranial aneurysm formation and rupture in male mice. Intracranial aneurysms were induced in mice using a combination of elastase injection into the cerebrospinal fluid and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt)-induced hypertension. Male mice were divided into two groups: a resveratrol diet group and a normal diet group. The dietary intervention lasted for 6 weeks, starting 3 weeks prior to elastase injection. The overall incidence of aneurysms did not differ significantly between the normal diet and resveratrol diet groups (71% vs. 59%, <i>p</i> = 0.497). However, resveratrol significantly reduced the rate of aneurysmal rupture compared with that in the normal diet group (88% vs. 40%, <i>p</i> = 0.026). Furthermore, resveratrol supplementation increased the mRNA levels of Sirtuin 1 (<i>Sirt1</i>) and decreased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (<i>Nfkb1</i>) and Tumor necrosis factor (<i>Tnf</i>). Our findings demonstrate that resveratrol reduces intracranial aneurysm rupture in a mouse model, indicating its therapeutic potential in this condition.</p>

     alt="Loss of Postnatal Retinal Input Perturbs Cortical Lamination in the Developing Ferret Visual Cortex"/>
<p>Early loss of visual input results in thickened visual cortex. This study of bilaterally enucleated ferrets localizes thickness differences to deep cortical layers 5/6, and finds they are detectable during the growth phase of cortical development. The thickness difference does not appear to be attributable to differential interneuron numbers.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuroanatomical development of the visual system is influenced by activity-dependent processes. Removal of retinal input early in development in animal model experiments reproduces several structural characteristics of the primary visual cortex in humans who have been blinded early in life. Yet, many questions regarding how the loss of retinal activity affects the organization and cellular composition of the visual cortex remain to be answered. Here, we report alterations to primary visual cortex development in ferrets over the postnatal day 20 (P20) to P38 age range that arise following bilateral enucleation on P7. Most notably, during this age range, V1 is observed to become thicker in P7 enucleates than in control animals. While this effect recapitulates observations of abnormally thick visual cortex in early blind humans, the observation that the thickness difference is observable by P32, while the cortex is still developing, has implications that run counter to prevailing interpretations of the V1 thickness difference. In order to further characterize the cytoarchitectural development of V1, we quantify the number and distribution of the two largest populations of inhibitory neurons through postnatal development, illustrating how the emergence of visual input–dependent organization displays a unique time course in both controls and enucleates. We observe perturbations to macroscopic anatomical development with only minor effects on the number and distribution of interneurons present throughout late corticogenesis following binocular enucleation. Our results demonstrate that postnatal enucleation can produce substantial and durable alterations to the mature organization of the visual cortex, likely mirroring those occurring in human patients who lose sight early in life. Our findings identify specific cellular and molecular alterations and highlight challenges that will need to be addressed in the design and development of restorative therapeutics.</p>

                Hengen and Shew propose that criticality—a state with scale-invariant dynamics—is a universal computational setpoint of healthy brains. Their meta-analysis of two decades of research reconciles contradictory findings. They present eight predictions that emerge when criticality is understood as an optimization principle that maximizes the brain’s computational power.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99986">Brain-derived exosomal hemoglobin transfer contributes to neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis under hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia is an important physiological stress causing nerve injuries and several brain diseases. However, the mechanism of brain response to hypoxia remains unclear, thus limiting the development of interventional strategies. This study conducted combined analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing and extracellular vesicle transcriptome sequencing on hypoxic mouse brains, described cell–cell communication in the brain under hypoxia from intercellular and extracellular dimensions, confirmed that hemoglobin mRNA was transferred from non-neuronal cells to neurons, and eventually expressed. Then we further explored the role of exosomal hemoglobin transfer in vitro, using human-derived cell lines, and clarified that hypoxia promoted the transfer and expression of exosomal hemoglobin between endothelial cells and neurons. We found the vital function of exosomal hemoglobin to protect against neurological injury by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. In conclusion, this study identified a novel mechanism of ‘mutual aid’ in hypoxia responses in the brain, involving exosomal hemoglobin transfer, clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the process of brain stress response, and provided a novel interventional perspective for hypoxia-related brain diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104475">Cognitive control of behavior and hippocampal information processing without medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control tasks require using one class of information while ignoring competing classes of information. The central role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in cognitive control is well established in the primate literature and largely accepted in the rodent literature because mPFC damage causes deficits in tasks that may require cognitive control, as inferred, typically from the task design. In prior work, we used an active place avoidance task where a rat or mouse on a rotating arena is required to avoid the stationary task-relevant locations of a mild shock and ignore the rotating task-irrelevant locations of those shocks. The task is impaired by hippocampal manipulations, and the discharge of hippocampal place cell populations judiciously alternates between representing stationary locations near the shock zone and rotating locations far from the shock zone, demonstrating cognitive control concurrently in behavior and the hippocampal representation of spatial information. Here, we test whether rat mPFC lesion impairs the active place avoidance task to evaluate two competing hypotheses, a ‘central-computation’ hypothesis that the mPFC is essential for the computations required for cognitive control and an alternative ‘local-computation’ hypothesis that other brain areas can perform the computations required for cognitive control, independent of mPFC. Ibotenic acid lesion of the mPFC was effective, damaging the cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices. The lesion also altered the normal coordination of metabolic activity across remaining structures. The lesion did not impair learning to avoid the initial location of shock or long-term place avoidance memory, but impaired avoidance after the shock was relocated. The lesion also did not impair the alternation between task-relevant and task-irrelevant hippocampal representations of place information. These findings support the local-computation hypothesis that computations required for cognitive control can occur locally in brain networks independently of the mPFC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103403">PDZ-directed substrate recruitment is the primary determinant of specific 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation by PP1-Neurabin</a></h4>

              
                Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1) relies on association with PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs) to generate substrate-specific PIP/PP1 holoenzymes, but the lack of well-defined substrates has hindered elucidation of the mechanisms involved. We previously demonstrated that the Phactr1 PIP confers sequence specificity on the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. Phactr1 defines a group of ‘RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W’ PIPs that all interact with PP1 in a similar fashion. Here, we use a PP1-PIP fusion approach to address sequence specificity and identify substrates of the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W family PIPs. We show that the four Phactr proteins confer identical sequence specificities on their holoenzymes. We identify the 4E-BP and p70 S6K translational regulators as substrates for the Neurabin/Spinophilin PIPs, implicated in neuronal plasticity, pointing to a role for their holoenzymes in mTORC1-dependent translational control. Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove. Thus, even PIPs that interact with PP1 in a similar manner use different mechanisms to ensure substrate selectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100666">The geometry and dimensionality of brain-wide activity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural activity organization is vital for deciphering brain function. By recording whole-brain calcium activity in larval zebrafish during hunting and spontaneous behaviors, we find that the shape of the neural activity space, described by the neural covariance spectrum, is scale-invariant: a smaller, <i>randomly sampled</i> cell assembly resembles the entire brain. This phenomenon can be explained by Euclidean Random Matrix theory, where neurons are reorganized from anatomical to functional positions based on their correlations. Three factors contribute to the observed scale invariance: slow neural correlation decay, higher functional space dimension, and neural activity heterogeneity. In addition to matching data from zebrafish and mice, our theory and analysis demonstrate how the geometry of neural activity space evolves with population sizes and sampling methods, thus revealing an organizing principle of brain-wide activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104609">Synaptic connectivity of sensorimotor circuits for vocal imitation in the songbird</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here, we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the three known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVC’s presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101760">Regulative synthesis of capsular polysaccharides in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Streptococcus suis</i> (<i>S. suis</i>) is an important zoonotic pathogen causing substantial economic losses in the swine industry. <i>S. suis</i> serotype 2 (SS2) is often isolated from the diseased. <i>S. suis</i> expresses capsular polysaccharide (CPS), a virulence factor crucial for their survival in the blood. However, the role of CPS in the pathogenesis of <i>S. suis</i> is incomplete. Here, we showed that thin CPS or no CPS was associated with efficient binding of an SS2 strain, 05ZYH33, to respiratory epithelial cells, while thick CPS increased resistance of 05ZYH33 to blood clearance. In a mouse infection model, 05ZYH33 was detected in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as early as 30 min after intranasal inoculation without bacteremia. Histological analysis revealed that 05ZYH33 in the nasal cavity invaded the olfactory epithelium, resulting in early brain inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy showed that 05ZYH33 isolated from NALT and CSF at early infection time had a thin layer of CPS, and those detected in the blood 5 hr post-inoculation showed a much thicker CPS. In addition, adoptive transfer of anti-CPS restricted 05ZYH33 in the blood but not in NALT or CSF. However, an antiserum directed to multiple non-CPS virulence factors (anti-V5) efficiently inhibited 05ZYH33 in NALT, CSF, and blood. Thus, 05ZYH33 colonizes NALT more efficiently without CPS and subsequently invades the meninges through the olfactory nerve system. These findings provide valuable information for the treatment of <i>S. suis</i> infection and the development of vaccines across serotypes of <i>S. suis</i> by targeting CPS-independent immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99478">A direct neural signature of serial dependence in working memory</a></h4>

              
                Serial dependence describes the phenomenon that current object representations are attracted to previously encoded and reported representations. While attractive biases have been observed reliably in behavior, a direct neural correlate has not been established. Previous studies have either shown a reactivation of past information without observing a neural signal related to the bias of the current information, or a repulsive distortion of current neural representations contrasting the behavioral bias. The present study recorded neural signals with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a working memory task to identify neural correlates of serial dependence. Participants encoded and memorized two sequentially presented motion directions per trial, one of which was later retro-cued for report. Multivariate analyses provided reliable reconstructions of both motion directions. Importantly, the reconstructed directions in the current trial were attractively shifted toward the target direction of the previous trial. This neural bias mirrored the behavioral attractive bias, thus reflecting a direct neural signature of serial dependence. The use of a retro-cue task in combination with MEG allowed us to determine that this neural bias emerged at later, post-encoding time points. This timing suggests that serial dependence in working memory affects memorized information during read-out and reactivation processes that happen after the initial encoding.

">Fundamental Sex Differences in Cocaine-Induced Plasticity of D1R- and D2R-MSNs in the Mouse Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that cocaine-induced changes in nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) differ based on dopamine receptor subtype expression, the sex of the animal, and for females, phase of the estrous cycle. These findings highlight the need to account for both sex and estrous cycle when studying drug-mediated alterations in neurophysiology. Whether MSNs of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), which serve different aspects of addiction, will exhibit similar sex and estrous cycle effects with cocaine administration was investigated. METHODS: Mice underwent a 5-day locomotor sensitization paradigm via daily cocaine administration (15 mg/kg, s.c.) followed by a 1- to 4-day drug-free abstinence period. We examined NAcC MSN excitability by obtaining ex vivo whole-cell recordings from differentially labeled dopamine D1-receptor expressing MSNs (D1R-MSNs) and dopamine D2-receptor expressing MSNs (D2R-MSNs) obtained from male mice or female mice that were either in estrus or diestrus. RESULTS: In this genetic background of mice, both male and female mice sensitized to cocaine in a similar manner. In males, there were no cocaine-induced changes in D1R-MSN or D2R-MSN excitability, with D2R-MSNs exhibiting greater excitability. In saline-treated females, D1R-MSN excitability fluctuated across the estrous cycle with increased excitability during estrus. Following cocaine, estrous cycle-dependent D1R-MSN excitability was arrested, fixed at an intermediate value between estrus and diestrus when compared to saline controls. D2R-MSNs did not change either across the estrous cycle or following cocaine. When comparing MSN subtypes, in diestrus, D2R-MSNs were more excitable under saline conditions, but indistinguishable from D1R-MSNs following cocaine. In contrast, during estrus, D1R- and D2R-MSN excitability was similar in saline treated animals, but with cocaine, D2R-MSNs displayed heightened excitability. CONCLUSIONS: There are fundamental sex differences in cocaine-induced changes to the excitability of D1R-MSNs in the NAcC. After cocaine exposure, female mice in diestrus exhibited a significant main effect change in MSN excitability, an inversion of what had previously been demonstrated in the NAcSh where no cocaine-induced changes were observed. These data suggest that there are distinct differences in the neuropharmacological effect of cocaine in males versus females that are shell and core specific.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>One of the hallmark features of neocortical anatomy is the presence of extensive top-down projections into primary sensory areas. It is hypothesized that one of the roles of these top-down projections is to carry contextual information that helps animals to resolve ambiguities in sensory data. One proposed mechanism of contextual integration is a combination of input streams at distinct apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Computationally, however, it is yet to be demonstrated how such an architecture could leverage distinct compartments for flexible contextual integration and sensory processing. Here, we implement a deep neural network with distinct apical and basal compartments that integrates (a) contextual information from top-down projections to apical compartments and (b) sensory representations driven by bottom-up projections to basal compartments. In addition, we develop a new contextual integration task using generative modeling. The performance of deep neural networks augmented with our “apical prior” exceeds that of single-compartment networks. We find that a sparse subset of neurons of the context-relevant categories receive the largest top-down signals. We further show that this sparse gain modulation is necessary. Altogether, this suggests that the “apical prior” could be key for handling the ambiguities that animals encounter in the real world.</span>

Data were retrieved from the Web of Science database, encompassing 5,020 publications focusing on AI in clinical neurology and neuroimaging. Among these, 2,687 were original research articles, predominantly published in English, with an average of 19.44 citations per article and an H-index of 90. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in publication activity, particularly after 2019, with the annual count peaking at 607 articles in 2024. The United States and China emerged as the leading contributors, and a strong positive correlation was found between publication productivity and both gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP purchasing power parity. However, no significant relationship was observed with the Human Development Index. Key research areas include radiology, psychiatry, and surgery, with machine learning and deep learning dominating the field. Regression models predict continued growth in AI-related research, underscoring its expanding role in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and high-impact journals in shaping the future of AI applications in clinical neurology and neuroimaging.</span>

Moreover, genetic and common environmental factors influencing regional homogeneity and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values at wave 1 (9 to 14 yr) also influenced values at wave 2 (10 to 16 yr) for many regions. However, the influence of genetic and common environmental factors varied across the cortex, exhibiting different patterns in different regions. Furthermore, we found new (ie independent) genetic and environmental influences on brain activity at wave 2, again with regional patterns. Exploratory analyses found weak associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms and local brain function in several regions of the temporal lobe.

The condition involves impaired inhibitory control, and whether music therapy can be effective against it is unclear. Here we analyzed various pathophysiological markers of impaired inhibitory control and identified some that improved after music therapy. We assessed cognitive function in 41 patients with SHE in the Go/NoGo task and electroencephalographic activity before and after a single exposure to Mozart’s K. 448. The same assessments were performed in two types of controls, 41 patients with nocturnal epilepsy and 40 healthy individuals. SHE showed significantly longer reaction time, lower accuracy, later onset of theta bursts in the mid-frontal region. Severity of them correlated positively with reaction time. During music exposure, theta activity synchronized with the rhythm. Music significantly shortened reaction time and increased accuracy in patients with SHE, while also shortening the interval until the onset of theta bursts. Our results suggest that SHE involves frontal network damage affecting inhibitory control, and that music therapy can mitigate this damage by facilitating onset of theta bursts. It also indicates that theta bursts may be useful for assessing therapeutic efficacy and for exploring ways to mitigate cognitive deficits in epilepsy patients with frontal network deficits.</span>

Growing evidence suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying such decisions may vary according to interpersonal relationship types. However, the specific modulatory effects of romantic love on vicarious risk assessment and outcome evaluation during dynamic decision-making remain unclear. Against this background, we employed a computerized gambling task combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neurophysiological correlates of romantic love's influence on vicarious decision processes in romantically involved young adults (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 40) while also investigating comparative effects of maternal love. Our results showed relationship-specific risk cues and outcome processing patterns during vicarious decision-making. In detail, we found enhanced N100 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for romantic partner at the cue phase but increased P300 amplitudes to wins and attenuated LPP amplitudes to losses for mother at the feedback phase. Additionally, oscillatory analysis revealed reduced alpha band oscillation for self versus strangers and attenuated theta band oscillation for partners relative to mothers during low-risk conditions. Together, these findings demonstrate that vicarious risk and outcome processing are fundamentally shaped by interpersonal relationships, with romantic partners and mothers eliciting qualitatively distinct neural response patterns in romantically involved individuals.</span>

                <p>Dmrta2 (also designated Dmrt5) is a transcriptional regulator expressed in cortical progenitors in a caudomedial<sup>high</sup>/rostrolateral<sup>low</sup> gradient with important roles at different steps of cortical development. Dmrta2 has been suggested to act in cortex development mainly by differential suppression of <I>Pax6</I> and other homeobox transcription factors such as the ventral telencephalic regulator <I>Gsx2</I>, which remains to be fully demonstrated. Here we have addressed the epistatic relation between Pax6 and Dmrta2 by comparing phenotypes in mutant embryos or embryos overexpressing both genes in various allelic combinations. We show that Dmrta2 cooperates with Pax6 in the maintenance of cortical identity in dorsal telencephalic progenitors and that it acts as a transcriptional repressor of <I>Pax6</I> to control cortical patterning. Mechanistically, we show that in P19 cells, Dmrta2 acts as a DNA binding-dependent repressor on the <I>Pax6 E60</I> enhancer and that a point mutation that affects its DNA binding properties identified in a consanguineous family leads to agenesis of the corpus callosum, pachygyria, and the absence of the cingulate gyrus. Finally, we provide evidence that Dmrta2 binds components of the NuRD repressor complex and interacts with zinc finger proteins such as Zfp423. Together, our results highlight the importance and conserved function of Dmrta2 in cortical development and provide novel insights into its mechanism of action.</p>

                Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common oral cancers with a high mortality rate. The biodiversity source in Indonesia makes areca nut a potential antioxidant in treating disease. Objective The study aimed to evaluate the effect of areca nut extract on 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)-tumor-induced rats. Methods Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 served as the control group, group 2 was 4NQO-induced rats without treatment, and groups 3 and 4 were given 4NQO-tumor inducer with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract, respectively. The rats in groups 2,3, and 4 received 30 ppm of 4NQO tumor inducer in drinking water for 12 weeks. In the end, all rats were euthanized, and the tongue was removed. The body, liver, kidney, heart, and lung weights were measured. Tongue tumor volume and dysplasia lesions were analyzed. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stromal areas were scored semi-quantitatively associating the infiltrate grade (0-3) and analyzed histologically. Results There were significant differences in body weight loss between the initial and final phases in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The areca nut at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the tumor size compared with groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The incidence of OSCC in rats with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract after 22 weeks was 0%, but the dysplasia lesions were observed at 28.57% and 85.71%, respectively. The highest mean of stromal TILs was in group 3 and there were significant differences in stromal TILs between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Conclusion Areca nut extract induced infiltrating lymphocytes in the stromal tumor area on the OSCC lesion of the tongue in 4NQO-induced rats.

                Background: After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it spread to 213 countries in 2020. In Indonesia there were 6,812,127 cases, which ranked 20th worldwide in the year 2024. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19 with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods This was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior to agreeing or declining to voluntarily participate in the questionnaire-based study. A total of 1,153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death (aOR: 2.502; 95% CI: 1.601-3.912) was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years (aOR: 0.486; 95% CI: 0.254-0.932) were 49% less likely to consistently use masks. Knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours (aOR: 1.697; 95% CI: 1.118-2.576); the transmission (aOR: 1.974; 95%CI: 1.040-3.746), knowledge of severe symptoms of COVID-19 (aOR: 1.981; 95%CI: 1.175-3.342); and awareness of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR (aOR: 2.238; 95%CI: 1.215-4.120) were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of COVID-19 as potentially fatal and knowledge regarding proper mask-changing intervals, the transmission, severe symptoms, and PCR-based diagnosis were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. However, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years were less likely to wear mask consistently. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures.

                <p>by Ryan J. Rowekamp, Tatyana O. Sharpee</p>

Biological visual systems are celebrated for their ability to reliably and precisely recognize objects. However, the specific neural mechanisms responsible for this capability remain largely elusive. In this study, we investigate neural responses in the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain to natural stimuli using a framework that includes quadratic computations in order to capture local recurrent interactions, both excitatory and suppressive. We find that these quadratic computations and specific coordination between their elements strongly increase both the predictive power of the model and the neural selectivity to natural stimuli. Particularly important were (i) coordination between excitatory and suppressive features to represent mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions in area V4, (ii) balance in the contribution of excitatory and suppressive components and its maintenance at similar levels across stages of processing, and (iii) refinement of feature selectivity between stages, with earlier stages representing broader category of inputs. Overall, this work describes how the brain could use multiple nonlinear mechanisms to increase selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003179">Two distinct subpopulations of human stem-like memory T cells exhibit complementary roles in self-renewal and clonal longevity</a></h4>

T stem cell-like memory cells (T<sub>SCM</sub> cells) are considered to be essential for the maintenance of immune memory. The T<sub>SCM</sub> population has been shown to have the key properties of a stem cell population: multipotency, self-renewal and clonal longevity. Here we show that no single population has all these stem cell properties, instead the properties are distributed. We show that the human T<sub>SCM</sub> population consists of two distinct cell subpopulations which can be distinguished by the level of their CD95 expression (CD95int and CD95hi). Crucially, using long-term <i>in vivo</i> labelling of human volunteers, we establish that these are distinct populations rather than transient states of the same population. These two subpopulations have different functional profiles <i>ex vivo</i>, different transcriptional patterns, and different tissue distributions. They also have significantly different TREC content indicating different division histories and we find that the frequency of CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> increases with age. Most importantly, CD95hi and CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> cells also have very different dynamics <i>in vivo</i> with CD95hi cells showing considerably higher proliferation but significantly reduced clonal longevity compared with CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub>. While both T<sub>SCM</sub> subpopulations exhibit considerable multipotency, no single population of T<sub>SCM</sub> cells has both the properties of self-renewal and clonal longevity. Instead, the “stemness” of the T<sub>SCM</sub> population is generated by the complementary dynamic properties of the two subpopulations: CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the property of clonal longevity and CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the properties of expansion and self-renewal. We suggest that together, these two populations function as a stem cell population.
