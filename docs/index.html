              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">China’s economic connectivity to the world economy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The ambition of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to revive the silk road of Roman times which was used by merchants to carry trade across Eurasia. China’s proclaimed aspiration is to reconnect to the world through its ancient trade corridors, and to emphasize its role as a world trade power. Should the BRI or “new silk road” be understood as efforts from President Xi Jinping to project China’s power into both Eurasia and at the global level? Should it moreover be understood as China’s step forward to fill the leadership vacuum left by a perceived weakening USA in terms of international relations? The present economic climate is characterised by uncertainty and turbulence at the global level, with some economies shifting towards protectionist practices, and others, such as the United Kingdom, trying to regain some international recognition outside the EU. This turbulent climate appears to benefit Beijing who can position itself as a new leader in the global political economy, notably through its BRI. The article discusses the issues raised by China’s ambition to shape  the current international economic order.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KIFC1 Regulates the Trajectory of Neuronal Migration</a></h4>

              
                <p>During neuronal migration, forces generated by cytoplasmic dynein yank on microtubules extending from the centrosome into the leading process and move the nucleus along microtubules that extend behind the centrosome. Scaffolds, such as radial glia, guide neuronal migration outward from the ventricles, but little is known about the internal machinery that ensures that the soma migrates along its proper path rather than moving backward or off the path. Here we report that depletion of KIFC1, a minus-end-directed kinesin called HSET in humans, causes neurons to migrate off their appropriate path, suggesting that this molecular motor is what ensures fidelity of the trajectory of migration. For these studies, we used rat migratory neurons <I>in vitro</I> and developing mouse brain <I>in vivo</I>, together with RNA interference and ectopic expression of mutant forms of KIFC1. We found that crosslinking of microtubules into a nonsliding mode by KIFC1 is necessary for dynein-driven forces to achieve sufficient traction to thrust the soma forward. Asymmetric bouts of microtubule sliding driven by KIFC1 thereby enable the soma to tilt in one direction or another, thus providing midcourse corrections that keep the neuron on its appropriate trajectory. KIFC1-driven sliding of microtubules further assists neurons in remaining on their appropriate path by allowing the nucleus to rotate directionally as it moves, which is consistent with how we found that KIFC1 contributes to interkinetic nuclear migration at an earlier stage of neuronal development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Resolving the mechanisms of neuronal migration is medically important because many developmental disorders of the brain involve flaws in neuronal migration and because deployment of newly born neurons may be important in the adult for cognition and memory. Drugs that inhibit KIFC1 are candidates for chemotherapy and therefore should be used with caution if they are allowed to enter the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Lasting, Pathway-Specific Impairment of a Novel Form of Spike-Timing-Dependent Long-Term Depression by Neuropathic Pain in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Malfunctioning synaptic plasticity is one of the major mechanisms contributing to the development of chronic pain. We studied spike-timing dependent depression (tLTD) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of male mice, a brain region involved in processing emotional aspects of pain. tLTD onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons depended on postsynaptic calcium-influx through GluN2B-containing NMDARs and retrograde signaling via nitric oxide to reduce presynaptic release probability. After chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, a model for neuropathic pain, tLTD was rapidly impaired; and this phenotype persisted even beyond the time of recovery from mechanical sensitization. Exclusion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs from the postsynaptic site specifically at projections from the anterior thalamus to the ACC caused the tLTD phenotype, whereas signaling downstream of nitric oxide synthesis remained intact. Thus, transient neuropathic pain can leave a permanent trace manifested in the disturbance of synaptic plasticity in a specific afferent pathway to the cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic plasticity is one of the main mechanisms that contributes to the development of chronic pain. Most studies have focused on potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission, but very little is known about the reduction in synaptic strength. We have focused on the ACC, a brain region associated with the processing of emotional and affective components of pain. We studied spike-timing dependent LTD, which is a biologically plausible form of synaptic plasticity, that depends on the relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. We found a long-lasting and pathway-specific suppression of the induction mechanism for spike-timing dependent LTD from the anterior thalamus to the ACC, suggesting that this pathology might be involved in altered emotional processing in pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reproducibility of the Rod Photoreceptor Response Depends Critically on the Concentration of the Phosphodiesterase Effector Enzyme</a></h4>

              
                <p>The high sensitivity of night vision requires that rod photoreceptors reliably and reproducibly signal the absorption of single photons, a process that depends on tight regulation of intracellular cGMP concentration through the phototransduction cascade. Here in the mouse (Mus musculus), we studied a single-site <I>D167A</I> mutation of the gene for the &alpha; subunit of rod photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDEA), made with the aim of removing a noncatalytic binding site for cGMP. This mutation unexpectedly eliminated nearly all PDEA expression and reduced expression of the &beta; subunit (PDEB) to ~5%-10% of WT. The remaining PDE had nearly normal specific activity; degeneration was slow, with 50%-60% of rods remaining after 6 months. Responses were larger and more sensitive than normal but slower in rise and decay, probably from slower dark turnover of cGMP. Remarkably, responses became much less reproducible than WT, with response variance increasing for amplitude by over 10-fold, and for latency and time-to-peak by &gt;100-fold. We hypothesize that the increase in variance is the result of greater variability in the dark-resting concentration of cGMP, produced by spatial and temporal nonuniformity in spontaneous PDE activity. This variability decreased as stimuli were made brighter, presumably because of greater spatial uniformity of phototransduction and the approach to saturation. We conclude that the constancy of the rod response depends critically on PDE expression to maintain adequate spontaneous PDE activity, so that the concentration of second messenger is relatively uniform throughout the outer segment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rod photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina reliably signal the absorption of single photons of light by generating responses that are remarkably reproducible in amplitude and waveform. We show that this reproducibility depends critically on the concentration of the effector enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which metabolizes the second messenger cGMP and generates rod light responses. In rods with the <I>D167A</I> mutation of the &alpha; subunit of PDE, only 5%-10% of PDE is expressed. Single-photon responses then become much more variable than in WT rods. We think this variability is caused by spatial and temporal inhomogeneity in the concentration of cGMP in darkness, so that photons absorbed in different parts of the cell produce responses of greatly varying amplitude and waveform.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase K (Inpp5k) Enhances Sprouting of Corticospinal Tract Axons after CNS Trauma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Failure of CNS neurons to mount a significant growth response after trauma contributes to chronic functional deficits after spinal cord injury. Activator and repressor screening of embryonic cortical neurons and retinal ganglion cells <I>in vitro</I> and transcriptional profiling of developing CNS neurons harvested <I>in vivo</I> have identified several candidates that stimulate robust axon growth <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Building on these studies, we sought to identify novel axon growth activators induced in the complex adult CNS environment <I>in vivo</I>. We transcriptionally profiled intact sprouting adult corticospinal neurons (CSNs) after contralateral pyramidotomy (PyX) in nogo receptor-1 knock-out mice and found that intact CSNs were enriched in genes in the 3-phosphoinositide degradation pathway, including six 5-phosphatases. We explored whether inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase K (<I>Inpp5k</I>) could enhance corticospinal tract (CST) axon growth in preclinical models of acute and chronic CNS trauma. Overexpression of <I>Inpp5k</I> in intact adult CSNs in male and female mice enhanced the sprouting of intact CST terminals after PyX and cortical stroke and sprouting of CST axons after acute and chronic severe thoracic spinal contusion. We show that <I>Inpp5k</I> stimulates axon growth in part by elevating the density of active cofilin in labile growth cones, thus stimulating actin polymerization and enhancing microtubule protrusion into distal filopodia. We identify <I>Inpp5k</I> as a novel CST growth activator capable of driving compensatory axon growth in multiple complex CNS injury environments and underscores the veracity of using <I>in vivo</I> transcriptional screening to identify the next generation of cell-autonomous factors capable of repairing the damaged CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurologic recovery is limited after spinal cord injury as CNS neurons are incapable of self-repair post-trauma. <I>In vitro</I> screening strategies exploit the intrinsically high growth capacity of embryonic CNS neurons to identify novel axon growth activators. While promising candidates have been shown to stimulate axon growth <I>in vivo</I>, concomitant functional recovery remains incomplete. We identified <I>Inpp5k</I> as a novel axon growth activator using transcriptional profiling of intact adult corticospinal tract (CST) neurons that had initiated a growth response after pyramidotomy in plasticity sensitized nogo receptor-1-null mice. Here, we show that <I>Inpp5k</I> overexpression can stimulate CST axon growth after pyramidotomy, stroke, and acute and chronic contusion injuries. These data support <I>in vivo</I> screening approaches to identify novel axon growth activators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Sensory and Motor Components of the Cortical Hierarchy Are Coupled to the Rhythm of the Stomach during Rest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bodily rhythms appear as novel scaffolding mechanisms orchestrating the spatiotemporal organization of spontaneous brain activity. Here, we follow-up on the discovery of the gastric resting-state network (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B65">Rebollo et al., 2018</cross-ref>), composed of brain regions in which the fMRI signal is phase-synchronized to the slow (0.05 Hz) electrical rhythm of the stomach. Using a larger sample size (<I>n</I> = 63 human participants, both genders), we further characterize the anatomy and effect sizes of gastric-brain coupling across resting-state networks, a fine grained cortical parcellation, as well as along the main gradients of cortical organization. Most (67%) of the gastric network is included in the somato-motor-auditory (38%) and visual (29%) resting state networks (RSNs). Gastric brain coupling also occurs in the granular insula and, to a lesser extent, in the piriform cortex. Thus, all sensory and motor cortices corresponding to both exteroceptive and interoceptive modalities are coupled to the gastric rhythm during rest. Conversely, little gastric-brain coupling occurs in cognitive networks and transmodal regions. These results suggest not only that gastric rhythm and sensory-motor processes are likely to interact, but also that gastric-brain coupling might be a mechanism of sensory and motor integration that mostly bypasses cognition, complementing the classical hierarchical organization of the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While there is growing interest for brain-body communication in general and brain-viscera communication in particular, little is known about how the brain interacts with the gastric rhythm, the slow electrical rhythm continuously produced in the stomach. Here, we show in human participants at rest that the gastric network, composed of brain regions synchronized with delays to the gastric rhythm, includes all motor and sensory (vision, audition, touch and interoception, olfaction) regions, but only few of the transmodal regions associated with higher-level cognition. Such results prompt for a reconsideration of the classical view of cortical organization, where the different sensory modalities are considered as relatively independent modules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Range Amplitude Coupling Is Optimized for Brain Networks That Function at Criticality</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain function depends on segregation and integration of information processing in brain networks often separated by long-range anatomic connections. Neuronal oscillations orchestrate such distributed processing through transient amplitude and phase coupling, yet surprisingly, little is known about local network properties facilitating these functional connections. Here, we test whether criticality, a dynamical state characterized by scale-free oscillations, optimizes the capacity of neuronal networks to couple through amplitude or phase, and transfer information. We coupled <I>in silico</I> networks which exhibit oscillations in the &alpha; band (8&ndash;16 Hz), and varied excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. We found that phase coupling of oscillations emerges at criticality, and that amplitude coupling, as well as information transfer, are maximal when networks are critical. Importantly, regulating criticality through modulation of synaptic gain showed that critical dynamics, as opposed to a static ratio of excitatory and inhibitory connections, optimize network coupling and information transfer. Our data support the idea that criticality is important for local and global information processing and may help explain why brain disorders characterized by local alterations in criticality also exhibit impaired long-range synchrony, even before degeneration of axonal connections.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To perform adaptively in a changing environment, our brains dynamically coordinate activity across distant areas. Empirical evidence suggests that long-range amplitude and phase coupling of oscillations are systems-level mechanisms enabling transient formation of spatially distributed functional networks on the backbone of a relatively static structural connectome. However, surprisingly little is known about the local network properties that optimize coupling and information transfer. Here, we show that criticality, a dynamical state characterized by scale-free oscillations and a hallmark of neuronal network activity, optimizes the capacity of neuronal networks to couple through amplitude or phase and transfer information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Bidirectional Communication between the Pontine Nucleus Incertus and the Medial Septum Is Carried Out by Electrophysiologically-Distinct Neuronal Populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Theta oscillations are key brain rhythm involved in memory formation, sensorimotor integration, and control of locomotion and behavioral states. Generation and spatiotemporal synchronization of theta oscillations rely on interactions between brain nuclei forming a large neural network, which includes pontine nucleus incertus (NI). Here we identified distinct populations of NI neurons, based on the relationship of their firing to hippocampal waves, with a special focus on theta oscillations, and the direction and type of interaction with the medial septum (MS) in male, urethane-anesthetized rats. By recording NI neuronal firing and hippocampal LFP, we described NI neurons that fire action potentials in a theta phase-independent or theta phase-locked and delta wave-independent or delta wave-locked manner. Among hippocampal activity-independent NI neurons, irregular, slow-firing, and regular, fast-firing cells were observed, while hippocampal oscillation-/wave-locked NI neurons were of a bursting or nonbursting type. By projection-specific optotagging, we revealed that only fast-firing theta phase-independent NI neurons innervate the MS, rarely receiving feedback information. In contrast, the majority of theta-bursting NI neurons were inhibited by MS stimulation, and this effect was mediated by direct GABAergic input. Described NI neuronal populations differ in reciprocal connections with the septohippocampal system, plausibly forming separate neuronal loops. Our results suggest that theta phase-independent NI neurons participate in theta rhythm generation through direct innervation of the MS, while theta-bursting NI neurons further transmit the rhythmic signal received from the MS to stabilize and/or strengthen rhythmic activity in other structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The generation and spatiotemporal synchronization of theta oscillations rely on interactions between nuclei forming a large neural network, part of which is the pontine nucleus incertus (NI). Here we describe that within NI there are populations of neurons that can be distinguished based on the relationship of their firing to hippocampal theta oscillations and delta waves. We show that these neuronal populations largely do not have reciprocal connections with the septohippocampal system, but form separate neuronal loops. Our results suggest that medial septum (MS)-projecting, fast-firing, theta phase-independent NI neurons may participate in theta rhythm generation through direct innervation of the MS, while theta-bursting NI neurons may further transmit the rhythmic signal received from the MS to other structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Peristimulus Time Responses Predict Adaptation and Spontaneous Firing of Auditory-Nerve Fibers: From Rodents Data to Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sound-level coding in the auditory nerve is achieved through the progressive recruitment of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) that differ in threshold of activation and in the stimulus level at which the spike rate saturates. To investigate the functional state of the ANFs, the electrophysiological tests routinely used in clinics only capture the first action potentials firing in synchrony at the onset of the acoustic stimulation. Assessment of other properties (e.g., spontaneous rate and adaptation time constants) requires single-fiber recordings directly from the nerve, which for ethical reasons is not allowed in humans. By combining neuronal activity measurements at the round window and signal-processing algorithms, we constructed a peristimulus time response (PSTR), with a waveform similar to the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) derived from single-fiber recordings in young adult female gerbils. Simultaneous recordings of round-window PSTR and single-fiber PSTH provided models to predict the adaptation kinetics and spontaneous rate of the ANFs tuned at the PSTR probe frequency. The predictive model derived from gerbils was then validated in female mice and finally applied to humans by recording PSTRs from the auditory nerve in normal-hearing patients who underwent cerebellopontine angle surgeries. A rapid adaptation time constant of ~3 ms and a mean spontaneous rate of ~22 spikes/s in the 4 kHz frequency range were found. This study offers a promising diagnostic tool to map the human auditory nerve, thus opening new avenues to better understanding auditory neuropathies, tinnitus, and hyperacusis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural adaptation in auditory nerve fibers corresponds to the reduction in the neuronal activity to prolonged or repeated sound stimulation. For obvious ethical reasons, single-fiber recordings from the auditory nerve are not feasible in humans, creating a critical gap in extending data obtained using animal models to humans. Using electrocochleography in rodents, we inferred adaptation kinetics and spontaneous discharge rates of the auditory nerve fibers in humans. Routinely used in basic and clinical laboratories, this tool will provide a better understanding of auditory disorders such as neuropathies, tinnitus, and hyperacusis, and will help to improve hearing-aid fittings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Delta Oscillations Coordinate Intracerebellar and Cerebello-Hippocampal Network Dynamics during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>During sleep, the widespread coordination of neuronal oscillations across both cortical and subcortical brain regions is thought to support various physiological functions. However, how sleep-related activity within the brain's largest sensorimotor structure, the cerebellum, is multiplexed with well-described sleep-related mechanisms in regions such as the hippocampus remains unknown. We therefore simultaneously recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and three distinct regions of the cerebellum (Crus I, lobule VI, and lobules II/III) in male mice during natural sleep. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations were found to be coordinated between these structures in a sleep stage-specific manner. During non-REM sleep, prominent  frequency coherence was observed between lobule VI and hippocampus, whereas non-REM-associated hippocampal sharp-wave ripple activity evoked discrete LFP modulation in all recorded cerebellar regions, with the shortest latency effects in lobule VI. We also describe discrete phasic sharp potentials (PSPs), which synchronize across cerebellar regions and trigger sharp-wave ripple suppression. During REM, cerebellar  phase significantly modulated hippocampal theta frequency, and this effect was greatest when PSPs were abundant. PSPs were phase-locked to cerebellar  oscillation peak and hippocampal theta oscillation trough, respectively. Within all three cerebellar regions, prominent LFP oscillations were observed at both low (, &lt;4 Hz) and very high frequencies (~250 Hz) during non-REM and REM sleep. Intracerebellar cross-frequency analysis revealed that  oscillations modulate those in the very high-frequency range. Together, these results reveal multiple candidate physiological mechanisms to support "offline," bidirectional interaction within distributed cerebello-hippocampal networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep is associated with widespread coordination of activity across a range of brain regions. However, little is known about how activity within the largest sensorimotor region of the brain, the cerebellum, is both intrinsically organized and links with higher-order structures, such as the hippocampus, during sleep. By making multisite local field potential recordings in naturally sleeping mice, we reveal and characterize multiple sleep stage-specific physiological mechanisms linking three distinct cerebellar regions with the hippocampus. Central to these physiological mechanisms is a prominent  (&lt;4 Hz) oscillation, which temporally coordinates both intracerebellar and cerebello-hippocampal network dynamics. Understanding this distributed network activity is important for gaining insight into cerebellar contributions to sleep-dependent processes, such as memory consolidation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Directional Tuning of Phase Precession Properties in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Running direction in the hippocampus is encoded by rate modulations of place field activity but also by spike timing correlations known as theta sequences. Whether directional rate codes and the directionality of place field correlations are related, however, has so far not been explored, and therefore the nature of how directional information is encoded in the cornu ammonis remains unresolved. Here, using a previously published dataset that contains the spike activity of rat hippocampal place cells in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions during free foraging of male Long-Evans rats in a 2D environment, we found that rate and spike timing codes are related. Opposite to a preferred firing rate direction of a place field, spikes are more likely to undergo theta phase precession and, hence, more strongly affect paired correlations. Furthermore, we identified a subset of field pairs whose theta correlations are intrinsic in that they maintain the same firing order when the running direction is reversed. Both effects are associated with differences in theta phase distributions and are more prominent in CA3 than in CA1. We thus hypothesize that intrinsic spiking is most prominent when the directionally modulated sensory-motor drive of hippocampal firing rates is minimal, suggesting that extrinsic and intrinsic sequences contribute to phase precession as two distinct mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal theta sequences, on the one hand, are thought to reflect the running trajectory of an animal, connecting past and future locations. On the other hand, sequences have been proposed to reflect the rich, recursive hippocampal connectivity, related to memories of previous trajectories or even to experience-independent prestructure. Such intrinsic sequences are inherently one dimensional and cannot be easily reconciled with running trajectories in two dimensions as place fields can be approached on multiple one-dimensional paths. In this article, we dissect phase precession along different directions in all hippocampal subareas and find that CA3 in particular shows a high level of direction-independent correlations that are inconsistent with the notion of representing running trajectories. These intrinsic correlations are associated with later spike phases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatosensory Evoked Potentials Reveal Reduced Embodiment of Emotions in Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consistent with current models of embodied emotions, this study investigates whether the somatosensory system shows reduced sensitivity to facial emotional expressions in autistic compared with neurotypical individuals, and whether these differences are independent from between-group differences in visual processing of facial stimuli. To investigate the dynamics of somatosensory activity over and above visual carryover effects, we recorded EEG activity from two groups of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or typically developing (TD) humans (male and female), while they were performing a facial emotion discrimination task and a control gender task. To probe the state of the somatosensory system during face processing, in 50% of trials we evoked somatosensory activity by delivering task-irrelevant tactile taps on participants' index finger, 105 ms after visual stimulus onset. Importantly, we isolated somatosensory from concurrent visual activity by subtracting visual responses from activity evoked by somatosensory and visual stimuli. Results revealed significant task-dependent group differences in mid-latency components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). ASD participants showed a selective reduction of SEP amplitudes (P100) compared with TD during emotion task; and TD, but not ASD, showed increased somatosensory responses during emotion compared with gender discrimination. Interestingly, autistic traits, but not alexithymia, significantly predicted SEP amplitudes evoked during emotion, but not gender, task. Importantly, we did not observe the same pattern of group differences in visual responses. Our study provides direct evidence of reduced recruitment of the somatosensory system during emotion discrimination in ASD and suggests that this effect is not a byproduct of differences in visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The somatosensory system is involved in embodiment of visually presented facial expressions of emotion. Despite autism being characterized by difficulties in emotion-related processing, no studies have addressed whether this extends to embodied representations of others' emotions. By dissociating somatosensory activity from visual evoked potentials, we provide the first evidence of reduced recruitment of the somatosensory system during emotion discrimination in autistic participants, independently from differences in visual processing between typically developing and autism spectrum disorder participants. Our study uses a novel methodology to reveal the neural dynamics underlying difficulties in emotion recognition in autism spectrum disorder and provides direct evidence that embodied simulation of others' emotional expressions operates differently in autistic individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Left Motor {delta} Oscillations Reflect Asynchrony Detection in Multisensory Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>During multisensory speech perception, slow  oscillations (~1&ndash;3 Hz) in the listener's brain synchronize with the speech signal, likely engaging in speech signal decomposition. Notable fluctuations in the speech amplitude envelope, resounding speaker prosody, temporally align with articulatory and body gestures and both provide complementary sensations that temporally structure speech. Further,  oscillations in the left motor cortex seem to align with speech and musical beats, suggesting their possible role in the temporal structuring of (quasi)-rhythmic stimulation. We extended the role of  oscillations to audiovisual asynchrony detection as a test case of the temporal analysis of multisensory prosody fluctuations in speech. We recorded Electroencephalograph (EEG) responses in an audiovisual asynchrony detection task while participants watched videos of a speaker. We filtered the speech signal to remove verbal content and examined how visual and auditory prosodic features temporally (mis-)align. Results confirm (1) that participants accurately detected audiovisual asynchrony, and (2) increased  power in the left motor cortex in response to audiovisual asynchrony. The difference of  power between asynchronous and synchronous conditions predicted behavioral performance, and (3) decreased -&beta; coupling in the left motor cortex when listeners could not accurately map visual and auditory prosodies. Finally, both behavioral and neurophysiological evidence was altered when a speaker's face was degraded by a visual mask. Together, these findings suggest that motor  oscillations support asynchrony detection of multisensory prosodic fluctuation in speech.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech perception is facilitated by regular prosodic fluctuations that temporally structure the auditory signal. Auditory speech processing involves the left motor cortex and associated  oscillations. However, visual prosody (i.e., a speaker's body movements) complements auditory prosody, and it is unclear how the brain temporally analyses different prosodic features in multisensory speech perception. We combined an audiovisual asynchrony detection task with electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how  oscillations support the temporal analysis of multisensory speech. Results confirmed that asynchrony detection of visual and auditory prosodies leads to increased  power in left motor cortex and correlates with performance. We conclude that  oscillations are invoked in an effort to resolve denoted temporal asynchrony in multisensory speech perception.</p>

                <p>It is well established that glutamate plays an important role in drug-induced and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. However, the role of glutamate in drug reward is unclear. In this study, we systemically evaluated the effects of multiple glutamate transporter (GLT) inhibitors on extracellular glutamate and dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), intravenous cocaine self-administration, intracranial brain-stimulation reward (BSR), and reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male and female rats. Among the five GLT inhibitors we tested, TFB-TBOA was the most potent. Microinjections of TFB-TBOA into the NAc, but not the ventral tegmental area (VTA), or dorsal striatum (DS), dose-dependently inhibited cocaine self-administration under fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio (PR) reinforcement schedules, shifted the cocaine dose&ndash;response curve downward, and inhibited intracranial BSR. Selective downregulation of astrocytic GLT-1 expression in the NAc by GLT-1 antisense oligonucleotides also inhibited cocaine self-administration. The reduction in cocaine self-administration following TFB-TBOA administration was NMDA GluN2B receptor dependent, and rats self-administering cocaine showed upregulation of GluN2B expression in NAc DA- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP-32)-positive medium-spiny neurons (MSNs). In contrast, TFB-TBOA, when locally administered into the NAc, VTA, or ventral pallidum (VP), dose-dependently reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior. Intra-NAc TFB-TBOA-evoked drug-seeking was long-lasting and NMDA/AMPA receptor dependent. These findings, for the first time, indicate that glutamate in the NAc negatively regulates cocaine's rewarding effects, while an excess of glutamate in multiple brain regions can trigger reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that glutamate plays an important role in relapse to drug seeking. However, the role of glutamate in drug reward is less clear. Here, we report that TFB-TBOA, a highly potent glutamate transporter (GLT) inhibitor, dose-dependently elevates extracellular glutamate and inhibits cocaine self-administration and brain-stimulation reward (BSR), when administered locally into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not other brain regions. Mechanistic assays indicate that cocaine self-administration upregulates NMDA-GluN2B receptor subtype expression in striatal dopaminoceptive neurons and activation of GluN2B by TFB-TBOA-enhanced glutamate inhibits cocaine self-administration. TFB-TBOA also reinstates cocaine-seeking behavior when administered into the NAc, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and ventral pallidum (VP). These findings demonstrate that glutamate differentially regulates cocaine reward versus relapse, reducing cocaine reward, while potentiating relapse to cocaine seeking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Encoding of Active Multi-Sensing Enhances Perceptual Decision-Making via a Synergistic Cross-Modal Interaction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Most perceptual decisions rely on the active acquisition of evidence from the environment involving stimulation from multiple senses. However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this process is limited. Crucially, it remains elusive how different sensory representations interact in the formation of perceptual decisions. To answer these questions, we used an active sensing paradigm coupled with neuroimaging, multivariate analysis, and computational modeling to probe how the human brain processes multisensory information to make perceptual judgments. Participants of both sexes actively sensed to discriminate two texture stimuli using visual (V) or haptic (H) information or the two sensory cues together (VH). Crucially, information acquisition was under the participants' control, who could choose where to sample information from and for how long on each trial. To understand the neural underpinnings of this process, we first characterized where and when active sensory experience (movement patterns) is encoded in human brain activity (EEG) in the three sensory conditions. Then, to offer a neurocomputational account of active multisensory decision formation, we used these neural representations of active sensing to inform a drift diffusion model of decision-making behavior. This revealed a multisensory enhancement of the neural representation of active sensing, which led to faster and more accurate multisensory decisions. We then dissected the interactions between the V, H, and VH representations using a novel information-theoretic methodology. Ultimately, we identified a synergistic neural interaction between the two unisensory (V, H) representations over contralateral somatosensory and motor locations that predicted multisensory (VH) decision-making performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In real-world settings, perceptual decisions are made during active behaviors, such as crossing the road on a rainy night, and include information from different senses (e.g., car lights, slippery ground). Critically, it remains largely unknown how sensory evidence is combined and translated into perceptual decisions in such active scenarios. Here we address this knowledge gap. First, we show that the simultaneous exploration of information across senses (multi-sensing) enhances the neural encoding of active sensing movements. Second, the neural representation of active sensing modulates the evidence available for decision; and importantly, multi-sensing yields faster evidence accumulation. Finally, we identify a cross-modal interaction in the human brain that correlates with multisensory performance, constituting a putative neural mechanism for forging active multisensory perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Distinct Metabolically Defined Central Nucleus Circuit Bidirectionally Controls Anxiety-Related Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anxiety disorders are debilitating psychiatric diseases that affect ~16% of the world's population. Although it has been proposed that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) plays a role in anxiety, the molecular and circuit mechanisms through which CeA neurons modulate anxiety-related behaviors are largely uncharacterized. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and has been shown to play a role in psychiatric disorders. Here, we reported that sEH was enriched in neurons in the CeA and regulated anxiety-related behaviors in adult male mice. Deletion of sEH in CeA neurons but not astrocytes induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistic studies indicated that sEH was required for maintaining the the excitability of sEH positive neurons (sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons) in the CeA. Using chemogenetic manipulations, we found that sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons bidirectionally regulated anxiety-related behaviors. Notably, we identified that sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons directly projected to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST; sEH<sup>CeA&ndash;BNST</sup>). Optogenetic activation and inhibition of the sEH<sup>CeA&ndash;BNST</sup> pathway produced anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects, respectively. In summary, our studies reveal a set of molecular and circuit mechanisms of sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons underlying anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of EETs, is shown to play a key role in mood disorders. It is well known that sEH is mostly localized in astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex and regulates depressive-like behaviors. Notably, sEH is also expressed in central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) neurons. While the CeA has been studied for its role in the regulation of anxiety, the molecular and circuit mechanism is quite complex. In the present study, we explored a previously unknown cellular and circuitry mechanism that guides sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons response to anxiety. Our findings reveal a critical role of sEH in the CeA, sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons and CeA-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) pathway in regulation of anxiety-related behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Action Potentials Are Critical for the Propagation of Focally Elicited Spreading Depolarizations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spreading depolarizations (SDs) of gray matter occur in the brain in different pathologic conditions, and cause varying degrees of tissue damage depending on the extent of metabolic burden on the tissue. As might be expected for such large depolarizations, neurons exhibit bursts of action potentials (APs) as the wave propagates. However, the specific role of APs in SD propagation is unclear. This is potentially consequential, since sodium channel modulation has not been considered as a therapeutic target for SD-associated disorders, because of ambiguous experimental evidence. Using whole-cell electrophysiology and single-photon imaging in acute cortical slices from male C57Bl6 mice, we tested the effects of AP blockade on SDs generated by two widely used induction paradigms. We found that AP blockade using tetrodotoxin (TTX) restricted propagation of focally induced SDs, and significantly reduced the amplitude of neuronal depolarization, as well as its Ca<sup>2+</sup> load. TTX also abolished the suppression of spontaneous synaptic activity that is a hallmark of focally induced SD. In contrast, TTX did not affect the propagation of SD induced by global superfusion of high [K<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>e</SUB> containing artificial CSF (ACSF). Thus, we show that voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<SUB>v</SUB>)-mediated neuronal AP bursts are critical for the propagation and downstream effects of focally induced SD but are less important when the ionic balance of the extracellular space is already compromised. In doing so we corroborate the notion that two different SD induction paradigms, each relevant to different clinical situations, vary significantly in their characteristics and potentially their response to treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our findings suggest that voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<SUB>v</SUB>) channels have a critical role in the propagation and downstream neural effects of focally induced spreading depolarization (SD). As SDs are likely induced focally in many disease conditions, these studies support sodium channel modulation, a previously underappreciated therapeutic option in SD-associated disorders, as a viable approach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">FASTMAP: Open-Source Flexible Atlas Segmentation Tool for Multi-Area Processing of Biological Images</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To better understand complex systems, such as the brain, studying the interactions between multiple brain regions is imperative. Such experiments often require delineation of multiple brain regions on microscopic images based on preexisting brain atlases. Experiments examining the relationships of multiple regions across the brain have traditionally relied on manual plotting of regions. This process is very intensive and becomes untenable with a large number of regions of interest (ROIs). To reduce the amount of time required to process multi-region datasets, several tools for atlas registration have been developed; however, these tools are often inflexible to tissue type, only supportive of a limited number of atlases and orientation, require considerable computational expertise, or are only compatible with certain types of microscopy. To address the need for a simple yet extensible atlas registration tool, we have developed FASTMAP, a Flexible Atlas Segmentation Tool for Multi-Area Processing. We demonstrate its ability to register images efficiently and flexibly to custom mouse brain atlas plates, to detect differences in the regional numbers of labels of interest, and to conduct densitometry analyses. This open-source and user-friendly tool will facilitate the atlas registration of diverse tissue types, unconventional atlas organizations, and a variety of tissue preparations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sensorimotor Learning in Response to Errors in Task Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The human sensorimotor system is sensitive to both limb-related prediction errors and task-related performance errors. Prediction error signals are believed to drive implicit refinements to motor plans. However, an understanding of the mechanisms that performance errors stimulate has remained unclear largely because their effects have not been probed in isolation from prediction errors. Diverging from past work, we induced performance errors independent of prediction errors by shifting the location of a reach target but keeping the intended and actual kinematic consequences of the motion matched. Our first two experiments revealed that rather than implicit learning, motor adjustments in response to performance errors reflect the use of deliberative, volitional strategies. Our third experiment revealed a potential dissociation of performance-error-driven strategies based on error size. Specifically, behavioral changes following large errors were consistent with goal-directed or model-based control, known to be supported by connections between prefrontal cortex and associative striatum. In contrast, motor changes following smaller performance errors carried signatures of model-free stimulus-response learning, of the kind underpinned by pathways between motor cortical areas and sensorimotor striatum. Across all experiments, we also found remarkably faster re-learning, advocating that such "savings" is associated with retrieval of previously learned strategic error compensation and may not require a history of exposure to limb-related errors.</p>

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. In the present article, the medicolegal evaluation in a case of fatal scald injury involving a two-year-old child from rural Nepal is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine the manner of death in such cases.

                Next Generation Sequencing technologies significantly impact the field of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) detection and monitoring, with immediate uses in diagnosis and risk assessment. For this application and in general, considerable challenges remain in demonstrating sufficient trust to act upon the meaningful information produced from raw data, partly because of the reliance on bioinformatics pipelines, which can produce different results and therefore lead to different interpretations. With the constant evolution of the field, it is difficult to identify, harmonise and recommend specific methods for large-scale implementations over time. In this article, we propose to address this challenge through establishing a transparent, performance-based, evaluation approach to provide flexibility in the bioinformatics tools of choice, while demonstrating proficiency in meeting common performance standards. The approach is two-fold: first, a community-driven effort to establish and maintain “live” (dynamic) benchmarking platforms to provide relevant performance metrics, based on different use-cases, that would evolve together with the AMR field; second, agreed and defined datasets to allow the pipelines’ implementation, validation, and quality-control over time. Following previous discussions on the main challenges linked to this approach, we provide concrete recommendations and future steps, related to different aspects of the design of benchmarks, such as the selection and the characteristics of the datasets (quality, choice of pathogens and resistances, etc.), the evaluation criteria of the pipelines, and the way these resources should be deployed in the community.

                Background: Phytomedicines are gaining a spotlight in wound management, where much research has suggested the wound healing potential of Barringtonia racemosa. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of B. racemosa kernel extract in accelerating wound healing process in animal models. Methods: B. racemosa kernel was extracted using ethanol:water (7:3) solvent and was then used as a bioactive ingredient in a Carbopol 940-based gel formulation in four different concentrations (1, 3, 5 and 7 ppm). A 3 cm diameter wound was made in the dorsal area of Rattus norvegicus rat and wound healing process was assessed up to 12 days using DESIGN (Depth, Exudate, Size of Inflammation/Infection, Granulation tissue, and Necrotic tissue) scoring system. Results: Our data suggested that the DESIGN scores were significantly different among concentration groups after the 3rdday onward suggesting B. racemosa extract accelerated the wound healing process. Rats treated with gel formulation containing 7 ppm of B. racemosa kernel extract had faster wound healing than that treated with topical Metcovazin. On day 6, macroscopic observation on 7 ppm group revealed that the wound had persistent redness, lesion area of < 3 cm2, and 80% healthy granulation, where presence of exudate and redness were not observable. Conclusion: B. racemosa kernel extract was effective in accelerating wound healing on rats. Further study is warranted to purify the bioactive component and the action mechanism in wound healing process.

                Background: The purposes of this pilot retrospective observational cohort study are to determine: 1) the safety and efficacy of corneal photovitrification (CPV), a corneal laser procedure, for vision improvement in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and other retinal disorders involving central vision loss, and 2) the correlation between post-treatment (post-treatment (Tx)) best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and pre-Tx potential visual acuity (PVA). Methods: BCDVA measurements using ETDRS charts and PVA measurements using Gonzalez-Markowitz PVA charts were analyzed for 72 eyes that received a single CPV treatment.   Results: Safety - No clinically significant complications or serious adverse events occurred. Efficacy – Mean BCDVA improved significantly from 20/303 (1.18 log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), 26 letters) at pre-Tx to 20/208 (1.02 logMAR, 34 letters) at 1m post-Tx (p = 0.000001) for a cohort of 57 eyes, improving to 20/198 (1.00 logMAR, 35 letters; 11.6 mean letters gained) at 12m (p = 0.0009) for a cohort of 29 eyes. Mean pre-Tx PVA gains correlated well with mean BCDVA improvements at 1m, 3m, 6m and 12m post-Tx. Conclusions: Subject to a small sample size, the CPV corneal laser procedure is safe and efficacious for vision improvement in patients with nAMD and other retinal disorders involving central vision loss. The pre-Tx PVA correlates well with post-Tx BCDVA; the PVA test may be useful for screening of candidate eyes for CPV treatment and for managing expectations.

                <p>by Romain Amyot, Arin Marchesi, Clemens M. Franz, Ignacio Casuso, Holger Flechsig</p>

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can visualize the dynamics of single biomolecules under near-physiological conditions. However, the scanning tip probes only the molecular surface with limited resolution, missing details required to fully deduce functional mechanisms from imaging alone. To overcome such drawbacks, we developed a computational framework to reconstruct 3D atomistic structures from AFM surface scans, employing simulation AFM and automatized fitting to experimental images. We provide applications to AFM images ranging from single molecular machines, protein filaments, to large-scale assemblies of 2D protein lattices, and demonstrate how the obtained full atomistic information advances the molecular understanding beyond the original topographic AFM image. We show that simulation AFM further allows for quantitative molecular feature assignment within measured AFM topographies. Implementation of the developed methods into the versatile interactive interface of the BioAFMviewer software, freely available at www.bioafmviewer.com, presents the opportunity for the broad Bio-AFM community to employ the enormous amount of existing structural and modeling data to facilitate the interpretation of resolution-limited AFM images.

The most common kind of cancer among women is breast cancer. Understanding the tumor microenvironment and the interactions between individual cells and cytokines assists us in arriving at more effective treatments. Here, we develop a data-driven mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of key cell types and cytokines involved in breast cancer development. We use time-course gene expression profiles of a mouse model to estimate the relative abundance of cells and cytokines. We then employ a least-squares optimization method to evaluate the model’s parameters based on the mice data. The resulting dynamics of the cells and cytokines obtained from the optimal set of parameters exhibit a decent agreement between the data and predictions. We perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the crucial parameters of the model and then perform a local bifurcation on them. The results reveal a strong connection between adipocytes, IL6, and the cancer population, suggesting them as potential targets for therapies.

Identifying copy number variants (CNVs) can provide diagnoses to patients and provide important biological insights into human health and disease. Current exome and targeted sequencing approaches cannot detect clinically and biologically-relevant CNVs outside their target area. We present SavvyCNV, a tool which uses off-target read data from exome and targeted sequencing data to call germline CNVs genome-wide. Up to 70% of sequencing reads from exome and targeted sequencing fall outside the targeted regions. We have developed a new tool, SavvyCNV, to exploit this ‘free data’ to call CNVs across the genome. We benchmarked SavvyCNV against five state-of-the-art CNV callers using truth sets generated from genome sequencing data and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification assays. SavvyCNV called CNVs with high precision and recall, outperforming the five other tools at calling CNVs genome-wide, using off-target or on-target reads from targeted panel and exome sequencing. We then applied SavvyCNV to clinical samples sequenced using a targeted panel and were able to call previously undetected clinically-relevant CNVs, highlighting the utility of this tool within the diagnostic setting. SavvyCNV outperforms existing tools for calling CNVs from off-target reads. It can call CNVs genome-wide from targeted panel and exome data, increasing the utility and diagnostic yield of these tests.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RosettaSurf—A surface-centric computational design approach</a></h4>

Proteins are typically represented by discrete atomic coordinates providing an accessible framework to describe different conformations. However, in some fields proteins are more accurately represented as near-continuous surfaces, as these are imprinted with geometric (shape) and chemical (electrostatics) features of the underlying protein structure. Protein surfaces are dependent on their chemical composition and, ultimately determine protein function, acting as the interface that engages in interactions with other molecules. In the past, such representations were utilized to compare protein structures on global and local scales and have shed light on functional properties of proteins. Here we describe RosettaSurf, a surface-centric computational design protocol, that focuses on the molecular surface shape and electrostatic properties as means for protein engineering, offering a unique approach for the design of proteins and their functions. The RosettaSurf protocol combines the explicit optimization of molecular surface features with a global scoring function during the sequence design process, diverging from the typical design approaches that rely solely on an energy scoring function. With this computational approach, we attempt to address a fundamental problem in protein design related to the design of functional sites in proteins, even when structurally similar templates are absent in the characterized structural repertoire. Surface-centric design exploits the premise that molecular surfaces are, to a certain extent, independent of the underlying sequence and backbone configuration, meaning that different sequences in different proteins may present similar surfaces. We benchmarked RosettaSurf on various sequence recovery datasets and showcased its design capabilities by generating epitope mimics that were biochemically validated. Overall, our results indicate that the explicit optimization of surface features may lead to new routes for the design of functional proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with lupus erythematosus in a sample of the Egyptian population: a hospital based cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr EL Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Moreover, patients’ medical records were also evaluated.  The oral manifestations were recorded according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in SLE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic.  Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with SLE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of SLE a widespread state. Also, implementation of oral hygiene measures and treatment to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life are recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Case report: Rare presentation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with severe depressive disorder with catatonia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy with symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, loss of appetite, bloating, weight loss, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, etc. It has a relatively late presentation, which makes its only potentially curative treatment, surgical resection, impractical for most patients. However, the prognosis is poor despite complete resection. The occurrence of depression and anxiety is rather common in patients with pancreatic cancer and a biological basis for this is suspected, although not studied in detail. We herein report a case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a 57-year-old man who suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, and significant weight loss. The computerized tomography (CT) scan and successive endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy with histopathology confirmed a mass arising from the mid-body of the pancreas with tubular and cystic glands lined by moderately pleomorphic columnar epithelial cells. The patient underwent chemotherapy with the FOLFIRINOX regimen. He eventually developed severe depression with psychotic symptoms and catatonia, which further exacerbated the challenges in the management of the malignancy. In spite of widely available therapeutic options for the management of depression described in the literature, the effectiveness of those in pancreatic cancer patients with concomitant depression is not well established. Hence, more studies are imperative in addressing the neuropsychiatric associations of pancreatic cancer and formulating a protocol for their apt management.

<p>Astrocyte calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes increases with Aß pathology and age. Increased calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes does not affect astrocyte network activity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are critical for healthy brain function. In Alzheimer’s disease, astrocytes become reactive, which affects their signaling properties. Here, we measured spontaneous calcium transients <i>ex vivo</i> in hippocampal astrocytes in brain slices containing the dentate gyrus of 6- (6M) and 9-month-old (9M) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We investigated the frequency and duration of calcium transients in relation to aging, amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, and the proximity of the astrocyte to Aβ plaques. The 6M APP/PS1 astrocytes showed no change in spontaneous calcium-transient properties compared to wild-type (WT) astrocytes. 9M APP/PS1 astrocytes, however, showed more hyperactivity compared to WT, characterized by increased spontaneous calcium transients that were longer in duration. Our data also revealed an effect of aging, as 9M astrocytes overall showed an increase in calcium activity compared to 6M astrocytes. Subsequent calcium-wave analysis showed an increase in sequential calcium transients (i.e., calcium waves) in 9M astrocytes, suggesting increased network activity <i>ex vivo</i>. Further analysis using null models revealed that this network effect is caused by chance, due to the increased number of spontaneous transients. Our findings show that alterations in calcium signaling in individual hippocampal astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice are subject to both aging and Aβ pathology but these do not lead to a change in astrocyte network activity. These alterations in calcium dynamics of astrocytes may help to understand changes in neuronal physiology leading to cognitive decline and ultimately dementia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Concomitant exploration of structural, functional, and neurochemical brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline is crucial in promoting healthy aging. Here, we present the DopamiNe, Age, connectoMe, and Cognition (DyNAMiC) project, a multimodal, prospective 5-year longitudinal study spanning the adult human lifespan. DyNAMiC examines age-related changes in the brain’s structural and functional connectome in relation to changes in dopamine D1 receptor availability (D1DR), and their associations to cognitive decline. Critically, due to the complete lack of longitudinal D1DR data, the true trajectory of one of the most age-sensitive dopamine systems remains unknown. The first DyNAMiC wave included 180 healthy participants (20–80 years). Brain imaging included magnetic resonance imaging assessing brain structure (white matter, gray matter, iron), perfusion, and function (during rest and task), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 radioligand. A subsample (<i>n</i> = 20, &gt;65 years) was additionally scanned with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET measuring D2DR. Age-related variation was evident for multiple modalities, such as D1DR; D2DR, and performance across the domains of episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed. Initial analyses demonstrated an inverted u-shaped association between D1DR and resting-state functional connectivity across cortical network nodes, such that regions with intermediate D1DR levels showed the highest levels of nodal strength. Evident within each age group, this is the first observation of such an association across the adult lifespan, suggesting that emergent functional architecture depends on underlying D1DR systems. Taken together, DyNAMiC is the largest D1DR study worldwide, and will enable a comprehensive examination of brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Regulation of ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And organelles play a role in different cellular interactions with ferroptosis. Targeting organelle metabolic pathways and redox responses may be an effective strategy for disease treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerʼs disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is a striking global health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products and the accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Strict regulation of iron metabolism is essential to ensure neuronal homeostasis. Excess and deficiency of iron are both associated with neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that oxidative stress caused by cerebral iron metabolism disorders in the body is involved in the process of AD, ferroptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, and regulating ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of AD. Various organelles are closely related to ferroptosis: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis from the aspects of iron metabolism and redox imbalance. In this review, the relationship between AD and the dysfunction of organelles (including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus) and the role of organelles in ferroptosis of AD were reviewed to provide insights for understanding the relationship between organelles and ferroptosis in AD and the treatment of AD.</p>

     alt="The role of sex in the association between cannabis use and working memory-related brain activity"/>
<p>Compared to controls, cannabis users show a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing working memory (WM) load and a relatively smaller reduction in WM related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. No sex differences emerged generally or in cannabis users in WM and WM load related activity or performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although cannabis use patterns differ between men and women, studies on sex differences on the effects of cannabis on the brain and cognitive control are largely lacking. Working memory (WM) is a component of cognitive control believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. In this study, we evaluated the association between cannabis use and WM (load) related brain activity in a large sample, enabling us to assess sex effects in this association. The brain activity of 104 frequent cannabis users (63% men) and 85 controls (53% men) was recorded during an N-back WM task. Behavioral results showed a significant interaction between WM load and group for both accuracy and reaction time, with cannabis users showing a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing WM load. Cannabis users compared to controls showed a relatively smaller reduction in WM (load) related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. This WM (load) related activity was not associated with performance nor cannabis use and related problems. An exploratory analysis showed higher WM-related activity in the superior frontal gyrus in men compared to women. While cannabis users showed higher WM (load) related activity in central nodes of the default mode network, this was not directly attributable to group specific worsening of performance under higher cognitive load. Further research is necessary to assess whether observed group differences increase with higher cognitive load, how group differences relate to measures of cannabis use, and how sex affects these group differences.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent clinical studies, in both children/adolescents and adults, have shown the extreme neuropsychological heterogeneity of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): specific neuropsychological deficits have been found only in a minority of individuals, with no direct correlation between discrete cognitive performances and the trajectory of clinical symptoms. Deficits in specific neuropsychological functions may be common in ADHD, but nevertheless no cognitive or neuropsychological profile may fully explain the disorder. Sex differences in the ADHD presentation, both at a neuropsychological and clinical level, also contribute to this clinical and neuropsychological heterogeneity. At a neuropsychological level, females with ADHD may show greater working memory problems, poorer vocabulary skills and worse visual spatial reasoning. Structural and functional imaging study also show discrete differences across sex; however, the great majority of clinical studies mainly or exclusively include male participants with insufficient data to draw firm conclusions on sex differences within the disorder. Here, we report the recent literature data, discussing still open research questions about the clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and neuropsychological functioning in ADHD with a focus on the impact of sex differences—a deeper insight in these unresolved issues may have relevant clinical and therapeutic implications for tailored, effective, and long-lasting interventions.</p>

<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

                Pinpointing causal variants at risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been a great challenge. In this issue of Neuron, Zhang et al. present a fine-mapping approach, RefMap, integrating functional genomics with GWAS summary statistics to prioritize causal variants for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

                In this issue of Neuron, Yu et al. (2022) uncovered a sensory pathway by which social touch can activate oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus. Their stimulation protocol could deliver pleasant sensory stimuli to juvenile mice, increasing their later-life social interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">ApoE Cascade Hypothesis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias</a></h4>

              
                In this review, Martens et al. propose a novel “ApoE Cascade Hypothesis,” which states that the biochemical and biophysical properties of apoE impact a cascade of events at the cellular and systems levels, ultimately leading to Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive decline.

The spectral properties of these states suggest that they are long-lived and could therefore be used for practical electronics applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 mediates the effects of viral infection on the host cell transcriptome</a></h4>

              
                Viral infection involves complex set of events orchestrated by multiple viral proteins. To identify functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we performed transcriptomic analyses of cells expressing individual viral proteins. Expression of Nsp14, a protein involved in viral RNA replication, provoked a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptome that strongly resembled that observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1,000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity. These effects were independent of the Nsp14 exonuclease activity and required the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain of the protein. Activation of the NFkB pathway and increased expression of <i>CXCL8</i> occurred early upon Nsp14 expression. We identified IMPDH2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of guanine nucleotides biosynthesis, as a key mediator of these effects. Nsp14 expression caused an increase in GTP cellular levels, and the effect of Nsp14 was strongly decreased in presence of IMPDH2 inhibitors. Together, our data demonstrate an unknown role for Nsp14 with implications for therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Measuring the tolerance of the genetic code to altered codon size</a></h4>

              
                Translation using four-base codons occurs in both natural and synthetic systems. What constraints contributed to the universal adoption of a triplet-codon, rather than quadruplet-codon, genetic code? Here, we investigate the tolerance of the <i>Escherichia coli </i>genetic code to tRNA mutations that increase codon size. We found that tRNAs from all twenty canonical isoacceptor classes can be converted to functional quadruplet tRNAs (qtRNAs). Many of these selectively incorporate a single amino acid in response to a specified four-base codon, as confirmed with mass spectrometry. However, efficient quadruplet codon translation often requires multiple tRNA mutations. Moreover, while tRNAs were largely amenable to quadruplet conversion, only nine of the twenty aminoacyl tRNA synthetases tolerate quadruplet anticodons. These may constitute a functional and mutually orthogonal set, but one that sharply limits the chemical alphabet available to a nascent all-quadruplet code. Our results suggest that the triplet codon code was selected because it is simpler and sufficient, not because a quadruplet codon code is unachievable. These data provide a blueprint for synthetic biologists to deliberately engineer an all-quadruplet expanded genetic code.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coagulation factors directly cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike and enhance viral entry</a></h4>

              
                Coagulopathy is a significant aspect of morbidity in COVID-19 patients. The clotting cascade is propagated by a series of proteases, including factor Xa and thrombin. While certain host proteases, including TMPRSS2 and furin, are known to be important for cleavage activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike to promote viral entry in the respiratory tract, other proteases may also contribute. Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that factor Xa and thrombin can also directly cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike, enhancing infection at the stage of viral entry. Coagulation factors increased SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids. A drug-repurposing screen identified a subset of protease inhibitors that promiscuously inhibited spike cleavage by both transmembrane serine proteases as well as coagulation factors. The mechanism of the protease inhibitors nafamostat and camostat may extend beyond inhibition of TMPRSS2 to coagulation-induced spike cleavage. Anticoagulation is critical in the management of COVID-19, and early intervention could provide collateral benefit by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. We propose a model of positive feedback whereby infection-induced hypercoagulation exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeting the Annexin A1-FPR2/ALX pathway for host-directed therapy in dengue disease</a></h4>

              
                Host immune responses contribute to dengue's pathogenesis and severity, yet the possibility that failure in endogenous inflammation resolution pathways could characterise the disease has not been contemplated. The pro-resolving protein Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is known to counterbalance overexuberant inflammation and mast cell (MC) activation. We hypothesised that inadequate AnxA1 engagement underlies the cytokine storm and vascular pathologies associated with dengue disease. Levels of AnxA1 were examined in the plasma of dengue patients and infected mice. Immunocompetent, interferon (alpha and beta) receptor 1 knockout (KO), AnxA1 KO<sup> </sup>and FPR2 KO mice were infected with <i>Dengue virus</i> (DENV) and treated with the AnxA1 mimetic peptide Ac<sub>2-26</sub> for analysis. Additionally, the effect of Ac<sub>2-26 </sub>on DENV-induced MC degranulation was assessed <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo</i>. We observed that circulating levels of AnxA1 were reduced in dengue patients and DENV-infected mice. While the absence of AnxA1 or its receptor FPR2 aggravated illness in infected mice, treatment with AnxA1 agonistic peptide attenuated disease manifestations. Both clinical outcomes were attributed to modulation of DENV-mediated viral load-independent MC degranulation. We have thereby identified that altered levels of the pro-resolving mediator AnxA1 are of pathological relevance in DENV infection, suggesting FPR2/ALX agonists as a therapeutic target for dengue disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microtubule rescue at midzone edges promotes overlap stability and prevents spindle collapse during anaphase B</a></h4>

              
                During anaphase B, molecular motors slide interpolar microtubules to elongate the mitotic spindle, contributing to the separation of chromosomes. However, sliding of antiparallel microtubules reduces their overlap, which may lead to spindle breakage, unless microtubules grow to compensate sliding. How sliding and growth are coordinated is still poorly understood. In this study, we have used the fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i> to measure microtubule dynamics during anaphase B. We report that the coordination of microtubule growth and sliding relies on promoting rescues at the midzone edges. This makes microtubules stable from pole to midzone, while their distal parts including the plus ends alternate between assembly and disassembly. Consequently, the midzone keeps a constant length throughout anaphase, enabling sustained sliding without the need for a precise regulation of microtubule growth speed. Additionally, we found that in <i>S. pombe</i>, which undergoes closed mitosis, microtubule growth speed decreases when the nuclear membrane wraps around the spindle midzone.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Minimal requirements for a neuron to co-regulate many properties and the implications for ion channel correlations and robustness</a></h4>

              
                Neurons regulate their excitability by adjusting their ion channel levels. Degeneracy - achieving equivalent outcomes (excitability) using different solutions (channel combinations) - facilitates this regulation by enabling a disruptive change in one channel to be offset by compensatory changes in other channels. But neurons must co-regulate many properties. Pleiotropy - the impact of one channel on more than one property - complicates regulation because a compensatory ion channel change that restores one property to its target value often disrupts other properties. How then does a neuron simultaneously regulate multiple properties? Here we demonstrate that of the many channel combinations producing the target value for one property (the single-output solution set), few combinations produce the target value for other properties. Combinations producing the target value for two or more properties (the multi-output solution set) correspond to the intersection between single-output solution sets. Properties can be effectively co-regulated only if the number of adjustable channels (<i>n</i><sub>in</sub>) exceeds the number of regulated properties (<i>n</i><sub>out</sub>). Ion channel correlations emerge during homeostatic regulation when the dimensionality of solution space (<i>n</i><sub>in </sub>- <i>n</i><sub>out</sub>) is low. Even if each property can be regulated to its target value when considered in isolation, regulation as a whole fails if single-output solution sets do not intersect. Our results also highlight that ion channels must be co-adjusted with different ratios to regulate different properties, which suggests that each error signal drives modulatory changes independently, despite those changes ultimately affecting the same ion channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adult mouse fibroblasts retain organ-specific transcriptomic identity</a></h4>

              
                Organ fibroblasts are essential components of homeostatic and diseased tissues. They participate in sculpting the extracellular matrix, sensing the microenvironment and communicating with other resident cells. Recent studies have revealed transcriptomic heterogeneity among fibroblasts within and between organs. To dissect the basis of inter-organ heterogeneity, we compare the gene expression of murine fibroblasts from different tissues (tail, skin, lung, liver, heart, kidney, gonads) and show that they display distinct positional and organ-specific transcriptome signatures that reflect their embryonic origins. We demonstrate that expression of genes typically attributed to the surrounding parenchyma by fibroblasts is established in embryonic development and largely maintained in culture, bioengineered tissues and ectopic transplants. Targeted knockdown of key organ-specific transcription factors affects fibroblast functions, in particular genes involved in the modulation of fibrosis and inflammation. In conclusion, our data reveal that adult fibroblasts maintain an embryonic gene expression signature inherited from their organ of origin, thereby increasing our understanding of adult fibroblast heterogeneity. The knowledge of this tissue-specific gene signature may assist in targeting fibrotic diseases in a more precise, organ-specific manner.

                Publishing is part and parcel of a successful academic career, and Covid-19 has amplified gender disparities in manuscript submissions and authorships. We used longitudinal publication data on 431,207 scientists in biology, chemistry, and clinical and basic medicine to quantify the differential impact of Covid-19 on women's and men's annual publishing rates. In a difference-in-differences analysis, we estimated that the average gender difference in publication productivity increased from -0.26 in 2019 (corresponding to a 17% lower output for women than men) to -0.35 in 2020 (corresponding to a 24% lower output for women than men). An age-group comparison showed a widening gender gap for both early career and mid-career scientists. The increasing gender gap was most pronounced among highly productive authors and scientists in clinical medicine and biology. Our study demonstrates the importance of reinforcing institutional commitments to diversity through policies that support the inclusion and retention of women researchers.

Inhibiting the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the TFIIH complex subunit XPB rapidly and reversibly induces a complete loss of chromosome structure and prevents the enrichment of condensins I and II, but not topoisomerase II, on chromatin. In addition, inhibiting TFIIH prevents condensation of both mouse and <i>Xenopus</i> nuclei in <i>Xenopus </i>egg extracts, which suggests an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of TFIIH action. Reducing nucleosome density through partial histone depletion restores chromosome structure and condensin enrichment in the absence of TFIIH activity. We propose that the TFIIH complex promotes mitotic chromosome condensation by dynamically altering the chromatin environment to facilitate condensin loading and condensin-dependent loop extrusion.

                Chronic opioid exposure causes structural and functional changes in brain circuits, which may contribute to opioid use disorders. Synaptic cell-adhesion molecules are prime candidates for mediating this opioid-evoked plasticity. Neuroligin-3 (NL3) is a postsynaptic adhesion protein that shapes synaptic function at multiple sites in the mesolimbic dopamine system. We therefore studied how genetic knockout of NL3 alters responses to chronic morphine in male mice. Constitutive NL3 knockout caused a persistent reduction in psychomotor sensitization after chronic morphine exposure, as well as a change in the topography of locomotor stimulation produced by morphine. This latter change was recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion of NL3 from cells expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor, whereas the reduction in psychomotor sensitization was recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion from dopamine neurons. In the absence of NL3 expression, dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area showed diminished activation following chronic morphine exposure, as measured by in vivo calcium imaging with fiber photometry. This altered pattern of dopamine neuron activity may be driven by aberrant forms of opioid-evoked synaptic plasticity in the absence of NL3: dopamine neurons lacking NL3 showed weaker synaptic inhibition at baseline, which was subsequently strengthened after chronic morphine. In total, our study highlights neurobiological adaptations in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area that correspond with increased behavioral sensitivity to opioids, and further suggests that NL3 expression by dopamine neurons provides a molecular substrate for opioid-evoked adaptations in brain function and behavior.

                Saccadic eye-movements play a crucial role in visuo-motor control by allowing rapid foveation onto new targets. However, the neural processes governing saccades adaptation are not fully understood. Saccades, due to the short-time of execution (20-100 ms) and the absence of sensory information for online feedback control, must be controlled in a ballistic manner. Incomplete measurements of the movement trajectory, such as the visual end-point error, are supposedly used to form internal predictions about the movement kinematics resulting in predictive control. In order to characterize the synaptic and neural circuit mechanisms underlying predictive saccadic control, we have reconstructed the saccadic system in a digital controller embedding a spiking neural network of the cerebellum with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules driving parallel fiber - Purkinje cell long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). This model implements a control policy based on a dual plasticity mechanism, resulting in the identification of the roles of LTP and LTD in optimizing saccade movement control: it turns out that LTD regulates the accuracy and LTP the speed (vigor) of the ballistic eye movement. The control policy also required cerebellar PCs to be divided into two subpopulations, characterized by burst or pause responses. To our knowledge, this is the first model that explains in mechanistic terms the accuracy and vigor regulation of ballistic eye movements in forward mode exploiting spike-timing to regulate firing in different populations of the neuronal network. This elementary model of saccades could be extended and applied to other more complex cases in which single jerks are concatenated to compose articulated and coordinated movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal dynamics of competition between statistical learning and episodic memory in intracranial recordings of human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The function of long-term memory is not just to reminisce about the past, but also to make predictions that help us behave appropriately and efficiently in the future. This predictive function of memory provides a new perspective on the classic question from memory research of why we remember some things but not others. If prediction is a key outcome of memory, then the extent to which an item generates a prediction signifies that this information already exists in memory and need not be encoded. We tested this principle using human intracranial EEG as a time-resolved method to quantify prediction in visual cortex during a statistical learning task and link the strength of these predictions to subsequent episodic memory behavior. Epilepsy patients viewed rapid streams of scenes, some of which contained regularities that allowed the category of the next scene to be predicted. We verified that statistical learning occurred using neural frequency tagging and measured category prediction with multivariate pattern analysis. Although neural prediction was robust overall, this was driven entirely by items that were subsequently forgotten. Such interference provides a mechanism by which prediction can regulate memory formation to prioritize encoding of information that could help learn new predictive relationships.

                Microglial cells of the aged brain manifest signs of dysfunction that could contribute to the worse neurological outcome of stroke in the elderly. Treatment with colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor antagonists enable transient microglia depletion that can be followed by microglia repopulation after interruption of the treatment, causing no known harm to mice. Using this strategy, we aimed to restore microglia function and ameliorate stroke outcome in aged mice. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induces strong innate immune responses in microglia highlighted by prominent type I interferon signaling, together with cellular metabolic perturbances and lipid droplet biogenesis in young mice. In aged mice, a subset of microglia accumulates lipid droplets under steady state and displays exacerbated innate immune responses after stroke. Microglia renewal in old mice reduces the lipid droplet content, prevents the ischemia-induced exaggerated type I interferon response, and improves the neurological outcome of stroke. This study shows that age-dependent lipid droplet-enriched microglia contribute to impair stroke outcome in old mice.

                Neuroimaging markers based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combined with various other measures (such as informative covariates, vascular risks, brain activity, neuropsychological test etc.,) might provide useful predictions of clinical outcomes during progression towards Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Bayesian approach aims to provide a trade-off by employing relevant features combinations to build decision support systems in clinical settings where uncertainties are relevant. We tested the approach in the MRI data across 959 subjects, aged 59-89 years and 453 subjects with available neuropsychological test scores and CSF biomarker status (amyloid-beta (A{beta})42/40 & and phosphorylated tau (pTau)) from a large sample multi-centric observational cohort (DELCODE). In order to explore the beneficial combinations of information from different sources, we presented a MRI-based predictive modelling of memory performance and CSF biomarker status (positive or negative) in the healthy ageing group as well as subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease using a Gaussian process multi-kernel framework. Furthermore, we systematically evaluated predictive combinations of input feature sets and their model variations, i.e. (A) combinations of brain tissue classes and feature type (modulated vs. unmodulated), choices of filter size of smoothing (ranging from 0 to 15 mm full width at half maximum), and image resolution (1mm, 2mm, 4mm and 8mm); (B) incorporating demography and covariates (C) the impact of the size of the training data set (i.e., number of subjects); (D) the influence of reducing the dimensions of data and (E) choice of kernel types. Finally, the approach was tested to reveal individual cognitive scores at follow-up (up to 4 years) using the baseline features. The highest accuracy for memory performance prediction was obtained for a combination of neuroimaging markers, demographics, genetic information (ApoE4) and CSF-biomarkers explaining 57% of outcome variance in out of sample predictions. The best accuracy for A{beta}42/40 status classification was achieved for combination demographics, ApoE4 and memory score while usage of structural MRI improved the classification of individual patient's pTau status.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance at active zones through a balance of delivery and turnover</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) mediate Ca2+ influx to trigger neurotransmitter release at specialized presynaptic sites termed active zones (AZs). The abundance of VGCCs at AZs regulates neurotransmitter release probability (Pr), a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength. Although biosynthesis, delivery and recycling cooperate to establish AZ VGCC abundance, experimentally isolating these distinct regulatory processes has been difficult. Here we describe how the AZ levels of Cacophony (Cac), the sole VGCC mediating synaptic transmission in Drosophila, are determined. We also analyzed the relationship between Cac, the conserved VGCC regulatory subunit 2{delta}, and the core AZ scaffold protein Bruchpilot (BRP) in establishing a functional AZ. We find Cac and BRP are independently regulated at growing AZs, as Cac is dispensable for AZ formation and structural maturation, and BRP abundance is not limiting for Cac accumulation. Additionally, AZs stop accumulating Cac after an initial growth phase, whereas BRP levels continue to increase given extended developmental time. AZ Cac is also buffered against moderate increases or decreases in biosynthesis, whereas BRP lacks this buffering. To probe mechanisms that determine AZ Cac abundance, intravital FRAP and Cac photoconversion were used to separately measure delivery and turnover at individual AZs over a multi-day period. Cac delivery occurs broadly across the AZ population, correlates with AZ size, and is rate-limited by 2{delta}. Although Cac does not undergo significant lateral transfer between neighboring AZs over the course of development, Cac removal from AZs does occur and is promoted by new Cac delivery, generating a cap on Cac accumulation at mature AZs. Together these findings reveal how Cac biosynthesis, synaptic delivery, and recycling set the abundance of VGCCs at individual AZs throughout synapse development and maintenance.

                The preprocessing of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data involves numerous steps, including the corrections for head motion, susceptibility distortion, low signal-to-noise ratio, and signal drifting. Researchers or clinical practitioners often need to configure different preprocessing steps depending on disparate image acquisition schemes, which increases the technical threshold for dMRI analysis for non-expert users. This could cause disparities in data processing approaches and thus hinder the comparability between studies. To make the dMRI data processing steps transparent and adapt to various dMRI acquisition schemes for researchers, we propose a semi-automated pipeline tool for dMRI named integrated Diffusion Image Operator or iDIO. This pipeline integrates features from a wide range of advanced dMRI software tools and targets at providing a one-click solution for dMRI data analysis, via automatic configuration for a set of optimal processing steps based on the image header of the input data. Additionally, the pipeline provides options for post-processing, such as estimation of diffusion tensor metrics and whole-brain tractography-based connectomes reconstruction using common brain atlases. The iDIO pipeline also outputs an easy-to-interpret quality control report to facilitate users to assess the data quality. To keep the transparency of data processing, the execution log and all the intermediate images produced in the iDIO's workflow are accessible. The goal of iDIO is to reduce the barriers for clinical or non-specialist users to adopt the state-of-art dMRI processing steps.

                Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are highly synchronous neuronal activity events. They have been predominantly observed in the hippocampus during offline states such as pause in exploration, slow-wave sleep and quiescent wakefulness. SWRs have been linked to memory consolidation, spatial navigation, and spatial decision-making. Recently, SWRs have been reported during visual search, a form of remote spatial exploration, in macaque hippocampus. However, the association between SWRs and multiple forms of awake conscious and goal-directed behavior is unknown. We report that ripple activity occurs in macaque visual areas V1 and V4 during focused spatial attention. The frequency of ripples is modulated by characteristics of the stimuli, by spatial attention directed toward a receptive field, and by the size of the attentional focus. Critically, the monkeys reaction times in detecting behaviorally relevant stimulus changes was affected on trials with SWRs. These results show that ripple activity is not limited to hippocampal activity during offline states, rather they occur in the neocortex during active attentive states and vigilance behaviors.

                Overlap between dendritic trees of neighboring neurons is a defining feature of central nervous systems. Dendritic domains sharing a given locus are arguably more likely to share afferent inputs, and proximity is a requirement for dendro-dendritic communication. Dendritic overlap also differentiates neuronal circuits characterized by redundancy and integration from those characterized by a more specific and selective connectivity. We examined the geometrical factors that affect intersection between pairs of neurons by, specifically, modelling the influence of cell-to-cell distance, and dendritic domain size and shape. We developed Matlab scripts to determine intersected volume between pairs of three-dimensionally reconstructed neurons using their convex hull (CH) polyhedrons as proxies for dendritic domain. The influence of neuron-to-neuron distance on intersection was not straightforward and reflected the diverse and anisotropic geometry of neurons, and the ostensible displacement of cell bodies from the CH centroid. The influence of size on pair intersection was tested by giving each neuronal CH pair the same (average) volume without modifying their shape. Conversely, the influence of neuronal shape on pair intersection was proved by giving each neuronal pair an average shape without modifying volumes. While both normalization increased intersection, shape averaging was remarkably more effective than size averaging in increasing pair intersection. We conclude that intersection does not only depend on neuron-to-neuron proximity, but critically on neuron-to-neuron differences in size and shape. The results predict that circuits characterized by selective connectivity exhibit greater heterogeneity in size, but especially shape, of their constituent neuronal elements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent separation of phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity</a></h4>

              
                Brain dynamics recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) is conceptualized as a sum of two components, "phase-locked" and "non-phase-locked" to the stimulus. Both activities are understood to be stemming from different neuronal mechanisms and hence accurately characterizing them is of immense importance in neuroscientific studies. Here, we discuss the drawbacks of currently used methods to separate the phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity and propose a new method that decomposes the two components simultaneously. First, we demonstrate that single-trial separation of phase-locked and non-phase-locked power is an ill-posed problem. Second, using simulations where ground truth validation is possible, we elucidate the drawbacks of the widely used averaging method and efficacy of the proposed concurrent phaser method (CPM). Using two experimental datasets, audio oddball EEG data and auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) we show how the empirical signal-to-noise estimates warrant the usage of CPM to separate phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CDKL5 deficiency slows synaptic vesicle endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is a severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy resulting mainly from de novo mutations in the X-linked CDKL5 gene. To determine whether loss of presynaptic CDKL5 function contributes to CDD, we examined synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling in primary hippocampal neurons generated from a Cdkl5 knockout rat model. Using a genetically-encoded reporter, we revealed that CDKL5 is selectively required for efficient SV endocytosis. We showed that CDKL5 kinase activity is both necessary and sufficient for optimal SV endocytosis, since kinase-inactive mutations failed to correct endocytosis in CDKL5 knockout neurons, whereas the isolated CDKL5 kinase domain fully restored SV endocytosis kinetics. Finally, we demonstrated that CDKL5-mediated phosphorylation of amphiphysin 1, a putative presynaptic target, is not required for CDKL5-dependent control of SV endocytosis. Overall, our findings reveal a key presynaptic role for CDKL5 kinase activity and enhance our insight into how its dysfunction may culminate in CDD.

                An adaptive stress response involves various mediators and circuits orchestrating a complex interplay of physiological, emotional and behavioural adjustments. We identified a population of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the lateral part of the interstitial nucleus of the anterior commissure (IPACL) - a subdivision of the extended amygdala, which exclusively innervate the substantia nigra (SN). Specific stimulation of this circuit elicits arousal and avoidance behaviour contingent on CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) located at axon terminals in the SN, which originate from external globus pallidus (GPe) neurons. The neuronal activity prompting the observed behaviour is shaped by IPACLCRH and GPeCRHR1 neurons coalescing in the SN. These results delineate a novel tripartite CRH circuit functionally connecting extended amygdala and basal ganglia nuclei to drive arousal and avoidance behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling from prefrontal cortex to lateral septum supports social novelty preference</a></h4>

              
                Social preference, the decision to interact with one member of the same species over another, is a key feature of optimizing social interactions. In rodents, social preference relies on both extrinsic factors, such as sex, strain and kinship, and intrinsic ones, such as the memory of previous encounters, which favors interactions with novel compared to familiar animals (social novelty preference). At present, it is unclear which neuronal circuits guide social preferences and whether such circuits promote social interactions with the preferred individuals or suppress interactions with the non- preferred ones. Although both the infra-limbic area of the pre-frontal cortex (ILA) and the lateral septum (LS) have been shown to support social novelty preference, the neuronal circuits and molecular mechanisms by which these brain regions interact to regulate social interactions are unknown. Here, we identify a population of inhibitory neurons in ILA that express the neuropeptide corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and project to the rostro-dorsal region of LS (rdLS). Release of CRH from ILA in rdLS during interactions with familiar mice disinhibits rdLS neurons, thereby suppressing interactions with familiar mice and contributing to social novelty preference. We further demonstrate how the maturation of CRH expression during the first two post-natal weeks enables the developmental shift from a preference for littermates in juveniles to a preference for novel mice in adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of efficient communication in the human connectome.</a></h4>

              
                The structure of the human connectome develops from childhood throughout adolescence to middle age, but how this affects the speed of neuronal signaling is not well described. To understand the maturation process of transmission speed across the connectome, we stimulated electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode pairs in 75 human subjects of 4 to 51 years old. We then measured the latency of cortico-cortical evoked responses in other electrodes. Each year, responses got faster, until transmission speed reached a minimum latency at the age of 29-44 years old. Responses during middle age were about two times faster compared to childhood. These increases in speed were observed in both long- and short-range connections between and within frontal, central, parietal, and temporal areas. These findings indicate that long-range and short-range communication between brain regions increase in efficiency well throughout adolescence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reciprocal representation of encoded features by cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations.</a></h4>

              
                In the cortex, the interplay between excitation and inhibition determines the fidelity of neuronal representations. However, while the receptive fields of excitatory neurons are often fine-tuned to the encoded features, the principles governing the tuning of inhibitory neurons are still elusive. We addressed this problem by recording populations of neurons in the postsubiculum (PoSub), a cortical area where the receptive fields of most excitatory neurons correspond to a specific head-direction (HD). In contrast to PoSub-HD cells, the tuning of fast-spiking (FS) cells, the largest class of cortical inhibitory neurons, was broad and heterogeneous. However, we found that PoSub-FS cell tuning curves were fine-tuned in the spatial frequency domain, resulting in various radial symmetries in their HD tuning. In addition, the average frequency spectrum of PoSub-FS cell populations was virtually indistinguishable from that of PoSub-HD cells but different from that of the upstream thalamic HD cells, suggesting that this co-tuning in the frequency domain has a local origin. Two observations corroborated this hypothesis. First, PoSub-FS cell tuning was independent of upstream thalamic inputs. Second, PoSub-FS cell tuning was tightly coupled to PoSub-HD cell activity even during sleep. Together, these findings provide evidence that the resolution of neuronal tuning is an intrinsic property of local cortical networks, shared by both excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. We hypothesize that this reciprocal encoding supports two parallel streams of information processing in thalamocortical networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional architecture of cerebral cortex during naturalistic movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing the functional organization of cerebral cortex is a fundamental step in understanding how different kinds of information are processed in the brain. Neuroimaging studies over the past decades have uncovered the function of many cortical areas in response to selected stimulus categories. However, it is still unclear how cortical areas are organized during naturalistic visual and auditory stimulation. Here we used high-resolution functional MRI data from 176 human subjects to map the macro-architecture of the entire cerebral cortex based on responses to a 60-minute audiovisual movie stimulus. A data-driven clustering approach revealed a map of 24 functional areas/networks, each related to a specific aspect of sensory or cognitive processing. The map included three distinct executive control (domain-general) networks which showed a strong push-pull interaction with domain-specific regions in visual, auditory, and language cortex. The cortical parcellation scheme presented here provides a comprehensive and unified map of functionally defined areas, which could replace a large set of functional localizer maps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A modality independent proto-organization of human multisensory areas</a></h4>

              
                The processing of multisensory information is based upon the capacity of brain regions, such as the superior temporal cortex, to combine information across modalities. However, it is still unclear whether the representation of coherent auditory and visual events does require any prior audiovisual experience to develop and function. In three fMRI experiments, intersubject correlation analysis measured brain synchronization during the presentation of an audiovisual, audio-only or video-only versions of the same narrative in distinct groups of sensory-deprived (congenitally blind and deaf) and typically-developed individuals. The superior temporal cortex synchronized across auditory and visual conditions, even in sensory-deprived individuals who lack any audiovisual experience. This synchronization was primarily mediated by low-level perceptual features and relied on a similar modality-independent topographical organization of temporal dynamics. The human superior temporal cortex is naturally endowed with a functional scaffolding to yield a common representation across multisensory events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep learning based feature extraction for prediction and interpretation of sharp- wave ripples</a></h4>

              
                Local field potential (LFP) deflections and oscillations define hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWR), one of the most synchronous events of the brain. SWR reflect firing and synaptic current sequences emerging from cognitively relevant neuronal ensembles. Current spectral methods fail to capture their mechanistic complexity, thus limiting progress. Here, we show how one-dimensional convolutional networks operating over high-density LFP hippocampal recordings allowed for automatic identification of SWR. When applied to ultra-dense hippocampus-wide recordings, we discovered physiologically relevant processes associated to the emergence of SWR, prompting for novel classification criteria. To gain interpretability, we developed a method to interrogate the operation of the artificial network. We found it relied in feature-based specialization, which permit identification of spatially segregated oscillations and deflections, as well as synchronous population firing. Thus, using deep learning based approaches may change the current heuristic for a better mechanistic interpretation of these relevant neurophysiological events.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease burden of cardiovascular conditions complicating pregnancy in Sri Lanka: a protocol [version 3; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the commonest indirect medical cause of maternal deaths worldwide, both in high-income and low and middle-income countries. To minimize the effects of CVD in pregnancy, proper risk assessment and appropriate referral is required. In Sri Lanka, cardiovascular disease complicating pregnancy is a significant cause of maternal mortality, second only to postpartum hemorrhage. Screening for CVD in pregnancy in Sri Lanka is limited to a routine clinical assessment. Evidence-based guidelines are yet to be developed, and this deficit may have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the CVD burden. This study aims to determine the burden of CVD in early pregnancy and develop a risk prediction model to be used in field pregnancy clinics in Sri Lanka to reduce CVD effects in pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in the Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Following registration to the antenatal care, pregnant women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were invited to attend a special clinic at their relevant Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Risk assessment was done through history and a clinical examination, and suspected/probable cases were referred for an echocardiogram by a consultant cardiologist. All the recruited participants in the first trimester were prospectively followed up and screened again between 24–28 weeks of the period of amenorrhoea (POA). Antenatal ward admissions with CVD complicating pregnancy will be extracted, and a telephone interview will be carried out between 6–12 weeks after the expected delivery date to cover postpartum morbidities.  Discussion This proposed study will be the largest of its kind carried out in the local setting. The study's findings will be beneficial for policymakers to develop guidelines to reduce maternal cardiovascular disease morbidities and mortalities in Sri Lanka.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Glans penile necrosis in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 and leprosy infection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was firstly identified in China and has been declared a global pandemic. Several serious extrapulmonary manifestations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been reported and associated with hypercoagulability thrombotic vasculopathy. In addition, cases of Mycobacterium-leprae infection have also been known associated with blood coagulation abnormality. Methods: Here, we report a 56-year-old male with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with concomitant leprosy infection with manifestation of glans penile necrosis, presented to the emergency department with acute penile pain. This case is unique because no occlusion blood flow to the penile was observed in the radiographic imaging. We described the potential pathophysiology in this case through a literature review. Results: The patient received treatment according to the COVID-19 protocol and was given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy for 4 days. During the follow up, the clinical and functional condition of the penis showed significant improvement. Conclusions: Microthrombus involvement, platelet abnormalities and impaired hemostasis due to SARS-CoV-2 and leprosy co-infection are the hypothesis in this case report.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Visual Perceptual Decision-Making in Freely Behaving Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The temporal dynamics of perceptual decisions offer a key window into the cognitive processes contributing to decision-making. Investigating perceptual dynamics in a genetically tractable animal model can facilitate the subsequent unpacking of the underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated the time course as well as fundamental psychophysical constants governing visual perceptual decision-making in freely behaving mice. We did so by analyzing response accuracy against reaction time (RT), i.e., conditional accuracy, in a series of two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) orientation discrimination tasks in which we varied target size, luminance, duration, and presence of a foil. Our results quantified two distinct stages in the time course of mouse visual decision-making: a "sensory encoding" stage in which conditional accuracy exhibits a classic trade-off with response speed, and a subsequent "short-term memory (STM)-dependent" stage in which conditional accuracy exhibits a classic asymptotic decay following stimulus offset. We estimated the duration of visual sensory encoding as 200&ndash;320 ms across tasks, the lower bound of the duration of STM as ~1700 ms, and the briefest duration of visual stimulus input that is informative as &le;50 ms. Separately, by varying stimulus onset delay, we demonstrated that the conditional accuracy function (CAF) and RT distribution can be independently modulated, and found that the duration for which mice naturally withhold from responding is a quantitative metric of impulsivity. Taken together, our results establish a quantitative foundation for investigating the neural circuit bases of visual decision dynamics in mice.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in the expression of fear and has been implicated in several anxiety disorders. This structure is densely innervated by DAergic projections that impinge on amygdalar neurons expressing various dopamine (DA) receptor subtypes, including D2 receptors (D2Rs). Although various pharmacological approaches have assessed the role of D2Rs in the CeA, the actual participation of postsynaptic D2Rs in the CeA to defensive behaviors remains unclear. Here, we investigated the distribution of D2Rs in the CeA and their role in modifying neuronal activity and fear related behaviors in mice. First, using the mouse reporter strain D2R-EGFP, we verified that D2Rs are present both in neurons of the CeA and in A10 dorsocaudal (A10dc) DAergic neurons that innervate the CeA. Moreover, we showed that pharmacological stimulation of D2Rs increases the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) cells present in the CeA, a type of neuron previously associated with reduced defensive behaviors. Finally, using a molecular genetics approach that discriminates postsynaptic D2Rs from presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, we demonstrated that mice carrying targeted deletions of postsynaptic D2Rs in the CeA display increased risk avoidance in exploratory tasks. Together, our results indicate that postsynaptic D2Rs in the CeA attenuate behavioral reactions to potential environmental threats.</p>

                Background: Because of yellow fever’s serious impact on health, vaccination is the principal strategy to control the disease. Administration of the yellow fever vaccine to breastfeeding women should be before they complete 9 months post-delivery, in order to prevent transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus to their infants through breast feeding. This study aimed to confirm whether the excretion of yellow fever vaccine virus is in milk of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers and to confirm the probable transmission to their infants through breast milk. Methods: Samples were taken as follows: one serum specimen was taken 3-14 days after the date of the vaccination, and breast milk specimens were taken at four different time points between 3-4 days apart. Specimens were obtained from eight nursing mothers, who received the YVF vaccine (17DD). Mothers were asymptomatic before and after the vaccine administration but their infants developed symptoms after administration. Maternal serum samples were tested for YFV specific IgM antibodies through immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA). RNA was extracted from serum and breast milk specimens and YFV RNA screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, five mothers (62.5%) were positive for YFV IgM and two mothers (25%) had YFV RNA in serum. Among milk specimens, YFV RNA was detected during the four different mentioned collection times as follows (positive milk specimens/total milk specimens): 3/8 (37.5 %), 4/6 (66.6%) and 1/4(25%). RNA was completely undetectable in the last collection time. Conclusions: YFV transmission from mothers to their babies through breast-feeding was highly probable indicated by the temporal relationship to mother’s YF vaccination.

                Background: Exercise leads to changes in hormonal concentration and metabolites which impacts growth and development; during physical activity, energy metabolism is influenced by hormones associated with pubertal development, and characterization of its response to exercise is essential. Therefore, we aimed to identify the effects of exercise on thyroid hormones in children and adolescents with thyroid function disorders. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase based on the search strategy, and the articles were screened based on inclusion criteria, for which two independent reviewers conducted data extraction. The eligible studies were methodologically assessed using a modified Downs and Black’s checklist. The extracted data were summarized according to study population, intervention, type and duration, outcome measures, and results. Results: The total number of screened articles was 1,710, out of which six papers were included for review. Studies included children and adolescents with hypothyroidism, intellectual disabilities, and obesity who received exercise or physical activity as an intervention. The outcomes included thyroid hormones T3, T4, and TSH. Studies were generally of low quality. The findings of the studies throw some light on the benefits of exercise or physical activity. Conclusions: Structured physical activity and exercise followed for a more extended period showed some thyroid function changes in this population. The intensity of change was directly proportional to exercise intensity. However, this review does not provide sufficient evidence stating that exercise results in changes of thyroid function returning to normal, which requires further higher-quality studies to strengthen the review’s findings.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the impact of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the development of cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>MS patients aged 18-60 were evaluated for anti-nucleocapsid and anti-Spike RBD antibody with electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay; antibody responses to Spike protein, RBD, N-terminal domain with multiepitope bead-based immunoassays (MBI); live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay; T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TruCulture ELISA; and IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays. Assay results were compared by DMT class. Spearman correlation and multivariate analyses were performed to examine associations between immunologic responses and infection severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between 1/6/2021 and 7/21/2021, 389 MS patients were recruited (mean age 40.3 years; 74% female; 62% non-White). Most common DMTs were ocrelizumab (OCR) - 40%; natalizumab - 17%, Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators -12%; and 15% untreated. 177 patients (46%) had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 130 had symptomatic infection, 47 - asymptomatic. Antibody responses were markedly attenuated in OCR compared to other groups (p≤0.0001). T-cell responses (IFNγ) were decreased in S1P (p=0.03), increased in natalizumab (p&lt;0.001), and similar in other DMTs, including OCR. Cellular and humoral responses were moderately correlated in both OCR (r=0.45, p=0.0002) and non-OCR (r=0.64, p&lt;0.0001). Immune responses did not differ by race/ethnicity. COVID-19 clinical course was mostly non-severe and similar across DMTs; 7% (9/130) were hospitalized.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMTs had differential effects on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune responses did not correlate with COVID-19 clinical severity in this relatively young and non-disabled group of MS patients.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The presence of elevated dopamine (DA) and its major metabolites in the cytosol of neurons has been associated with their vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Over 99% of the cell's amines are confined to secretory vesicles (SVs), making these structures fundamental in the regulation of cytosolic DA levels. SVs of platelets use similar, if not the same mechanisms to accumulate serotonin in SVs as dopaminergic neurons do to store DA. Hence, any functional defects in platelets probably mirrors events in DA neurons.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have isolated fresh platelets from the blood of 75 PD patients, 116 matched controls and 24 patients with Parkinsonism, assaying serotonin handling (basal content, accumulation, secretion and spontaneous leakage).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a dramatic decrease in the serotonin content and uptake by SVs, as well as decreased thrombin-induced release by platelets from PD patients but not in those from most Parkinsonism cases. Platelets from PD patients also failed to retain serotonin in SVs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings indicate a functional impairment in the handling of amines by SVs in PD patients. This defect may serve as a biomarker of PD, and the approach described here may be potentially used for the subclinical detection of PD and to establish a platform to assay disease modifying drugs.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Caffeine consumption and dementia: Are Lewy bodies the link?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the association between caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 888 participants aged 59+ from the Rush Memory and Aging Project(MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ from UK Biobank(UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (e.g. AD, Lewy bodies, vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio(HR), regression and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In MAP, compared to ≤100mg/d, caffeine intake &gt;100mg/d was associated with a significantly higher HR(95%CI) of all-cause[1.35(1.03,1.76)] and Alzheimer's[1.41(1.07,1.85)] dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline. In UKB, compared to ≤100mg/d, the HRs(95%CI) of all-cause dementia for consuming 100≤200, 200≤300, 300≤400 and &gt;400mg/d were 0.83(0.72,0.94), 0.74(0.64,0.85), 0.74(0.64,0.85) and 0.92(0.79,1.08), respectively. Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake &gt;100mg/d was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies[Odds ratio(95%CI): 0.40(0.21,0.75)].</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons.</p>

                Ayloo et al. reveal a mechanism of how blood-CNS barriers are actively maintained by the CNS microenvironment. They discovered that a ligand-receptor signaling between pericyte-secreted vitronectin and its endothelial cell receptor integrin α5 is critical to suppress transcytosis to ensure barrier integrity in mice.

                Hu et al. find that methylene-bridge-containing polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and DHA covalently modify surface tryptophan of membrane-targeting proteins, including PDK1 and AKT2, and recruit them to the cytoplasmic membrane to activate AKT signaling. The EPA and DHA actions facilitate glucose uptake but can also induce insulin resistance.

                Murakami et al. show that Drosophila S2 cell temperature is maintained by DESAT1-dependent unsaturation of phospholipid acyl chains via modulation of mitochondrial respiration coupled with thermogenesis. Mitochondrial respiration is potentiated upon cold exposure in a DESAT1-dependent manner. We propose a cell-autonomous mechanism for intracellular temperature control in living cells.
