">Memory-specific E-I balance supports diverse replay and mitigates catastrophic forgetting</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is the brain's central locus for memory processing. In a widely accepted hypothesis, the hippocampus stores short-term memories in attractor states, which are then consolidated in the neocortex as long-term memories. Hippocampal replay activities play a pivotal role in memory consolidation, but memories are only transiently, not persistently, replayed, casting doubt on the attractor memory hypothesis. Concepts like memory capacity, the upper bound on the number of storable stable memories in a neural network, may also need to be revised if their offline transient activation is more essential for memory consolidation. Here, we explore the biologically plausible mechanism of offline memory processing by asking a recurrent spiking network to replay reliably as many stored assemblies as possible. We demonstrate the importance of memory-assembly-specific inhibitory plasticity for replaying diverse memory assemblies. Furthermore, our results highlight the role of transient memory states in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

">Theory of Mind and Discourse Production in Schizotypy: An fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizotypy (ST) reflects subclinical traits linked to schizophrenia spectrum disorders and associated cognitive and social impairments. Theory of Mind (ToM) and discourse production deficits are well documented in schizophrenia (SZ), yet the neural basis of discourse-related ToM processes in ST remains unclear. This study investigated brain activation during narrative planning and production in individuals with schizotypal traits. Methods: Thirty young adults (mean age = 18.8 years) completed standardized assessments, including the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief Revised (SPQBR), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), depression (PHQ9), and dissociation (DESB). Participants performed a discourse task in an fMRI scanner, describing nine-panel cartoons requiring inference of character intentions. Behavioral discourse metrics included total and inferred events. fMRI analyses examined activation during planning and production phases, with SPQBR positive, negative, and disorganized traits entered as regressors. Results: Schizotypal traits correlated with multiple psychosocial risk factors, including elevated depression, ACEs, and dissociation (r = .48 .82, p < .01). During planning, canonical ToM/self-referential regions (vmPFC, precuneus, insula) were recruited. Positive traits correlated with increased activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and lingual gyrus, whereas disorganized traits were associated with reduced activation in the precuneus and lingual gyri. During production, networks spanning vmPFC, hippocampus, right TPJ, and basal ganglia were engaged. Negative traits correlated with increased motor/premotor activation, while disorganized traits correlated with reduced activation in lingual gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate distinct neural correlates of schizotypal traits during discourse planning and production, supporting models of schizophrenia spectrum risk emphasizing disrupted inference and integration processes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-952/v1?src=rss">Multimodal Machine Learning Approach for Diagnosing Atopic Dermatitis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory skin disease with diverse clinical presentations, often overlapping with other dermatoses. Its diagnosis remains largely dependent on clinical expertise, leading to variability and limited diagnostic accuracy, particularly among general practitioners. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates lesion image analysis and structured anamnesis to improve AD diagnosis. Methods This diagnostic study was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 used retrospective data from 2021–2024, and Phase 2 involved prospective external validation from multiple hospitals in 2025. Patients with AD or related skin conditions were included, with diagnoses based on AAD 2014 criteria. Multimodal fusion combined ResNet50-extracted image features and MPNet-based anamnesis text features using a late fusion model. This approach mimics clinical reasoning by integrating visual and contextual clinical information to classify cases as AD or non-AD. Results and Discussion The multimodal AI model integrating ResNet50 (image) and MPNet (anamnesis) achieved 98.28% accuracy in classifying AD vs non-AD, outperforming image-or text-only models. It offers clinical advantages by mimicking physician reasoning, improving diagnostic consistency, reducing subjectivity, and enabling mass triage. However, real-world generalizability remains a challenge due to limited training diversity, potential language constraints (Bahasa Indonesia), and narrow differential diagnoses. External validation and explainable AI (XAI) are critical for broader application. Despite limitations, the model aligns with emerging literature, showing multimodal AI can approach or surpass expert-level performance in dermatological diagnosis when rigorously validated. Conclusions The multimodal ResNet50-MPNet model shows near-perfect accuracy in diagnosing AD by mimicking clinician reasoning. It offers consistent, holistic assessment but requires external validation and improved interpretability for clinical adoption. Continued AI-clinician collaboration is vital to translating this promising technology into real-world dermatological care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-133/v3?src=rss">Mortality involving and not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated in England between Apr 21 and May 23 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy may be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, may have increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-951/v1?src=rss">Impact of antibiotics on the genomic expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the East African community: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern, with the greatest burden observed in lower-middle-income countries. Monitoring AMR through a One Health approach is essential to understand the link between clinical, animal, and environmental sources and to develop targeted interventions. Objectives This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of antibiotics on gene expression in Pseudomonas spp. within the East African Community (EAC). Methodology A thorough literature search across Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed yielded 284 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria after screening. The selected studies came from five EAC countries. Findings showed a high prevalence of AMR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with over 90% resistance to most antibiotics, except Amikacin, which remained effective likely due to limited usage. Results and discussion Common resistance genes identified included carbapenemases such as blaNDM-1 and blaVIM. The disc diffusion method was the most commonly used technique (50%).Multidrug-resistant clones like ST244 and ST357 were frequently reported. Environmental isolates had lower resistance rates (54%) compared to clinical strains (73%), suggesting differing selection pressures. Most studies originated from Kenya and Uganda (each 30%), reflecting differences in research capacity and healthcare infrastructure across the region. Conclusion These results underscore the urgent need for expanded AMR surveillance, stronger antimicrobial stewardship, and further research to inform public health responses in East Africa.

                Background There is a limited range of treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a cancer known for its aggressiveness; therefore, innovative alternative therapies are required. A link between TNBC progression and bacterial dysbiosis in the gut microenvironment has been demonstrated. Thai traditional formulary medicine (TTFM), comprising bioactive natural products and medicinal plants, exhibits anti-cancer properties. However, the effectiveness of TTFM against breast cancer (BC) has not been clarified. The present study aimed to identify the secondary metabolites of TTFM and investigate its effects on BC both in vitro and in vivo. Methods The metabolite profiles of TTFM extracts were investigated using LC-MS/MS analysis. The anti-cancer activities were examined using a cell viability assay. The effects on the apoptosis pathway and gene expression profiles were also investigated using an apoptosis assay and RNA sequencing analysis. Next, TTFM extracts were examined in 4T1 xenografted mouse models. The gut microbiota profiles and tumor gene expression were investigated by 16S rDNA sequencing and nanoString, respectively. Results LC-MS/MS identified 302 compounds in the TTFM extract. In breast cancer cells, TTFM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Additionally, TTFM treatment partially restored the gut microbiota balance, increasing the abundance of Butyrivibrio hungatei and reducing Clostridium saccharolyticum. NanoString analysis showed that TTFM modulated immune responses by upregulating the Pias1 gene and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1r2, IL-1β, IL-2) and cancer-related genes (Ccno, Nkd1). Conclusion This study highlights the anti-cancer potential of TTFM extracts, suggesting its future use in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

                <p>by Han-Jia Jiang, Jugoslava Aćimović, Tiina Manninen, Iiro Ahokainen, Jonas Stapmanns, Mikko Lehtimäki, Markus Diesmann, Sacha J. van Albada, Hans Ekkehard Plesser, Marja-Leena Linne</p>

Astrocytes engage in local interactions with neurons, synapses, other glial cell types, and the vasculature through intricate cellular and molecular processes, playing an important role in brain information processing, plasticity, cognition, and behavior. This study advances understanding of local interactions and self-organization of neuron-astrocyte networks and contributes to the broader investigation of their potential relationship with global activity regimes and overall brain function. We present six new contributions: (1) the development of a new model-building framework for neuron-astrocyte networks, (2) the introduction of connectivity concepts for tripartite neuron-astrocyte interactions in biological neural networks, (3) the design of a scalable architecture capable of simulating networks with up to a million cells, (4) a formalized description of neuron-astrocyte modeling that facilitates reproducibility, (5) the integration of experimental data to a greater extent than existing studies, and (6) simulation results demonstrating how neuron-astrocyte interactions drive the emergence of synchronization in local neuronal groups. Specifically, we develop a new technology for representing astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in distributed simulation code for large-scale spiking neuronal networks. This includes an astrocyte model with calcium dynamics, an extended neuron model receiving calcium-dependent signals from astrocytes, and a parallelized connectivity generation scheme for tripartite interactions between pre- and postsynaptic neurons and astrocytes. We verify the efficiency of our reference implementation through benchmarks varying in computing resources and network sizes. Our <i>in silico</i> experiments reproduce experimental data on astrocytic effects on neuronal synchronization, demonstrating that astrocytes consistently induce local synchronization in groups of neurons across various connectivity schemes and global activity regimes. By adjusting the strength of neuron-astrocyte interactions, we can switch the global activity regime from asynchronous to network-wide synchronization. This work represents an advancement in neuron-astrocyte modeling, introducing a novel framework that enables large-scale simulations of astrocytic influence on neuronal networks.

The brain exhibits rich oscillatory dynamics that play critical roles in vigilance and cognition, such as the neural rhythms that define sleep. These rhythms continuously fluctuate, signaling major changes in vigilance, but the widespread brain dynamics underlying these oscillations are difficult to investigate. Using simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI in humans who fell asleep inside the scanner, we developed a machine learning approach to investigate which fMRI regions and networks predict fluctuations in neural rhythms. We demonstrated that the rise and fall of alpha (8–12 Hz) and delta (1–4 Hz) power—two canonical EEG bands critically involved with cognition and vigilance—can be predicted from fMRI data in subjects that were not present in the training set. This approach also identified predictive information in individual brain regions across the cortex and subcortex. Finally, we developed an approach to identify shared and unique predictive information, and found that information about alpha rhythms was highly separable in two networks linked to arousal and visual systems. Conversely, delta rhythms were diffusely represented on a large spatial scale primarily across the cortex. These results demonstrate that EEG rhythms can be predicted from fMRI data, identify large-scale network patterns that underlie alpha and delta rhythms, and establish a novel framework for investigating multimodal brain dynamics.

                <p>by Azka Javaid, H. Robert Frost</p>

The accurate cell-level characterization of cytokine activity is important for understanding the signaling processes underpinning a wide range of immune-mediated conditions such as auto-immune disease, cancer and response to infection. We previously proposed the SCAPE (Single cell transcriptomics-level Cytokine Activity Prediction and Estimation) method to address the challenges associated with cytokine activity estimation in human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Here, we propose a new method MouSSE (Mouse-Specific Single cell transcriptomics level cytokine activity prediction and Estimation) for performing cytokine activity estimation in murine scRNA-seq and ST data. MouSSE estimates the cell-level activity of 86 distinct cytokines using a gene set scoring approach. The cytokine-specific gene sets used by MouSSE are constructed using experimental cytokine stimulation data from the Immune Dictionary and cell-level scores are computed using a modification of the Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM) technique that supports both positive and negative gene weights. MouSSE is validated using data from both the Immune Dictionary via stratified cross-validation and external scRNA-seq and ST datasets against 10 cytokine activity estimation methods. These results demonstrate that MouSSE outperforms comparable methods for cell-level cytokine activity estimation in mouse scRNA-seq and ST data. An example vignette and installation instructions for the MouSSE R package are provided at https://github.com/azkajavaid/MousseR-package.

                <p>by Anton Iyer, Adrian Alva, Adrián E. Granada, Shaon Chakrabarti</p>

Drug tolerant persisters (DTPs) drive cancer therapy resistance by temporarily evading drug action, allowing multiple routes to eventual permanent resistance. Despite clear evidence for DTPs, the timing of their emergence, proliferative nature, and how their population dynamics arise from measured single-cell kinetics remain poorly understood. Here we use time-lapse microscopy data from two cancer cell lines, integrating single-cell and population measurements, to develop a quantitative description of drug persistence. Contrary to the expectation that increasing levels of genotoxic stress should lead to slower times to division and faster times to death, we observe minor changes in the single-cell intermitotic and death time distributions upon increasing cisplatin concentration. Yet, population decay rates increase 3-fold, suggesting a surprising independence of the overall dynamics from the measured birth and death rates. To explain this phenomenon, we argue that the observed lineage correlations and concentration-dependent decay rates imply cell-state dependent fate choices made <i>both</i> pre and post-cisplatin as opposed to just post-drug birth/death rate-based competitive fate choices. We demonstrate that these cell-states, present in the pre-drug ancestors of DTP and sensitive cells, exhibit no difference in cycling speed and are inherited across at least 2-3 cellular generations. Post-drug survival versus death fates are decided with high probability by these pre-existing cell-states, but get modulated to some extent by the drug, leading to a drug concentration dependent state-fate map. A stochastic model implementing these rules simultaneously recapitulates the observed decay rates and cell-fate lineage correlations. The model also demonstrates how the use of barcode diversity change before and after drug might lead to misleading interpretations of the timing of persister fate decisions. Our results provide a conceptual framework for quantifying pre versus post-drug contributions to cell fate, without requiring knowledge of the underlying molecular architecture of the heterogeneous cell states.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-949/v1?src=rss">Behavioral Finance in the sphere of investment: Systematic Review of Literature between 2020 and 2025 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Behavioral finance is a growing field that explores how cognitive biases and psychological factors—such as emotions, heuristics, and social influence—affect financial decision-making. This paper investigates how behavioral biases have evolved and influenced investment behavior in light of recent technological and market developments. Methods A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing on peer-reviewed publications from 2020 to 2025. A total of 30 studies were analyzed, selected from databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Emerald using criteria including relevance, recency, and empirical focus. The selected literature was categorized based on psychological biases, methodological approaches, and emerging themes in investor behavior. Results The findings highlight that traditional biases such as overconfidence, herding, anchoring, and loss aversion continue to dominate investment behavior. Moreover, the review identifies automation bias—a newer bias arising from investor over-reliance on AI and fintech platforms. Studies show that technological innovation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising retail investor activity have intensified behavioral distortions. Conclusion Behavioral finance remains essential for understanding real-world investment behavior. Enhancing financial literacy, incorporating behavioral nudges, and updating regulatory frameworks are critical for mitigating the negative effects of these biases. The study offers a forward-looking perspective on integrating behavioral insights into investment strategies and calls for future research into AI-driven finance, cross-cultural effects, and the role of fintech in shaping investor psychology. This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research published between 2020 and 2025. This review identifies key behavioral biases, such as overconfidence, herding, anchoring, and loss aversion, that continue to dominate investor behavior. It also highlights emerging biases, including automation bias, resulting from increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and fintech platforms. This study analyzed 30 peer-reviewed articles using various methodologies, including surveys, experiments, and econometric models.

                Background Bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has emerged as an effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity. Despite its benefits, howver, it may result in severe complications. One rare but serious postoperative issue is the development of a gastrobronchial fistula (GBF), a condition with a challenging diagnosis and management pathway due to its insidious nature. Case Presentation We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2015. The early postoperative course was complicated by a gastric fistula that was managed with double pigtail stents. Subsequently, the patient developed recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, and imaging in 2017 revealed a GBF connecting the gastric remnant to the bronchial tree. Initial endoscopic management with stenting failed because of migration. Definitive surgical management involved complex adhesiolysis and creation of tension-free fistula-jejunal anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Discussion Gastrothoracic fistula post-bariatric surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Their development is often linked to the insufficient treatment of early gastric leaks or collections. Diagnosis is frequently delayed owing to nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic approaches have show limited success, and surgical management, often complex, is frequently necessary. Multidisciplinary strategies, including endoscopic and surgical options, are vital for achieving favorable outcomes. Conclusion Gastrobronchial fistulas represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge following sleeve gastrectomy. A high index of suspicion, long-term follow-up, and tailored multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective management and resolution. Awareness of this rare complication should prompt early detection and intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality.

                Introduction Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. Case Presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. Conclusion Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-699/v2?src=rss">The antimicrobial activity of EDTA in combination with Meropenem, Amikacin, and Piperacillin-Tazobactam against hospital-multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance presents a critical challenge to public health. In Iraq, the increasing rise of resistance strains further confirms the need for innovative treatment strategies. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has shown promise in enhancing antibiotic efficacy via destabilizing bacterial membranes and disrupting biofilms. Objectives This study examines the effects of combining EDTA with commonly used antibiotics on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a major hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. Additionally, it assesses the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in these bacterial strains. The main goal is to improve treatment outcomes and address the growing challenges of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings. Methods This experimental in vitro study evaluates the effects of combining EDTA with meropenem, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from clinical samples. Results The results show that EDTA enhanced the antibiotics’ effectiveness, increasing inhibition zone diameters and improving bacterial susceptibility. The inhibition zone expanded by approximately 2 to 5 millimeters. Resistance patterns shifted, with some previously resistant or intermediate strains becoming susceptible when treated with the combined therapy. In conclusion, EDTA increases the efficacy of meropenem, amikacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Conclusion This presents a promising approach to improve treatment options for infections caused by resistant pathogens. Further research is needed to understand EDTA’s mechanisms and clinical applications.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapidly digitising educational system due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made a change in leadership imperative. A key framework for improving organisational effectiveness in handling these changes is digital leadership. It combines technological competencies with traditional leadership. Even with increased scholarly interest, there remains a gap in the thorough analysis of the field’s intellectual framework, thematic evolution, and collaborative dynamics. This study addresses this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of digital leadership research in education from 1993 to 2024, employing RStudio to map publication trends, influential sources, author productivity, conceptual themes, and social structures. Data from 338 Scopus-indexed documents reveal a significant rise in publications post-2010, peaking in 2023, with core journals such as Education and Information Technologies and Cogent Education dominating the field. However, the notable decline observed in 2024 indicates that the decline in publications may be due to research saturation, a change in research priorities, or funding. Prolific authors like Karakose T., Altinay F., and Z. underscore the centrality of collaborative research, while thematic mapping identifies key clusters: digital competence, virtual leadership, and institutional innovation. Thematic evolution highlights a post-pandemic pivot toward digital transformation and AI integration, though niche areas like K-12 digital leadership remain underdeveloped. Social network analysis reveals dispersed yet growing global collaborations, with the United States, Turkey, and the United Kingdom as dominant hubs, while disparities persist in Global South participation. The study’s implications emphasize the need for interdisciplinary research, equitable global partnerships, and policy frameworks that prioritize digital leadership training for educators. Practitioners are encouraged to implement adaptive strategies to leverage emerging technologies, ensuring sustainable learning outcomes. This analysis provides a foundation for future research and practice in digital leadership by delineating the field’s conceptual and social networks, thereby bridging the divides between theory, policy, and institutional practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-946/v1?src=rss">Spigelian Hernia: Diagnostic Challenges And Therapeutic Approaches: Report of Fourteen Clinical Cases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Although Spigelian hernia is rare, it should not be underestimated because of its significant risk of strangulation. The scarcity of studies and the absence of large, comprehensive case series on this pathology often makes clinical decision-making, despite appearing straightforward, both challenging and ambiguous. Methods This is a retrospective, monocentric study, conducted between January 2013 and December 2022, involving 14 patients who underwent surgery for a Spigelian hernia in the General Surgery Department of Charles Nicole Hospital in Tunis. Various epidemiological, clinical, radiological, and therapeutic factors were analysed using univariate analysis and logistic regression analyses. Results Fourteen patients with Spigelian hernia were recruited. The mean patient age was 62 years. All patients had predisposing factors for increased intra-abdominal pressure, and 50% had a history of abdominal surgery. The most common symptom was lateralized abdominal pain. Diagnosis was supported by imaging in 85.7% of cases, with CT scans being particularly helpful in emergency settings. Surgical repair was performed in all patients, predominantly via an open approach (92.8%). Primary suture repair was used in 64.2% of cases, while mesh repair was performed in 35.7%. The postoperative course was uneventful in 85.7% of patients. Morbidity was 14.2%, with no mortality. One recurrence was observed during follow-up. Conclusions Despite its rarity, Spigelian hernia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of localized abdominal pain. Imaging, particularly CT, plays a key role in diagnosis.

                Background Syphilis is a cosmopolitan infection, with recent infections (primary or secondary syphilis <1 year) posing the highest risk of mother-to-child transmission. In such cases, early treatment is crucial in determining obstetric prognosis. Objective This study aims to present current data of syphilis in pregnant women and improve the management of syphilis in pregnant women in the city of Kisangani. Methods This is an analytical case-control study covering the period from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. The study was conducted at Makiso Kisangani General Referral Hospital, with a study population of 290 pregnant women. A non-exhaustive sampling method was used, selecting, in the obstetrical department, a sample of 145 pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis and 145 others diagnosed with out syphilis. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.3. Results The most represented age group was 20 to 34 years (61.4%). The majority of pregnant women with syphilis were married (61.4%), in monogamous relationships (72.4%), and had unemployed partners (26.9%). The most common risk factors were having a partner who was a driver (OR: 3.31; p = 0.028), a trader (OR: 8.08; p <0.001), and having a history of STIs (p <0.001) or multiple sexual partners (p = 0.011). In 75% of cases, pregnancy resulted in the birth of a live fetus and 25% cases result in the birth of a died fetus. Conclusion Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis could be reduced through early detection and standard treatment of syphilis for pregnant women and their husbands/sexual partners.

                Background Based on signs prohibiting certain actions, people warn others using imperative forms of verbs or give a soft warning using politeness strategies. This study clarified how native Japanese speakers and Uzbek Japanese learners perform warnings based on prohibited signs. Methods After clarifying the difference between prohibition and warning, we proposed a classification scheme for the latter speech act in terms of politeness. Data were elicited using a discourse completion task. We prepared tasks for how participants verbally warn people who are about to perform prohibited acts in museums and hospitals, based on the prohibited signs. Results Native Japanese speakers tended to mitigate warnings by using two politeness strategies. The first politeness strategy was the use of rule-based expressions such as “It is forbidden.” However, such expressions may make the hearer feel that the speaker is an overbearing person who wields authority. To avoid this risk, Japanese speakers used the second politeness strategy of hedging inference, as in “Looks like it is forbidden.” They made it clear that the power to forbid does not rest with them, but with the public authorities, and furthermore, that it is only a possibility of their own speculation. The Uzbek learners of Japanese, on the other hand, were more direct in their warnings than the Japanese, and implemented a politeness strategy of apology as compensation. In some cases, the Japanese group and the Uzbek Japanese learners’ group did not warn. They did not warn strangers. Conclusions The characteristics of Uzbek learners of Japanese were found to follow the general characteristics of the learners’ language. This study presented a framework for classifying warnings about prohibited acts. This framework is applicable to languages other than Japanese, Uzbek, and Japanese spoken by Uzbek learners of Japanese.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) constitute a major public health challenge globally. The increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases in South Africa continues to impact mortality and morbidity, including disability, necessitating the need to explore the growing burden of NCDs and their implications for public health. NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory diseases are associated with various factors, ranging from lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and socioeconomic differences. Therefore, this review will explore and describe the prevalence of NCDs, associated risk factors, and the impact on the South African public healthcare system. Methods The five-step review described by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology: (1) determining the research question, (2) comprehensive database search, (3) inclusion criteria, (4) data extraction, and (5) analysis and presentation of the results, will be used for this study. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-P) will guide this scoping review protocol. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 10 weeks, from 15 October to 31 December 2025. Literature search will be conducted across multiple electronic databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and grey literature. The literature search timeline is between 2000 and 2025. The eligibility of articles will be determined using a two-stage screening process. All articles will be individually assessed for eligibility by two reviewers, while any disagreements will be resolved by consensus. The extracted data from eligible articles will be synthesized and presented using charts and narrative summaries. Conclusion This scoping review will provide an evidence map of research available on the prevalence of NCDs in South Africa, with a description of the risk factors and interventions to prevent and control NCDs in South Africa, while also informing the development of targeted public health policies and interventions for NCDs in South Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-944/v1?src=rss">Hydrotherapy as a complementary intervention for academic stress in higher education: A public health perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The global rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has heightened the urgency to tackle modifiable risk factors, including chronic psychological stress. Faculty members in higher education institutions are increasingly experiencing academic stress due to heavy workloads, administrative demands, and insufficient institutional support. Despite this, the well-being of faculty is often neglected as a crucial element in fostering knowledge and innovation, leading to burnout, reduced productivity, and a greater susceptibility to NCDs. This paper contends that hydrotherapy, long appreciated for its physiological and psychophysiological advantages, should be acknowledged as a non-pharmacological, evidence-based, and scalable solution for managing chronic academic stress. Hydrotherapy provides a comprehensive, proactive approach to faculty wellness by influencing stress-related biological pathways, especially the hypothalamic (pituitary) axis. Based on emerging clinical evidence and public health models, we propose the strategic incorporation of hydrotherapy into institutional wellness programs, viewing it not just as a relaxation method, but as a transformative intervention with the potential to improve long-term institutional vitality and public health outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-943/v1?src=rss">Antibiotic treatment of severe bacterial pneumonia: a scoping review to characterise the evidence for current treatment options [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The FAIR project is evaluating flagellin aerosol therapy (FLAMOD) as an adjunct to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pneumonia. Our scoping review characterises the existing evidence for the antibiotic treatment of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia (SBP) to inform future health economic modelling of FLAMOD versus standard-of-care. Methods A systematic search identified relevant publications (January 2001 to July 2021) in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and other sources. Clinical trials and cohort studies of antibiotic treatments in hospitalised patients with SBP reporting clinical efficacy, mortality, or length of hospital stay were eligible. Two reviewers independently applied the review methods. The study data were extracted into a bespoke Microsoft Access database. Results Over half of the 327 included studies were retrospective cohort studies and the remainder were RCTs (20%) or prospective cohort studies (23%). Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was the most common type of pneumonia (39%). Among 144 studies that treated specific bacteria, gram-negative pathogens (22.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (20.1%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.4%) were the most common. In 236 studies reporting treatment with specific antibiotics, 44% used an antibiotic from the WHO reserve list of antibiotics and a third mapped to a single drug class (commonly polymyxins, 20 studies). Mortality was the most frequently reported outcome (27.9% of studies on severe CAP). Conclusion We characterised evidence for antibiotic treatment in patients with SBP. Our database provides us with the flexibility to identify evidence for a future economic model to assess whether FLAMOD can be a cost-effective adjunct to conventional antibiotic treatment of AMR. Evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics in SBP is plentiful, but heterogeneous. We highlight challenges for evidence synthesis, including difficulties in identifying studies specifically on severe pneumonia, lack of clear reporting about whether treatment is empirical or definitive, and inconsistent reporting of the line of therapy and levels of antibiotic resistance.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wit</a></h4>

              
                Background Good care and conscious, mindful parenting are the essential requirements of the early childhood period. Good care in early childhood consists of mindful handling of children’s needs like hunger, care in sickness, socio-emotional needs, safety, love and affection. Good care promotes children’s development and provides a favourable environment for learning. It’s a well-known fact that hospitalization is a stressful situation for child of any age. Play is an integral part of early childhood period which is virtually restricted in hospital settings. This study will try to explore the effectiveness of play therapy delivered in hospital settings, on early child development (ECD). Methods This will be a randomized control trial conducted in the Paediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital in Wardha, India. The sample size will be 360 children, 180 each in intervention and control arm. The hospitalized children from intervention arm will receive customized Play Therapy sessions from trained research assistants and will be followed up at scheduled monthly home visits for one year from the date of enrolment. All children will be assessed for changes in cognitive, motor and socio-emotional development scores. The differences in development scores between intervention and control groups will be compared and effect sizes of changes will be calculated. Discussion Implementation of play stimulation activities have been reported as useful strategies for promoting child development and good recovery during hospitalization. This trial will attempt to explore the effectiveness of play therapy on changes in child development scores of children from intervention group compared to the control group. The customized play therapy program will be adapted to paediatric inpatient settings, and attempts will be made to improve the Play Therapy kit for hospitalized children.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104057">Maintenance of neuronal TDP-43 expression requires axonal lysosome transport</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 mislocalization and pathology occurs across a range of neurodegenerative diseases, but the pathways that modulate TDP-43 in neurons are not well understood. We generated a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line and performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference FACS-based screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 levels in neurons. A meta-analysis of our screen and publicly available screens identified both specific hits and pathways present across multiple screens, the latter likely responsible for generic protein level maintenance. We identified BORC, a complex required for anterograde lysosome transport, as a specific modifier of TDP-43 protein, but not mRNA, levels in neurons. BORC loss led to longer half-life of TDP-43 and other proteins, suggesting lysosome location is required for proper protein turnover. As such, lysosome location and function are crucial for maintaining TDP-43 protein levels in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106508">Blue-shifted ancyromonad channelrhodopsins for multiplex optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Light-gated ion channels from protists (channelrhodopsins or ChRs) are optogenetic tools widely used for controlling neurons and cardiomyocytes. Multiplex optogenetic applications require spectrally separated molecules, which are difficult to engineer without disrupting channel function. Scanning numerous sequence databases, we identified three naturally blue-shifted ChRs from ancyromonads. They form a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree and contain residue motifs characteristic of anion ChRs (ACRs). However, only two conduct chloride, whereas the closely related <i>Nutomonas longa</i> homolog generates inward cation currents in mammalian cells under physiological conditions, significantly exceeding those by previously known tools with similar spectral maxima (peak absorption at ~440 nm). Measurements of transient absorption changes and pH titration of purified proteins combined with mutant analysis revealed the roles of the residues in the photoactive site. Ancyromonad ChRs could be activated by near-infrared two-photon illumination, a technique that enables the deeper-tissue optogenetic activation of specific neurons in three dimensions. Both ancyromonad ACRs allowed optogenetic silencing of mouse cortical neurons in brain slices. <i>Ancyromonas sigmoides</i> ACR (<i>Ans</i>ACR) expression in cholinergic neurons enabled photoinhibition of pharyngeal muscle contraction in live worms. Overall, our results deepen the mechanistic understanding of light-gated channel function and expand the optogenetic toolkit with potent, blue-shifted ChRs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106481">Human single-neuron activity is modulated by intracranial theta burst stimulation of the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Direct electrical stimulation of the human brain has been used for numerous clinical and scientific applications. At present, however, little is known about how intracranial stimulation affects activity at the microscale. In this study, we recorded intracranial EEG data from a cohort of patients with medically refractory epilepsy as they completed a visual recognition memory task. During the memory task, brief trains of intracranial theta burst stimulation (TBS) were delivered to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using simultaneous microelectrode recordings, we isolated neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex and tested whether stimulation enhanced or suppressed firing rates. Additionally, we characterized the properties of modulated neurons, clustered presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons by waveform morphology, and examined the extent to which modulation affected memory task performance. We observed a subset of neurons (~30%) whose firing rate was modulated by TBS, exhibiting highly heterogeneous responses with respect to onset latency, duration, and direction of effect. Notably, location and baseline activity predicted which neurons were most susceptible to modulation, although the impact of this neuronal modulation on memory remains unclear. These findings advance our limited understanding of how focal electrical fields influence neuronal firing at the single-cell level.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100749">Membrane binding properties of the cytoskeletal protein bactofilin</a></h4>

              
                Bactofilins are a widespread family of cytoskeletal proteins that are essential for bacterial morphogenesis, chromosome organization, and motility. They assemble into non-polar filaments independently of nucleotides and typically associate with the cytoplasmic membrane. Their membrane interaction is thought to involve a short N-terminal peptide, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we clarify the complete membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of the <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> bactofilin BacA and identify residues critical for its function. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that its affinity for membranes arises from hydrophobic residue-driven water exclusion and electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that this mode of membrane binding is conserved across diverse bacterial phyla. Importantly, we observe that BacA polymerization and membrane binding stimulate each other, and both of these processes are necessary for recruiting the membrane-bound client protein PbpC, a cell wall synthase that interacts with BacA via its N-terminal cytoplasmic region. PbpC can functionally replace the MTS of BacA when overproduced, demonstrating that client proteins contribute to the bactofilin-membrane association. Thus, bactofilin assembly and localization are determined by a complex interplay of different factors, thereby enabling the adaptation of these processes to the needs of the systems they control.

">Verbal Episodic Processing in Newborns</a></h4>

              
                During the first period of life, human infants rapidly and effortlessly acquire the languages they are exposed to. Although memory is central to this process, the nature of early verbal memory systems and the factors that determine retention and forgetting remain largely unknown. Behavioural and brain measures have demonstrated memory formation in newborns. However, word traces fade in the face of acoustic overlap, leading to interference and forgetting. Here, we investigate whether speakers' identity changes facilitate the separation into distinct acoustic episodes and the creation of non-overlapping verbal memories. Newborns (0-4 days-old) were tested in a familiarization-interference-test protocol, while neural cortical activity was recorded using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed higher neural activation for novel words compared to familiar ones in the test phase, indicating that the infants recognized the familiar words despite the presence of potentially interfering sounds. The recognition response was measured over the left inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) areas, known to be crucial for encoding auditory information and language processing. The neural response also involved the right IFG and STG, involved in interpreting vocal social cues and speaker recognition. These data show that speaker identity is a key feature of speech, enabling episodic-like memories from birth and evolutionary advantages at the outset of human communication.

">Population coupling of V1 and V4 neurons and its relation to local cortical state fluctuations and attention in macaque monkey</a></h4>

              
                Neurons couple to various degrees to the activity level of the local neighboring population whereby strongly coupled 'choristers' and weakly coupled 'soloists' have been identified as two extremes of a continuous spectrum. At the same time neuronal populations undergo coordinated On and Off cortical state activity fluctuations, which are locally modulated by attention. The population coupling of soloists and choristers suggests that soloists should show limited alignment with cortical state fluctuations, while choristers should exhibit profound alignment. To test this, we recorded neurons across cortical layers in macaque areas V1 and V4, while animals performed a feature based spatial attention task. As expected, we found a wide range of population coupling strength of neurons. In line with our prediction, coupling of choristers to cortical state changes (ON-OFF transitions) was generally stronger than that of soloists. The strength of population coupling of neurons was similar during spontaneous and stimulus driven activity. Allocation of attention to the receptive field reduced the population coupling strength. Attentional modulation of neurons was positively correlated with population coupling strength. While neurons on averaged retained their coupling strengths across conditions, some neurons can change coupling strength condition dependent, thereby potentially enhancing the coding abilities of cortical circuits.

">Sensitivity of the human temporal voice areas to nonhuman primate vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, research on voice processing in the human brain - particularly the study of temporal voice areas (TVA) - was dedicated almost exclusively to conspecific vocalizations. To characterize commonalities and differences regarding primate vocalization representations in the human brain, the inclusion of closely related nonhuman primates - namely chimpanzees and bonobos - is needed. We hypothesized that neural commonalities would depend on both phylogenetic and acoustic proximities, with chimpanzees ranking closest to Homo. Presenting human participants (N=23) with the vocalizations of four primate species (rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans) and regressing-out relevant acoustic parameters using three distinct analyses, we observed within-TVA, sample-specific, bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus activity for chimpanzee vocalizations compared to: all other species; nonhuman primates; human vocalizations. Within-TVA activity was also observed for macaque vocalizations. Our results provide evidence for subregions of the TVA that respond principally - but not exclusively - to phylogenetically and acoustically close nonhuman primate vocalizations, namely those of chimpanzees.

">Spatial predictive coding in visual cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that can explain how animals build internal models of their sensory environments by predicting sensory inputs. Predictive coding may capture either spatial or temporal relationships between sensory objects. While the original theory by Rao and Ballard, 1999 described spatial predictive coding, much of the recent experimental data has been interpreted as evidence for temporal predictive coding. Here we directly tested whether the "mismatch" neural responses in sensory cortex are due to a spatial or a temporal internal model. We adopted two common paradigms to study predictive coding: one based on virtual-reality and one based on static images. After training mice with repeated visual stimulation for several days, we performed multiple manipulations, including: 1) we introduced a novel stimulus, 2) we replaced a stimulus with a novel gray wall, 3) we duplicated a trained stimulus, or 4) we altered the order of the stimuli. The first two manipulations induced a substantial mismatch response in neural populations of up to 20,000 neurons recorded across primary and higher-order visual cortex, while the third and fourth ones did not. Thus, a mismatch response only occurred if a new spatial -- not temporal -- pattern was introduced.

">Gait adaptation to asymmetric foot-ground compliance applied by robotic footwear</a></h4>

              
                Perturbing foot-ground interaction dynamics has shown promise for eliciting adaptations to inter-limb weight-bearing symmetry, a critical target for rehabilitation of asymmetrical neuromotor deficits affecting gait. To date, this perturbation paradigm has been delivered via adjustable stiffness treadmills, in which the treadmill deck displaces under the foot during the stance phase of gait. Recently, we developed robotic footwear capable of delivering asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations during walking, offering a portable experimental platform for asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations, allowing it to be executed overground and on conventional treadmills. In this study, we quantified kinetic and spatio-temporal gait adaptation to a foot-ground compliance perturbation delivered by the novel robotic footwear. We found that participants shifted their vertical ground reaction force impulse, vertical pushoff peak, and peak braking force toward the unperturbed limb after the perturbation was removed, indicating a shift in neuromotor control elicited by the perturbation. We conclude that the robotic footwear can elicit weight bearing adaptations similar to adjustable stiffness treadmills, and that the dissipative mechanical properties of the shoes likely play a key role in the direction of the adaptation.

">Accelerated rTMS for Enhancing Intact Cognition: An Examination of Dose Effects on Electrocortical Indicators of Attention and Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND AND AIMS Improvements in cognition (e.g., attention, working memory) are common after repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment and have also been observed in non-clinical samples. This study investigated whether rTMS can enhance cognitive resilience in individuals who perform in high-stress environments using cognitive measures and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore potential neural mechanisms of rTMS-induced cognitive change. METHODS 40 college-educated adults not reporting cognitive or psychiatric concerns underwent a 5-day accelerated (10 sessions/ day) rTMS treatment and pre-post cognitive assessment. Participants were assigned to 1 of 10 doses defined as number of active vs. sham stimulation sessions/ day (total active pulses = 3,000-30,000). To assess cognitive effects, standard batteries (NIH Toolbox, Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows [WinSCAT]) were administered-and a subset (n=21) also did an N-Back working memory task with EEG measurement-before, immediately after, and 1 month after rTMS. For all indices, linear and quadratic correlations of pre-to-post-rTMS change with dose were examined to test if an optimal dose was achieved. RESULTS From pre- to post-rTMS, participants improved in fluid cognition (working memory, processing speed) as measured by NIH toolbox, t(39)=8.4, p<.001, d=1.3, and WinSCAT, t(39)=4.1, p<.001, d=.65; and, improvement in the latter related linearly to rTMS dose, r(39)=.40, p=.01. Regarding EEG, subjects who received high (6+ active sessions/day) also showed increased amplitudes of an event-related marker of stimulus-directed attention (P300) whether it was elicited by simple task targets, t(10)=3.1, p=.01, d=.95, or task-unrelated noise stimuli played during the task as probes of peripheral attention, t(10)=3.6, p=.005, d=1.1. Additionally, there were linear relationships between change magnitude and rTMS dose for simple task target-related, r(20)=.45, p=.04, and peripheral noise-related, r(20)=.54, p=.009, P300s. CONCLUSIONS rTMS improved fluid reasoning abilities and also changed how dynamic attention is deployed during high-demand challenges as a potential mediator of fluid cognition improvements. While linear dose-response relationships support that changes were rTMS-elicited, absence of a response curve asymptote also suggests that still-higher doses could be warranted to achieve maximal effects in non-clinical samples.

">Secondary nucleation of α-Synuclein drives Mitochondria dysfunctions and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The seeding of -Synuclein (Syn) is a key driver of Lewy pathology propagation in Parkinson's disease (PD) and forms the basis for recent diagnostic advances. However, it remains unclear how the structural and biochemical features of Syn seeds dictate their propagation efficiency, capacity to induce Lewy body formation, and resulting cellular toxicity. Using genetic and idiopathic PD cell models, we map the pathogenic cascade beginning with the seed-driven conversion of endogenous Syn, followed by impaired degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately Lewy body formation. By coupling kinetic modelling of aggregation with functional readouts, we identify secondary nucleation as the predominant mechanism generating toxic Syn aggregation intermediates, identifying the critical process that links seeding to pathology. Extending this framework to PD brain, we quantitatively correlate seeding capacity with the spatiotemporal spread and severity of Lewy pathology, revealing a mechanistic connection between Syn aggregation dynamics and disease progression at molecular, cellular, and anatomical levels. By unifying molecular mechanism with clinicopathological progression, our work identifies catalytic Syn fibrillar seeds as tractable targets for both disease-modifying therapy and biomarker development in PD.

">Bodily Self in Macaque Monkeys and Human Infants</a></h4>

              
                Whether monkeys possess the concept of bodily self remains controversial. We found that macaque monkeys trained for mirror self-recognition (MSR) could spontaneously recognize themselves when viewing video images of their back from a third-person perspective (3PP), but this generalization required a few minutes of "exploration". In contrast, through visual-tactile synchronization training similar to that used in human out-of-body studies, naive monkeys could recognize themselves from 3PP back images and demonstrated MSR within seconds. Interestingly, in human infants, we found that 3PP back self-recognition developed spontaneously several months after MSR. These results demonstrate the existence of hierarchical bodily self in macaques and similar stepwise development of bodily self in human infants, offering insights into the emergence and manifestation of bodily self in natural and artificial intelligence.

">Optimizing and assessing multichannel TMS focality</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multichannel transcranial magnetic stimulation (mTMS) enables electronic steering of induced electric fields across multiple cortical targets without physical coil repositioning, addressing key limitations of conventional single-channel TMS (sTMS). However, determining optimal input currents for focal stimulation remains challenging, and different mTMS systems have not been systematically compared under realistic hardware constraints. Objective: To develop an user-centric framework for optimizing and assessing mTMS focality by introducing a generic optimization algorithm, establishing meaningful focality metrics, and comparing mTMS coil arrays with traditional single-channel TMS across cortical targets. Methods: We developed a fast optimization framework incorporating target E-field constraints via parametrization of degenerated hyperellipsoids, explicitly integrating current-rate limits, for example from stimulator electronics and coil heating. Using high-resolution finite-element models of nine individual brains, we compared two mTMS designs (5-channel planar and 6/12-channel spherical systems) with standard sTMS figure-of-eight coils. Three complementary metrics quantified performance: Focality, Target2Max, and OverstimulatedArea. Results: Despite using a single optimized placement for all region-of-interest targets, mTMS achieved focality comparable to repositioned single-channel TMS. For superficial targets, single-channel TMS showed slightly better focality, but for deeper cortical targets (>25mm skin-cortex distance), mTMS performed similarly. More stimulation channels improved focality but required stronger current-rate constraints. The planar design performed better for deeper targets, while spherical designs improved with additional channels. Conclusion: mTMS systems demonstrate remarkable performance comparable to standard TMS, enabling efficient multi-target stimulation without repositioning. Our open-source framework provides practical tools for designing and evaluating mTMS systems, supporting goal-directed mTMS development and effective application.

">Multisensory attenuation of the pupil light response in autistic and non-autistic children</a></h4>

              
                Autonomic responses to sensory stimuli are altered in autism, yet little is known about how multisensory input modulates these responses. This study examined whether auditory stimuli affect the pupil light reflex (PLR), a parasympathetically driven response to light, in autistic and non-autistic children. Pupillometry was used to measure responses to visual-only (V), auditory-only (A), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli in 72 children aged 6-14 years (34 non-autistic, 38 autistic). We hypothesized that auditory input would attenuate pupil constriction in non-autistic children and that this cross-modal modulation might differ in autism, reflecting altered sensory-autonomic functioning. Across groups, results revealed a consistent pattern: auditory stimuli elicited pupil dilation, visual stimuli evoked constriction, and simultaneous audiovisual stimuli led to attenuated constriction relative to visual-only trials. This attenuation lends support to prior findings of multisensory attenuation of the PLR. Time-binned analysis revealed a group effect during the 500-1000 ms post-stimulus window: autistic children showed significantly more positive baseline-corrected pupil responses across conditions (i.e., less constriction in V/AV and greater dilation in A), suggesting group differences in the dynamic trajectory of the pupil response. Contrary to expectations, autistic and non-autistic children did not differ significantly on peak constriction or constriction latency within visual conditions. Findings support the presence of cross-modal modulation of the PLR in both autistic and non-autistic children and suggest that auditory signals influence early-stage visual-autonomic processing similarly across groups. Pupillometry may provide a promising, noninvasive tool for probing sensory-autonomic interactions in autism. Future studies with paradigms optimized for pupil measurement may reveal more nuanced group differences and clarify links to real-world sensory challenges.

">Vascular-Perfusable Human 3D Brain-on-Chip</a></h4>

              
                Development and delivery of treatments for neurological diseases are limited by the tight and selective human blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although animal models have been important research and preclinical tools, the rodent BBB exhibits species differences and fails to capture the complexity of human genetics. Microphysiological systems incorporating human-derived cells hold great potential for modeling disease and therapeutic development, with advantages in screening throughput, real-time monitoring, and tunable genetic backgrounds when combined with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. Existing 3D BBB-on-chip systems have incorporated iPSC-derived endothelial cells but not the other major brain cell types from iPSCs, each of which contributes to brain physiology and disease. Here we developed a 3D Brain-Chip system incorporating endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, microglia, and oligodendroglia from iPSCs. To enable this multicellular 3D co-culture in-chip, we designed a GelChip microfluidic platform using a 3D printing-based approach and dextran-based engineered hydrogel. Leveraging this platform, we co-cultured and characterized iPSC-derived brain-on-chips and modeled the brain microvasculature of APOE4, the strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease. These 3D brain-on-chips provide a versatile system to assess BBB vascular morphology and function, investigate downstream neurological effects in disease, and screen therapeutics to optimize delivery to the brain.

">Cancer-induced Nerve Injury Unveils a Sympathetic-to-Sensory Nerve Axis in Head and Neck Cancer</a></h4>

              
                Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most painful cancers, with patients frequently reporting spontaneous, neuropathic-like pain. While sympathetic and sensory nerves have been individually implicated in cancer progression, whether and how these systems interact to drive pain and tumor growth has remained unclear. Here, we integrate prospective human data with reverse-translational mouse models to reveal that cancer-induced nerve injury unveils crosstalk between sympathetic postganglionic neurons and trigeminal sensory afferents in the tumor microenvironment. In patients, circulating norepinephrine (NE) correlated with spontaneous pain and perineural invasion, identifying a potential sympathetic contribution to disease burden. In mice, aggressive non-immunogenic OSCC tumors evoked spontaneous nociceptive behaviors, elevated tumoral NE, and sensory nerve injury marked by ATF3 expression and hyperexcitability. Tumor-associated sensory neurons acquired adrenergic sensitivity through 1-adrenergic receptor plasticity, while sympathetic neurons exhibited plasticity characterized by sprouting, altered gene expression, and heightened excitability, creating a maladaptive feed-forward loop that amplified nociceptive signaling. Disrupting this sympathetic-sensory communication by sympathectomy or selective ablation of TRPV1 sensory fibers reduced tumor growth, sympathetic tone, and spontaneous pain like behaviors, although sensory adrenergic sensitivity persisted. Together, these findings establish that reciprocal sympathetic-sensory plasticity and crosstalk in the tumor may fuel both OSCC progression and neuropathic like pain. Targeting this peripheral neuroplasticity may offer a translational strategy to limit tumor growth and alleviate pain.

">Genomic plasticity drives olfactory adaptation in a pest fly</a></h4>

              
                Preference shifts in insects are often driven by changes in the olfactory system, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The worldwide pest Drosophila suzukii, which oviposits in ripe rather than overripe fruits, provides a powerful model to study these mechanisms and their behavioral consequences. Here, we show that this shift is linked to functional remodeling in four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs): ab2B, ab3A, ab4B, and ab10A. While ab3A and ab10A exhibit tuning changes shared with the non-pest relative D. biarmipes, ab2B and ab4B display species-specific adaptations in D. suzukii. These changes result not only from receptor sequence divergence but also from novel innovations: receptor co-expression in ab3A and partitioned expression of Or67a paralogs in ab2B and ab10A. Together, these findings show how genomic plasticity in chemosensory gene families enables rapid sensory adaptation and niche transition.

">Cereblon-related mild intellectual disability disrupts response inhibition and uniformity of group--individual strategies</a></h4>

              
                Temporal processing, including duration, is essential for survival and communication across species. Intellectual disability (ID), which has diverse causes, including Cereblon (CRBN), impairs duration discrimination. CRBN-related ID, link to abnormal cognitive behaviors, may disrupt both perception and behavior during duration discrimination. However, cross-species behavioral strategies, their variation with ID, and associated behavioral indices remain unclear. Here, humans and wild-type (WT) mice with typical intelligence, and CRBN knockout (KO) mice with ID, performed an auditory duration discrimination task with Long (10 s) and Short (2 s) cues. All groups distinguished stimulus durations, but latency-based strategies diverged. KO mice showed impulsivity and divergent responses at both individual and group levels, whereas WT mice and humans consistently delayed their responses by ~2 s to the Short cue length, reflecting inhibition and convergent responses. In typical intelligence models, latencies for both stimuli clustered between 2--5 s, while in ID model depended on stimulus duration. Duration perception is a conserved cross-species capacity, while task-specific cognitive strategies are intrinsically preserved though variation emerges with ID. We suggest that latency indices dissociated inhibition from impulsivity, and convergence from divergence. We further suggest that CRBN-related ID preserves perceptual understanding but disrupts the shared behavioral language of typical intelligence.

">Psychedelics Relax Priors and Reshape Orbitofrontal Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics such as psilocybin and ketamine are gaining attention as rapid-acting treatments for psychiatric disorders, yet the mechanisms by which they alter cognition remain unclear. A key hypothesis from the REBUS model proposes that psychedelics relax high-level priors, allowing bottom-up sensory information to exert greater influence over perception and behavior. Here, we test this model in mice performing a free-response perceptual decision-making task that disambiguates prior-driven and sensory-driven decision strategies. Acute administration of psilocybin or ketamine significantly slowed decision times and improved accuracy. Behavioral modeling that combined drift diffusion and GLM-HMM frameworks revealed that these changes were mediated by increased decision thresholds and a marked shift into sensory-engaged cognitive states. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping identified a distributed decision-making network, with psychedelics selectively modulating cortical and subcortical nodes. Calcium imaging in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key region for integrating priors and sensory inputs, revealed preserved decision-related selectivity under psychedelics, while exhibiting reduced neuronal correlations, i.e. population-level signatures of weakened top-down influence and relaxed priors. Together, these results provide circuit-level support for the REBUS model, showing that psychedelics reconfigure brain-wide and local dynamics to promote more deliberate, flexible, and sensory-driven decision policies.

">Pre-stimulus Brain States Predict and Control Variability in Stimulation Responses</a></h4>

              
                Does the ongoing brain state determine how it responds to localized electrical stimulation? This fundamental question has major implications for neuroscience and medicine, as stimulation outcomes remain highly variable even when identical parameters ("how") and target sites ("where") are used. Such unpredictability undermines reproducibility, limits clinical reliability, and forces current protocols to rely on empirical trial-and-error rather than principled, evidence-based strategies. Mounting evidence suggests that the brain's state prior to stimulation--a crucial "when" factor--shapes responses, yet the most reliable predictive markers remain unknown. Here, we systematically characterize the links between pre-stimulus (spontaneous) activity and post-stimulus (evoked) responses using simultaneous high-density EEG and stereotactic EEG from 36 epilepsy patients across 379 sessions (21,800 stimulations). We show that large-scale neural dynamics robustly predict stimulation outcomes, with a subset of measures--particularly network synchronization, functional connectivity, and spatiotemporal signal diversity--consistently forecasting responses across sessions. Whole-brain activity enhanced prediction compared to local assessments, and predictability varied across networks, being strongest in sensorimotor and visual regions. These findings establish a quantitative framework for state-dependent brain stimulation: by timing interventions to optimal pre-stimulus states, variability can be reduced and reproducibility enhanced. Our results directly address the fundamental question of where and when to stimulate, providing a pathway toward evidence-based protocols with improved therapeutic precision.

">Mobile Eye-Tracking Glasses Capture Ocular and Head Markers of Listening Effort</a></h4>

              
                To extend the assessment of listening effort beyond a sound booth, we validated mobile eye-tracking glasses (Pupil Labs Neon) by comparing them to a stationary system (Eyelink DUO) in a controlled environment. We recorded eye movements, pupil size, and head movements from 26 young adults during a speech-in-noise task. When listening conditions became challenging, we observed reduced gaze dispersion and increased pupil sizes of similar magnitude from both devices, in addition to reduced head movements recorded solely by the mobile device. These findings suggest that mobile eye-trackers reliably capture listening effort, paving the path towards assessments in daily settings.

">A mobile circular DNA element drives memory-related processes in mice</a></h4>

              
                Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) are double stranded, closed loop DNA molecules that act independently of the genome. Here we report the discovery of a brain-enriched ecDNA, ecCldn34d, that regulates the transcriptional state of plasticity-related genes and is temporally associated with the stability of fear memories. ecDNA therefore represents a novel class of mobile DNA elements that are involved in experience-dependent neuroadaptation.

">Local translation of circular RNAs is required for synaptic activity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched in synapses and implicated in cognitive processes, and recent studies have shown that circRNAs can encode micropeptides, which suggests that there may be novel synaptic proteoforms in the brain that await discovery. Here we report widespread learning-induced local circRNA translation in the prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6 mice. More than 1500 synapse-enriched circRNAs contain active IRES elements, with 842 interacting with the ribosome and 241 exhibiting direct evidence of activity-induced translation. We discovered a synapse-enriched micropeptide (P1) that is derived from a single exon circRNA, the mRNA host of which encodes an enzyme associated with protein repair. Although P1 is only a third of the size of the full-length protein, it is locally expressed, enzymatically active, and interacts with plasticity-related proteins, including CaMKII. In addition to direct effects on synaptic activity, targeted P1 knockdown impairs whereas its overexpression enhances fear extinction memory. These findings shed new light on the "dark" proteome in the brain and reveal local circRNA translation as a novel mechanism of plasticity and memory.

">Prediction of treatment response in infantile epileptic spasms syndrome using EEG phase-amplitude coupling</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Treatment selection for infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) is complex and multifaceted, and currently no EEG biomarkers can guide this decision by predicting treatment response. We tested the predictive value of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), as IESS patients are known to have elevated PAC. Methods: We analyzed retrospective EEG recordings from 40 IESS patients, before and after treatment, and 20 healthy controls. Patients were classified as responders (n=25) or non-responders (n=15) based on short-term treatment outcomes. We measured PAC in each EEG using modulation index (MI) and mean vector length (MVL) and analyzed the relationship between pre- and post-treatment values and the ability of pre-treatment values to predict response. Results: MI and MVL values decreased with treatment in almost all subjects. However, non-responders had significantly higher pre-treatment MI than responders (P<0.05), suggesting utility for predicting treatment response. Logistic regression modeling suggested that a 0.5 unit decrease in log(MI), which is approximately one IQR of the pre-treatment log(MI) values, results in a 6-fold increase in odds of positive treatment response. Significance: MI reflects short-term treatment response and is a candidate predictive EEG biomarker for IESS. MI may offer individualized insights for treatment selection and management strategies for IESS.

">Explaining attractive and repulsive biases in the subjective visual vertical</a></h4>

              
                Perception of gravity can be assessed by measuring the subjective visual vertical (SVV), the visually indicated spatial direction that appears earth-vertical to an observer. When the SVV is measured in darkness while the observer is roll-tilted, it shows substantial biases. At tilts larger than 45{degrees}, the bias is attractive, that is, the visual indicator appears vertical when rotated toward the observer. At smaller tilts, however, a repulsive bias is observed. The attractive bias has been explained within the Bayesian framework as the effect of a prior for upright posture. The repulsive bias has so far been considered anti-Bayesian, suboptimal, or as the result of uncompensated ocular counterroll. Here we show that both biases can be explained within a purely Bayesian model. More specifically, the repulsive bias at small roll-tilts is a consequence of the known tilt-dependent variability of the SVV, which is hypothesized to reflect different levels of sensory noise of the otolith organs. We thus provide a solution to a century-old question of why there is a repulsive bias in vertical perception.

">Low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation offers both immediate and delayed neuroprotection in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model</a></h4>

              
                Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and the current standard of care, therapeutic hypothermia, provides only partial neuroprotection. This study investigates the potential of low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-TMS) as a novel non-pharmacological adjunct therapy by targeting a key pathological mechanism of HIE: a persistent, pathological increase in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, or hypoxic long-term potentiation (hLTP). Using a neonatal mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia, we administered a single session of LF-TMS shortly after the hypoxic event. We then evaluated its effects on synaptic function via slice electrophysiology and on brain injury volume using serial MRI. Our results show that hypoxia-ischemia induced a significant and lasting synaptic potentiation in the brain's penumbral region. A single LF-TMS treatment successfully reduced this elevated glutamatergic response to control levels, suggesting a therapeutic mechanism similar to long-term depression (LTD) by regulating AMPA receptor redistribution. Furthermore, LF-TMS provided significant neuroprotection, as demonstrated by a reduction in the volume of the ischemic core and penumbra 48 hours after the injury. LF-TMS did not alter excitability in sham-treated mice, confirming its safety as a targeted intervention for pathological conditions without affecting normal brain function. This study provides strong evidence that LF-TMS is a promising neuroprotective strategy that acutely and subacutely mitigates brain injury in a neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model.

                Gaining insight into the spectral and temporal alterations in brain connectivity associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may offer pathways toward more informative biomarkers and a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms. We propose FINE (Frequency-aware Interpretable Neural Encoder), a novel deep learning model designed to capture multi-scale temporal and frequency-specific patterns in dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from resting-state fMRI. FINE integrates multiple expert branches, including convolutional layers, learnable wavelet layers, transformers, and static encoders, enabling the joint modeling of temporal evolution and spectral content of brain networks in an end-to-end framework. Beyond classification, FINE supports frequency-wise interpretability by aligning gradient-based saliency maps with statistical group differences, revealing potential robust, biologically meaningful biomarkers of AD. Evaluated on the large OASIS-3 dataset (856 subjects), FINE achieves AD classification performance (ROC-AUC 0.769) and provides insights into frequency-specific connectivity disruptions, particularly within subcortical, sensorimotor, and cerebellar networks. Our results demonstrate that incorporating frequency-aware modeling and interpretable architectures can advance both disease classification and underlying functional disruption of AD-related brain dynamics.

">Encoding neural representations of time-continuous stimulus-response transformations in the human brain with advanced deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior arises from the continuous transformation of sensory input into goal-directed actions. While existing analytical methods often break time into discrete events, the stages and underlying representations involved in stimulus-response (S-R) transformations within time-continuous, complex environments remain only partially understood. Encoding models, combined with deep neural networks (DNNs) for feature generation, offer a promising framework for capturing these neural processes. While DNNs continue to improve in performance, it remains unclear whether these advances translate into more accurate models of brain activity. To address this, we collected fMRI data from participants (N = 23) as they played arcade-style video games and applied DNN-based encoding models to predict voxel-level brain activity. We compared the prediction accuracy of features from three DNNs at different stages of development within our encoding model. We show that the most advanced DNN provides the most predictive feature space for neural responses, while also exhibiting a closer hierarchical alignment between its internal representations and the brains functional organization. These results enable a more fine-grained characterization of time-continuous S-R transformations in high-dimensional visuomotor tasks, progressing along the dorsal visual stream and extending into motor-related regions. This approach highlights the potential of machine learning to advance cognitive neuroscience by enhancing the ecological validity of experimental tasks.

">Cell Type-Specific Remodelling of the Female Hippocampus by Reproductive Experience and Age</a></h4>

              
                Background: The hippocampus undergoes extensive cellular remodelling throughout life in response to multiple biological factors that shape its structure and function. Aging represents a fundamental driver of brain changes, with the hippocampus being particularly vulnerable to age-related concerns that contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease risk. Reproductive experience, including pregnancy and motherhood, triggers profound hormonal fluctuations and metabolic demands that are increasingly recognized as major modulators of brain plasticity, yet represent an understudied and often paradoxical dimension of neurobiological variation. Although reproductive experience and aging are each known to influence biology across the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, their independent and interactive effects on cellular composition have not been systematically examined using quantitative approaches that can resolve cell-type-specific changes. Methods: We performed cell type deconvolution using Single-cell deconvolution of cell types (SCDC) on bulk RNA-sequencing data from female rat hippocampus, comparing nulliparous and parous females across young/older ages (7 month or 13 month old Sprague-Dawley rats, parous: 30 days or 6 months after giving birth) and dorsal/ventral regions. We harmonized 201 cell type annotations from three single-cell reference datasets into 23 biologically coherent categories utilizing female only data. Three-way ANOVA was used to identify independent and interactive effects. Complementary analyses (random forest, PCA, DESeq2) identified parity-associated transcriptional signatures. Cell-specific functional enrichment was performed by weighted gene set enrichment meta-analysis across multiple pathway databases and metrics. Results: Age emerged as the dominant factor affecting hippocampal cellular composition, significantly altering 6 harmonized cell types, particularly impacting microglia and oligodendrocytes. Regional effects were more extensive, affecting 9 harmonized cell types, while age x region interactions were minimal affecting two harmonized cell types. Critically, parity exerted independent effects on three cell populations: dorsal CA3 pyramidal neurons (p=0.0086-0.010 across two datasets) and SST interneurons (p=0.029) both showed 15-25% decreases, while astrocytes increased (p=0.022). Cell-type-specific pathway analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms with enrichment for protein degradation pathways in CA3 pyramidal neurons (GSK3B and BTRC:CUL1-mediated degradation; ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Cyclin D), neuroinflammation pathways in astrocytes, and GABAergic signaling disruption in SST interneurons (signaling receptor activity; GPCR ligand binding). Conclusions: Reproductive experience selectively remodels hippocampal cellular architecture through distinct, cell-type-specific molecular programs that operate independently of age and regional factors. These findings show parity as a critical biological variable requiring consideration in neuroscience and aging research and suggest specific cellular targets for understanding how reproductive history influences brain function.

">Long-acting naltrexone restores network connectivity in subjects with co-morbid cannabis and opioid use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Co-morbid substance use disorders (SUDs) are common but difficult to study due to the complex, interacting, and overlapping mechanisms through which they affect brain networks. Many datasets collected to investigate a specific SUD include participants with co-morbid SUDs. While most studies treat comorbid SUDs as covariates of no interest, these covariates also contain untapped information. This is particularly relevant as cannabis use disorder (CanUD) has become increasingly prevalent and co-morbid with other SUDs that have been more thoroughly studied. While treatments have been established for multiple SUDs, none have been approved for CanUD, although naltrexone (NTX) has been associated with reduced use. Here, we conducted a retrospective secondary analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from individuals with primary opioid use disorder (OUD) with co-morbid CanUD, alcohol use disorder (AUD), or cocaine use disorder (CocUD), while controlling for opioid use. All participants underwent imaging prior to receiving a therapeutic dose of long-acting intramuscular NTX (Vivitrol), an approved treatment for OUD and AUD but not for CocUD, and again two weeks post-administration. At baseline, OUD individuals with co-morbid CanUD, AUD, or CocUD exhibited distinct functional connectivity (FC) alterations compared to those with OUD-only. These differences were greater in younger participants and primarily involved the default mode network. Following NTX administration, FC differences between the co-morbid CanUD and OUD-only groups globally diminished. A similar FC response to NTX was observed in the parietal, subcortical, sensory, and cerebellar networks in the co-morbid AUD group. In contrast, little change in FC was observed in co-morbid CocUD. These findings, combined with prior evidence that NTX reduces cannabis use by dampening the experience of reward, suggest NTX may hold promise as a treatment for CanUD.

">Discovering flexible codes for prediction across timescales in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Efficient coding theory postulates that a sensory system maximizes information between its response and the input, yet it is unclear if a different measure of optimality that takes into account output function might give a better fit to neural data. The sensory processing delays in many systems suggest that the maximization of predictive information is a reasonable objective function for driving fast, effective downstream behavior. We introduce a one-parameter family of optimal encoding distributions based on how far out in time a population of retinal ganglion cells is optimized to predict future stimuli. Analyzing the population response to a moving bar stimulus with rich temporal correlation structure identifies which particular optimal encoding best describes the neural activity. This allows for the discovery of how far out in time the retina is predicting, instead of simply testing for optimality at one timescale. As stimulus statistics change, so too does the time scale of prediction that best matches the population response. Focusing on this optimal timescale, the neural code can be evaluated in terms of classic efficient coding theory, revealing that the code also shows a peak in how these predictive bits are allocated in the population response repertoire. The stimulus has a fully controlled set of temporal statistics, but is still complex enough to show behaviors like starts and stops, constant motion, and motion reversals. Its tractable statistical structure allows for an information theoretic account of computations like motion anticipation and the retina reversal response in terms of the maximization of predictive information.

">Brain Microstructure and Obesity Risk in Early Childhood: Insights from Restriction Spectrum Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Pediatric obesity is a growing public health concern, yet little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of obesity risk in early childhood. Using restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), we examined associations between adiposity and brain microstructure in a cross-sectional sample of 159 children aged 4-7 years, including 81 with ADHD and 78 typically developing (TD) peers. We focused on RSI-derived measures of restricted diffusion-specifically restricted normalized isotropic (RNI), directional (RND), and total (RNT) signals-as indicators of cellular density in subcortical and cortical regions implicated in reward and salience processing. Body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, and obesity status were assessed. Higher BMI, but not other adiposity measures, was significantly associated with increased RNI in the right insula, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and putamen, as well as increased RNT in the right insula and pallidum. These findings suggest early microstructural alterations in reward-related circuits, consistent with theories of diet-related neuroinflammation. Contrary to hypotheses, ADHD diagnosis did not moderate the associations, and anthropometric profiles were similar between groups. This suggests a shared neural pathway linking early adiposity and brain structure, independent of diagnostic status. Our findings replicate and extend prior work in older children, highlighting BMI as the most sensitive marker of obesity-related brain differences in early childhood. These results underscore the potential of RSI as a tool for identifying early neural risk markers of obesity and inform future efforts to design preventive interventions during critical developmental windows.

                <p>Understanding how neural circuits integrate sensory and state information to support context-dependent behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. Oviposition is a complex process during which a fruit fly integrates context and sensory information to choose an optimal location to lay her eggs. The circuit that controls oviposition is known, but how the oviposition circuit integrates multiple sensory modalities and internal states is not. Using the Hemibrain connectome, we identified the oviposition inhibitory neuron (oviIN) as a key hub in the oviposition circuit and analyzed its inputs to uncover potential parallel pathways that may be responsible for computations related to sensory integration and decision-making. We applied a network analysis to the subconnectome of inputs to the oviIN to identify clusters of interconnected neurons&mdash;many of which are uncharacterized cell types. Our findings indicate that the inputs to oviIN form multiple parallel pathways through the unstructured neuropils of the superior protocerebrum, a region implicated in context-dependent processing.</p>

     alt="Cellular Composition of the Brain of a Northern Minke Whale"/>
<p>Avelino-de-Souza et al. show that the minke whale has 3.2 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex, as predicted for a generic cetartiodactyl species, which places it and other cetaceans between monkeys and great apes in a ranking of mammal and bird species by total numbers of neurons in the pallium/cerebral cortex. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The largest mammalian brains belong to cetacean species among the cetartiodactyls. Stereological analyses have estimated cetacean numbers of cerebral cortical neurons to be more than the average 16 billion of humans, yet isotropic fractionator estimates in artiodactyls predict that even the largest cetacean brains should have no more than a few billion cortical neurons. Here, we used the isotropic fractionator to investigate these contrasting estimates of neuronal numbers by determining the numbers of neurons and non-neuronal cells forming the brain of a northern minke whale, previously estimated using stereology as containing 12.8 billion cortical neurons (Eriksen and Pakkenberg 2007), and comparing it to our dataset of several dozen mammalian species analyzed with the same method. We report that, with 3.2 billion neurons, the minke whale cerebral cortex conforms to the quantitative scaling rules that apply to other mammals, especially the closely related artiodactyls. The same brain contained a total of 57.4 billion neurons, of which 54.2 billion were cerebellar neurons, matching the expected numbers of a hypothetical artiodactyl brain of similar cerebellar mass. In addition, we found that the northern minke whale brain, with a mass of 2683.9 g, contained 173.4 billion non-neuronal cells, following the universal scaling rules that apply to the brain in all therian mammals examined to date. Thus, how non-neuronal cells are added to the mammalian brain is conserved across therian mammals and is not affected by the transition to an obligatory aquatic life history. Strikingly, we find that the minke whale is an outlier amongst mammals in having almost 18 cerebellar neurons for every neuron in the cerebral cortex, compared to the average ratio of 4, which might be related to infrasonic communication. In addition, with only approximately 88 million neurons, the remainder of the brain (brainstem/diencephalon/subcortical telencephalon) of the northern minke whale exhibited the lowest relative neuronal density of these regions reported in mammalian brains, which might be related to the absence of limbs compared to all other mammalian species. Our results indicate that the number of neurons in cetacean brains has been grossly overestimated by stereological accounts, and place whale brains on par with highly cognitively capable macaws, macaques, baboons, and elephants, but below great apes and humans, in terms of numbers of cortical neurons.</p>

                Introduction NeuroAiD, also known as MLC601 or MLC901, is a Chinese herbal combination used worldwide for stroke treatment. It contains herbal components and five hewan components. MLC601 contains herbal components and hewan components, while MLC901 has a similar herbal composition. NeuroAiD is used to support neurologic recovery after stroke and to aid cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease. Studies show that NeuroAiD has potential in treating Alzheimer’s disease and is beneficial in both local and global stroke models and in the Kortikal culture. However, there is limited bibliometric research on NeuroAiD, which is a method of collecting data from published articles to analyze developments and trends in the field of research. This research contributes significantly to the literature and helps develop more effective stroke treatment strategies. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis Results The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, topic dendogram, and world cloud. Conclusions The study investigates the potential of Neuroaid, a neuroprotective drug, for stroke prevention and cognitive function enhancement. It uses terms like “cognition” and “neurogenesis” to highlight its potential. While the study’s focus may be limited, it provides valuable insights into research direction and potential areas of neuroaid for stroke treatment.

                Background Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a clinically aggressive disease requiring intensive treatment. The two principal curative approaches are radical cystectomy (RC) and bladder preservation therapy, most commonly trimodal therapy (TMT), which combines maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) with concurrent chemoradiation. While both strategies have demonstrated comparable oncologic outcomes in select patient populations, their impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) remains a crucial differentiator—particularly in real-world, resource-constrained settings where cultural and logistical considerations shape patient preferences and treatment access. Objectives The QUEST (Quality of life and Evaluation of Survival in Treatment of bladder cancer) study aims to evaluate and compare QoL outcomes and survival metrics in MIBC patients undergoing either RC or bladder preservation. It seeks to generate institution-specific data using validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), thereby supporting individualized, evidence-informed decision-making. Methods This prospective, single-center, observational cohort study will enroll 94 patients with non-metastatic MIBC (cT2–T4aN0M0) who are eligible for either treatment approach. Participants will self-select their treatment modality following multidisciplinary counselling. QoL will be assessed longitudinally using the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) and EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and multiple post-treatment intervals. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and correlation of PROM scores with survival. Stratification and statistical adjustments will address inherent selection bias. Discussion The QUEST study will provide critical insights into the lived experiences and clinical outcomes of MIBC patients in eastern India. By integrating PROMs into routine oncologic evaluation, it will help bridge the gap between survival-centric and patient-centric care models. The findings are expected to inform future guidelines, promote shared decision-making, and enhance long-term care strategies for bladder cancer in similar healthcare settings.

                This study evaluated the performance of the sub-base material of High Court Road, Kabale, Uganda, using the California Bearing Ratio and Triaxial Compression Tests. Optimizing sub-base material selection is expected to enhance road longevity, minimize maintenance costs, and ensure sustainable, value-for-money construction, ultimately improving infrastructure reliability and reducing long-term performance. Field samples were collected at one-meter depth and tested for California Bearing Ratio and shear strength parameters of cohesion, angle of internal friction, and stress-strain behavior of the soil under varying axial loads, to evaluate the overall suitability under estimated loading conditions. Laboratory tests indicate that the sub-base consists predominantly of fine-grained soil, classified as high-plasticity clay based on the Unified Soil Classification System. Compaction results show maximum dry densities between 16.05 kN/m3 and 18.03 kN/m3, with Optimum Moisture Content between 18.9% and 23.3%. Shear strength parameters indicate cohesion values ranging from 67.5 kPa to 95.2 kPa, which fall below the recommended minimum of 100 kPa for stable sub-base performance. The angle of internal friction ranges from 9.00° to 19.71°, lower than the 26°–29° range typically required for stability and high bearing capacity. The CBR values range from 2% to 13%, significantly below the recommended minimum of 30% for sub-base layers. This confirms that the current sub-base material has poor load-bearing capacity and is unsuitable for supporting expected traffic loads. To support the anticipated traffic load, the study recommends construction using a 450 mm thick sub-base material embedded in the 950 mm thick pavement, attaining a minimum of 98% compaction, stabilization using lime/cement, and reinforcement of the sub-base with geosynthetics. An alternative pavement design comprising a 225 mm sub-base, in a 725 mm thick pavement, is also recommended, particularly in instances where granular material and crushed stones are more readily available

                The cardiac Purkinje network plays a vital role in the heart’s electrical conduction system, ensuring efficient and synchronized ventricular contraction. When impaired—particularly by ischemia—it can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. In this study, we present an advanced computational model of the Purkinje network that integrates cell-level heterogeneity, spatial organization, and localized ischemic zones with customizable severity gradients. Developed in Python using open-source libraries (NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn), the model generates rich visualizations of network structure, conduction velocities, ischemia severity, and electrophysiological parameters. Simulations demonstrate how ischemia alters conduction and refractoriness in a spatially dependent manner, providing insights into arrhythmogenic risk. This modeling framework can advance understanding of cardiac conduction under pathological conditions and support therapeutic development.

                Background Behavioral expression rarely depends on a single determinant; it emerges from the convergence of neural, hormonal, and contextual factors. The lordosis reflex in female rats is a well-studied model requiring hypothalamic circuits, ovarian hormones, and somatosensory input, yet these findings have been framed qualitatively without a formal law specifying how the factors combine. Methods I propose a candidate law of convergence, formalized by the ARCH × Φ framework, in which behavior is modeled as a multiplicative product of Archetype (A: neural substrate), Drive (D: hormonal priming), Context (C: tactile stimulation), and a modulatory threshold field (Φ: arousal, neuromodulation, stress). Drawing on decades of lesion, hormone, and tactile manipulation studies, I evaluate three necessity tests of lordosis: loss of the ventromedial hypothalamus (A), ovariectomy without estradiol–progesterone replacement (D), and removal of flank stimulation (C). Results Across these tests, lordosis fails when any single factor is absent, even when the others are intact. This supports conjunctive necessity rather than additive sufficiency. Incorporating Φ explains modulatory influences such as dopamine, serotonin, stress, and development, which shift the threshold for expression. Conclusions This synthesis reframes lordosis as a model system for testing a general principle of conjunctive behavioral control. The proposed law of convergence generates falsifiable predictions, integrates disparate findings across neuroendocrinology and ethology, and may extend to other motivated behaviors, including aggression, caregiving, and social bonding. By moving from description to quantitative formulation, the ARCH × Φ framework advances toward a predictive field theory of behavior.

Simulating within-host virus sequence evolution allows for the investigation of factors such as the role of recombination in virus diversification and the impact of selective pressures on virus evolution. Here, we provide a new software to simulate virus within-host evolution called wavess (within-host adaptive virus evolution sequence simulator), a discrete-time individual-based model and a corresponding user-friendly R package. The underlying model simulates recombination, a latent infected cell reservoir, and three forms of selection: conserved sites fitness and replicative fitness in comparison to a reference sequence, and immune fitness including cross-reactivity imposed by a co-evolving immune response. In the R package, we also provide functions to generate model inputs from empirical data, as well as functions to analyze the simulation outputs. At user-defined time points, the software returns various counts related to the virus population(s) and a set of sampled virus sequences. We applied this model to investigate the selection pressures on HIV-1 <i>env</i> sequences longitudinally collected from 11 individuals. The best-fitting immune cost differed across individuals, mirroring the real-world expectation of heterogeneous immune responses among human hosts. Furthermore, the phylogenies reconstructed from these simulated sequences were similar to the phylogenies reconstructed from the real sequences for all summary statistics tested. To our knowledge, compared to other similar models, wavess has been more rigorously validated against real within-host virus sequences, and is the first to be implemented as an R package. The wavess R package can be downloaded from https://github.com/MolEvolEpid/wavess.

                <p>by Israël Tankam Chedjou, Ruairí Donnelly, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

Cassava viral diseases, including Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), pose significant threats to global food security, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study explores the potential of varietal mixtures as a sustainable disease management strategy by introducing CropMix, a novel web-based application. The application encodes a flexible insect-borne plant pathogen transmission model to predict and optimize yields under scenarios of varietal mixtures. For instance, we use the application to evaluate the ability of virus-resistant cassava varieties (which may have lower yields in the absence of disease) to protect more susceptible varieties against CMD and CBSD, and we also consider mixtures involving tolerant varieties and non-host crops. For CMD, the high transmission rates of cassava mosaic virus (genus <i>Begomovirus</i>) limits the efficacy of mixtures, with susceptible monocultures emerging as more productive than susceptible-resistant mixtures whatever the whitefly pressure. In contrast, for CBSD, varietal mixtures demonstrate substantial benefits, with resistant varieties shielding susceptible ones and mitigating severe yield losses under moderate or high insect pressure. Management strategies involving non-host crops and complementary control measures, such as roguing, can further enhance outcomes. The model’s simplicity and adaptability make it suitable for tailoring recommendations to diverse insect-borne crop viral diseases and agroecological contexts. The study emphasizes the need for integrating real-world data and participatory frameworks to refine and implement disease management strategies. We discuss the critical balance between agronomic potential and farmer acceptability, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts to ensure sustainable cassava production.

                <p>by Shiqi Luo, Qiuyi Wang, Ao Chen, Liang Huang, Yaoqi Liu, Xin Zong, Yuanhui Mao</p>

Macrophages require rapid and tightly controlled regulatory mechanisms to respond to environmental disruptions. While transcriptional regulation has been well characterized, the mechanisms underlying translational control in macrophages remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the dynamics of mRNA translation in mouse macrophages during acute, intermediate, and prolonged LPS exposure. Our results reveal clear phase-specific translational regulation during macrophage polarization, which initially increases the synthesis of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Mechanistically, we observed pervasive upstream translation in the 5′ UTRs of cell cycle-related mRNAs, which contributes to cell cycle arrest during the early phase of inflammatory response. Notably, we identified a unique codon preference toward A/U in the third position of codons in macrophages, which contrasts with the G/C preference commonly observed in other tissues. AU codon preference increases the stability and translation efficiency of cell cycle-related mRNAs, promoting cell cycle restoration after extended LPS exposure. These findings reveal that uORF translation and codon usage bias are critical components of translational regulation during macrophage polarization, highlighting a potential therapeutic intervention for modulating immune activation via macrophage-specific codon optimization.

                <p>by Monami Nishio, Xingyu Liu, Allyson P. Mackey, Michael J. Arcaro</p>

Postnatal brain development in primates involves prolonged structural maturation of the cortex, laying the foundation for advanced perceptual and cognitive functions. In humans, cortical development is thought to progress along a hierarchical gradient from early-maturing sensorimotor regions to later-developing association areas. However, developmental changes across cortical depth, which contribute to both local computation and large-scale network integration, have been largely unexplored. It also remains unclear which features of these maturational trajectories are conserved across primates and how they may have been further extended or modified in humans. Using the T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) MRI ratio as a noninvasive measure of cortical microarchitecture, we systematically compared depth-dependent and regional developmental trajectories in humans and macaques. We identified a conserved “inside-out” gradient of maturation, with deeper cortical depths exhibiting steeper increases in T1w/T2w ratio and earlier plateaus than superficial depths. This depth-dependent pattern was embedded within a broader hierarchical gradient of maturation across the cortical surface, extending from sensorimotor regions to association cortex. While the spatial structure of these gradients was shared across species, humans exhibited markedly prolonged development across the entire cortical hierarchy, including both sensory and association cortices, and across cortical depths. These findings suggest that conserved developmental gradients are elaborated in humans to support an extended window of postnatal plasticity, enabling the experience-dependent refinement of cortical circuits that underlie the complex, integrative functions central to human perception and cognition.

Scientific communities need to understand and eliminate barriers that prevent people with diverse backgrounds from contributing to and participating in science. However, the combined impact of individuals’ linguistic, economic, and gender backgrounds on their scientific productivity is poorly understood. Using a survey of 908 environmental scientists, we show that being a woman is associated with up to a 45% reduction in the number of English-language publications, compared to men. Being a woman, a non-native English speaker, and from a low-income country is associated with up to a 70% reduction, compared to male native English speakers from a high-income country. The linguistic and economic productivity gap narrows when based on the total number of English- and non-English-language publications. We call for an explicit effort to consider linguistic, economic, and gender backgrounds and incorporate non-English-language publications when assessing the performance and contribution of scientists.

                Background Ovarian tumors remain one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies due to delayed diagnosis. Differentiating benign from malignant adnexal masses is crucial to guide clinical management. While ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, its limitations in certain indeterminate cases justify the use of MRI, particularly through the O-RADS classification (Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System). However, challenges remain in interpreting solid components and enhancement curves. Methods This retrospective study included 89 patients with 116 adnexal masses deemed indeterminate on ultrasound. All patients underwent pelvic MRI using a standardized protocol, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and ADC mapping. Adnexal masses were classified according to O-RADS, and ADC values were used to refine classifications between categories 3–4 and 4–5. Final diagnoses were confirmed by histopathological analysis after surgical resection. Results Integration of ADC values improved diagnostic accuracy. Six masses initially classified as O-RADS 3 were upgraded to O-RADS 4 based on ADC cut-offs, and 18 O-RADS 4 masses were reclassified as O-RADS 5. Additionally, eight lesions initially classified as O-RADS 4 were reclassified to O-RADS 3. The integrated O-RADS/ADC strategy demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, with sensitivity reaching 100%, specificity of 95.1%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. The diagnostic accuracy, calculated using Youden’s index, was 0.95. Furthermore, the use of non-contrast-enhanced MRI sequences (T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and ADC mapping) alone also provided robust diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity of 98.67% and a specificity of 90.48%. Conclusions: Incorporating ADC values into the O-RADS classification enhances the diagnostic performance of MRI in evaluating adnexal masses. This refined approach enables more accurate stratification of malignancy risk, improves clinical decision-making, and may help avoid unnecessary surgery, particularly in women where fertility preservation is a concern.

                This study analyzed international research on systems thinking in science education from 2014 to 2025. Systems thinking, as it points out the links between parts of complex systems, is being seen as an important skill for managing issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and sustainability. Despite its importance, genetics is introduced differently in education around the world. Using Scopus data, we study the main contributors to this field, emerging research themes, and how different institutions are teaming up, with sustainability, STEM education, and interdisciplinary learning being areas that are gaining importance. This information highlights the need for international research partnerships and support for teachers to teach systems thinking and improve students’ skills to face real-life problems. The results can help improve how policymakers, educators, and researchers introduce systems thinking into classrooms.

                Background Critical thinking is a collection of dispositions and abilities related to individuals’ analytical, creative, and practical cognitive and decision-making skills. The development of optimal critical thinking skills better prepares students for college and their careers. The measurement of critical thinking actual abilities like inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, or systemic thinking among college students is limited. Similarly, the assessment of all types of critical thinking like creative or practical from the perspectives of students is meager. Methods This research utilizes original data collected from 803 college students between 2020 and 2021 after securing institutional review approval for the research. Self-reported data on 30 items instrument measuring students’ ratings of their analytical, creative, and practical thinking is used. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and correlation analysis all were used to estimate the prevalence of critical thinking, and whether gender or language influence it or not. Results Results indicate that undergraduate students rated their abilities in critical thinking is very high. On all three types of critical thinking (analytical thinking, creative thinking, practical thinking), students scored between 117 and 123 on a 30-150 scale, indicating a high score. Additionally, gender and language have little to no influence over critical thinking scores. Further, analytical, creative, and practical thinking are independent from each other evident in the low correlations among all three elements. The results suggest the emergence of the Dunning-Kruger effect concerning students’ critical thinking assessment. Conclusions There is a colossal gap between students- self-reported ratings and their actual performance on critical thinking instruments. More rigorous assessments of dispositions and abilities are needed utilizing existing validated instruments in literature.

                Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people globally, with nearly 80% living in low- and middle-income countries. From 1990 to 2021, childhood idiopathic epilepsy cases increased by 26.34%. Despite treatment advancements, stigma, fear, and misconceptions, especially in schools, hinder the inclusion of learners with epilepsy. School-based educational interventions have emerged as a vital strategy to raise awareness and reduce stigma. This scoping review aims to identify and map the types of epilepsy-related curricula in primary and secondary schools and special education settings worldwide, evaluating their effectiveness. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, a comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases and grey literature sources. Eligible studies will include various research designs focusing on educational interventions for learners, educators, or school communities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. The findings will be synthesized through thematic analysis. The review is expected to reveal significant variation in the design and evaluation of epilepsy curricula, with many lacking standardized implementations. It aims to inform the development of relevant and scalable education strategies, ultimately supporting inclusive, equitable, and stigma-free learning environments for students with epilepsy.

                The study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention and action among university students in five Latin American countries, integrating correlation analyses, multiple regressions, and visualizations through Raincloud Plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report presents only those that showed significant differences between countries or were identified as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Key variables such as entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in its discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase. In contrast, financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants in the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the need for an adaptive curriculum that incorporates emotional competencies, training pathways differentiated by entrepreneurial stage, and support strategies that include mentoring, early diagnosis, and well-being management.

We hypothesized that quantitative analysis of eye movements during a natural multi-component task (passage reading) could produce a measure capable of capturing subclinical signs and disease progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Binocular gaze sampled at 1000 hertz (Hz) was collected from 102 individuals with ataxia (including 36 spinocerebellar ataxias, 12 Friedreich's ataxia, and 5 multiple system atrophy) and 70 healthy controls. Longitudinal data were available for 26 participants with ataxia in the ongoing Neurobooth natural history study. The Reading Eye Abnormality Digital (READ) score was developed by training a regression model to aggregate saccade and fixation kinematics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean displacement of fixations, the number and frequency of saccades, and the proportion of regressive saccades were related to oculomotor dysfunction, speech dysfunction, and overall ataxia severity. The READ score was reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and correlated with Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) total score (<i>r</i> = 0.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), oculomotor (<i>r</i> = 0.52, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and speech (<i>r</i> = 0.73, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) subscores, and patient reports of function including patient-reported outcome measures (PROM)-Ataxia (<i>r</i> = 0.51, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and the Dysarthria Impact Scale (DIS; <i>r</i> = 0.53, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The READ score detected subclinical oculomotor (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and speech signs (AUC = 0.72, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and disease progression (<i>d</i> = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.03). The BARS total did not reach statistical significance in capturing progression between study visits in this cohort (<i>d</i> = 0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.08).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Digital measures of eye movements are a promising approach for sensitively measuring ataxia in clinical trials (including early-stage disease) and may have utility in other neurodegenerative diseases affecting speech or ocular control. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Recapitulative schema of different exploratory levels of the evolutionary impact on human neurological diseases.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Clinical neuroscience focuses on the mechanisms of brain function, but this approach falls short of insights into how the central nervous system (CNS) evolved, both in health and disease. Here, we discuss evolutionary concepts relevant to understanding human brain diseases, on the genetic, subcellular, cellular, connectomic, behavioral, and cultural levels. By revisiting common neurological diseases, we discuss evolved residues from our ancestors, mechanisms of exaptation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and human longevity with the consequent outpacing of biological evolution by cultural evolution. An evolution-based conceptual framework can propel transdisciplinary research targeting the constraints imposed by and compensatory adaptations involved in human-specific neurological diseases.

                Background Multi-sectoral settings such as hospitals, health care centres, clinics, schools, workplaces, community events, and online platforms play an important role in reaching individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds and delivering health promotion interventions that change behaviour and improve health outcomes. The aim of this review was to systematically review the nature and effectiveness of eye health promotion interventions implemented by eye health professionals across various multi-sectoral settings. Method This review was conducted using the Centre for Review and Dissemination guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and reported in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement. A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted on electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline, CINAHL and Academic Search Complete hosted on EBSCOHost and supplemented with a hand search for relevant studies published between 1999 and 2024. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018. The eligibility criterion was met by 80 studies out of 15 554 screened. Results Eye health promotion interventions identified among studies were categorised as health education, health counselling, vision screening, eye screening and training programmes, health prevention, health promotion, health policy, ophthalmic intervention programmes, comprehensive eye examination and screening for diabetic retinopathy. Most studies showed a significant impact of eye health promotion interventions. Conclusion Overall, studies demonstrated a diverse range of strategies that have shown significant effectiveness across various settings. This systematic review highlights the effectiveness of eye health promotion interventions, whilst identifying gaps in compliance, follow-up systems, and policy integration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84243">Distinct functions of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors in the T-tubule vs. outer surface membrane</a></h4>

              
                β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) regulate cardiac function during sympathetic nerve stimulation. β-ARs are present in both the cardiac T-tubule (TTM) and outer surface membrane (OSM), but how their location impacts their function is unknown. Here, we developed a technology based on size exclusion to explore the function of β-ARs located in the OSM. We synthetized a PEG-Iso molecule by covalently linking isoprenaline (Iso) to a 5000 Da PolyEthylene-Glycol (PEG) chain to increase the size of the β-AR agonist and prevent it from accessing the T-tubule network. The affinity of PEG-Iso and Iso on β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs was measured using radioligand binding. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess PEG-Iso conformation and visualise the accessibility of the Iso moiety to water. Using confocal microscopy, we show that PEGylation constrains molecules outside the T-tubule network of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) due to the presence of the extracellular glycocalyx. β-AR activation in OSM with PEG-Iso produced a lower stimulation of [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> than Iso but a larger stimulation of cytosolic PKA at equivalent levels of [cAMP]<sub>I</sub> and similar effects on excitation-contraction coupling parameters. However, PEG-Iso produced a much lower stimulation of nuclear cAMP and PKA than Iso. Thus, OSM β-ARs in ARVMs control mainly cytosolic cAMP/PKA pathway and contractility, while TTM β-ARs control mainly nuclear cAMP, PKA and consequent nuclear protein phosphorylation. Size exclusion strategy using ligand PEGylation provides a unique approach to evaluate the respective contribution of T-tubule <i>vs.</i> outer surface membrane proteins in cardiac cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104037">Recovery of the full in vivo firing range in post-lesion surviving DA SN neurons associated with Kv4.3-mediated pacemaker plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) control several essential functions, including the voluntary movement, learning and motivated behavior. Healthy DA SN neurons show diverse firing patterns <i>in vivo</i>, ranging from slow pacemaker-like activity (1-10 Hz) to transient high frequency bursts (&lt;100 Hz), interspersed with pauses that can last hundreds of milliseconds. Recent <i>in vivo</i> patch experiments have started to reveal the subthreshold mechanisms underlying this physiological diversity, but the impact of challenges like cell loss on the <i>in vivo</i> activity of adult DA SN neurons, and how these may relate to behavioral disturbances, are still largely unknown. We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological properties of surviving SN DA neurons after partial unilateral 6-OHDA lesions, a single-hit, non-progressive model of neuronal cell loss. We show that mice subjected to this model have an initial motor impairment, measured by asymmetrical rotations in the open field test, which recovered over time. At 3 weeks post-lesion, when open field locomotion was strongly impaired, surviving DA SN neurons showed a compressed <i>in vivo</i> dynamic firing range, characterized by a 10-fold reduction of <i>in vivo</i> burst firing compared to controls. This <i>in vivo</i> phenotype was accompanied by pronounced <i>in vitro</i> pacemaker instability. In contrast, in the chronic post-lesion phase (&gt;2 months), where turning symmetry in open field locomotion had recovered, surviving SN DA neurons displayed the full dynamic range of <i>in vivo</i> firing, including <i>in vivo</i> bursting, similar to controls. The normalized <i>in vivo</i> firing pattern was associated with a 2-fold acceleration of stable <i>in vitro</i> pacemaking, mediated by Kv4.3 potassium channel downregulation. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a homeostatic pacemaker plasticity mechanism in surviving DA SN neurons after pronounced cell loss.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To make optimal decisions, intelligent agents must learn latent environmental states from discrete observations. Bayesian frameworks argue that integration of evidence over time allows us to refine our state belief by reducing uncertainty about alternate possibilities. How is this increasing belief precision during learning reflected in the brain? We propose that temporal neural variability should scale with the degree of reduction of uncertainty during learning. In a sample of 47 healthy adults, we found that BOLD signal variability (SD<sub>BOLD</sub>, as measured across independent learning trials) indeed compressed with successive exposure to decision-related evidence. Crucially, more accurate participants expressed greater SD<sub>BOLD</sub> compression primarily in default mode network regions, possibly reflecting the increasing precision of their latent state belief during more efficient learning. Further, computational modeling of behavior suggested that more accurate subjects held a more unbiased (flatter) prior belief over possible states that allowed for larger uncertainty reduction during learning, which was directly reflected in SD<sub>BOLD</sub> changes. Our results provide first evidence that neural variability compresses with increasing belief precision during effective learning, proposing a flexible mechanism for how we come to learn the probabilistic nature of the world around us.</span>

                <p>Auditory perception can be modulated by other sensory stimuli. However, we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms that support multisensory behavior. Here, while male nonhuman primates detected a target vocalization that was embedded in a background chorus of vocalizations, we recorded spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that a congruent video of a monkey eliciting the target vocalization improved the monkeys' behavior, relative to their performance when we only presented a static image of the monkey. As a proxy for the functional organization of A1, we compared the contribution of neurons with significant spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) with those that had nonsignificant STRFs (nSTRFs). Because, on average, STRF and nSTRF neurons have different spike waveform shapes, firing rates, and neural-correlation structure, we hypothesized that they might belong to different neural populations. Consistent with this, we found that, although STRF neurons encode stimulus information through synchronized activity, task-related information in the primate A1 is encoded more as a structured dynamic process in the population of nSTRF neurons. Together, these findings suggest that modulatory multisensory behavior is supported by nSTRF neurons and identifies, for the first time, a functional differentiation between the role that STRF and nSTRF neurons contribute to behavior.</p>

                <p>Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural-level differences (ILDs) are used to generate a neuron's spatially restricted receptive field (RF) and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have restricted spectral components, although these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to frequency-restricted sounds and, in turn, how this changes the organization of their RFs into a topographic map. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons from male and female mice in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup call, and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to a pup call and chirps with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60&deg; in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal RF patterns and demonstrated that there are at least four classes of auditory-responsive neurons in the SC that lie in different locations along the anteroposterior axis of the SC.</p>

                <p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>

                <p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/38/e0773252025?rss=1">Combined Auditory, Tactile, and Visual FMRI Reveals Sensory-Biased and Supramodal Working Memory Regions in the Human Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <I>N-</I>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/38/e0804252025?rss=1">Peripheral Gating of Nociception Investigated with a Decerebrate, Arterially Perfused Preparation of the Rat</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for "gating" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as "filtering," was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/38/e1529242025?rss=1">Impact of Elovl5 Deficiency on Cerebellar Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <I>Elovl5</I> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>

                <p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>

                <p><I>MiRNA</I>-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple diseases, yet the key regulatory <I>miRNAs</I> in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify <I>miR-153</I> as consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. Knockdown of <I>miR-153</I> in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, <I>miR-153</I> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <I>miR-153</I> suppressed <I>KPNA5</I> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the <I>miR-153</I>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. These findings reveal a potential role of the <I>miR-153</I>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in CCH-related cognitive decline.</p>
