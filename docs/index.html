              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01868">Condition-Invariant fMRI Decoding of Speech Intelligibility with Deep State Space Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.

                arXiv:2511.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study how the human brain works, we need to explore the organization of the cerebral cortex and its detailed cellular architecture. We introduce CytoNet, a foundation model that encodes high-resolution microscopic image patches of the cerebral cortex into highly expressive feature representations, enabling comprehensive brain analyses. CytoNet employs self-supervised learning using spatial proximity as a powerful training signal, without requiring manual labelling. The resulting features are anatomically sound and biologically relevant. They encode general aspects of cortical architecture and unique brain-specific traits. We demonstrate top-tier performance in tasks such as cortical area classification, cortical layer segmentation, cell morphology estimation, and unsupervised brain region mapping. As a foundation model, CytoNet offers a consistent framework for studying cortical microarchitecture, supporting analyses of its relationship with other structural and functional brain features, and paving the way for diverse neuroscientific investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02063">Neural dynamics of cognitive control: Current tensions and future promise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive control is a suite of processes that helps individuals pursue goals despite resistance or uncertainty about what to do. Although cognitive control has been extensively studied as a dynamic feedback loop of perception, valuation, and action, it remains incompletely understood as a cohesive dynamic and distributed neural process. Here, we critically examine the history of and advances in the study of cognitive control, including how metaphors and cultural norms of power, morality, and rationality are intertwined with definitions of control, to consider holistically how different models explain which brain regions act as controllers. Controllers, the source of top-down signals, are typically localized in regions whose neural activations implement elementary component processes of control, including conflict monitoring and behavioral inhibition. Top-down signals from these regions guide the activation of other task-specific regions, biasing them towards task-specific activity patterns. A relatively new approach, network control theory, has roots in dynamical systems theory and systems engineering. This approach can mathematically show that controllers are regions with strongly nested and recurrent anatomical connectivity that efficiently propagate top-down signals, and precisely estimate the amount, location, and timing of signaling required to bias global activity to task-specific patterns. The theory converges with prior evidence, offers new mathematical tools and intuitions for understanding control loops across levels of analysis, and naturally produces graded predictions of control across brain regions and modules of psychological function that have been unconsidered or marginalized. We describe how prior approaches converge and diverge, noting directions for future integration to improve understanding of how the brain instantiates cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02722">Association-sensory spatiotemporal hierarchy and functional gradient-regularised recurrent neural network with implications for schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls. Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation, we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.

                arXiv:2511.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01885">Mirror-Neuron Patterns in AI Alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities, aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

                arXiv:2511.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI) is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis.

                arXiv:2404.03902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past work has reported inverted-U relationships between arousal and auditory task performance, but the underlying neural network mechanisms remain unclear. To make progress, we recorded auditory cortex activity from behaving mice during passive tone presentation and simultaneously monitored pupil-indexed arousal. In these experiments, neural discriminability of tones was maximized at intermediate arousal, revealing a neural correlate of the inverted-U. We explained this arousal-dependent sound processing using a spiking model with clusters. In the model, stimulus discriminability peaked as the network transitioned from a multi-attractor phase exhibiting slow switching between metastable cluster activations (low arousal) to a single-attractor phase with uniform activity (high arousal). This transition also qualitatively captured arousal-induced reductions of neural variability observed in the data. Altogether, this study elucidates computational principles to explain interactions between arousal, neural discriminability, and variability, and suggests that transitions in the dynamical regime of cortical networks could underlie nonlinear modulations of sensory processing.

                arXiv:2510.01386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving {\it in vivo} stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients ($\beta_i$) that capture the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.

Abstract: Objective: This work presents a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the goal of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods and procedures: We consider the Phase Transfer Entropy (PTE) to estimate the effective connectivity between SEEG channels, and design a novel algorithm, named the Desynchronization Index (DI), that identifies the EZ as the group of channels showing independent behavior with respect to the rest of the network during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. Results: We test the proposed DI algorithm against the Epileptogenicity Index (EI) on a clinical dataset of 20 patients, considering the channels that were thermocoagulated at the end of SEEG monitoring as the detection target. Our results indicate that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.85 vs. AUC=0.83), while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). Conclusion: The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy in the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. Clinical impact: The integration of connectivity- and energy-based features can lead to the definition of a new biomarker of epileptogenic channels, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving the understanding of the dynamics behind the generation of seizures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14125">Contrastive Consolidation of Top-Down Modulations Achieves Sparsely Supervised Continual Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548">Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01806">Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.01806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple framework for modeling the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a few impurities or resource sites where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around a resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in a model with one impurity. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solution is the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and it is linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are disrupted by possibly long intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence, forgetting can allow the walker to save a lot of memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning process. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02241">Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

                arXiv:2509.04633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02500">Evolutionary Algorithm for Chance Constrained Quadratic Multiple Knapsack Problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic multiple knapsack problem (QMKP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem characterised by multiple weight capacity constraints and a profit function that combines linear and quadratic profits. We study a stochastic variant of this problem where profits are considered as random variables. This problem reflects complex resource allocation problems in real-world scenarios where randomness is inherent. We model this problem using chance constraints to capture the stochastic profits. We propose a hybrid approach for this problem, which combines an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with a local optimisation strategy inspired by multi-factorial optimisation (MFO). EAs are used for global search due to their effectiveness in handling large, complex solution spaces. In the hybrid approach, EA periodically passes interim solutions to the local optimiser for refinement. The local optimiser applies MFO principles, which are typically used in multi-tasking problems. The local optimiser models the local problem as a multi-tasking problem by constructing disjoint search spaces for each knapsack based on an input solution. For each item, its assignment across all knapsacks is considered to determine the preferred knapsack. Items are then divided into disjoint groups corresponding to each knapsack, allowing each knapsack to be treated as a separate optimisation task. This structure enables effective application of MFO-based local refinements. We consider two EAs for the problem, (1+1) EA and ($\mu+\lambda$) EA. We conduct experiments to explore the effectiveness of these EAs on their own and also with the proposed local optimiser. Experimental results suggest that hybrid approaches, particularly those incorporating MFO, perform well on instances where chance constraints and capacity constraints are tight.

                arXiv:2511.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the local computational principles which are required to enable this function remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory - Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of different inputs to an output into unique information from each input, redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

                arXiv:2504.07213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of studies that combine Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning has been growing steadily in recent years. Evolutionary Machine Learning has been shown to help automate the design of machine learning algorithms and to lead to more reliable solutions. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, has produced good results in learning useful features when labelled data is limited. This suggests that the combination of these two areas can help both in shaping evolutionary processes and in automating the design of deep neural networks, while also reducing the need for labelled data. Still, there are no detailed reviews that explain how Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning can be used together. To help with this, we provide an overview of studies that bring these areas together. Based on this growing interest and the range of existing works, we suggest a new sub-area of research, which we call Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning and introduce a taxonomy for it. Finally, we point out some of the main challenges and suggest directions for future research to help Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning grow and mature as a field.

                Over the past decade, studies in EMI contexts describe a range of music-based interventions for EFL learners that generally fall into several categories. Many interventions rely on song listening as the core activity. Some studies use song listening alone, while others combine it with activities such as lyric analysis, dictation, gap-filling, or group discussion. Digital platforms—via Spotify, YouTube, LyricsTraining, and other web-based tools—have also been deployed to deliver authentic music experiences and provide interactive feedback. A smaller set of studies reports the use of music cloze exercises, jazz chants, pop music selections, children’s songs, humorous songs, and even singing paired with body movement or drama to enhance engagement and fluency. Quantitative reports detail meaningful improvements. For example, one study documented an increase in mean engagement scores from 3.06 to 7 following a 10-week song listening intervention, while another showed test scores rising from 65% to 82% when song listening was coupled with lyric analysis. Other studies note enhancements in reduced form recognition, listening comprehension, and overall motivation. Together, these findings illustrate that music-based interventions—whether grounded in traditional song listening or enhanced by digital and interactive components—are associated with increased listening engagement and measurable gains in fluency.

                Non-heteronormative persons within South African Pentecostal communities experience unique challenges that arise from the intersection of sexual orientation and religious belief. Although the South African constitutional framework ostensibly grants rights and protections to sexually diverse individuals, Pentecostal expressions of Christianity largely continue to uphold heteronormative understandings, rendering sexual diversity undesirable and invisible. This scoping review paper aims to systematically map the literature on the experiences, theological discourses, and pastoral care of non-heteronormative persons in South African Pentecostalism, utilising Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. By analysing, collating, and summarising the existing body of work, the review aims to identify categories of evidence and information gaps to facilitate the possibility of further developing inclusive theological and pastoral practices and paradigms within/pastoral care within South African Pentecostalism. Ultimately, the findings will guide researchers, policymakers, and faith communities in devising interventions and responses to foster acceptance, inclusion, and well-being.

                Global climate change poses significant challenges to human health and nutrition, particularly affecting lactating individuals and their infants. This review examines the impact of climate change on lactation, focusing on physiological, socioeconomic, and public health implications. Rising temperatures and heat stress can reduce milk production and alter milk composition, while malnutrition and water scarcity exacerbate these effects. Vulnerable populations face heightened risks, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation strategies. Recommendations include enhancing nutritional support, securing water supplies, reducing environmental toxin exposure, and integrating lactation considerations into climate policies. Employing a social-ecological lens, this review underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to support lactating individuals in a warming world. Future research should explore the complex interactions between climate stressors and lactation to develop effective public health interventions.

                The farming industry faces continuous threats from pest control and farm security issues because rodents cause significant damage to crops and disrupt farm operations. Traditional pest control methods require continuous human interaction which proves both resource-intensive and inefficient. Modern agricultural practices benefit from sustainable solutions through the combination of renewable energy with smart technologies. This research presents an innovative solar-powered motion-sensor system that utilizes OpenCV and YOLOv8 computer vision frameworks to autonomously detect and classify rodent intruders on farmland real-time. The system demonstrates its ability to detect and prevent rodent intruders according to initial testing results. The OpenCV/YOLO system uses motion sensor signals to analyze movement patterns before distinguishing rodents in their various groups. The solar-powered system operates continuously which decreases human intervention needs and enhances farm surveillance capabilities. The model demonstrates its capability to defend crops from rodent damage and enhance farm resistance against land degradation threats, resulting to improved crop yield and management. KPIs have been evaluable to prove the system’s efficiency and reliable to be used in agricultural practices to manage animal pests. The current system encounters problems with detecting wild animals beyond rodents as well as tracking rodent activity beneath ground level. Future developments could include improved pest capture systems alongside enhanced surveillance features for detecting both unauthorized human intruders and large animals. Future research should also invest in real-time implementation in fields with real data. The automated monitoring technology needs to be integrated with reliable sources of energy to create sustainable agricultural operations that are efficient and resilient, hence enhancing food security.

                Background Micro and small enterprises (MSEs) are pivotal to economic development, yet their growth is often constrained by limited financial capabilities and restricted access to finance. Among Muslim women entrepreneurs in Mbarara City, Uganda, these challenges are compounded by gendered financial barriers and adherence to Islamic financial principles. While financial literacy and debt management skills are known drivers of performance, the mechanisms through which these skills translate into tangible business outcomes remain underexplored. This study investigates whether access to finance mediates the relationship between debt management skills and the performance of Muslim women-owned MSEs. Methods A cross-sectional design was employed using purposive sampling to select 170 Muslim women-owned MSEs in Mbarara City. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in SmartPLS 4. The study assessed the measurement and structural models for reliability, validity, and predictive accuracy, and mediation was tested using the Sobel and bootstrapping methods. Results Findings revealed a significant partial mediating effect of access to finance on the relationship between debt management skills and business performance (Sobel z = 8.6661, p < 0.001). Approximately 52.9% of the total effect of debt management on performance operated indirectly through access to finance, while 47.1% was direct. The model explained 97.0% of the variance in performance and 94.4% in access to finance, with strong reliability and validity indicators (Cronbach’s α = 0.938–0.968; AVE = 0.940–0.956). The model fit indices (SRMR = 0.016; NFI = 0.901) confirmed an excellent fit. Overall, debt management skills significantly enhanced both access to finance (β = 0.313, p < 0.001) and performance (β = 0.342, p < 0.001). Conclusion Access to finance significantly amplifies the impact of debt management skills on business performance, underscoring its critical mediating role. The findings affirm that financial competence alone is insufficient without corresponding access to financial resources. Recommendations Integrated interventions that combine financial literacy training especially in debt management, budgeting, and Sharia-compliant finance with enhanced access to affordable, gender-sensitive financial products are essential to bridge the capability resource gap and promote sustainable growth among Muslim women-owned MSEs.

                This quantitative study investigates the current landscape of inclusive education for children with special needs in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a focus on identifying perceived barriers, assessing institutional support, and quantifying the attitudes of key stakeholders, including teachers, special educators, school administrators, and parents. Drawing on a sample of 550 participants across three major districts of Jeddah, the research utilized a structured questionnaire incorporating Likert-scale items to capture perceptions of inclusion, obstacles to implementation, and the systemic support available in schools. Descriptive analysis revealed generally positive attitudes toward inclusive education (M = 3.85), though moderate levels of perceived barriers (M = 2.90) and institutional support (M = 3.23) suggest significant implementation challenges remain. ANOVA and t-tests showed no statistically significant differences in attitudes across gender or professional roles, indicating a shared understanding of inclusive values across stakeholder groups. However, regression analysis showed no significant predictors of attitudes in a linear model, whereas path analysis revealed that institutional support had a strong positive effect (β = 0.431, p < 0.0001), and perceived barriers had a significant negative effect (β = -0.270, p < 0.0001). These findings underscore the importance of structural and systemic factors in shaping inclusive education outcomes. The study concludes with recommendations for improving institutional support, enhancing teacher training, and fostering inclusive infrastructure, while also noting limitations related to geography and self-reporting. The research contributes to Saudi Arabia’s broader Vision 2030 goals by offering evidence-based insights for creating a more inclusive and equitable education system.

Diagnostic tests that can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious diseases. Considerable effort has been paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. We use machine learning to assess the surrounding risk landscape under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation. We develop this to predict the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis incidents in cattle herds, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected improves by over 5 percentage points, or 240 additional infected herds detected in one year beyond those detected by the skin test alone. We also use feature importance testing for assessing the weighting of risk factors. While many factors are associated with increased risk of incidents, of note are several factors that suggest that in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected.

Objective/Background <p>Transmission-dynamic models are commonly used to study infectious disease epidemiology. Calibration involves identifying model parameter values that align model outputs with observed data or other evidence. Inaccurate calibration and inconsistent reporting produce inference errors and limit reproducibility, compromising confidence in the validity of modeled results. No standardized framework exists for reporting on calibration of infectious disease models, and an understanding of current calibration approaches is lacking.</p> Methods <p>We developed the Purpose-Inputs-Process-Outputs (PIPO) framework for reporting calibration practices and applied it in a scoping review to assess calibration approaches and evaluate reporting comprehensiveness in transmission-dynamic models of tuberculosis, HIV and malaria published between January 1, 2018, and January 16, 2024. We searched relevant databases and websites to identify eligible publications, including peer-reviewed studies where these models were calibrated to empirical data or published estimates.</p> Results <p>We identified 411 eligible studies encompassing 419 models, with 74% (n = 309) being compartmental models and 20% (n = 81) individual-based models (IBMs). The predominant analytical purpose was to evaluate interventions (71% of models, n = 298). Parameters were calibrated mainly because they were unknown or ambiguous (40%, n = 168), or because determining their value was relevant to the scientific question beyond being necessary to run the model (20%, n = 85). The choice of calibration method was significantly associated with model structure (p-value<0.001) and stochasticity (p-value = 0.006), with approximate Bayesian computation more frequently used with IBMs and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo with compartmental models. Regarding reporting comprehensiveness, all PIPO framework items were reported in 4% (n = 18) of models; 11–14 items in 66% (n = 277), and 10 or fewer items in 28% (n = 124). Implementation code was the least reported, available in only 20% (n = 82) of models.</p> Conclusions <p>Reporting on calibration is heterogeneous in recent infectious disease modeling literature. Our proposed framework for reporting of calibration approaches could support improved reproducibility and credibility of modeled analyses.</p>

Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Na<sub>V</sub>) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub> were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of −90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than −80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as −60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na<sup>+</sup> current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming Na<sub>V</sub> subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of Na<sub>V</sub> and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.

                <p>by Clark L. Hendrickson, Ira L. Blitz, Amina Hussein, Kitt D. Paraiso, Jin S. Cho, Michael W. Klymkowsky, Matthew J. Kofron, Ken W. Y. Cho</p>

Germ layer specification represents a critical transition where pluripotent cells acquire lineage-specific identities. We identify the maternal transcription factors Foxi2 and Sox3 to be pivotal master regulators of ectodermal germ layer specification in <i>Xenopus</i>. Ectopic co-expression of Foxi2 and Sox3 in prospective endodermal tissue induces the expression of ectodermal markers while suppressing mesendodermal markers. Transcriptomics analyses reveal that Foxi2 and Sox3 jointly and independently regulate hundreds of ectodermal target genes. During early cleavage stages, Foxi2 and Sox3 pre-bind to key <i>cis</i>-regulatory modules (CRMs), marking sites that later recruit Ep300 and facilitate H3K27ac deposition, thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape of the ectodermal genome. These CRMs are highly enriched within ectoderm-specific super-enhancers (SEs). Our findings highlight the pivotal role of ectodermal SE-associated CRMs in precise and robust ectodermal gene activation, establishing Foxi2 and Sox3 as central architects of ectodermal lineage specification.

Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNc<sup>DA</sup> neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNc<sup>DA</sup> neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

Under the midday sun, when photosynthesizers are producing oxygen, shallow aquatic ecosystems can become supersaturated with oxygen (>100% air saturation) while they simultaneously peak in water temperature. It has been suggested that oxygen supersaturation could protect water-breathing animals from mortality during heatwaves because of the potential role of oxygen in governing thermal tolerance. Here, we conducted a circumglobal assessment of the effects of ecologically relevant oxygen supersaturation (150%, hyperoxia) on warming tolerance (here, measured using critical thermal maximum, CT<sub>max</sub>) in 14 aquatic ectotherms from diverse marine and freshwater environments (10 fishes, four decapod crustaceans), in a series of 24 experiments that included 147 CT<sub>max</sub> trials and 1,451 animals using two warming rates (0.3°C min<sup>−1</sup> and 1°C h<sup>−1</sup>). In 10 of 14 species, there was no effect of oxygen supersaturation relative to normoxic controls. In four species (two tropical reef fishes and two marine decapod crustaceans), we found mixed evidence for effects of oxygen saturation, with most of the effects being small (<i>ca</i>. 0.2°C–0.3°C). Thus, contrary to predictions, we conclude that oxygen supersaturation is unlikely to protect most water-breathers from heatwaves and therefore few species distribution models or climate risk assessments will benefit from incorporating oxygen supersaturation.

                <p>by Matteo Tripodi, Hiroki Asari</p>

Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal’s behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, already at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modeling analysis suggests that the temporal response modulations arise from changes in the intrinsic properties of the circuit, such as gain modulation via the histamine H1 receptors in the retina. Facilitation of visual processing at low histamine levels may offer an ethological advantage, enabling animals to respond rapidly to visual threats during periods of reduced activity.

                Background This study aimed to quantify saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins and determine the IC50 values of avocado seed and aloe vera extracts. Methods The materials investigated were 70% ethanol extracts derived from avocado seeds and aloe vera. Both samples underwent quantitative phytochemical analyses to ascertain the total component content, and antioxidant activity was assessed using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique to evaluate % inhibition and IC50 values. The absorbance of the samples was quantified using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, which facilitated the calculation of the total chemical content and antioxidant activity. Results The avocado seed extract comprised saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins at concentrations of 0.21%, 0.0232%, 19.94%, and 10.66%, respectively, with an IC50 value of 135 μg/mL. Aloe vera extract contains saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins at concentrations of 0.74%, 0.0313%, 0.99%, and 4.68%, respectively, with an IC50 value of 4614 μg/mL. Conclusion Avocado seeds exhibited elevated flavonoid and tannin levels, whereas aloe vera demonstrated increased alkaloid and saponin concentrations. In the antioxidant activity assessment, avocado seeds demonstrated superior antioxidant efficacy.

     alt="Release and Reuptake Sites for Norepinephrine Are Differently Distributed Across Layers of the Primary Visual Cortex in Macaque Monkeys"/>
<p>While norepinephrine is thought to act - at least in part - through volume transmission, evidence from cortex is limited. We quantified and compared the laminar distributions of axons immunoreactive for the norepinephrine transporter (NET, reuptake sites) and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH, release sites) in primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortex in macaques. The distinct laminar densities (shading) we observed suggest volume transmission and further indicate that diffusion length scales differ between layers with a cortical area, and likely between cortical areas as well.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Norepinephrine (NE) is released in cortex by axons arising from the locus coeruleus (LC). The cortical innervation patterns from LC have been mapped previously using antibodies directed against the vesicular synthetic enzyme for NE, dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), which provides information about putative release sites. We sought to quantify putative NE reuptake sites by immunolabeling the norepinephrine transporter (NET), focusing on the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortex of macaque monkeys. We used stereological methods to determine the density of axon segments immunoreactive for NET (NET+ segments) in V1 and V2, and non-stereological methods to compare the laminar distribution of NET+ segments and to compare the distribution of NET+ segments in V1 with segments immunoreactive for DBH (DBH+). We also developed a novel analysis approach on the basis of Bayesian statistics that allowed us to combine these quantitative data with qualitative data from previously published studies to generate and compare updated estimates of LC axon density. In line with prior reports based on DBH immunoreactivity, we find that LC axon density is higher in V2 than in V1 and has a similar laminar pattern across both areas. We also find that densities of DBH+ and NET+ segments differ across the layers of V1. This indicates that sites of NE release and reuptake may not be colocated and suggests a role for differing scales of diffusion in cortical modulatory effects mediated by NE.</p>

                Chen et al. map an aging-linked, SASP-driven H2-T23high (Qa-1b) monocyte program in vaccine-injected muscle that suppresses cDC2 and engages the CD94/NKG2A checkpoint. NKG2A blockade restores T/NKT cell function and vaccine responses in aged mice and human PBMCs, nominating the HLA-E-NKG2A axis for geriatric vaccination.

                Xu et al. review the potential role of trained immunity in the inflammatory response following myocardial infarction (MI). They discuss how pre-infarction trained immunity exacerbates initial tissue injury and how the MI event itself induces long-term inflammatory memory, thereby increasing residual risk in patients.

                Joyce et al. observe that neutrophils are the major immune cells in diabetic wounds and identify genetic factors required for GBS survival. GBS requires glycolipids and LTA alanylation to survive in the diabetic wound, which protects GBS against neutrophil killing via cationic antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.

                Lu et al. show that nuclear WDFY2 plays a role in DNA damage repair by facilitating the recruitment of the MRN complex to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Targeting WDFY2 may represent a promising strategy to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102346">Characterization of postsynaptic glutamate transporter functionality in the zebrafish retinal first synapse across different wavelengths</a></h4>

              
                In the zebrafish retina, incident light undergoes wavelength-dependent processing encompassing mechanisms such as color opponency, contrast enhancement, and motion detection prior to neural transmission to the brain proper. In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here, we demonstrate that the knockout of <i>eaat5b</i> and <i>eaat7</i> disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task-specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli. Such a behavioral assay targeting short and long wavelengths indicates that EAAT5b and EAAT7 influence UV-dependent prey detection and motion sensing differently. Our findings highlight the importance of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in modulating light integration dynamics in the zebrafish retina.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94794">Cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of Arginase 2 on cardiac aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106122">Correlation detection as a stimulus computable account for audiovisual perception, causal inference, and saliency maps in mammals</a></h4>

              
                Animals excel at seamlessly integrating information from different senses, a capability critical for navigating complex environments. Despite recent progress in multisensory research, the absence of stimulus-computable perceptual models fundamentally limits our understanding of how the brain extracts and combines task-relevant cues from the continuous flow of natural multisensory stimuli. Here, we introduce an image- and sound-computable population model for audiovisual perception, based on biologically plausible units that detect spatiotemporal correlations across auditory and visual streams. In a large-scale simulation spanning 69 psychophysical, eye-tracking, and pharmacological experiments, our model replicates human, monkey, and rat behaviour in response to diverse audiovisual stimuli with an average correlation exceeding 0.97. Despite relying on as few as 0–4 free parameters, our model provides an end-to-end account of audiovisual integration in mammals—from individual pixels and audio samples to behavioural responses. Remarkably, the population response to natural audiovisual scenes generates saliency maps that predict spontaneous gaze direction, Bayesian causal inference, and a variety of previously reported multisensory illusions. This study demonstrates that the integration of audiovisual stimuli, regardless of their spatiotemporal complexity, can be accounted for in terms of elementary joint analyses of luminance and sound level. Beyond advancing our understanding of the computational principles underlying multisensory integration in mammals, this model provides a bio-inspired, general-purpose solution for multimodal machine perception.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105347">Misclassification in memory modification in AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, could potentially be mitigated through early detection and interventions. However, it remains challenging to assess subtle cognitive changes in the early AD continuum. Computational modeling is a promising approach to explain a generative process underlying subtle behavioral changes with a number of putative variables. Nonetheless, internal models of the patient remain underexplored in AD. Determining the states of an internal model between measurable pathological states and behavioral phenotypes would advance explanations about the generative process in earlier disease stages beyond assessing behavior alone. Previously, Gershman et al., 2017b proposed the latent cause model, which provides a normative account of memory modification phenomena in Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here, we assumed the latent cause model as an internal model and estimated internal states defined by the model parameters being in conjunction with measurable behavioral phenotypes. The 6- and 12-month-old <i>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></i> knock-in AD model mice and the age-matched control mice underwent memory modification learning, which consisted of classical fear conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement. The results showed that <i>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></i> mice exhibited a lower extent of reinstatement of fear memory. Computational modeling revealed that the deficit in the <i>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></i> mice would be due to their internal states being biased toward overgeneralization or overdifferentiation of their observations, and consequently, the competing memories were not retained. This deficit was replicated in another type of memory modification learning in the reversal Barnes maze task. Following reversal learning, <i>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></i> mice, given spatial cues, failed to infer coexisting memories for two goal locations during the trial. We concluded that the altered internal states of <i>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></i> mice illustrated their misclassification in the memory modification process. This novel approach highlights the potential of investigating internal states to precisely assess cognitive changes in early AD and multidimensionally evaluate how early interventions may work.

">CeDNe: A multi-scale computational framework for modeling structure-function relationships in the C. elegans nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural circuits generate behavior requires integrating structural and functional data across scales. C. elegans with its complete connectome, genetically identifiable neurons, single-cell transcriptome, neuropeptide-receptor distribution, and an amenability to simultaneous measurement of brain-wide neural activity and behavior presents a unique opportunity for such a multiscale circuit analysis. However, the absence of a unifying framework to connect these diverse datasets limits our ability to connect network structure and attributes with function. Here we introduce CeDNe - C.elegans Dynamical Network, an open-source computational framework that integrates anatomical, molecular, and imaging datasets into a unified graph-based representation that enables multimodal data analysis by cross-referencing different omics layers in a single computational environment. Specifically, CeDNe provides modular tools for visualizing and analyzing network connectivity, motif distribution, and circuit paths. Further, it incorporates a computational framework that simulates neural dynamics and optimizes network models to bridge structural connectivity with neural activity. Thus, CeDNe establishes a scalable foundation for data-driven modeling of the nervous system. This open-source tool not only facilitates computational connectomics and multimodal analyses in C. elegans, but also serves as a generalizable framework for investigating structure-function relationships in neural networks of other organisms.

">Impact of air pollution on Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density metrics (NODDI) in 10-13-year-old children with and without ADHD diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                Air pollution is a significant risk factor for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. While studies have linked pollutants to changes in brain structure, specific effects on white matter microstructure remain inconclusive. Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) provide two nuanced, separate white matter measures that serve as proxies for neurite density and cell-body organization. We used NODDI to examine potential associations between prenatal, early life and current exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with diameter < 10 micrometers (PM10) and white matter microstructure in school-aged children. We also explored whether ADHD diagnosis moderated these associations. We observed several negative associations between both NO2 and PM10 exposure and neurite density across various white-matter fibers and exposure windows, but none of the associations were statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In this analysis, we did not find any statistically significant associations between long-term exposure to PM10 and NO2 and white matter microstructural integrity as measured by NODDI. Our results highlight the challenge of detecting modest environmental impacts on the brain and underscore the need for larger, more targeted studies to confirm these preliminary trends.

">Neural Encoding through Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation</a></h4>

              
                Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form fc + {sum} ai fi). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (r {gtrsim} 2-3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ~2-3). HAM's log-uniform distribution yields a 1/f global spectral profile and 1/f sideband spectra in the broadband "aperiodic" component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network's intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to observed spectral features of brain activity.

">Reactivating aversive memories in humans: An EEG and Microstates study of post-retrieval processes</a></h4>

              
                Although fear conditioning is one of the most widely used models to study anxiety in humans, much remains to be explored regarding its underlying neural correlates. It is known that the retrieval of consolidated memories can trigger modifications, weakening, strengthening, or updating of the original memory, depending on the cues presented during the reminder. In this study, we employed a three-day threat-conditioning protocol in which an angry face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an aversive sound (unconditioned stimulus, US). Our main objective was to identify neural markers of post-retrieval processes triggered by the presentation of the CS+ alone, 24 hours after acquisition. Additionally, we aimed to assess cognitive biases by examining how the perception of the conditioned stimulus changes following conditioning. To this end, we recorded resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity using a 30-channel system at a 256 Hz sampling rate. We analyzed four minutes of resting-state EEG following the presentation of the reminder cue, focusing on memory-related patterns in the frequency domain and microstate dynamics. We compared neural activity after the reminder presentation between two groups: a Reactivation group previously exposed to threat conditioning on the first day and a Control group with no prior conditioning. Our results confirmed successful conditioning (CS+ US association) and memory retention 48 hours later, as evidenced by higher skin conductance responses and greater US expectancy to the CS+. Moreover, participants rated the CS+ face as more aversive than the CS-; face 48 hours after conditioning, compared to their pre-conditioning ratings. Relative to the Control group, the Reactivation group showed decreased beta-band activity (25-30 Hz) in central regions during the 90 seconds following the reminder, which may reflect enhanced post-reactivation processing of the memory, in contrast to participants who saw the face for the first time. Previous research has highlighted the role of reduced beta amplitude in the encoding and retrieval of another type of memory: episodic memory. Furthermore, when analyzing EEG microstates (short-lived, quasi-stable topographies of brain activity that reoccur over time), we found lower global field power for microstates C, A, E, and B in the Reactivation group compared with the Control group. Our findings provide initial evidence for neural correlates associated with post-retrieval processes, including decreased beta activity and microstate level differences related to the post-retrieval processing of an implicit memory.

">The hidden phase of memory: EEG signatures of reactivation during post-retrieval rest</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval reactivates previously encoded representations, allowing for their modification and strengthening. However, the neural processes that follow reactivation and contribute to long-term retention remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the post-retrieval resting period to identify neural markers of memory reactivation and their relation to subsequent memory performance. Participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables in multisensory contexts and, on the following day, received either a cue-syllable reminder (context + cue syllable; RX) or a context-only reminder (RCTX) while EEG activity was recorded before and after the reminder presentation. Both reminders elicited significant reductions in beta power (25-40)Hz during the post-reminder rest, consistent with memory reactivation. The magnitude of beta decrement correlated with better long-term performance. Graph-theoretical analyses of phase synchronization networks in the beta band revealed that the RCTX reminder produced higher bilateral frontal betweenness centrality, suggesting greater engagement of frontal regions in mediating global information flow when retrieving only contextual cues. Moreover, frontal centrality and network density were predictive of subsequent memory accuracy. These findings demonstrate that memory reactivation extends beyond cue presentation into post-retrieval rest, leaving identifiable oscillatory and topological signatures that influence memory persistence. Our results underscore the crucial role of frontal network dynamics and beta-band activity in facilitating long-term memory.

">Neural oscillatory dynamics reveal altered top-down and integrative mechanisms during face processing in autistic children and unaffected siblings of autistic children</a></h4>

              
                Face processing is fundamental to social communication and has been a major focus of autism research. While event-related potential (ERPs) studies of face processing have produced mixed results, little work has examined neuro-oscillatory dynamics, which may better capture the integrity of underlying networks. To address this gap, EEG was recorded from children aged 8-13 across three groups: autistic (n = 50), non-autistic (n = 38) and siblings of autistic children (n = 26), during a visual oddball task. In a blocked design, participants viewed faces and objects, presented upright and inverted (non-targets), to assess the face inversion effect (the FIE; a larger or earlier N170 to inverted than upright faces), and responded to infrequent shadow versions (targets). Analyses using permutation statistics and linear mixed models focused on non-target stimuli, quantifying face-related ERPs (P1, N170) and oscillatory activity associated with sensory and attentional processing (theta, alpha, gamma). Across groups, faces elicited earlier P1 and larger N170 amplitudes than objects, and showed a FIE. Furthermore, the rightward lateralization of the FIE was reduced for autistic participants. Analyses in the frequency domain revealed greater induced theta for inverted versus upright stimuli and for faces versus objects, revealing face specific effects, and stronger theta for inverted faces for the autistic and sibling groups, suggesting greater cognitive effort in processing these social stimuli. Gamma-band inter-trial phase coherence exhibited face selectivity only in the non-autistic group, pointing to differences in early network synchronization in autistic children relative to their non-autistic peers, whereas alpha event-related desynchronization did not vary by group or category. Altogether, these findings support altered neural synchronization/efficiency for autistic participants and siblings of autistic children, that is specific to face stimuli and seen despite largely typical sensory driven encoding. These data suggest that neural oscillatory assays are more sensitive to face processing differences in autism than broadband ERPs and that these oscillatory assays may be endophenotypic.

">Circuit-specific gene editing for precision modulation of neuronal activity with CRISPR-rabies virus</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR gene editing has revolutionized our ability to study and manipulate specific genes, enabling novel insights into gene function and potential therapies for brain disorders. Recent advances in cell-type-specific regulatory elements and viral delivery systems have made precise in vivo gene editing possible. However, neurons with similar molecular profiles can belong to different circuits, complicating efforts to manipulate circuit function and behavior. To address this, we developed CRISPR-rabies virus (CRV), which leverages the trans-synaptic spread of rabies virus to enable gene editing within anatomically defined neural circuits. By pairing CRV with cell type-specific Cas9 expression, we achieved targeted gene modifications in specific circuits. We demonstrate that CRV can modulate sodium and potassium channel expression in parvalbumin interneurons, thereby effectively regulating synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Its compatibility with 3'-capture single-cell RNA-seq allows simultaneous circuit perturbation and molecular profiling. In summary, CRV allows precise circuit-level gene modulation, providing a platform for studying gene function in neural circuits and developing novel gene therapies for brain disorders.

">Inverse Neural-Kinematic Dynamics Revealed by RQA During Motor Skill Learning</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill acquisition involves dynamic co-adaptation of brain and behavior, yet the temporal coupling between neural and kinematic processes during learning remains unclear. Traditional analyses often treat the brain and behavior independently, potentially overlooking their interactive dynamics. In this study, we applied Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), a nonlinear method for assessing temporal structure in complex systems, to both EEG and foot trajectory data collected during a seven-session motor learning task. Twelve healthy adults practiced drawing five shapes with their dominant foot on a digital tablet while EEG was recorded from sensorimotor cortex electrodes. We found a fundamental inverse relationship between neural and behavioral dynamics: as motor performance improved, EEG determinism in the left hemisphere increased by 2.7% (p<0.001), while kinematic determinism decreased by 18.4% (p<0.001), indicating more organized brain activity supporting more flexible movement patterns. EEG laminarity also increased by 1.5% (p<0.001), while kinematic laminarity decreased by 15.2% (p<0.001). Shape-specific analysis revealed that patterns B and M elicited the most pronounced neural-behavioral adaptations. These findings suggest that increasingly structured neural dynamics facilitate adaptive motor execution. Our dual-domain RQA framework offers a powerful tool to quantify learning efficiency and uncover the dynamic coupling between neural reorganization and behavioral adaptation.

">All Memories Are Equal at Night: Sleep Protects Without Preference for Strength</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Sleep benefits memory, but whether this benefit depends on initial memory strength remains heavily debated. We asked whether overnight sleep preferentially stabilizes weakly vs. strongly encoded declarative items, and whether classical sleep oscillations account for any benefit. Methods: Ninety healthy adults (n=30/group) learned 80 unrelated word pairs; half were presented twice (S-, weak), while the other half was studied three times (S+, strong). Memory retention was tested after (i) 9hrs containing nocturnal sleep (n= 30), (ii) a comparable daytime waking period (n= 30), or (iii) immediately (~40-min) after encoding. Accuracy (cued recall) and reaction times (RT) indexed memory accessibility. In the sleep group, polysomnography was used to quantify slow oscillation (SO) density as well as fast spindle intensity to study potential relations to memory performance. Results: Strongly encoded items (S+) were recalled better than weak items (S-) in all three groups. An interaction indicated that WAKE disproportionately forgot more weak items S- relative to strong S+ items, whereas SLEEP showed no differential benefit for weak versus strong items, with performance more closely resembling that of the immediate recall group. Reaction-time analyses echoed this pattern with WAKE responding more slowly than SLEEP and IMMEDIATE, and there is no RT difference between SLEEP and IMMEDIATE. S+ were retrieved faster than S- (with no group interaction). Finally, classical sleep markers did not account for overnight retention: spindle and slow-oscillation metrics showed no stronger associations on the learning night than on the adaptation night and did not differ by item strength, suggesting largely trait-like rather than state-dependent relationships between these oscillations and declarative memory. Conclusions: Sleep protects declarative memories irrespective of initial strength and matches immediate recall performance. Traditional sleep metrics, such as slow oscillation density and spindle intensity, did not predict overnight retention performance but instead reflected more trait-like relationships.

">A Human Hippocampal Organoid Model with Sustained Neural Stem Cells Reveals State Shifts Under Glucocorticoid Stress</a></h4>

              
                The human hippocampus is a critical brain region for learning, memory, and stress regulation, distinguished by its ability to sustain neurogenesis after birth. This plasticity is driven by hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs), which generate new neurons and maintain circuit integrity, but are highly sensitive to environmental and pathological influences. Mechanistic insight into human hippocampal development and neurogenesis remains limited by the absence of physiologically relevant models. Here, we establish an optimized protocol to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hippocampal organoids that recapitulate key features of hippocampal development. These organoids maintain organized NSC niches, support ongoing neurogenesis, and generate hippocampus-specific cell types. Cellular, transcriptomic, and electrophysiological analyses confirm progressive neuronal maturation, synapse formation, and functional activity, highlighting the physiological relevance of the system. Using this model, we modeled excess prenatal glucocorticoid exposure with dexamethasone, which perturbed NSC dynamics by reducing proliferation and inducing a precocious quiescent-like state. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of NSC activation genes and upregulation of quiescence- and autophagy-associated programs, suggesting that glucocorticoid signaling enforces an early transition toward quiescence. These findings reveal a mechanism by which excessive glucocorticoid exposure may impair hippocampal growth. Together, this study introduces a robust human hippocampal organoid platform for dissecting the regulation of hippocampal development and for modeling the impact of environmental stressors on human neurogenesis.

">Hidden Spirals Reveal Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Traveling Waves in Human Memory</a></h4>

              
                Traveling waves are neural oscillations that progressively propagate across the cortex in specific directions and spatial patterns, however, their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To probe their mechanisms, we analyzed direct brain recordings from humans performing a working memory task using empirical statistical modeling and computational modeling. By using independent component analysis, we showed that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in complex spatial patterns that correlated with behaviors such as memory encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. We also applied a novel computational model to identify novel complex spatial patterns, using coupled phase oscillators to reveal hidden spirals that were not clearly visible in the original recordings. The orientation of these hidden spirals distinguished between separate cognitive states, such as memory encoding and retrieval. Our simultaneous empirical and computational modeling provides a general framework to probe the functional significance and neurocomputational mechanisms underlying a diverse range of spatial patterns of traveling waves. Importantly, our novel model-based analytical approach can identify new types of traveling waves in the brain that are missed with conventional analysis approaches.

">Elevated urea levels in human frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis post-mortem brain tissue: Evidence of a multi-dementia pathogenic mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) represent two neurodegenerative diseases on opposite sides of a movement disorder continuum. However, like many other neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular pathogenesis of FTD and ALS is not fully understood. Our group has previously reported evidence for a pervasive elevation of brain urea levels in five other dementia-causing diseases. However, brain urea levels have yet to be measured in ALS and FTD. Here, we employed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to characterise brain urea differences between control (n=14/12) and ALS/FTD (FTD: n=8/9; ALS: n=13/14) cases in post-mortem tissue from two brain regions with different levels of neuropathological burden (high vs. low). Elevated urea levels were observed in both the frontal cortex (high neuropathological burden) and primary visual cortex (low neuropathological burden) in cases with FTD. Contrastingly, in cases with ALS, elevated urea was observed in the primary motor cortex (high neuropathological burden), but not the dentate nucleus (low neuropathological burden). These results not only suggest that elevated urea levels are also present in ALS and FTD but imply that elevated brain urea is linked to a multi-dementia pathogenic mechanism. In contrast to ALS, the observation of elevated urea in regions of both high and low neuropathological burden in FTD implies that this phenotype is likely widespread and, therefore, may play a larger role in the pathogenesis of disease. Such a mechanism could offer new directions for developing treatments targeting this underlying pathology.

">Dopamine D1Aa and D2a Receptor Expression in the Auditory System of a Vocal Fish</a></h4>

              
                Although dopamine receptors (DARs) have been identified in various vertebrate neural circuits, their expression in the central auditory system remains poorly characterized. Reproductive-state changes in catecholamine innervation of central auditory nuclei in the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) highlight a unique, ethologically relevant role for catecholamines, including dopamine, in modulating auditory function to enhance reproductive success. Dopamines effects on these systems are mediated via its receptors; thus, the goal of the present study is to characterize excitatory dopamine D1Aa and inhibitory dopamine D2a receptor transcript expression throughout the central auditory system of the plainfin midshipman. Fluorescence in situ hybridization-immunohistochemistry (FISH-IHC) revealed robust D1Aa and D2a expression in forebrain auditory-recipient centers that receive catecholaminergic input: postcommissural and ventral nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, anterior tuberal nucleus, central posterior nucleus of the thalamus, and parvocellular preoptic nuclei. Large dopamine neurons in the periventricular posterior tuberculum, which are, in part, responsible for the reproductive-state changes in central and peripheral catecholamine innervation only express D2a, whereas large noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus express both D1Aa and D2a. The midbrain torus semicircularis, periaqueductal gray, hindbrain octavolateralis efferent nucleus, and descending/secondary octaval nuclei also express both receptor types. D2a expression predominates over D1Aa, and we identify a subpopulation of cells throughout the auditory system that co-express both receptors. The robust distribution of inhibitory and excitatory dopamine receptor expression in the central auditory system, coupled with co-expression in a subset of cells, provides strong neuroanatomical evidence of dopamines complex role in modulating auditory sensitivity and processing.

">Epigenetic control of microglial developmental milestones from proliferative progenitors to efficient phagocytes</a></h4>

              
                Early immune perturbations increase the risk of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying the maturation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain parenchyma, remain poorly defined. Specifically, how proliferation, morphological differentiation, and phagocytosis are coordinated among microglia progenitors as they colonize the embryonic brain remains unclear. Here, we combined mathematical modeling with spatiotemporal analyses of the murine hippocampus and cerebellum from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P60 to reconstruct the trajectory of microglial development. We identified a proliferative-to-quiescent (P/Q) switch around P3/P4 that preceded the acquisition of morphological complexity and efficient phagocytosis and was accompanied by coordinated shifts in cell-cycle dynamics and metabolic state. Strikingly, this P/Q switch was recapitulated in repopulation contexts in mice and in the human fetal brain, where later stages displayed enhanced phagocytic function coupled to reduced proliferation. Perturbing the proliferative phase through pharmacological or genetic disruption of CSF1R signaling impaired subsequent microglial complexity and phagocytosis efficiency, revealing an unexpected reliance of phagocytosis on proliferation-driven colonization. Finally, we show that microglia stepwise maturation during development is associated with chromatin remodeling and driven by the epigenetic regulator Ikaros. Together, these findings uncover the sequential milestones of microglial development, revealing a potential period of early vulnerability and establishing an unexpected linkage between proliferation and phagocytosis essential to understanding how these processes are coordinated in neurodegenerative disorders.

">Mechanistic Link between Executive Functions and Higher Cognition: Evidence from Psychometric Modeling and Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Human cognitive abilities depend on flexible coordination across distributed cognitive control systems within the frontoparietal network, yet the causal architecture linking executive functions (EFs) to higher cognition remains debated. We combined psychometric modeling and neuromodulation to test causal contributions of EFs to distinct cognitive abilities. In a psychometric study, we modeled Unity-Diversity EF components (updating, inhibition, shifting) against four Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) group factors. Fluid reasoning (Gf) was uniquely related to both Common EF and Updating-specific variance, whereas visual processing (Gv) and processing speed (Gs) were primarily linked to Common EF; crystallized ability (Gc) proved to be largely independent of EFs. To causally probe this architecture, in neuromodulatory study we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over prefrontal and parietal hubs of the frontoparietal network. tDCS selectively enhanced working memory updating, with right-hemisphere stimulation improving Gv but reducing Gf performance. Mediation analyses revealed that working memory updating mediated tDCS effects on higher cognition, yet the direction of effects varied across hemispheres and ability domains, exposing indirect, updating-driven facilitative and compensatory mechanisms within the frontoparietal network. Together, these findings bridge psychometric and neuromodulatory approaches to advance mechanistic understanding of how EFs support higher cognition.

">Beyond retinotopy: exploiting native visual representations in cortical neuroprostheses for vision loss remediation</a></h4>

              
                Cortical prosthetic systems offer a promising path to restoring vision in blindness by stimulating neurons in the visual cortex to evoke visual percepts. To effectively encode visual information, however, it is essential to target neurons based on their functional encoding properties. Current stimulation protocols focus on retinotopic information, ignoring other key encoding properties, and therefore fail to reproduce complex visual percepts. We demonstrate that incorporating orientation selectivity alongside retinotopy to guide stimulation dramatically improves fidelity of the evoked activity to the underlying neural code. We propose a Bottlenecked Rotation-Equivariant CNN (BRCNN) and demonstrate that neural responses can be predicted to a large degree using only retinotopy and orientation preference. Using this model, we design a retinotopy-and-orientation aware stimulation protocol and validate it in a state-of-the-art large-scale optogenetic stimulation simulation framework of primary visual cortex. Our protocol elicits neural activity patterns exhibiting substantially higher correlation with natural vision responses compared to retinotopic-only approaches.

">AHA1 regulates Aβ production via modulation of APP expression and γ-secretase assembly</a></h4>

              
                Deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), produced by gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) co-chaperone, activator of Hsp90 ATPase homolog 1 (AHA1), is known to promote the accumulation of toxic tau species; however, its effects on Abeta production remain unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of endogenous AHA1 decreases Abeta generation and reduces APP and gamma-secretase components, whereas AHA1 overexpression elevates Abeta production and the expression of these proteins. The AHA1-E67K mutant, which has impaired Hsp90 binding, lowers Abeta production and the levels of APP and gamma-secretase components compared with wild-type AHA1. AHA1 associates with APP and immature gamma-secretase components, including anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH1), indicating its role in APP proteolysis and Abeta production. Disruption of the AHA1/Hsp90 complex - through AHA1 knockdown, the E67K mutant, or a small-molecule inhibitor - reduces gamma-secretase assembly. Familial AD mutations in APP-C99 and presenilin-1 (PS1) increase AHA1, Hsp90, APP, and APH1 expression, enhancing Abeta production. Importantly, AHA1 knockdown decreases abnormal Abeta generation and C99, PS1-CTF, and APH1 levels in mutant APP cells, while AHA1 overexpression enhances Abeta production in PS1 mutant cells. Collectively, these findings reveal that AHA1 regulates Abeta production by modulating APP expression and gamma-secretase assembly, establishing AHA1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in AD.

">Pitch selectivity in ferret auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our perception of pitch, the tonal quality of a sound at a fundamental frequency (F0), is essential for musical melody, vocal communication, and attending to a voice in a crowded room. Pitch is distinct from simple frequency tuning. Although pitch perception can arise from either harmonic spectral structure or temporal regularity, it remains unclear how individual neurons represent these distinct cues. We recorded spiking activity in hundreds of ferret auditory cortical neurons while systematically varying harmonic and temporal pitch cues. A subset of neurons represented F0 based on harmonic content, another subset on temporal periodicity, and a third population exhibited invariant pitch tuning across both cue classes. These findings provide the first evidence for specialized pitch neurons in non-primates, and demonstrate that mammalian auditory cortex employs dual spectral-temporal mechanisms for extracting F0.

">Test-Retest Reliability of Dopaminergic fPET and fMRI Measures During Reward Processing</a></h4>

              
                Reward processing is essential to human brain function, with dopamine signalling in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) as key element. The monetary incentive delay task is widely studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measuring indirect hemodynamic changes. Functional positron emission tomography (fPET) with 6-[18F]FDOPA directly quantifies dopamine synthesis enabling dynamic assessment during task performance within a single scan. We investigated the reliability of 6-[18F]FDOPA fPET and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI during a modified monetary incentive delay task in 25 healthy participants across two PET/MRI sessions. Intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variance were computed for BOLD beta estimates and striatal dopamine synthesis at 30s and 2s resolutions. fPET showed fair to good reliability in the NAcc and putamen at rest, fair reliability during the win condition in the caudate and putamen, but poor reliability across the loss condition in all regions. Conversely, fMRI showed good reliability in the NAcc during feedback and in the caudate during feedback loss, but fair reliability elsewhere except for poor reliability in the caudate during cue loss. These findings indicate that both methods achieve comparable reliability but in different target areas, with the molecular specificity of fPET offering dynamic assessment of dopaminergic function.

">Predictive vision-language integration in the human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Integrating linguistic and visual information is a core function of human cognition, yet how information from these two modalities interacts in the brain remains largely unknown. Competing frameworks, including the hub-and-spoke model and Bayesian theories such as predictive coding, offer conflicting accounts of how the brain achieves multimodal integration. To address this question, we collected a large-scale fMRI dataset and leveraged state-of-the-art AI systems to construct encoding models that probe how the human brain matches and integrates linguistic and visual information. We found that prior information from one modality can modulate neural responses in another, even in the early visual cortex (EVC). Integration neural response in EVC is governed by prediction errors consistent with predictive coding theory. Enhanced and suppressed neural responses to semantically matched cross-modal stimuli were found in distinct EVC populations, with suppression population carrying denser, behaviorally relevant semantic information. Both populations support semantic integration with distinct temporal dynamics and representational structures. These findings provide representational- and computational-level insights into how the brain integrates information across modalities, revealing unified principles of information processing that link biological and artificial intelligence.

">Acute stress reduces risk-aversion by changing magnitude perception</a></h4>

              
                Stress is thought to impair financial decision-making by influencing the willingness to take risks. This effect is commonly attributed to stress-related changes in affective evaluation of rewards and their associated uncertainty. However, existing research has yielded inconsistent findings, and the psychological and neural mechanisms at play remain poorly understood. Here we show that acute psychosocial stress can affect financial risk-taking by altering basic perception of payoff magnitudes, independent of subjective valuation processes. Psychophysical and fMRI modelling reveals that stress reduces risk-aversion without changing choice consistency. A Bayesian perceptual model attributes this effect to an upward shift in prior beliefs about payoff magnitude: Under stress, participants choices are guided by relatively more optimistic beliefs about the risky options. A convergent pattern emerges in parietal neural representations of the payoff magnitudes, which show a systematic upward shift in neural coding as a consequence of the stress manipulation. These findings provide converging neural and behavioral evidence that stress influences financial risk-taking by changing neurocomputational processes related to magnitude perception. This has significant implications for psychological and neuroscience theories of stress and risky behavior, with potential applications to policy and clinical interventions.

">Accessing Meaning During Encoding Shapes Subsequent Memory Reactivation in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Semantic access can occur in many forms, ranging from retrieving specific exemplars to linking concepts with related meanings. We hypothesized that accessing meaning at different levels during encoding would lead to distinct neural reactivation patterns during later memory retrieval. Human participants learned novel word-image associations through prompts that queried item-specific, categorical, or thematic features, while undergoing fMRI. Multivariate pattern analysis shows that encoding histories leave distinct neural signatures even when behavioral performances is equivalent. Encoding history could be decoded by classifiers from recognition activity across the ventral visual stream and higher-order regions. Category-based encoding reduced item-specific reinstatement in perceptual regions, while item-based encoding modified cross-phase item-level similarity in the anterior temporal lobe, suggesting a transition from detailed to integrative conceptual representations. Together, these findings demonstrate that semantic access during encoding shapes how memories are neurally reinstated to integrate perceptual and conceptual information across systems supporting semantic and episodic memory.

">Network modularity reveals context and state-dependent reorganization of time-varying functional connectivity in single-cell resolved neural activity recordings</a></h4>

              
                An important goal of neuroscience is to understand how biological neural networks organize activity at multiple scales to enable complex information processing and behavioral output. To address this challenge, large-scale neural activity datasets with increased resolution and wider coverage have become more prevalent across many model systems. However, bridging the gap in scale between changes in pairwise functional connectivity between neurons and changes in brain-wide organization of activity remains a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate application of modularity-based community detection and network modularity to single-cell resolved recordings, for the first time, as a method to summarize complex changes in time-varying functional connectivity, facilitating comparisons across multiple time windows, recordings, and conditions. We apply these methods to both single-cell resolved multi-cell and whole-brain activity recordings. In the multi-cell recordings, we find that food odor changes functional connectivity between existing network modules in a C. elegans locomotory interneuron network, rather than reorganizing them. In spontaneous whole-brain activity, we identify several key hub neurons and combinations that significantly destabilize module assignments when silenced. Together, these results demonstrate community detection and modularity as a method for detecting context and network state-dependent changes in functional connectivity at the intermediate scale of network modules in single-cell resolved neural activity. Results from these analyses facilitate future investigation of mechanisms that mediate organization of neural activity at intermediate scales.

">Dormant viral pathways underlie space-induced neural senescence: a neuroprotective strategy for spaceflight and neurological diseases</a></h4>

              
                Long duration spaceflight is associated with neurological symptoms in astronauts, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using human brain organoids cultured aboard the International Space Station, we analyzed three independent spaceflights to demonstrate that exposure to the space environment triggers Space Induced Neural Senescence (SINS), characterized by chromatin remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of viral-like transcriptional programs in the absence of infection. Multiomics analyses identified upregulation of endogenous LINE-1 (L1) retroelements, whose activity was markedly enhanced in organoids lacking MECP2, a known L1 repressor implicated in Rett syndrome. The resulting accumulation of cytoplasmic L1 DNA elicited an IL6 mediated inflammatory and neurotoxic response, which was reversed by reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTi) such as lamivudine or stavudine. Parallel preclinical experiments in Mecp2-deficient mice confirmed that RTi treatment restored neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis, function, cognition, and survival. These findings reveal that the space environment reactivates dormant genomic retroelements, providing an unexpected mechanistic insight into astronaut neurobiology and identifying a potential therapeutic strategy for both space-induced and terrestrial neurological conditions. Our pioneering study demonstrates the value of space-enabling research in accelerating drug discovery and the treatment of diseases on Earth.

">How tp1, an indirect wing steering muscle, stabilizes Drosophila's flight</a></h4>

              
                Flapping flight is inherently unstable, requiring Drosophila to fine-tune their wing motions on a milliseconds timescale. Pioneering studies have shown that the direct steering muscles, which attach to the wing hinge, are important for generating these rapid flight reflexes. Recent connectome data, however, reveal that indirect steering muscles or tension muscles, which alter the mechanics of the thorax, receive some of the same synaptic inputs from the sensory apparatus as the direct steering muscles. This discovery suggests that the indirect steering muscles may also be important for flight control. Here, we show that the indirect tergopleural muscles indeed contribute substantially to stabilization, particularly for large pitch perturbations. We find that for small perturbations (less than 1000 deg/s), flies modulate their wing stroke amplitude to generate lift-based corrective torques, a strategy that has been previously documented. For larger perturbations, however, we observe that Drosophila engage an additional wing degree of freedom-the wing pitch angle-to leverage additional lift and drag forces during the corrective maneuver. Quasi-steady aerodynamic simulations reveal that this strategy minimizes power consumption, anaolgous to how some mammals (including humans) adjust their steady-state gaits in a near energyoptimal manner. Using optogenetics and a control theory framework we demonstrate that the tergopleural muscle is activated by a proportional gain component of a nonlinear PI controller responsible for determining the wing pitch angle during large perturbations. A simplified torsional-spring model for the wing hinge captures the changes in the wing pitch dynamics observed during correction maneuvers by using the tergopleural muscle to adjust the rest angle of the wing. These findings provide a striking example of reflex strategy selection in time-critical behaviors and underscores the vital role of indirect steering muscles in flight stabilization.

">mTOR pathway gene knockout results in mTOR-dependent cellular aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Malformations of cortical development (MCD) caused by variants in mTOR pathway genes (MPGs) are a leading cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Characteristic histopathological features of MPG-associated MCD include cytomegaly and cortical dyslamination often with neurons in abnormally close apposition (aggregates). We hypothesized that cellular aggregation is an mTOR-dependent phenotype. Tsc2, Nprl3, Strada or Kptn were knocked out (KO) using CRISPR/Cas9 in N2a cells in vitro. Levels of phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein (PS6; Ser240/244), a marker for mTOR activation, were defined via Western blotting in vitro. Timelapse live-cell imaging was used to observe aggregate formation, with or without mTORC1 inhibition (rapamycin). EdU-base cell proliferation assay and cell death assays were performed to determine whether aggregation was the result of changes in cell cycle or increased cell death. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to define changes in the cell aggregate proteome. Human MCD brain tissue specimens were stained with PS6 to assay mTOR signaling in neuronal clusters. All knockout lines formed multi-cell aggregates compared to control lines within 24-48 hours of plating in vitro. Aggregation was abolished with mTOR inhibitor treatment, establishing the mTOR-dependency of aggregate formation. Aggregation was not driven by cell proliferation, apoptosis/necrosis, or the presence of extracellular DNA in culture media. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed altered expression of protein across KO lines including adhesion molecules (e.g., contactin-3), cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., stathmin-2), and protein processing/transport (e.g., Uevld). Our findings establish aberrant cellular aggregation as an mTOR-dependent phenotype across multiple MPG associated with MCD. Changes in expression of adhesion molecules may contribute to abnormal cell aggregation and cortical lamination in MCD and results in abnormal network formation that leads to seizures.

">Phospho-eIF2B-epsilon links stress response-driven translation to amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                A central aetiopathological event in Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) derived from the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, a pathway initiated by BACE1. Chronic activation of the Integrated Stress Response is linked to Alzheimer disease, typically through eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which selectively enhances translation of key stress-responsive mRNAs like ATF4 and BACE1. We investigated a novel regulatory mechanism mediated by Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a hyperactive kinase in Alzheimer disease, on the translational factor eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2. We treated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) with a GSK-3beta inhibitor (NP031112) or overexpressed a constitutively active GSK-3beta mutant (GSK-3beta-S9A) on HEK cells to modulate GSK-3beta activity. GSK-3beta inhibition significantly reduced ATF4 and BACE1 protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner as we tested by western blot (P<0.001), independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation. This effect was translational, as the inhibitor still reduced BACE1 levels when transcription was blocked. Crucially, NP031112 reversed stress-induced eIF2Bepsilon phosphorylation at Ser540 (P<0.001). Furthermore, H2O2-induced Abeta1-42 secretion by SH-SY5Y cells was significantly reversed by GSK-3beta inhibition (P<0.001). Luciferase reporter assays using the BACE1 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) confirmed that both eIF2Bepsilon silencing and a phosphomimetic mutant eIF2Bepsilon-S540E increased BACE1 5' UTR-driven translation (P<0.001), demonstrating that reduced functional eIF2B enhances BACE1 translation. Finally, immunohistofluorescence and western blot analysis of human AD hippocampi confirmed the translational link, showing a significant increase in pS540-eIF2Bepsilon, ATF4, and BACE1 levels in AD patients compared to non-demented controls (P<0.001 for all three). Our findings establish a novel GSK-3beta-eIF2Bepsilon-BACE1 axis that links stress response dysregulation to amyloidogenesis, independent of canonical eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of eIF2Bepsilon functionally mimics the effects of eIF2alpha phosphorylation by reducing the available functional eIF2B pool, thereby reprogramming translation to favour the production of stress proteins like ATF4 and BACE1. Based on our results, we proposed that eIF2Bepsilon phosphorylation is a key etiological mechanism in Alzheimer disease.

">Investigating the Influence of Anti-Seizure Medications on Aperiodic EEG Activity</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) signals comprise both oscillatory (periodic) and non-oscillatory (aperiodic) components. Aperiodic activity forms the 1/f-like background of the EEG power spectrum and can be characterised by parameters describing the offset and slope (1/f exponent). Evidence from computational modelling and GABAergic drug studies suggests that increased inhibitory input steepens this slope. This study examined the effects of two antiseizure medications (ASMs) that reduce cortical excitability through different mechanism of action on aperiodic EEG activity. Resting EEG was recorded with eyes open and closed from 13 healthy male volunteers at baseline and two hours after administration of lamotrigine (300 mg), levetiracetam (3000 mg), or placebo. Power spectra were computed using Welch's method and aperiodic parameters estimated with the specparam algorithm. In the eyes-open condition, lamotrigine significantly reduced the aperiodic offset from pre- to post-dose (p = 0.022) and relative to placebo (p = 0.0032), indicating lower broadband power at low frequencies. No significant changes in slope were found under either condition during eyes-closed, and levetiracetam produced no measurable effects on any parameter. These findings indicate that aperiodic metrics may capture specific neurophysiological mechanisms, with lamotrigine producing a broadband reduction in EEG power consistent with its suppression of cortical excitability via sodium channel blockade.

">Hypoxia-induced regulation of zDHHC23 opens avenues for new biomarkers for NON MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Neuroblastoma is a highly metastatic paediatric malignancy with poor prognosis, and remains a leading cause of paediatric cancer mortality. Current risk stratification is disproportionately reliant on MYCN amplification, a feature present in only ~25% of cases. This narrow focus neglects the majority of patients that have non-MYCN amplified tumours, limiting opportunities for therapeutic innovation. To define molecular drivers of metastasis in non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma and identify putative prognostic markers, we leveraged our validated in vivo chick embryo xenograft model to profile oxygen-sensitive transcriptional changes, revealing a cohort of ~400 genes associated with metastatic competence. Integrative survival analysis using two independent patient cohorts identified 59 genes predictive of event-free survival in non-MYCN amplified disease. Among these, the poorly characterized Zinc Finger DHHC-Type Palmitoyltransferase 23 (zDHHC23) emerged as a robust prognostic candidate. Proteomic interrogation of zDHHC23 under varying oxygen conditions uncovered dynamic interactome remodelling, notably hypoxia-attenuated association with the 26S proteasome and the TIM23 mitochondrial import complex. These findings suggest zDHHC23 as a hypoxia-responsive regulator linked to metastatic signalling, and a promising target for biomarker development and therapeutic intervention in high-risk, non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma.

">Activity drives local CaMKII synthesis and subcellular localization via autophosphorylation-dependent pathways</a></h4>

              
                Strong repeated stimulation of a neuron triggers an increase in local protein synthesis along with a change in localization of proteins, allowing the neuron to rapidly adjust its proteome in response to activity. One of these proteins, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), is involved in mediating structural and functional changes after activity. While postsynaptic CaMKII translation has been studied, very little is known about presynaptic synthesis, including its mechanisms and the functional consequences. We utilized the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model to study the molecular requirements for activity-dependent synthesis along with the localization of CaMKII protein. Presynaptic-specific tagging of endogenous CaMKII demonstrates that spaced stimulation rapidly increases presynaptic CaMKII through local translation of pre-existing mRNA, independently of somatic factors. This activity-dependent synthesis requires the distal 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the CaMKII mRNA, which is also necessary for steady-state synaptic accumulation. Additionally, we show that activity-dependent synthesis requires CaMKII T287 autophosphorylation-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway. While activity-dependent redistribution of CaMKII has been previously identified, very little is known about how local synthesis and translocation may interact to define different pools of protein that may have distinct functions. We demonstrate that CaMKII with a T287D phosphomimetic mutant localizes to the synaptic membrane and pulse-chase experiments show that the localization of newly-synthesized CaMKII differs from pre-existing CaMKII, indicating neuronal activity generates spatially distinct, and likely functionally distinct, CaMKII populations which may underlie long-lasting plasticity.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Visual working memory is crucial for goal-directed thoughts and behaviors. However, it is not clear how goals modulate working memory maintenance, as previous models often considered stimulus encoding to be the endpoint of goal-directed control. To address this gap, eighty adults performed delayed estimation tasks while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography. In each trial, participants memorized three visual gratings varying in orientation and location and were instructed which attribute to recall. Based on recall success, trials were classified as successful or unsuccessful. We examined the effects of task instructions and their behavioral relevance using event-related potentials and multivariate pattern analysis during encoding and maintenance. The orientation task elicited larger contralateral delay activity than the location task. Moreover, the two tasks were decodable from brain patterns during the maintenance phase, and these patterns did not generalize to the encoding phase, suggesting that goal-directed modulation during maintenance was not merely a consequence of selective encoding. We further found that goal-directed modulation involves two functionally distinct processes that unfold dynamically over time, with the latter beginning even before stimulus offset and continuing throughout the entire maintenance phase. Finally, task decoding accuracy was consistently higher for successful than unsuccessful trials during maintenance.</span>

Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated somatosensory evoked magnetic fields during two types of finger movement, varying in speed and force exertion. We focused on three SI components—M20, M30, and M38—occurring within 20 to 40 ms post-stimulation. Across all movement conditions, the M20 and M30 amplitudes were significantly reduced when compared with the stationary condition, reflecting sensory gating, whereas M38 was significantly enhanced during both the rotation and pinch tasks. Further analyses revealed that the reduction in M20 was sensitive to movement speed, and that of M30 was influenced by both speed and force. In contrast, the enhancement of M38 was modulated by the finger movement type. These findings suggest that SI activity is not uniformly inhibited during movement, but selectively modulated in a context-dependent manner. The initial components in the SI may reflect the filtering of predictable inputs, whereas M38 could represent the more complex integration associated with skillful finger movement. Thus, our results suggest a dynamic somatosensory processing mechanism that underpins fine motor control.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding narratives requires at least transient access to the semantic system, to decode incoming content, and prolonged access to the default mode network to maintain and manipulate the narrative model. Subregions within the integrative semantic hubs in bilateral anterior temporal lobe appear differentially sensitive to the need to rapidly decode external input (exogenous processing) versus reflecting on context stored in the narrative model (endogenous processing). The latter is most consistently reported in the middle temporal gyrus portion of the hub, suggesting that this region serves as a critical hinge point, dynamically interacting with the default mode network to facilitate endogenous processing. The present study investigated this by characterizing the functional connectivity profiles of anterior temporal lobe subregions during movie-viewing and examining content-evoked changes in these profiles. Compared to other anterior temporal lobe subregions, middle temporal gyrus was more functionally connected to the default mode network, and these connections were strengthened during moments with limited incoming information, providing viewers with a chance to reflect on the content. Rather than being functionally distinct networks, the semantic and default mode systems dynamically interact to facilitate reflection or endogenous semantic processing. Future work should further characterize how neural systems dynamically shift from integrated to segregated states in response to everyday processing demands.</span>

                <p>Emotional dysregulation is highly comorbid with sleep disturbances. Sleep is composed of unique physiological states that are reflected by conserved brain oscillations. Though the role of these state-dependent oscillations in cognitive function has been well established, less is known regarding the nature of state-dependent oscillations across brain regions that strongly contribute to emotional function. To characterize these dynamics, we recorded local field potentials simultaneously from multiple cortical and subcortical regions implicated in sleep and emotion regulation and characterized widespread patterns of spectral power and synchrony between brain regions during sleep-wake states in male and female mice. First, we showed that single brain regions encode sleep state, albeit to various degrees of accuracy. We then identified network-based classifiers of sleep based on the combination of features from all recorded brain regions. Spectral power and synchrony from brain networks allowed for automatic, accurate, and rapid discrimination of wake, non-REM sleep (NREM), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. When we examined the impact of commonly prescribed sleep-promoting medications on neural dynamics across these regions, we found disparate alterations to both cortical and subcortical activity across all three states. Finally, we found that a stress manipulation that disrupts circadian rhythm in male mice increased sleep fragmentation without altering the underlying average brain dynamics across sleep-wake states. Thus, we characterized state-dependent brain dynamics across regions canonically associated with emotions.</p>

                Background Neonatal hypothermia is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and death in the world, especially in low-income countries like Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, despite many studies being conducted on neonatal hypothermia, the reported findings are inconsistent. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to assess the pooled prevalence and factors associated with neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia. Objectives This study aims to assess the pooled prevalence and factors associated with neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia. Methods An extensive systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to extract studies on the pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia. The PubMed, Medline, Google, Google Scholar, CINAL, and EMBASE were systematically searched. Nine articles assessed the pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia and associated factors in Ethiopia were included. Articles selected and extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported to Stata version 14 for analysis. I-squared was used to assess the heterogeneity of the included papers, while Egger’s regression test and the funnel plot were used to check publication bias. Results A total of nine primary articles that going well together the inclusion criteria with a total population of 4075 were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia was found to be 61.81% (95% CI: 57.21%, 66.41%). Neonates who had delayed initiation of breast feeding (Odds Ratio: 3.1; 95% CI: 2.37, 4.05), neonates who had no skin to skin contact (Odds Ratio: 4.4; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.27), neonates delivered at night time (Odds Ratio: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.90, 4.69), being low birth weight (Odds Ratio: 3.61; 95% CI: 2.35, 5.54) and neonates who had early bathing (Odds Ratio: 5.27; 95% CI: 2.73, 10.17) were factors significantly associated with hypothermia. Conclusion We found that the pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia was high. Thus, The concerned stakeholders should work to strengthen the neonatal care practice to include the possible significant factors of neonatal hypothermia.

                Background The global age-standardised suicide rate is estimated at 8.9/100 000, while South Africa is at 23.5/100 000. The prehospital Emergency Medical Services is located within this burden of health. Emergency Care providers have a duty to assess, treat and transport healthcare consumers with suicidality, when attending to the suicide caseload. The aim was to appraise suicidality case frequency and typology and estimate the scope of the challenge faced by a jurisdictional emergency medical service and its care providers. Methods Using a retrospective cross-sectional design and a novel data collection instrument, a census of three years of Ambulance Incident Management Records was undertaken in a rural district of the Western Cape, South Africa. Results Of 413,712 records, 2,976 (N) mental health-related incidents were sampled. Fourteen percent (n = 412) were assessed to have descriptors of suicidal ideation (n = 227), attempted suicide (n = 83) or death by suicide (n = 102). There were, on average, 2.8 deaths by suicide per month over the 3-year study period in the Garden Route District. Women were reported to mostly ingest poison and overdose on medication, while men used strangulation and were 5 times more likely to die by suicide than women. Conclusion This study estimates the prehospital suicide and suicidality burden for the Western Cape Government Emergency Medical Services, elucidating an under-researched health concern within the South African prehospital space. Further study is required on the risk of emergency care provider stigmatisation towards suicide and suicidality cases, while auditing the need to assess policy, praxis, medical surveillance, EC provider clinical capacity and victim needs and experiences. Suicidality and suicide in Southern Africa could require a ‘Syndemic’ approach for the emergency service to interrupt suicidality and advance professional relevance.

                Background The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in military targeting systems represents one of the most significant technological shifts in modern warfare, fundamentally altering the speed, precision, and scale of military operations. In the context of the Iranian-Israeli conflict, both nations have emerged as early adopters of AI-enhanced military technologies, albeit through markedly different strategic approaches and technological implementations. Method This study employs a mixed-method analytical approach that combines technical system assessment, comparative case study analysis, and evaluation of the international legal framework. Data collection utilized cross-checking methodology across multiple source types, including investigative journalism, open-source intelligence (OSINT) platforms, military data, and peer-reviewed studies to address three core research questions regarding technical architecture differences, operational effectiveness metrics, and compliance with International Humanitarian Law. Results The analysis reveals substantial differences in both approach and capability. Israeli systems exhibit advanced data integration and surveillance architectures, emphasizing precision and human machine collaboration through platforms such as the Iron Dome, Lavender, and various targeting support technologies. In contrast, Iranian systems prioritize cost-effectiveness and asymmetric capabilities, focusing on autonomous drone operations and cyber warfare integration, albeit with limited independently verified performance metrics. Notable divergences exist in operational doctrine, human oversight mechanisms, and legal compliance frameworks. While field results reveal that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in warfare must be subject to international law to avoid significant civilian casualties. Conclusion While both countries have incorporated AI technologies into military operations, critical gaps in international governance underscore the urgent need for robust regulatory mechanisms to oversee autonomous weapon systems. These findings contribute to academic understanding of military AI implementation patterns and inform policy debates on the ethical and legal dimensions of algorithmic warfare

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1199/v1?src=rss">Aerodynamic Performance of a Baja SAE Vehicle Using Hybrid RANS-LES Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study presents a high-fidelity computational investigation of the aerodynamic performance of a Baja SAE off-road vehicle using a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence modeling approach. The methodology combines the Spalart–Allmaras RANS model for near-wall flow treatment with Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) for resolving large-scale unsteady turbulent structures in the vehicle’s wake. A detailed computational domain and refined meshing strategy were implemented using ANSYS Fluent, including mesh adaptation based on the LES filter size (Δ = 23.5 mm) and mesh independence validation. Simulations were performed under steady (RANS) and unsteady (DES) conditions at 30 km/h, yielding a drag coefficient (Cd) of 1.290 for RANS and 1.249 for DES. While RANS provided stable results with low variance (σ = 0.005), the DES model captured transient phenomena such as vortex shedding and near-wake recirculation with higher accuracy (σ = 0.024), enhancing the prediction of flow separation zones and aerodynamic forces. Pressure and velocity field analyses revealed improved resolution of stagnation zones and vortex dynamics under the DES framework, particularly around the roof, rear, and underbody regions. The Q-criterion visualization showed that DES allowed the identification of both large-scale and fine-scale vortex structures in the near and far wake, offering a comprehensive representation of turbulence intensity and flow instabilities. These findings confirm the suitability of hybrid RANS–LES methods for aerodynamic optimization of complex vehicle geometries, providing enhanced predictive capabilities compared to traditional steady-state models.

                Background The use of artificial intelligence or machine learning in the development of prediction models is increasing exponentially but the present model is associated with a high degree of heterogeneity and associated bias. The present model is associated with a difficult learning curve and we aimed to develop a tool evaluating risk of bias in cardiology research which was succinct and effective. Methods Our tool (AIr) consists of 10 questions and can be utilised to assess the risk of bias in model development, external validation, and the combination of the two in machine-learned or artificial intelligence models. Results AIr was as effective as the current risk of bias tool, PROBAST, however, was significantly more succinct and had a greater inter-rater reliability than PROBAST. Conclusion We propose that our tool maintains validity regarding the assessment of the risk of bias in cardiology publications whilst increasing reliability when compared with PROBAST.

                <p>by Yihao Yin, Linzhi Zhuang, Yulei Wang, Yazhou Shi, Bengong Zhang</p>

Understanding gene regulation during cell differentiation requires effective integration of multi-omics single-cell data. In this study, we propose BranchKGN, a heterogeneous graph transformer-based framework for identifying branch-specific key genes along cell differentiation trajectories. By integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data into a unified gene representation, we infer differentiation trajectories using Slingshot and construct a heterogeneous graph capturing gene–cell relationships. Through attention-based graph learning, BranchKGN assigns gene importance scores within each cell, enabling the identification of genes consistently informative across branch point cells and their descendant lineages. These genes are then used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and differentiation trajectories. Validation on three independent datasets demonstrates that the identified gene sets not only capture key regulators of cell fate bifurcation but also support accurate reconstruction of differentiation trajectories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of BranchKGN in dissecting gene regulation dynamics during cellular transitions and provide a valuable tool for multi-omics single-cell analysis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in many eukaryotes. Next-generation sequencing of small RNAs (small RNA-seq) is central to the discovery and annotation of miRNAs. Newly annotated miRNAs and their longer precursors encoded by <i>MIRNA</i> loci are typically submitted to databases such as the miRBase microRNA registry following the publication of a peer-reviewed study. However, genome-wide scans using small RNA-seq data often yield high rates of false-positive <i>MIRNA</i> annotations, highlighting the need for more robust validation methods. miRScore was developed as an independent and efficient tool for evaluating new <i>MIRNA</i> annotations using sRNA-seq data. miRScore combines structural and expression-based analyses to provide rapid and reliable validation of new <i>MIRNA</i> annotations. By providing users with detailed metrics and visualization, miRScore enhances the ability to assess confidence in <i>MIRNA</i> annotations. miRScore has the potential to advance the overall quality of <i>MIRNA</i> annotations by improving accuracy of new submissions to miRNA databases and serving as a resource for re-evaluating existing annotations.

                <p>by Aitor Oviedo-Madrid, José González-Gomariz, Ruben Armañanzas</p>

Micro-RNAs (miRNA) and their relationship with messenger RNAs (mRNA) have been widely associated with disease development and progression. Post-transcriptional coregulatory networks are sets of miRNA-mRNA interactions that regulate specific genetic behaviors through their combined activity. However, identifying reliable sets of such interactions associated with specific diseases remains challenging, partly due to the high rate of false positives and the lack of user-friendly tools developed for this purpose. In this work, we introduce a new Python package called RNACOREX (RNA CORegulatory network EXplorer and classifier). RNACOREX is a new, easy-to-use tool that allows researchers to find disease associated post-transcriptional coregulatory networks and use them to classify new unseen observations of miRNA and mRNA quantifications. RNACOREX combines structural information from curated databases with expression data analysis, using conditional mutual information to infer reliable sets of miRNA–mRNA interactions. These sets are then used to build probabilistic models based on Conditional Linear Gaussian (CLG) classifiers, which allow both prediction on new samples and validation of the inferred networks.
To demonstrate its capabilities, we tested RNACOREX in 13 different databases from the The Cancer Genome Atlas Program, generating the associated post-transcriptional coregulatory networks and extracting classification performance metrics for each tumor type. Specifically, we used RNACOREX to classify patients according to their survival time in each cancer type, highlighting miRNA–mRNA interactions that consistently appeared across different cancer types. The results show that RNACOREX achieves competitive predictive performance compared to widely used classification algorithms, while offering the added benefit of interpretability through its graph-based modeling framework.

The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate <i>in vitro</i> vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 562 times compared to single-core CPM code execution on CPU. Over short timescales of up to 3 recursive evaluations, or 300 MCS, our model captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as a step toward efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM simulations of biological processes.

Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells have a wide range of sizes and ploidies, but the mechanisms patterning their size and spatial distribution remain unclear. Here, we show that the same genetic pathway creating giant cells in sepals also regulates cell size in the leaf epidermis, leading to the formation of giant cells. In both sepals and leaves, giant cells are scattered among smaller cells; therefore, we asked whether their spatial arrangement is random. By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues, we show that the giant cell pattern becomes less random across the epidermis as the cells surrounding giant cells divide, leading to clustered patterns in mature tissues. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model reproduces the giant cell organization, suggesting that random giant cell initiation together with the divisions of surrounding cells lead to the observed clustered pattern. These findings reveal that cell-size patterning is developmentally regulated by common mechanisms in leaves and sepals, and the spatial pattern of giant cells emerges from the interplay between stochastic cell-autonomous gene expression and tissue growth.

                <p>by J. Benito Wainwright, Charlotte E. J. Rolfe, Graeme D. Ruxton, Nathan W. Bailey</p>

One of the most enduring mysteries in biology concerns the evolution of complex adaptations made up of interacting component traits. When these component traits do not enhance fitness independently of one another, their origin requires that they evolve sequentially through intermediate steps that do not produce their full adaptive value as a combined trait, or alternatively, that they arise via simultaneous, synergistic evolution. We tested these alternatives using the powerful but accessible example of leaf masquerade in katydids, where in some species, highly modified wings strikingly mimic vegetation to avoid predator recognition. Combining a field predation experiment with a phylogenetic comparative analysis of wing morphology in 58 Neotropical katydid species, we show that color and shape synergistically interact to enhance survival in the wild, and modifications in both traits evolved concurrently during diversification of this clade. Our findings identify the adaptive value of masquerade camouflage in the wild and show how concordant evolutionary change in separate traits—evolutionary synergy—can generate extraordinarily specialized, multi-component adaptations.

Haplodiploid inheritance, in which females are diploid and males are haploid, is found in all species of Hymenoptera. Sex in haplodiploids is commonly determined by the alleles present at a complementary sex determination (CSD) locus, with heterozygosity triggering the female developmental pathway. The identity of this locus differs among taxa and is only known in a few species. Here, we map a single CSD locus to a 2 kbp region in the genome of the red mason bee <i>Osmia bicornis.</i> It overlaps the long noncoding RNA <i>ANTSR</i>, which has been identified as the sex-determining gene in the invasive ant <i>Linepithema humile</i>. This locus is homozygous in diploid males and exhibits extremely high levels of haplotype diversity, consistent with the action of frequency-dependent selection. The elevated levels of heterozygosity in the CSD locus enable us to fine-map potentially functional genetic variation within it. We also identify elevated levels of genetic diversity in the ortholog of the CSD locus in five other bee and ant genera, suggesting that it may govern sex determination widely in Hymenoptera. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that <i>ANTSR</i> evolved a role in sex determination over 150 million years ago and is the ancestral sex-determination locus of bees and ants.

                Background Corneal diseases, if untreated, can result in irreversible blindness. Corneal transplantation is an established treatment that restores vision in affected individuals. Expanding public awareness of eye donation is essential to increase the availability of donor corneas and reduce the burden of corneal blindness. This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of Trinidadians toward eye donation. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2020 among 398 adults (≥18 years) across eight counties in Trinidad. Data were collected using a predesigned, pre-tested structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings, and the results were presented as percentages. Cross-tabulations and multivariable logistic regression were performed to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of eye donation. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Of the 398 participants, 57.3% (n = 228) were female and 32.7% (n = 130) were younger than 24 years. Nearly all (99.5%, n = 396) had formal education, with 47.9% (n = 191) holding graduate degrees. Just over half (54.3%, n = 216) were aware that the cornea could be donated. Among these, the internet (15.9%, n = 63) and television (15.3%, n = 61) were the primary information sources. Only 14.6% (n = 58) correctly identified the ideal timeframe (within six hours of death) for eye harvesting. Multivariable regression showed that sex (OR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.18–2.74) and education (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28–0.71) were associated with knowledge, while religion (OR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.03–8.28) influenced perception. Conclusions Trinidadians demonstrated moderate knowledge but poor attitudes toward eye donation. Sex, education, and religion were the key predictors of awareness and perception. To improve donor cornea availability, public awareness must be strengthened through culturally sensitive national strategies such as digital campaigns, televised programs, workshops, and educational outreach.

                Background Gender inference from names is widely used in bibliometric and epidemiologic research, including in general internal medicine. Traditional tools such as Gender API and NamSor are considered accurate but remain limited by misclassifications and unclassified cases. Recent studies suggest that ChatGPT may perform comparably to these tools. We aimed to test whether a two-step procedure could further improve ChatGPT’s performance. Methods We evaluated ChatGPT-5 against Gender API using a random sample of 1,000 Swiss physicians. A two-step one-shot prompt was applied: 1-assign gender directly from the name if reliable; 2-otherwise, verify using the internet. Gender API was applied to the same dataset with no threshold and at probability thresholds of ≥60%, ≥70%, ≥80%, and ≥90%. Confusion matrices, McNemar’s test, and accuracy metrics (errorCoded, errorCodedWithoutNA, naCoded) were computed. Results Of 1,000 physicians, 523 (52.3%) were women and 477 (47.7%) were men. ChatGPT-5 achieved 996 correct classifications (99.6%), with 4 errors and no unclassified cases, whereas Gender API (whole sample) achieved 977 correct classifications (97.7%), 18 errors, and 5 unclassified cases (p-value<0.001). At higher thresholds, Gender API reduced errors but produced up to 6.5% unclassified cases. Overall error rates (errorCoded) were 0.4% for ChatGPT-5 versus 2.3% for Gender API. ChatGPT-5 marked 10.1% of names as “checked” through internet verification, increasing to 69.6% among cases that Gender API misclassified or left unclassified. Conclusion ChatGPT-5 substantially outperformed Gender API in gender inference from physicians’ names, achieving near-perfect accuracy without unclassified cases. Its adaptive use of internet verification for difficult names may offer a robust and efficient approach for large-scale research.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The epigenome provides the brain with a nucleus-templated form of plasticity that is of fundamental importance for learning and memory. Of the various types of epigenetic modifications, elevations in histone acetylation have been shown to accompany learning and memory, yet the role this epigenetic modification plays within specific cell populations has remained unexplored. Here, we developed a genetic approach to manipulate whole-genome histone acetylation in memory-bearing neuronal ensembles. By showing that an increase in histone acetylation promotes fear memory recall, while its downregulation has the opposite effect, we revealed the existence of a functional relationship between histone acetylation and memory expression within memory-bearing engram cells.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal-based associative learning is a cornerstone of human behavior and is compromised in schizophrenia. Learning is subserved by time-driven brain network dynamics during encoding and retrieval of associations, but the impact of these dynamics on effective connectivity (EC) is unclear. We used Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to investigate (a) patient-control differences in connectivity, (b) time-related impacts on connectivity, and (c) the interaction between group and time. We investigated a closed network of regions including the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, the hippocampus, and regions in the magno- and parvo-cellular visual pathways. fMRI data (3 T Siemens Verio) were collected in 90 participants (52 stable schizophrenia patients) using an object-location associative learning paradigm with conditions for (a) Encoding (encoding <i>what</i> goes <i>where</i>) and (b) Retrieval (retrieving <i>what</i> was in the cued location). Competing network architectures were evaluated using DCM. We analyzed DCM-derived EC estimates of the contextual modulation of pathways by task condition and time, with a focus on inter-group differences and interactions with time. The winning model architecture revealed contextual modulation of bottom-up but not top-down pathways. In SCZ, encoding resulted in reduced contextual modulation of hippocampal ➔dACC and the dlPFC ➔ dACC pathways (emphasizing the importance of this triumvirate of regions). In SCZ, retrieval resulted in reduced modulation of the dlPFC ➔ dACC pathway. We observed widespread evidence for the plasticity of connection strengths over time (independent of Group). Finally, retrieval evoked an interaction in the contextual modulation of the inferior temporal ➔ hippocampus pathway (decreased modulation over time in HC, but increased modulation in SCZ). Our DCM-based investigation re-affirms the important role of frontal–hippocampal pathways in memory encoding and retrieval, elucidates the nature of memory dynamics, and reveals task-evoked disruption of network function in schizophrenia.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can occur from either traumatic or non-traumatic causes. While traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), caused by acute external forces, is well-researched, non-traumatic spinal cord injury (NTSCI), arising from chronic conditions like tumors and infections, is often underreported and misclassified. NTSCI is increasingly recognized as a major cause of SCI globally, particularly affecting the elderly and infants. Despite its prevalence, research on NTSCI remains limited, necessitating new models to understand its pathophysiology. This study introduces a novel, repeatable model for NTSCI in both neonatal (9 days post-partum) and adult rats (9 weeks post-partum), simulating chronic compression injuries. The model uses 3D-printed (PLA) spacers to induce mild–moderate compression in the lower thoracic vertebrae. Six weeks of spinal cord compression resulted in locomotor deficits and cellular changes consistent with hypoxic–ischemic injury due to disrupted blood flow, without significant long-term inflammation or astrogliosis. This versatile model can be easily adapted for different age groups, for graded injury severities, and for different injury durations. It offers a promising avenue for understanding and treating chronic compression NTSCI, addressing a critical gap in current research. This model can be used in future research to test and understand the effectiveness and pathophysiology of decompression and cellular interventions in response to chronic compression NTSCI.</p>

     alt="Adult Striatal Neurogenesis—A Comparative Approach Between Pigeons, Mice, Macaques, and Human"/>
<p>Striatal adult neurogenesis is an understudied field. Here, we add new quantitative data showing that pigeons provide high levels of adult neurogenesis in the striatum compared to mice. Besides, we show that macaque and human differ in their potential to produce adult-born neurons at least in the caudate nucleus.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis describes the formation of new neurons in the adult brain, a process that is fundamental to related functions, particularly in the hippocampus. Although studies reported adult striatal neurogenesis in humans, the phenomenon is still understudied in those regions. Thus, to gain a deeper understanding in different species, the expression of neurogenic markers was quantitatively analyzed in striatal subregions of pigeons and mice. Further, in macaques and human a detailed analysis of the subventricular zone (SVZ) was performed and the human caudate nucleus was qualitatively examined. The results show higher neuronal plasticity in striatal subregions of pigeons compared to mice, as reflected by higher numbers of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/Doublecortin+, Doublecortin+, and BrdU+/Neuronal nuclei marker+ cells. Analysis of BrdU+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ signals indicated further higher gliogenesis/potential stem cell division in pigeons. As newborn striatal neurons may arise from stem cell niches in the SVZ, active proliferation was analyzed with (sex determining region Y)-box 2, GFAP, and Ki-67 in macaques and humans. Specific subdivisions of the SVZ were identified, with GFAP and Ki-67 differentially distributed. Additionally, signs of persistent neuronal plasticity were observed with Doublecortin+ cells in the human caudate nucleus but not in the macaque. The higher levels of striatal adult neurogenesis in pigeons and perspectives of useful methods may encourage the use of birds to investigate the functional role of this phenomenon and may facilitate our understanding of neuronal plasticity even in the human striatum in the future.</p>

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 03 November 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02866-1">doi:10.1038/s41592-025-02866-1</a></p>Anatomical brain mapping techniques face limitations in accurate fiber reconstruction. The cytoarchitecture-based link estimation (CABLE) framework enables 3D mapping of brain fiber tracts at cellular resolution without fiber-specific staining. Based on intrinsic cytoarchitectonic organization, CABLE provides a new approach for studying brain connectivity in humans and other primates.

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 03 November 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02878-x">doi:10.1038/s41592-025-02878-x</a></p>Modeling cellular responses to developmental and chemical cues is essential for understanding disease progression and informing therapeutic strategies, yet it often demands extensive experimental screening. We have developed a conditional diffusion model called Squidiff, which enables the in silico prediction of single-cell transcriptomic responses to both developmental signals and perturbations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99937">Short heat shock factor A2 regulates heat resistance and growth balance in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Cells prevent heat damage through the highly conserved canonical heat stress response (HSR), where heat shock factors (HSFs) bind heat shock elements (HSEs) to activate heat shock proteins (HSPs). Plants generate short HSFs (S-HSFs) derived from <i>HSF</i> splicing variants, yet their functions remain poorly understood. While an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How plants prevent this hyperactivation to ensure proper growth remains unknown. Here, we report that <i>Arabidopsis</i> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer sensitivity to extreme heat (45°C) and constitute new HSF types featuring a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD). This tDBD binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE), which confers minimal promoter heat-responsiveness and exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. Using S-HsfA2, we investigated whether and how S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. <i>HSP17.6B</i>, a common direct target of HsfA2 and S-HsfA2, confers thermotolerance; however, its overexpression partially causes HSR hyperactivation. Moreover, HRE–HRE-like and HSE elements mediate the <i>HSP17.6B</i> promoter’s heat response. We further show S-HsfA2 alleviates hyperactivation via two mechanisms: (1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates <i>HSP17.6B</i> via the HRE–HRE-like element, establishing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-<i>HSP17.6B</i>) that antagonistically represses HsfA2-activated <i>HSP17.6B</i> expression. (2) S-HsfA2 binds the HsfA2 DBD, preventing HsfA2 from binding HSEs and thereby attenuating HsfA2-activated <i>HSP17.6B</i> promoter activity. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of S-HsfA2 in preventing hyperactivation of plant heat tolerance to maintain proper growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89596">Glucose-stimulated KIF5B-driven microtubule sliding organizes microtubule networks in mouse pancreatic β cells</a></h4>

              
                In pancreatic islet β cells, molecular motors use cytoskeletal polymers microtubules as tracks for intracellular transport of insulin secretory granules. The β-cell microtubule network has a complex architecture and is nondirectional, which provides insulin granules at the cell periphery for rapid secretion response, yet to avoid oversecretion and subsequent hypoglycemia. We have previously characterized a peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array, which is critical for the withdrawal of excessive insulin granules from the secretion sites. Microtubules in β cells originate at the Golgi in the cell interior, and how the peripheral array is formed remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kinesin KIF5B, a motor protein with the capacity to transport microtubules as cargos, is needed to align sub-membrane microtubules in clonal mouse β cells MIN6 and β cells within intact mouse islets. Real-time imaging and photokinetics approaches indicate that KIF5B actively slides existing microtubules to the β-cell periphery. Moreover, like many physiological β-cell features, microtubule sliding is facilitated by a high glucose stimulus. These new data, together with our previous report that high glucose destabilizes the sub-membrane microtubule array to allow for robust secretion, indicate that MT sliding is another integral part of glucose-triggered microtubule remodeling, likely replacing destabilized peripheral microtubules to prevent their loss over time and β-cell malfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107598">Insight into the bioactivity and action mode of betulin, a candidate aphicide from plant metabolite, against aphids</a></h4>

              
                Pest-resistant plants usually utilize secondary metabolites to cope with insect infestation. Betulin, a key bioactive compound in aphid-resistant wild peach, possesses promising applications in crop protection. Here, betulin, in both greenhouse and field experiments, displayed excellent control efficacy against <i>Myzus persicae</i>. RNA-seq, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting revealed that betulin significantly inhibited the expression of <i>MpGABR</i> (encoding a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor). Besides, RNAi-mediated silencing of <i>MpGABR</i> markedly increased aphid sensitivity to betulin. Furthermore, microscale thermophoresis (MST) and voltage-clamp assays indicated that betulin bound to MpGABR (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> = 2.24 µM) and acted as an inhibitor of MpGABR. Molecular docking, mutagenesis, and genome editing suggested that THR228 is a critical and highly conserved site in MpGABR that betulin binds to specifically, causing aphid death. Overall, the activity of betulin depends on specific targeting and inhibition of MpGABR. Elucidating the mechanism of action of this peach-derived insecticide may offer a sustainable green strategy for aphid control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107069">Engineering NIR-sighted bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Spatially and temporally orchestrated gene expression underpins organismal development, physiology, and adaptation. In bacteria, two-component systems (TCS) translate environmental cues into inducible expression outputs. Inducible expression also serves as a versatile instrument in both basic and applied science. Here, we harness the photosensors of rhizobial bathy-phytochromes to construct synthetic TCSs for stringent activation of gene expression by near-infrared (NIR) light in laboratory and probiotic <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains, and in <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>. Orthogonal TCSs afford the multiplexed expression control of several genes by NIR and visible light. Notwithstanding substantial photochemical activation of bathy-phytochromes by visible radiation, the NIR-light-responsive systems hardly responded to red light. Evidently, light signals can be processed by TCSs into highly nonlinear responses at the physiologically relevant level of gene expression. These fundamental aspects likely extend to naturally occurring TCSs. Depending on their photosensor traits and environmental conditions, bathy-phytochromes may thus either be NIR-specific or function as colorblind receptors of light vs. darkness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98798">Characterization of binding kinetics and intracellular signaling of new psychoactive substances targeting cannabinoid receptor using transition-based reweighting method</a></h4>

              
                New psychoactive substances (NPS) targeting human cannabinoid receptor 1 pose a significant threat to society as recreational abusive drugs that have pronounced physiological side effects. These greater adverse effects compared to classical cannabinoids have been linked to the higher downstream <i>β</i>-arrestin signaling. Thus, understanding the mechanism of differential signaling will reveal an important structure-activity relationship essential for identifying and potentially regulating NPS molecules. In this study, we simulate the slow (un)binding process of NPS MDMB-Fubinaca and classical cannabinoid HU-210 from CB<sub>1</sub> using multi-ensemble simulation to decipher the effects of ligand binding dynamics on downstream signaling. The transition-based reweighing method is used for the estimation of transition rates and underlying thermodynamics of (un)binding processes of ligands with nanomolar affinities. Our analyses reveal major interaction differences with transmembrane TM7 between NPS and classical cannabinoids. A variational autoencoder-based approach, neural relational inference (NRI), is applied to assess the allosteric effects on intracellular regions attributable to variations in binding pocket interactions. NRI analysis indicates a heightened level of allosteric control of NPxxY motif for NPS-bound receptors, which contributes to the higher probability of formation of a crucial triad interaction (Y<sup>7.53</sup>-Y<sup>5.58</sup>-T<sup>3.46</sup>) necessary for stronger <i>β</i>-arrestin signaling. Hence, in this work, MD simulation, data-driven statistical methods, and deep learning point out the structural basis for the heightened physiological side effects associated with NPS, contributing to efforts aimed at mitigating their public health impact.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105842">Relative timescale of channel voltage dependence and channel density regulation impacts assembly and recovery of activity</a></h4>

              
                Neurons can maintain stable activity profiles over their lifetimes despite ion channel turnover over minutes to weeks. Neuronal activity is also influenced by regulating the voltage dependence of ion channels. How do these two forms of plasticity work together to maintain a stable activity profile? We augment a classical model of activity-dependent ion channel density regulation with a mechanism that adjusts channel voltage dependence based on activity. These findings reveal that the timescale of these mechanisms shapes the specific electrical activity patterns that achieve a target activity profile. Moreover, alterations in channel voltage dependence can impact a neuron’s ability to recover from perturbations. These results highlight a potentially distinct role for activity-dependent regulation of channel voltage dependence in maintaining stable neuronal activity profiles.
