<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Loss-of-function variants in <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> or <em class="a-plus-plus">EP300</em> result in Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS). The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em>, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Mechanisms and progression of ischemic injuries in the retina are still incompletely clarified. Therefore, the time course of microglia activation as well as resulting cytokine expression and downstream signaling were investigated. Ischemia was induced in one eye by transiently elevated intraocular pressure (60 min) followed by reperfusion; the other eye served as a control. Eyes were processed for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Already 2 h after ischemia, more microglia/macrophages were in an active state in the ischemia group. This was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. Activation of TLR3, TLR2, and the adaptor molecule Myd88 was also observed after 2 h. NFκB revealed a wave-like activation pattern. In addition, an extrinsic caspase pathway activation was noted at early time points, while enhanced numbers of cleaved caspase 3<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> cells could be observed in ischemic retinae throughout the study. Retinal ischemia induced an early and strong microglia/macrophage response as well as cytokine and apoptotic activation processes. Moreover, in early and late ischemic damaging processes, TLR expression and downstream signaling were involved, suggesting an involvement in neuronal death in ischemic retinae.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The effective prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) needs to be explored, and the effect of preoperative pain on POCD remains unclear. We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial, central nervous system, immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Evidence suggests a steady rise in MS prevalence over the past five decades in the United States and around the world. Even with increased understanding of immunology, the specific etiological trigger of MS remains unknown. Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease–modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Due to molecular mimicry, maternal antibacterial antibodies are suspected to promote neurodevelopmental changes in the offspring that finally can cause disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Using a human first trimester prenatal brain multiprotein array (MPA), we demonstrate here that antibodies to the digestive tract bacteria <em class="a-plus-plus">Helicobacter pylori</em> (α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em>) and <em class="a-plus-plus">Campylobacter jejuni</em> (α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>) interact with different synaptic proteins, including the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 5 (Syt5). Interactions of both antisera with Syt5 were confirmed by Western blot with a HEK293-cells overexpression lysate of this protein. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed SiMa cells to express Syt5, which also co-migrated with a band/spot labeled by either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>. Functionally, a 12-h pretreatment of SiMa cells with 10 μg/ml of either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em> resulted in a significant reduction of acetylcholine(ACh)-dependent calcium signals as compared to controls. Also ACh-dependent vesicle recycling was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>. Similar effects were observed upon pretreatment of SiMa cells with Syt5-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the present study supports the view that prenatal maternal antibacterial immune responses towards <em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> and by this to Syt5 are able to cause functional changes, which in the end might contribute also to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Moreover, the regulatory network was constructed with the hub genes as seed nodes with associated transcription factors (TFs) and microRNA (miRNAs). In this analysis, we identified MYC as the major TF and the miRNAs <em class="a-plus-plus">miR-21</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">miR-155</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">miR-7</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">miR26A1</em> have a significant role in modulating the hub genes. Briefly, these significant hub genes and their enriched pathways, TFs, and miRNAs have aided in the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PD and its potential core target genes.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and development of stroke. However, the regulatory function of many lncRNAs in large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) has not been fully elucidated. Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis recently proposed by Pandolfi, the present study was conducted using experimental techniques and bioinformatics to investigate the expression and regulatory function of a lncRNA involved in the development of LAA. The lncRNAs differentially expressed in stroke were obtained using meta-analysis, and one lncRNA was selected for experimental studies on patients with LAA (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 100) and healthy controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 100) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The patients were also evaluated through meta-analysis to identify the function of the selected lncRNA, miRNAs, and mRNAs with altered expression in stroke. Finally, the experimental results and meta-analysis findings were integrated, and different functional groups were assigned. The results indicated that the level of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was significantly lower in the patients with LAA compared to the healthy control subjects (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the expression of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was inversely correlated with LAA (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 009, OR = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.786–0.965). In addition, a network of differentially expressed genes (DE genes) was created for miRNAs and mRNAs based on their association with lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1. Functional analysis showed that the DE genes in the network are involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs. The findings of the present study suggest that the downregulation of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 is associated with LAA development by interrupting the regulatory network of cells. The results of network analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 could influence the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> has been used for the past two decades as neuroprotective treatment in a variety of preterm conditions. Despite the putative advantages of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the short- and long-term molecular function of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent has not been fully elucidated. Neuregulin (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, in the biology of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We hypothesize that this pathway may be associated with the neuroprotective role of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub>. The current study aims to investigate the ability of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> to modulate the normal developing expression pattern of selected genes related to the NRG1-ErbB, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We demonstrate that overall short-term treatment of dam rats with MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> affects the expression of fetal brain NRG1, NRG3, ErbB4, GAD67, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine D<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> and D<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub> receptors, GluN1, and GluN2B. More specifically, the administration of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> alters the expression of NRG-ErbB, GAD67, TH, and D2R at early gestation day 16 (GD16) regardless of the activation of the maternal immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data suggest that MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> treatment may affect the expression of major neuronal systems and pathways mostly at an early gestation day. These changes might be an initial clue (foundation stone) in the molecular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent for the developmental brain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Psychosocial stress has been widely reported to contribute to psychiatric disturbances. Perturbations in the enzymes of GABAergic and cholinergic systems have been implicated as precursors in different stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 kDa (GAD67) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been recognized as prospective strategies for the prevention of psychosocial stress-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin, a neuro-active flavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruits, has been shown to produce memory-enhancing, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory activities similarly to ginseng, a very potent adaptogen. In this communication, we assessed the effect of naringin on social-defeat stress (SDS)-induced behavioral, GABAergic, cholinergic, oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes in mice using the resident–intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were culled into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 (normal- and SDS-controls) received sterile saline, groups 3–5 were given naringin (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) whereas group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, but followed by 10 min SDS (physical and psychological) exposure to groups 2–6 with aggressor–resident mice. Behavioral effects using Y-maze, elevated-plus maze, sociability, and tail-suspension tests were assessed on day 14. GAD67, AChE enzymes, and biomarkers of oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Naringin and ginseng reversed all SDS-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin increased the levels of GAD67 and decreased AChE activities in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Furthermore, naringin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), malondialdehyde, nitrite concentrations, and increased glutathione levels in a region-dependent manner. Our study suggests that naringin attenuated SDS-induced behavioral endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disease through increased GAD67 synthesis, inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative, nitrergic stress, and neuroinflammatory processes in stress-sensitive brain regions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Self-motion perception used for locomotion and navigation requires the integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive input. In the absence of vision, postural stability and locomotor tasks become more difficult. Previous research has suggested that in visually deprived children, postural stability and levels of physical activity are overall lower than in sighted controls. Here we hypothesized that visually impaired and blind children and adolescents differ from sighted controls in postural stability and gait parameters, and that physically active individuals outperform sedentary peers in postural stability and gait parameters as well as in navigation performance. Fourteen blind and visually impaired children and adolescents (8–18 years of age) and 14 matched sighted individuals took part. Assessments included postural sway, single-leg stance time, parameters of gait variability and stability, self-reported physical activity, and navigation performance. Postural sway was larger and single-leg stance time was lower in blind and visually impaired participants than in blindfolded sighted individuals. Physical activity was higher in the sighted group. No differences between the group of blind and visually impaired and blindfolded sighted participants were observed for gait parameters and navigation performance. Higher levels of physical activity were related to lower postural sway, longer single-leg stance time, higher gait stability, and superior navigation performance in blind and visually impaired participants. The present data suggest that physical activity may enhance postural stability and gait parameters, and thereby promote navigation performance in blind and visually impaired children and adolescents.</p>

Dominant neuroanatomical models hold that humans regulate their movements via loop-like cortico-subcortical networks, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), thalamus, and sensorimotor cortices (SMC). Inhibitory commands across these networks are purportedly sent via transient, burst-like signals in the {beta} frequency (15-29Hz). However, since human depth-recording studies are typically limited to one recording site, direct evidence for this proposition is hitherto lacking. Here, we present simultaneous multi-site depth-recordings from SMC and either STN or thalamus in humans performing the stop-signal task. In line with their purported function as inhibitory signals, subcortical {beta}-bursts were increased on successful stop-trials and were followed within 50ms by increased {beta}-bursting over SMC. Moreover, between-site comparisons (including in a patient with simultaneous recordings from all three sites) confirmed that {beta}-bursts in STN precede thalamic {beta}-bursts. This provides first empirical evidence for the role of {beta}-bursts in conveying inhibitory commands along long-proposed cortico-subcortical networks underlying movement regulation in humans.

The flexible and efficient adaptation to dynamic, rapid changes in the auditory environment likely involves generating and updating of internal models. Such models arguably exploit connections between the neocortex and the cerebellum, supporting proactive adaptation. Here we test the functional mechanisms associated with temporo-cerebellar connectivity, verifying these mechanisms for speech sounds. First, we identify lesion-specific deficits for the encoding of short timescale spectro-temporal non-speech and speech properties in patients with left posterior temporal cortex stroke. Second, using lesion-guided probabilistic tractography in healthy participants, we reveal bidirectional temporo-cerebellar connectivity with cerebellar dentate nuclei and crura I/II. These findings imply that the encoding and modeling of rapidly modulated auditory spectro-temporal properties engage a temporo-cerebellar interface. The data further support the conjecture that proactive adaptation to a dynamic environment via internal models is a generalizable principle.

The dynamic and fleeting nature of sound necessitates the rapid encoding and use of information distributed over time. Here we investigated cerebellar contributions to these abilities. We measured EEG from cerebellar patients and healthy controls while they listened to oddball sound sequences consisting of infrequent pitch-deviant and frequent standard tones. Inter-stimulus-intervals were temporally regular (600 ms) or irregular (200-1000 ms). This allowed probing early event-related potentials (ERP; P50, N100) that reflect repetitive and changing stimulus characteristics in temporally regular or less (irregular) predictable sequences. Further, time-frequency data provided an index of temporal processing variability at the stimulation frequencies. We expected that cerebellar lesions lead to aberrant encoding and use of auditory information, reflected in the ERP morphology of peak amplitudes, latencies and typical suppression effects linked to stimulus predictability. Results confirm longer P50 peak latencies in patients and variable processing at stimulation frequencies covarying with the location of cerebellar damage. These findings further support the idea that the cerebellum might play a generalizable role in the encoding of auditory stimulation over time.

The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.







Abstract
Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.

Schwann cells (SCs) were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.







Abstract
Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.

Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.







Abstract
Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of nonneuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.

A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a well encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.







Abstract
The natural endocast Museo di Geologia e Paleontologia of the Università degli Studi di Torino (MGPT)‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between ca. 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe, and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of MGPT‐PU 13873 is ~1.81; therefore, this specimen shows an EQ in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.

Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate Leucoraja erinacea. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention.

Abstract
Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate Leucoraja erinacea. We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor: ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal's anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.

VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.
VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.
Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.









Abstract
The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.

Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a similar general neuroanatomical organization and revealed equivalent innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e., the podia and the spines).







Abstract
The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of representatives of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus, the asteroid Patiria miniata, and the holothuroid Parastichopus parvimensis. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species, including at the level of the appendages. Our results support the previously proposed hypotheses for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis for more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.

Ivanova et al., use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow.







Abstract
Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, and Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.

Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease (LD)—a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the LD mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.







Abstract
Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the EPM2A or the NHLRC1 gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and Cortical layer V of the Epm2a or Nhlrc1 knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in Postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1–2 months) as well as the older (7–8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26042?af=R">Endosome dysregulation in Down syndrome: a potential contributor to Alzheimer's disease pathology</a></h4>

Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, the degradation and the retrograde pathway. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever’, has been reported. While we know a lot about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has been identified yet. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.

Patients with COVID‐19 can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, CXCL8, and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active TGF‐β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a para‐infectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines.

Morphology of Satb2 expressing ganglion cells in macaque, human, and marmoset retinas. The study shows that Satb2 expression in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World and New World primate species.







Abstract
In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue‐yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide‐field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide‐field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT‐rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5–4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction‐selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings imply that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common peripheral vestibular diseases. Since the peripheral vestibular system connects with the cerebellum via the brainstem, repeated episodic vertigo may result in progressive structural and functional changes in the cerebellum and brainstem. In the present work, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of T1-weighted images and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 32 patients with BPPV and 32 matched healthy controls were used to assess cerebellar and brainstem anatomical and spontaneous resting-state brain activity alterations associated with BPPV. We used a spatially unbiased infratentorial template toolbox in combination with VBM to analyze cerebellar and brainstem gray matter volume (GMV), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo). Patients with BPPV showed decreased GMV in the right cerebellum posterior lobe/cerebellar tonsil extending to the cerebellum anterior lobe and pons relative to healthy controls. BPPV patients also exhibited significantly higher fALFF values in the right pons and left pons and higher ReHo values in the left cerebellum posterior lobe/Crus2 than the controls. Furthermore, the fALFF <em class="a-plus-plus">z</em>-scores in the pons were positively correlated with the duration of vertigo at baseline and dizziness visual analog scale scores 1 week after canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs). BPPV patients exhibited structural and functional changes in the cerebellum and pons, which may reflect the adaptation and plasticity of these anatomical structures after repeated attacks of episodic vertigo. These results indicate that the changes in pons function may be closely related to residual dizziness after CRPs.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of the uncommon causes of ischemic stroke, and is associated with young and female patients. However, the significance of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) in older ischemic stroke patients is uncertain. We aimed to examine the significance of aPLs in ischemic stroke in these older patients.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A total of 739 patients with acute ischemic stroke within 7 days of initial symptoms were collected consecutively. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from medical records. aPLs (lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2glycoprotein-I antibody) were measured the day after admission and the presence of at least one antibody was regarded as positive aPL. Patients with positive aPL were rechecked after at least 12 weeks for confirmation of APS.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Of the 739 patients, 103 (13.9%) had at least one aPL initially. These patients were older, had more atrial fibrillation and higher levels of inflammatory markers. Among the 103 aPL positive patients, 41 remained positive at 3 months, 23 showed negative conversion, and 39 were not available for follow-up. Patients diagnosed with APS had higher numbers of aPL and had specifically anti-β2glycoprotein-I IgG antibody. The patients with aPLs did not differ significantly from the others in terms of stroke subtype.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">aPL was rather common in ischemic stroke patients regardless of age. Although the influence of transient positive aPL on ischemic stroke remains uncertain, two or more aPLs and the presence of anti-β2glycoprotein-I IgG may predict a diagnosis of APS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Cognitive and behavioural impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) negatively influences the quality of life and survival, and, therefore, screening for these impairments is recommended. We developed a cognitive screening tool, the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–frontotemporal dementia–cognitive screen (ALS–FTD–Cog) and aimed to validate it in patients with ALS. During the current study, the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) was published and we, therefore, decided to compare these two cognitive screening methods. The ALS–FTD–Cog was administered to 72 patients with ALS, 21 patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) and 34 healthy controls. Twenty-nine patients with ALS underwent the ECAS. ROC curve analyses were performed and sensitivity and specificity of the ALS–FTD–Cog and ECAS were calculated, with a neuropsychological examination (NPE) as the gold standard. Cognitive impairment was present in 28% of patients with ALS. ROC curve analyses of the ALS–FTD–Cog and ECAS showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI 0.58–0.86) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.86–1.03), respectively. Compared to a full NPE, sensitivity and specificity of the ALS–FTD–Cog were 65.0% and 63.5% and of the ECAS 83.3% and 91.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the ALS–FTD–Cog in patients with bvFTD were 94.4% and 100%, respectively. Test characteristics of the ALS–FTD–Cog were moderate, suggesting restricted practical value, as compared to a comprehensive NPE. The ECAS had an excellent AUC and high sensitivity and specificity, indicating that it is a valid screening instrument for cognitive impairment in ALS.</p>

Mental imagery is an important tool in the cognitive control of emotion. The present study tests the prediction that visual imagery can generate and regulate differential fear conditioning via the activation and prioritization of stimulus representations in early visual cortices. We combined differential fear conditioning with manipulations of viewing and imagining basic visual stimuli in humans. We discovered that mental imagery of a fear-conditioned stimulus compared to imagery of a safe conditioned stimulus generated a significantly greater conditioned response as measured by self-reported fear, the skin conductance response, and right anterior insula activity (experiment 1). Moreover, mental imagery effectively down- and up-regulated the fear conditioned responses (experiment 2). Multivariate classification using the functional magnetic resonance imaging data from retinotopically defined early visual regions revealed significant decoding of the imagined stimuli in V2 and V3 (experiment 1) but significantly reduced decoding in these regions during imagery-based regulation (experiment 2).

Scene meaning is processed rapidly, with 'gist' extracted even when presentation duration spans a few dozen milliseconds. This has led some to suggest a primacy of bottom-up information. However, gist research has typically relied on showing successions of unrelated scene images, contrary to our everyday experience in which the world unfolds around us in a predictable manner. Thus, we investigated whether top-down information - in the form of observers' predictions of an upcoming scene - facilitates gist processing. Within each trial, participants (N=336) experienced a series of images, organised to represent an approach to a destination (e.g., walking down a sidewalk), followed by a final target scene either congruous or incongruous with the expected destination (e.g., a store interior or a bedroom). Over a series of behavioural experiments, we found that: appropriate expectations facilitated gist processing; inappropriate expectations interfered with gist processing; the effect of congruency was driven by provision of contextual information rather than the thematic coherence of approach images, and; expectation-based facilitation was most apparent when destination duration was most curtailed. We then investigated the neural correlates of predictability on scene processing using ERP (N=26). Congruency-related differences were found in a putative scene-selective ERP component, related to integrating visual properties (P2), and in later components related to contextual integration including semantic and syntactic coherence (N400 and P600, respectively). Taken together, these results suggest that in real-world situations, top-down predictions of an upcoming scene influence even the earliest stages of its processing, affecting both the integration of visual properties and meaning.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429772v1?rss=1">Effects of LSD are differentially modulated in arrestin knockout mice</a></h4>

Recent evidence suggests that psychedelic drugs can exert beneficial effects on anxiety, depression, and ethanol and nicotine abuse in humans. However, the hallucinogenic side effects of psychedelics often preclude their clinical use. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a prototypical hallucinogen and its psychedelic actions are exerted through the 5HT2A serotonin receptor (5HT2AR). 5HT2AR activation stimulates Gq and arrestin (Arr) mediated signaling. To separate effects of these signaling modes, we have used Arr1 and Arr2 mice. We find that LSD stimulates motor activities to similar extents in WT and Arr1 KO mice, with non-significant effects in Arr2 KOs. LSD robustly stimulates many surrogates of psychedelic drug actions including head twitches, grooming, retrograde walking, and nose poking in WT and Arr1 KO animals. In contrast, LSD only slightly stimulates head twitches in Arr2 KO mice, without effects on retrograde walking or nose poking. The 5HT2AR antagonist MDL100907 (MDL) blocks these LSD effects. LSD also disrupts prepulse inhibition (PPI) in WT and Arr1 KOs. PPI is unaffected in Arr2 KOs. MDL restores PPI in WT mice, but this antagonist is without effect and haloperidol is required in Arr1 KOs. LSD produces a biphasic body-temperature response in WT mice, a monophasic response in Arr1 KOs, and is without effect in Arr2 mutants. Both MDL and the 5HT1AR antagonist, WAY100635 (WAY), block the effects of LSD on body temperatures in WT mice, whereas WAY is effective in Arr1 KOs. Collectively, these results reveal that LSD produces diverse behavioral effects through Arr1 and Arr2, and that the psychedelic drug-like actions of LSD appear to require Arr2.

The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) form a family of neuromodulatory G protein-coupled receptors that contain both a seven-helix transmembrane domain (TMD) and a large extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD) which enables stable dimerization. While numerous studies have revealed variability across subtypes in the initial activation steps at the level of LBD dimers, an understanding of inter-TMD interaction and rearrangement remains limited. Here we use a combination of single molecule fluorescence, molecular dynamics, functional assays, and conformational sensors to reveal that distinct TMD assembly properties drive differences between mGluR subtypes. We uncover a variable region within transmembrane helix 4 (TM4) that contributes to homo- and heterodimerization in a subtype-specific manner and tunes orthosteric, allosteric and basal activation. We also confirm a critical role for a conserved inter-TM6 interface in stabilizing the active state during orthosteric or allosteric activation. Together this study informs a working model of inter-TMD rearrangement that drives mGluR function.

Competing motivational drives coordinate behaviors essential for survival. For example, interoceptive feedback from the body during a state of negative energy balance serves to suppress anxiety-like behaviors and promote exploratory behaviors in rats. Results from past research suggest that this shift in motivated behavior is linked to reduced activation of specific neural populations within the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS). However, the potential impact of metabolic state and the potential role of cNTS neurons on conditioned avoidance behaviors has not been examined. The present study investigated these questions in male and female rats, using a task in which rats learn to avoid a context (i.e., a darkened chamber) after it is paired with a single mild footshock. When rats later were tested for passive avoidance of the shock-paired chamber, male rats tested in an overnight food-deprived state and female rats (regardless of feeding status) displayed significantly less avoidance compared to male rats that were fed ad libitum prior to testing. Based on prior evidence that prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP)-positive noradrenergic neurons and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)-positive neurons within the cNTS are particularly sensitive to metabolic state, we examined whether these neural populations are activated in conditioned rats after re-exposure to the shock-paired chamber, and whether neural activation is modulated by metabolic state. Compared to the control condition, chamber re-exposure activated PrRP+ noradrenergic neurons and also activated neurons within the anterior ventrolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vlBNST), which receives dense input from PrRP+ terminals. In parallel with sex differences in passive avoidance behavior, PrRP+ neurons were less activated in female vs. male rats after chamber exposure. GLP1+ neurons were not activated in either sex. Overnight food deprivation before chamber re-exposure reduced activation of PrRP+ neurons, and also reduced vlBNST activation. Our results support the view that PrRP+ noradrenergic neurons and their inputs to the vlBNST contribute to the expression of passive avoidance memory, and that this contribution is modulated by metabolic state.

The study of states of arousal is key to understand the principles of consciousness. Yet, how different brain states emerge from the collective activity of brain regions remains unknown. Here, we studied the fMRI brain activity of monkeys during wakefulness and anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. Using maximum entropy models, we derived collective, macroscopic properties that quantify the system's capabilities to produce work, to contain information and to transmit it, and that indicate a phase transition from critical awake dynamics to supercritical anesthetized states. Moreover, information-theoretic measures identified those parameters that impacted the most the network dynamics. We found that changes in brain state and in state of consciousness primarily depended on changes in network couplings of insular, cingulate, and parietal cortices. Our findings suggest that the brain state transition underlying the loss of consciousness is predominantly driven by the uncoupling of specific brain regions from the rest of the network.

Abstract
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.

<p>by Giulia Fiscon, Federica Conte, Lorenzo Farina, Paola Paci</p>

The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug–disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic similarity (i.e., SARS), comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), or for their association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19 (e.g., malaria, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis). Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments (e.g., <i>chloroquine</i>, <i>hydroxychloroquine</i>, <i>tocilizumab</i>, <i>heparin</i>), as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs (<i>hydroxychloroquine</i>, <i>chloroquine</i>, <i>lopinavir</i>, <i>ritonavir</i>, <i>remdesivir</i>), actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-IFNγ, anti-TNFα, anti-IL12, anti-IL1β, anti-IL6), and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were <i>in-silico</i> validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human coronavirus infections.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6wRrQ2CXSbQ" width="1" />

<p>by Lichy Han, Zahra N. Sayyid, Russ B. Altman</p>

For many prevalent complex diseases, treatment regimens are frequently ineffective. For example, despite multiple available immunomodulators and immunosuppressants, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains difficult to treat. Heterogeneity in the disease across patients makes it challenging to select the optimal treatment regimens, and some patients do not respond to any of the existing treatment choices. Drug repurposing strategies for IBD have had limited clinical success and have not typically offered individualized patient-level treatment recommendations. In this work, we present NetPTP, a Network-based Personalized Treatment Prediction framework which models measured drug effects from gene expression data and applies them to patient samples to generate personalized ranked treatment lists. To accomplish this, we combine publicly available network, drug target, and drug effect data to generate treatment rankings using patient data. These ranked lists can then be used to prioritize existing treatments and discover new therapies for individual patients. We demonstrate how NetPTP captures and models drug effects, and we apply our framework to individual IBD samples to provide novel insights into IBD treatment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pfrgx4o-cyw" width="1" />

<p>by Barbara Feulner, Claudia Clopath</p>

Neural activity is often low dimensional and dominated by only a few prominent neural covariation patterns. It has been hypothesised that these covariation patterns could form the building blocks used for fast and flexible motor control. Supporting this idea, recent experiments have shown that monkeys can learn to adapt their neural activity in motor cortex on a timescale of minutes, given that the change lies within the original low-dimensional subspace, also called neural manifold. However, the neural mechanism underlying this within-manifold adaptation remains unknown. Here, we show in a computational model that modification of recurrent weights, driven by a learned feedback signal, can account for the observed behavioural difference between within- and outside-manifold learning. Our findings give a new perspective, showing that recurrent weight changes do not necessarily lead to change in the neural manifold. On the contrary, successful learning is naturally constrained to a common subspace.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pmmyetNIyeQ" width="1" />

In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.






Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.

Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across 5 sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of evoked potentials (EPs) as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>Impairment of spatial memory, including an inability to recall previous locations and navigate the world, is often one of the first signs of functional disability on the road to cognitive impairment. While there are many screening and diagnostic tools which attempt to measure spatial memory ability, they are often not representative of real-life situations and can therefore lack applicability. One potential solution to this problem involves the use of virtual reality (VR), which immerses individuals in a virtually-simulated environment, allowing for scenarios more representative of real-life without any of the associated risks. Here, we review the evidence surrounding the use of VR for the screening and diagnosis of spatial memory impairments, including potential limitations and how it compares to standard neuropsychological tests. We will also discuss the evidence regarding the potential use of VR in the rehabilitation of spatial memory deficits, which has not been well studied, but which could be game-changing if proven successful.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24801?af=R">A systematic review of noninflammatory cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for clinical outcome in neonates with perinatal hypoxic brain injury that could be biologically significant</a></h4>

Abstract
Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that purportedly arises from hypoxia‐ischemia is labeled hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical syndrome involving acidosis, a low Apgar score and the need for resuscitation in the delivery room; asphyxia alerts one to the possibility of NE. In the present systematic review, we focused on the noninflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are involved in the development of possible brain injury in asphyxia or HIE. A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for case–control studies was conducted and 17 studies were found suitable by a priori criteria. Statistical analysis used the Mantel–Haenszel model for dichotomous data. The pooled mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. We identified the best biomarkers, based on the estimation approach in evaluating the biological significance, out of hundreds in three categories: cell adhesion and proliferation, oxidants and antioxidants, and cell damage. The following subtotal‐population comparisons were made: perinatal asphyxia versus no asphyxia, asphyxia with HIE versus asphyxia without HIE, asphyxia with HIE versus no asphyxia, and term versus preterm HIE newborn with asphyxia. Biological significance of the biomarkers was determined by using a modification of the estimation approach, by ranking the biomarkers according to the difference in the bounds of the CIs. The most promising CSF biomarkers for prognostication especially for the severest HIE include creatine kinase, xanthine oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron‐specific enolase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Future studies are recommended using such a combined test to prognosticate the most severely affected patients.

<p>Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation
aiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The
field has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which
exhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted
pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural
models include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their
outputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and
is the problem addressed in the paper.
</p>
<p>Previous work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment
score for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained
approach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word
level. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to
leverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training
instance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring
procedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive
evaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio
benchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of
the proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control
hallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further
experiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be
successfully used on very noisy settings.

<p>Morphological regeneration is an important feature that highlights the
environmental adaptive capacity of biological systems. Lack of this
regenerative capacity significantly limits the resilience of machines and the
environments they can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an
approach for simulated soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when
being damaged. Although numerical simulations using soft robots have played an
important role in their design, evolving soft robots with regenerative
capabilities have so far received comparable little attention. Here we propose
a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural cellular automata.
Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information to regrow
damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable
soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are
damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell
interactions alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results
take a step towards equipping artificial systems with regenerative capacities
and could potentially allow for more robust operations in a variety of
situations and environments. The code for the experiments in this paper is

<p>In this work we consider multitasking in the context of solving multiple
optimization problems simultaneously by conducting a single search process. The
principal goal when dealing with this scenario is to dynamically exploit the
existing complementarities among the problems (tasks) being optimized, helping
each other through the exchange of valuable knowledge. Additionally, the
emerging paradigm of Evolutionary Multitasking tackles multitask optimization
scenarios by using as inspiration concepts drawn from Evolutionary Computation.
The main purpose of this survey is to collect, organize and critically examine
the abundant literature published so far in Evolutionary Multitasking, with an
emphasis on the methodological patterns followed when designing new algorithmic
proposals in this area (namely, multifactorial optimization and
multipopulation-based multitasking). We complement our critical analysis with
an identification of challenges that remain open to date, along with promising
research directions that can stimulate future efforts in this topic. Our
discussions held throughout this manuscript are offered to the audience as a
reference of the general trajectory followed by the community working in this
field in recent times, as well as a self-contained entry point for newcomers
and researchers interested to join this exciting research avenue.

<p>This paper considers the following question: how well can depth-two ReLU
networks with randomly initialized bottom-level weights represent smooth
functions? We give near-matching upper- and lower-bounds for
$L_2$-approximation in terms of the Lipschitz constant, the desired accuracy,
and the dimension of the problem, as well as similar results in terms of
Sobolev norms. Our positive results employ tools from harmonic analysis and
ridgelet representation theory, while our lower-bounds are based on (robust
versions of) dimensionality arguments.

<p>In this paper we examine the concept of complexity as it applies to
generative art and design. Complexity has many different, discipline specific
definitions, such as complexity in physical systems (entropy), algorithmic
measures of information complexity and the field of "complex systems". We apply
a series of different complexity measures to three different generative art
datasets and look at the correlations between complexity and individual
aesthetic judgement by the artist (in the case of two datasets) or the
physically measured complexity of 3D forms. Our results show that the degree of
correlation is different for each set and measure, indicating that there is no
overall "better" measure. However, specific measures do perform well on
individual datasets, indicating that careful choice can increase the value of
using such measures. We conclude by discussing the value of direct measures in
generative and evolutionary art, reinforcing recent findings from neuroimaging
and psychology which suggest human aesthetic judgement is informed by many
extrinsic factors beyond the measurable properties of the object being judged.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">There are no effective treatments in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of theta burst repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on postural instability in PSP. Twenty PSP patients underwent a session of sham or real cerebellar rTMS in a crossover design. Before and after stimulation, static balance was evaluated with instrumented (lower back accelerometer, Rehagait®, Hasomed, Germany) 30-s trials in semitandem and tandem positions. In tandem and semitandem tasks, active stimulation was associated with increase in time without falls (both <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em>=0.04). In the same tasks, device-extracted parameters revealed significant improvement in area (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em>=0.007), velocity (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em>=0.005), acceleration and jerkiness of sway (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em>=0.008) in real versus sham stimulation. Cerebellar rTMS showed a significant effect on stability in PSP patients, when assessed with mobile digital technology, in a double-blind design. These results should motivate larger and longer trials using non-invasive brain stimulation for PSP patients.</p>

<p>Alterations in the processes that control α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression, assembly and trafficking are closely linked to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We have recently shown that the serine/threonine kinase Protein kinase N1 (PKN1) is a developmentally active regulator of cerebellar synaptic maturation by inhibiting AKT and the neurogenic transcription factor neurogenic differentiation factor-2 (NeuroD2). NeuroD2 is involved in glutamatergic synaptic maturation by regulating expression levels of various synaptic proteins. Here we aimed to study the effect of Pkn1 knockout on AKT phosphorylation and NeuroD2 levels in the hippocampus and the subsequent expression levels of the NeuroD2 targets and AMPAR subunits: glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) and GluA2/3. We show that PKN1 is expressed throughout the hippocampus. Interestingly, not only postnatal but also adult hippocampal phospho-AKT and NeuroD2 levels were significantly elevated upon Pkn1 knockout. Postnatal and adult Pkn1<sup>–/–</sup> hippocampi showed enhanced expression of the AMPAR subunit GluA1, particularly in area CA1. Surprisingly, GluA2/3 levels were not different between both genotypes. In addition to higher protein levels, we also found an enhanced GluA1 content in the membrane fraction of postnatal and adult Pkn1<sup>–/–</sup> animals, while GluA2/3 levels remained unchanged. This points toward a very specific regulation of GluA1 expression and/or trafficking by the novel PKN1-AKT-NeuroD2 axis. Considering the important role of GluA1 in hippocampal development as well as the pathophysiology of several disorders, ranging from Alzheimer’s, to depression and schizophrenia, our results validate PKN1 for future studies into neurological disorders related to altered AMPAR subunit expression in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>In humans, copy number variations in CYFIP1 appear to have sweeping physiological and structural consequences in the brain, either producing or altering the severity of intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. Independently, SynGAP1 haploinsufficiency produces intellectual disability and, frequently, autism. Cyfip1 inhibits protein translation and promotes actin polymerization, and SynGAP1 is a synaptically localized Ras/Rap GAP. While these proteins are clearly distinct, studies investigating their functions in mice have shown that each regulates the maturation of synapses in the hippocampus and haploinsufficiency for either produces an exaggerated form of mGluR-dependent long-term depression, suggesting that some signaling pathways converge. In this study, we examined how Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency impacts SynGAP1 levels and localization, as well as potential sites for mechanistic interaction in mouse hippocampus. The data show that synaptic, but not total, levels of SynGAP1 in Cyfip1<sup>+/–</sup> mice were abnormally low during early postnatal development and in adults. This may be in response to a shift in the balance of kinases that activate SynGAP1 as levels of Cdk5 were reduced and those of activated CaMKII were maintained in Cyfip1<sup>+/–</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. Alternatively, this could reflect altered actin dynamics as Rac1 activity in Cyfip1<sup>+/–</sup> hippocampus was boosted significantly compared to wild-type mice, and levels of synaptic F-actin were generally enhanced due in part to an increase in the activity of the WAVE regulatory complex. Decreased synaptic SynGAP1 coupled with a CaMKII-mediated bias toward Rap1 inactivation at synapses is also consistent with increased levels of synaptic GluA2, increased AMPA receptor-mediated responses to stimulation, and increased levels of synaptic mGluR1/5 compared to wild-type mice. Collectively, our data suggest that Cyfip1 regulates SynGAP1 and the two proteins work coordinately at synapses to appropriately direct actin polymerization and GAP activity.</p>

<p>The α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a fundamental role in inner ear physiology. It mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear fibers that descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the auditory sensory epithelium. The α9 and α10 subunits have undergone a distinct evolutionary history within the family of nAChRs. Predominantly in mammalian vertebrates, the α9α10 receptor has accumulated changes at the protein level that may ultimately relate to the evolutionary history of the mammalian hearing organ. In the present work, we investigated the responses of α9α10 nAChRs to choline, the metabolite of acetylcholine degradation at the synaptic cleft. Whereas choline is a full agonist of chicken α9α10 receptors it is a partial agonist of the rat receptor. Making use of the expression of α9α10 heterologous receptors, encompassing wild-type, heteromeric, homomeric, mutant, chimeric, and hybrid receptors, and in silico molecular docking, we establish that the mammalian (rat) α10 nAChR subunit underscores the reduced efficacy of choline. Moreover, we show that whereas the complementary face of the α10 subunit does not play an important role in the activation of the receptor by ACh, it is strictly required for choline responses. Thus, we propose that the evolutionary changes acquired in the mammalian α9α10 nAChR resulted in the loss of choline acting as a full agonist at the efferent synapse, without affecting the triggering of ACh responses. This may have accompanied the fine-tuning of hair cell post-synaptic responses to the high-frequency activity of efferent medial olivocochlear fibers that modulate the cochlear amplifier.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest the brain functional connectivity impairment is the early event occurred in case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We model the brain as a graph based network to study these impairment. In this paper, we present a new diagnosis approach using graph theory based features from functional magnetic resonance (fMR) images to discriminate AD, MCI, and healthy control (HC) subjects using different classification techniques. These techniques include linear support vector machine (LSVM), and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). We used pairwise Pearson’s correlation-based functional connectivity to construct the brain network. We compare the classification performance of brain network using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) datasets. Node2vec graph embedding approach is employed to convert graph features to feature vectors. Experimental results show that the SVM with LASSO feature selection method generates better classification accuracy compared to other classification technique.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking and other addictive behaviors are among the main preventable risk factors for several severe and potentially fatal diseases. It has been argued that addictive behavior is controlled by an automatic-implicit cognitive system and by a reflective-explicit cognitive system, that operate in parallel to jointly drive human behavior. The present study addresses the formation of implicit attitudes towards smoking in both smokers and non-smokers, using a Go/NoGo association task (GNAT), and behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. The GNAT assesses, via quantifying participants’ reaction times, the strength of association between a target category and either pole of an evaluative dimension (positive or negative). EEG analysis is performed to determine the temporal course of the event-related potential (ERP) components underlying Go/NoGo decisions and implicit attitude formation. Both smokers and non-smokers showed prolonged reaction times to smoking-related pictures when the pictures were coupled with positive evaluative words (“incongruent condition”). This indicates negative implicit attitudes towards smoking in both groups alike at the time point of the behavioral response (600–700 ms post-stimulus). However, only the non-smokers, not the smokers, were found to show a delay of the N200 component in the incongruent condition. This is interpreted as reflecting ambivalent or even positive implicit attitudes towards smoking in the smoker group at the time point of the N200 (300–400 ms post-stimulus). Our study thus provides evidence for the hypothesis that implicit attitudes are subject to changes within several hundred milliseconds after stimulus presentation, and can be altered in the course of their formation.</p>

<p>Background: Recently, attention has grown toward cerebellar neuromodulation in motor learning using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). An important point of discussion regarding this modulation is the optimal timing of tDCS, as this parameter could significantly influence the outcome. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the timing of cerebellar anodal tDCS (ca-tDCS) on motor learning using a sequential finger-tapping task (FTT).</p><p>Methods: One hundred and twenty two healthy young, right-handed subjects (96 females) were randomized into four groups (During<sub>sham</sub>, Before, During<sub>real</sub>, After). They performed 2 days of FTT with their non-dominant hand on a custom keyboard. The task consisted of 40 s of typing followed by 20 s rest. Each participant received ca-tDCS (2 mA, sponge electrodes of 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, 20 min) at the appropriate timing and performed 20 trials on the first day (T1, 20 min). On the following day, only 10 trials of FTT were performed without tDCS (T2, 10 min). Motor skill performance and retention were assessed.</p><p>Results: All participants showed a time-dependent increase in learning. Motor performance was not different between groups at the end of T1 (p = 0.59). ca-tDCS did not facilitate the retention of the motor skill in the FTT at T2 (p = 0.27). Thus, our findings indicate an absence of the effect of ca-tDCS on motor performance or retention of the FTT independently from the timing of stimulation.</p><p>Conclusion: The present results suggest that the outcome of ca-tDCS is highly dependent on the task and stimulation parameters. Future studies need to establish a clear basis for the successful and reproducible clinical application of ca-tDCS.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622224">Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning in fNIRS Data</a></h4>

<p>Increasing student involvement in classes has always been a challenge for teachers and school managers. In online learning, some interactivity mechanisms like quizzes are increasingly used to engage students during classes and tasks. However, there is a high demand for tools that evaluate the efficiency of these mechanisms. In order to distinguish between high and low levels of engagement in tasks, it is possible to monitor brain activity through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The main advantages of this technique are portability, low cost, and a comfortable way for students to concentrate and perform their tasks. This setup provides more natural conditions for the experiments if compared to the other acquisition tools. In this study, we investigated levels of task involvement through the identification of correct and wrong answers of typical quizzes used in virtual environments. We collected data from the prefrontal cortex region (PFC) of 18 students while watching a video lecture. This data was modeled with supervised learning algorithms. We used random forests and penalized logistic regression to classify correct answers as a function of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. These models identify which regions best predict student performance. The random forest and penalized logistic regression (GLMNET with LASSO) obtained, respectively, 0.67 and 0.65 area of the ROC curve. Both models indicate that channels F4-F6 and AF3-AFz are the most relevant for the prediction. The statistical significance of these models was confirmed through cross-validation (leave-one-subject-out) and a permutation test. This methodology can be useful to better understand the teaching and learning processes in a video lecture and also provide improvements in the methodologies used in order to better adapt the presentation content.</p>

<p>A decrease in cortical excitability tends to be easily followed by an increase induced by external stimuli via a mechanism aimed at restoring it; this phenomenon is called “homeostatic plasticity.” In recent years, although intervention methods aimed at promoting motor learning using this phenomenon have been studied, an optimal intervention method has not been established. In the present study, we examined whether subsequent motor learning can be promoted further by a repetitive passive movement, which reduces the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) before motor learning tasks. We also examined the relationship between motor learning and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Forty healthy subjects (Val/Val genotype, 17 subjects; Met carrier genotype, 23 subjects) participated. Subjects were divided into two groups of 20 individuals each. The first group was assigned to perform the motor learning task after an intervention consisting in the passive adduction–abduction movement of the right index finger at 5 Hz for 10 min (RPM condition), while the second group was assigned to perform the task without the passive movement (control condition). The motor learning task consisted in the visual tracking of the right index finger. The results showed that the corticospinal excitability was transiently reduced after the passive movement in the RPM condition, whereas it was increased to the level detected in the control condition after the motor learning task. Furthermore, the motor learning ability was decreased immediately after the passive movement; however, the motor performance finally improved to the level observed in the control condition. In individuals carrying the Val/Val genotype, higher motor learning was also found to be related to the more remarkable changes in corticospinal excitability caused by the RPM condition. This study revealed that the implementation of a passive movement before a motor learning tasks did not affect M1 excitatory changes and motor learning efficiency; in contrast, in subjects carrying the Val/Val polymorphism, the more significant excitatory changes in the M1 induced by the passive movement and motor learning task led to the improvement of motor learning efficiency. Our results also suggest that homeostatic plasticity occurring in the M1 is involved in this improvement.</p>

<p>The Fist-Edge-Palm (FEP) task, a manual hand task, has been used to detect frontal dysfunctions in clinical situations: its performance failures are observed in various prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related disorders, including schizophrenia. However, previous imaging studies reported that the performance of the FEP task activated motor-related areas, but not the PFC. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationships between the performance of the FEP task and PFC functions. Hemodynamic activity in the PFC, including the dorsolateral PFC (area 46) and frontal pole (area 10), was recorded. Healthy young subjects performed the FEP task as well as a palm tapping (PT) task (control task) three times. The subjects also completed a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA) questionnaire. We found that hemodynamic activity (Oxy-Hb) in the PFC increased in the first trial of the FEP task but decreased considerably in the second and third trials compared to the PT task. The number of performance errors in the FEP task also decreased in the second and third trials. Error reduction (i.e., learning) in the FEP task between the first and second trials was negatively correlated with schizotypal trait and the number of perseveration errors in the WCST. Furthermore, changes in the PFC hemodynamic activity between the first and second trials were positively correlated with error reduction in the FEP task between the first and second trials, and negatively correlated with the number of perseveration errors in the WCST. These results suggest that learning in the FEP task requires PFC activation, which is negatively associated with perseveration errors in the WCST. The results further suggest that the FEP task, in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy, may be useful as a diagnostic method for various disorders with PFC dysfunction.</p>

<p>Motor proficiency reflects the ability to perform precise and coordinated movements in different contexts. Previous research suggests that different profiles of motor proficiency may be associated with different cognitive functioning characteristics thus suggesting an interaction between cognitive and motor processes. The current study investigated this interaction in the general population of healthy adults with different profiles of motor proficiency by focusing on error-related cognitive control and behavioral adaptation mechanisms. In addition, the impact of these processes was assessed in terms of trait anxiety and worries. Forty healthy adults were divided into high and low motor proficiency groups based on an assessment of their motor skills. Using electroencephalography during a flanker task, error-related negativity (ERN) was measured as the neural indicator of cognitive control. Post-error slowing (PES) was measured to represent behavioral adaptation. Participants also completed an anxiety assessment questionnaire. Participants in the high motor proficiency group achieved better task accuracy and showed relatively enhanced cognitive control through increased ERN. Contrastingly, individuals in the lower motor proficiency group achieved poorer accuracy whilst showing some evidence of compensation through increased PES. Trait anxiety reflecting general worries was found to be correlated with motor functioning, but the study could not provide evidence that this was related to cognitive or behavioral control mechanisms. The interaction between cognitive and motor processes observed in this study is unique for healthy and sub-clinical populations and provides a baseline for the interpretation of similar investigations in individuals with motor disorders.</p>

<p>Event-related potential components are sensitive to the processes underlying how questions are understood. We use so-called “covert” wh-questions in Mandarin to probe how such components generalize across different kinds of constructions. This study shows that covert Mandarin wh-questions do not elicit anterior negativities associated with memory maintenance, even when such a dependency is unambiguously cued. N = 37 native speakers of Mandarin Chinese read Chinese questions and declarative sentences word-by-word during EEG recording. In contrast to prior studies, no sustained anterior negativity (SAN) was observed between the cue word, such as the question-embedding verb “wonder,” and the in-situ wh-filler. SANs have been linked with working memory maintenance, suggesting that grammatical features may not impose the same maintenance demands as the content words used in prior work.</p>

<p>Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain (CP), which causes more disability than any other medical condition in the United States at a cost of $560–$635 billion per year (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Opioid analgesics are frequently used to treat CP. However, long term use of opioids can cause brain changes such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia that, over time, increase pain sensation. Also, opioids fail to treat complex psychological factors that worsen pain-related disability, including beliefs about and emotional responses to pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be efficacious for CP. However, CBT generally does not focus on important factors needed for long-term functional improvement, including attainment of personal goals and the psychological flexibility to choose responses to pain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been recognized as an effective, non-pharmacologic treatment for a variety of CP conditions (Gutierrez et al., 2004). However, little is known about the neurologic mechanisms underlying ACT. We conducted an ACT intervention in women (n = 9) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected pre- and post-ACT, and changes in functional connectivity (FC) were measured using Network-Based Statistics (NBS). Behavioral outcomes were measured using validated assessments such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the NIH Toolbox Neuro-QoL<sup>TM</sup> (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders) scales. Results suggest that, following the 4-week ACT intervention, participants exhibited reductions in brain activation within and between key networks including self-reflection (default mode, DMN), emotion (salience, SN), and cognitive control (frontal parietal, FPN). These changes in connectivity strength were correlated with changes in behavioral outcomes including decreased depression and pain interference, and increased participation in social roles. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that improved function across the DMN, SN, and FPN may drive the positive outcomes associated with ACT. This study contributes to the emerging evidence supporting the use of neurophysiological indices to characterize treatment effects of alternative and complementary mind-body therapies.</p>

<p>Introduction: The potential therapeutic efficacy of real-time fMRI Neurofeedback has received increasing attention in a variety of psychological and neurological disorders and as a tool to probe cognition. Despite its growing popularity, the success rate varies significantly, and the underlying neural mechanisms are still a matter of debate. The question whether an individually tailored framework positively influences neurofeedback success remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Methods: To address this question, participants were trained to modulate the activity of a target brain region, the visual motion area hMT+/V5, based on the performance of three imagery tasks with increasing complexity: imagery of a static dot, imagery of a moving dot with two and with four opposite directions. Participants received auditory feedback in the form of vocalizations with either negative, neutral or positive valence. The modulation thresholds were defined for each participant according to the maximum BOLD signal change of their target region during the localizer run.</p><p>Results: We found that 4 out of 10 participants were able to modulate brain activity in this region-of-interest during neurofeedback training. This rate of success (40%) is consistent with the neurofeedback literature. Whole-brain analysis revealed the recruitment of specific cortical regions involved in cognitive control, reward monitoring, and feedback processing during neurofeedback training. Individually tailored feedback thresholds did not correlate with the success level. We found region-dependent neuromodulation profiles associated with task complexity and feedback valence.</p><p>Discussion: Findings support the strategic role of task complexity and feedback valence on the modulation of the network nodes involved in monitoring and feedback control, key variables in neurofeedback frameworks optimization. Considering the elaborate design, the small sample size here tested (N = 10) impairs external validity in comparison to our previous studies. Future work will address this limitation. Ultimately, our results contribute to the discussion of individually tailored solutions, and justify further investigation concerning volitional control over brain activity.</p>

<p>Liquid state machine (LSM) is a type of recurrent spiking network with a strong relationship to neurophysiology and has achieved great success in time series processing. However, the computational cost of simulations and complex dynamics with time dependency limit the size and functionality of LSMs. This paper presents a large-scale bioinspired LSM with modular topology. We integrate the findings on the visual cortex that specifically designed input synapses can fit the activation of the real cortex and perform the Hough transform, a feature extraction algorithm used in digital image processing, without additional cost. We experimentally verify that such a combination can significantly improve the network functionality. The network performance is evaluated using the MNIST dataset where the image data are encoded into spiking series by Poisson coding. We show that the proposed structure can not only significantly reduce the computational complexity but also achieve higher performance compared to the structure of previous reported networks of a similar size. We also show that the proposed structure has better robustness against system damage than the small-world and random structures. We believe that the proposed computationally efficient method can greatly contribute to future applications of reservoir computing.</p>

<p>Deposition of toxic protein inclusions is a common hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease etc. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is an important brain metabolite whose levels got altered under various neurodegenerative conditions. Indeed, NAA has been a widely accepted biological marker for various neurological disorders. We have also reported that NAA is a protein stabilizer. In the present communication, we investigated the role of NAA in modulating the aggregation propensity on two model proteins (carbonic anhydrase and catalase). We discovered that NAA suppresses protein aggregation and could solubilize preformed aggregates.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating adult brain cancer with high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance. Cellular heterogeneity and extensive invasion of surrounding brain tissues are characteristic features of GBM that contribute to its intractability. Current GBM model systems do not recapitulate some of the complex features of GBM and have not produced sufficiently-effective treatments. This has cast doubt on the effectiveness of current GBM models and drug discovery paradigms. In search of alternative pre-clinical GBM models, various 3D organoid-based GBM model systems have been developed using human cells. The scalability of these systems and potential to more accurately model characteristic features of GBM, provide promising new avenues for pre-clinical GBM research and drug discovery efforts. Here, we review the current suite of organoid-GBM models, their individual strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future applications with an emphasis on compound screening.</p>

<p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a calcium-permeable ion channel best known for its ability to be gated by the pungent constituent of red chili pepper, capsaicin, and related chemicals from the group of vanilloids as well as by noxious heat. As such, it is mostly expressed in sensory neurons to act as a detector of painful stimuli produced by pungent chemicals and high temperatures. Its activation is also sensitized by the numerous endogenous inflammatory mediators and second messengers, making it an important determinant of nociceptive signaling. Except for such signaling, though, neuronal TRPV1 activation may influence various organ functions by promoting the release of bioactive neuropeptides from sensory fiber innervation organs. However, TRPV1 is also found outside the sensory nervous system in which its activation and function is not that straightforward. Thus, TRPV1 expression is detected in skeletal muscle; in some types of smooth muscle; in epithelial and immune cells; and in adipocytes, where it can be activated by the combination of dietary vanilloids, endovanilloids, and pro-inflammatory factors while the intracellular calcium signaling that this initiates can regulate processes as diverse as muscle constriction, cell differentiation, and carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present review is to provide a clear-cut distinction between neurogenic TRPV1 effects in various tissues consequent to its activation in sensory nerve endings and non-neurogenic TRPV1 effects due to its expression in cell types other than sensory neurons.</p>

<p>Current methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia include structured questionnaires, structured interviews, and various cognitive tests. Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%. We propose a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discuss the merits and opportunities of our approach.</p>

<p>Sex-related differences are tied into neurodevelopmental and lifespan processes, beginning early in the perinatal and developmental phases and continue into adulthood. The present study was designed to investigate sexual dimorphism of changes in gray matter (GM) volume in post-adolescence, with a focus on early and middle-adulthood using a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of healthy controls from the European Network on Psychosis, Affective disorders and Cognitive Trajectory (ENPACT). Three hundred and seventy three subjects underwent a 3.0 T MRI session across four European Centers. Age by sex effects on GM volumes were investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas regions (ROI). Females and males showed overlapping and non-overlapping patterns of GM volume changes during aging. Overlapping age-related changes emerged in bilateral frontal and temporal cortices, insula and thalamus. Both VBM and ROI analyses revealed non-overlapping changes in multiple regions, including cerebellum and vermis, bilateral mid frontal, mid occipital cortices, left inferior temporal and precentral gyri. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for sex differences in cross-sectional analyses, not only in the study of normative changes, but particularly in the context of psychiatric and neurologic disorders, wherein sex effects may be confounded with disease-related changes.</p>

Mutations in <i>KCNQ2</i>, which encodes a pore-forming K<sup>+</sup> channel subunit responsible for neuronal M-current, cause neonatal epileptic encephalopathy, a complex disorder presenting with severe early-onset seizures and impaired neurodevelopment. The condition is exceptionally difficult to treat, partially because the effects of <i>KCNQ2</i> mutations on the development and function of human neurons are unknown. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and gene editing to establish a disease model and measured the functional properties of differentiated excitatory neurons. We find that patient iPSC-derived neurons exhibit faster action potential repolarization, larger post-burst afterhyperpolarization and a functional enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels. These properties, which can be recapitulated by chronic inhibition of M-current in control neurons, facilitate a burst-suppression firing pattern that is reminiscent of the interictal electroencephalography pattern in patients. Our findings suggest that dyshomeostatic mechanisms compound KCNQ2 loss-of-function leading to alterations in the neurodevelopmental trajectory of patient iPSC-derived neurons.

The large number of individuals placed into quarantine because of possible SARS CoV-2 exposure has high societal and economic costs. There is ongoing debate about the appropriate duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We use empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects onward transmission from traced contacts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and from returning travellers. We also consider the roles of testing followed by release if negative (test-and-release), reinforced hygiene, adherence, and symptoms in calculating quarantine efficacy. We show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as a 10 day quarantine, but with fewer person days spent in quarantine. The findings apply to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63341">Cycles, sources, and sinks: Conceptualizing how phosphate balance modulates carbon flux using yeast metabolic networks</a></h4>

Phosphates are ubiquitous molecules that enable critical intracellular biochemical reactions. Therefore, cells have elaborate responses to phosphate limitation. Our understanding of long-term transcriptional responses to phosphate limitation is extensive. Contrastingly, a systems-level perspective presenting unifying biochemical concepts to interpret how phosphate balance is critically coupled to (and controls) metabolic information flow is missing. To conceptualize such processes, utilizing yeast metabolic networks we categorize phosphates utilized in metabolism into cycles, sources and sinks. Through this, we identify metabolic reactions leading to putative phosphate sources or sinks. With this conceptualization, we illustrate how mass action driven flux towards sources and sinks enable cells to manage phosphate availability during transient/immediate phosphate limitations. We thereby identify how intracellular phosphate availability will predictably alter specific nodes in carbon metabolism, and determine signature cellular metabolic states. Finally, we identify a need to understand intracellular phosphate pools, in order to address mechanisms of phosphate regulation and restoration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63194">Evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements in bdelloid rotifers</a></h4>

Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genomic parasites whose ability to spread autonomously is facilitated by sexual reproduction in their hosts. If hosts become obligately asexual, TE frequencies and dynamics are predicted to change dramatically, but the long-term outcome is unclear. Here, we test current theory using whole-genome sequence data from eight species of bdelloid rotifers, a class of invertebrates in which males are thus far unknown. Contrary to expectations, we find a variety of active TEs in bdelloid genomes, at an overall frequency within the range seen in sexual species. We find no evidence that TEs are spread by cryptic recombination or restrained by unusual DNA repair mechanisms. Instead, we find that that TE content evolves relatively slowly in bdelloids and that gene families involved in RNAi-mediated TE suppression have undergone significant expansion, which might mitigate the deleterious effects of active TEs and compensate for the consequences of long-term asexuality.

X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy. The severe Mediterranean variant (G6PD Med) found across Europe and Asia is thought to confer protection against malaria, but its effect is unclear. We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to observed G6PD Med allele frequencies in 999 Pashtun patients presenting with acute <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria and 1408 population controls. G6PD Med was associated with reductions in symptomatic <i>P. vivax</i> malaria incidence of 76% (95% CI 58-88) in hemizygous males and homozygous females combined, and 55% (95% CI 38-68) in heterozygous females. Unless there is very large population stratification within the Pashtun (confounding these results), the G6PD Med genotype confers a very large and gene dose proportional protective effect against acute vivax malaria. The proportion of patients with vivax malaria at risk of haemolysis following 8-aminoquinoline radical cure is substantially overestimated by studies measuring G6PD deficiency prevalence in healthy subjects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60577">Single molecule microscopy reveals key physical features of repair foci in living cells</a></h4>

In response to double strand breaks (DSB), repair proteins accumulate at damaged sites, forming membrane-less sub-compartments or foci. Here we explored the physical nature of these foci, using single molecule microscopy in living cells. Rad52, the functional homolog of BRCA2 in yeast, accumulates at DSB sites and diffuses ~6 times faster within repair foci than the focus itself, exhibiting confined motion. The Rad52 confinement radius coincides with the focus size: foci resulting from 2 DSBs are twice larger in volume that the ones induced by a unique DSB and the Rad52 confinement radius scales accordingly. In contrast, molecules of the single strand binding protein Rfa1 follow anomalous diffusion similar to the focus itself or damaged chromatin. We conclude that while most Rfa1 molecules are bound to the ssDNA, Rad52 molecules are free to explore the entire focus reflecting the existence of a liquid droplet around damaged DNA.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60263">Membrane-partitioned cell wall synthesis in mycobacteria</a></h4>

Many antibiotics target the assembly of cell wall peptidoglycan, an essential, heteropolymeric mesh that encases most bacteria. In rod-shaped bacteria, cell wall elongation is spatially precise yet relies on limited pools of lipid-linked precursors that generate and are attracted to membrane disorder. By tracking enzymes, substrates, and products of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>, we show that precursors are made in plasma membrane domains that are laterally and biochemically distinct from sites of cell wall assembly. Membrane partitioning likely contributes to robust, orderly peptidoglycan synthesis, suggesting that these domains help template peptidoglycan synthesis. The cell wall-organizing protein DivIVA and the cell wall itself promote domain homeostasis. These data support a model in which the peptidoglycan polymer feeds back on its membrane template to maintain an environment conducive to directional synthesis. Our findings are applicable to rod-shaped bacteria that are phylogenetically distant from <i>M. smegmatis</i>, indicating that horizontal compartmentalization of precursors may be a general feature of bacillary cell wall biogenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59067">Pancreatic progenitor epigenome maps prioritize type 2 diabetes risk genes with roles in development</a></h4>

Genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk affect gene regulation in metabolically relevant tissues, such as pancreatic islets. Here, we investigated contributions of regulatory programs active during pancreatic development to T2D risk. Generation of chromatin maps from developmental precursors throughout pancreatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) identifies enrichment of T2D variants in pancreatic progenitor-specific stretch enhancers that are not active in islets. Genes associated with progenitor-specific stretch enhancers are predicted to regulate developmental processes, most notably tissue morphogenesis. Through gene editing in hESCs, we demonstrate that progenitor-specific enhancers harboring T2D-associated variants regulate cell polarity genes <i>LAMA1</i> and <i>CRB2</i>. Knockdown of <i>lama1</i> or <i>crb2</i> in zebrafish embryos causes a defect in pancreas morphogenesis and impairs islet cell development. Together, our findings reveal that a subset of T2D risk variants specifically affects pancreatic developmental programs, suggesting that dysregulation of developmental processes can predispose to T2D.

Understanding the different neural networks that support human language is an ongoing challenge for cognitive neuroscience. Which divisions are capable of distinguishing the functional significance of regions across the language network? A key separation between semantic cognition and phonological processing was highlighted in early meta-analyses, yet these seminal works did not formally test this proposition. Moreover, organisation by domain is not the only possibility. Regions may be organised by the type of process performed, as in the separation between representation and control processes proposed within the Controlled Semantic Cognition framework. The importance of these factors was assessed in a series of activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses that investigated which regions of the language network are consistently recruited for semantic and phonological domains, and for representation and control processes. Whilst semantic and phonological processing consistently recruit many overlapping regions, they can be dissociated (by differential involvement of bilateral anterior temporal lobes and superior temporal gyri) only when using both formal analysis methods and sufficient data. Both semantic and phonological regions are further dissociable into control and representation regions, highlighting this as an additional, distinct dimension on which the language network is functionally organised. Furthermore, some of these control regions overlap with multiple-demand network regions critical for control beyond the language domain, suggesting the relative level of domain-specificity is also informative. Multiple, distinct dimensions are critical to understand the role of language regions. Here we present a proposal as to the core principles underpinning the functional organisation of the language network.

Language is a defining human behavior and is dependent on networks interactions amongst broadly distributed neuronal substrates. Transient dynamics between language regions that underpin speech production have long been postulated, yet have proven challenging to evaluate empirically. We used direct intracranial recordings during single word production to create a finely resolved spatiotemporal atlas (134 patients, 25810 electrodes, 40278 words) of the entire language-dominant cortex and used this to derive single-trial state-space sequences of network motifs. We derived 5 discrete neural states during the production of each word, distinguished by unique patterns of distributed cortical interaction. This interactive model was significantly better than a model of the same design but lacking interactions between regions in explaining observed activity. Our results eschew strict functional attribution to localized cortical populations, supporting instead the idea that cognitive processes are better explained by distributed metastable network states.

A fundamental aspect of human experience is that it is segmented into discrete events. This may be underpinned by transitions between distinct neural states. Using an innovative data-driven state segmentation method, we investigate how neural states are organized across the cortical hierarchy and where in cortex neural state and perceived event boundaries overlap. Our results show that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions and long states in anterior temporal pole and lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Neural state boundaries overlap with event boundaries across large parts of this hierarchy. State boundaries are shared within and between groups of brain regions that resemble well known functional networks, such as the default mode network that fractionates into two subnetworks; one fast, one slow. Together these findings suggest that a nested cortical hierarchy of neural states forms the basis of event segmentation.

Objectives: Tbx1 mutant mice are a widely used model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) because they manifest a broad spectrum of physical and behavioral abnormalities that is similar to that found in 22q11.2DS patients. In Tbx1 mutants, brain abnormalities include changes in cortical cytoarchitecture, hypothesized to be caused by the precocious differentiation of cortical progenitors. The objectives of this research are to identify drugs that have efficacy against the brain phenotype, and through a phenotypic rescue approach, gain insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying Tbx1 haploinsufficiency. Experimental approach: Disease model: Tbx1 heterozygous and homozygous embryos. We tested the ability of two FDA-approved drugs, the LSD1 inhibitor Tranylcypromine and Vitamin B12, to rescue the Tbx1 mutant cortical phenotype. Both drugs have proven efficacy against the cardiovascular phenotype, albeit at a much reduced level compared to the rescue achieved in the brain. Methods: in situ hybridization and immunostaining of histological brain sections using a subset of molecular markers that label specific cortical regions or cell types. Appropriate quantification and statistical analysis of gene and protein expression were applied to identify cortical abnormalities and to determine the level of phenotypic rescue achieved. Results: Cortical abnormalities observed in Tbx1 mutant embryos were fully rescued by both drugs. Intriguingly, rescue was obtained with both drugs in Tbx1 homozygous mutants, indicating that they function through mechanisms that do not depend upon Tbx1 function. This was particularly surprising for Vitamin B12, which was identified through its ability to increase Tbx1 gene expression. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is only the second example of drugs to be identified that ameliorate phenotypes caused by the mutation of a single gene from the 22q11.2 homologous region of the mouse genome. This one drug-one gene approach might be important because there is evidence that the brain phenotype in 22q11.2DS patients is multigenic in origin, unlike the physical phenotypes, which are overwhelmingly attributable to Tbx1 haploinsufficiency. Therefore, effective treatments will likely involve the use of multiple drugs that are targeted to the function of specific genes within the deleted region.

Decision-making and representations of arousal are intimately linked. Behavioral investigations have classically shown that either too little or too much bodily arousal is detrimental to decision-making, indicating that there is an inverted U relationship between bodily arousal and performance. How these processes interact at the level of single neurons as well as the neural circuits involved are unclear. Here we recorded neural activity from orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of macaque monkeys while they made reward-guided decisions. Heart rate (HR) was also recorded as a proxy for bodily arousal. Recordings were made both before and after subjects received excitotoxic lesions of the bilateral amygdala. In intact monkeys, higher HR facilitated reaction times (RTs). Concurrently, a set of neurons in OFC and dACC selectively encoded trial-by-trial variations in HR independent of reward value. After amygdala lesions, HR increased and the relationship between HR and RTs was reversed. Concurrent with this change, there was an increase in the proportion of dACC neurons encoding HR. Applying a novel population-coding analysis, we show that bilateral amygdala lesions skew the balance of encoding in dACC away from signaling either reward value or choice direction towards HR coding around the time that choices are made. Taken together, the present results provide insight into how bodily arousal and decision-making are signaled in frontal cortex. Our findings may shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying some psychiatric disorders linked to amygdala dysfunction that are characterized by heightened arousal and deficits in decision-making.

The timing and quality of sleep-wake cycles are regulated by interacting circadian and homeostatic mechanisms. Although the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian clock, local clocks are active across the brain and the respective sleep-regulatory roles of SCN and extra-SCN clocks are unclear. To determine the specific contribution(s) of the SCN, we used virally mediated genetic complementation, expressing Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) to restore circadian molecular competence to the SCN of globally clockless Cry1/Cry2-null mice. Under free-running conditions, the rest/activity behaviour of Cry1/Cry2-null controls which received EGFP (SCNCon) was arrhythmic, whereas Cry1-complemented mice (SCNCry1) had circadian behaviour comparable to that of Cry1,2-competent wild-types (WT). In SCNCon mice, sleep-wakefulness, assessed by electroencephalography/electromyography, also lacked circadian organisation. In SCNCry1 mice, however, it was comparable to WT, with consolidated vigilance states (wake, REM and NREM sleep) and rhythms in NREMS delta power and expression of REMS within total sleep. Wakefulness in SCNCon mice was more fragmented than in WT, with more wake-NREMS-wake transitions. This disruption was corrected in SCNCry1 mice. Following sleep deprivation, all mice showed an initial homeostatic increase in NREMS delta power. The SCNCon mice, however, had reduced, non-consolidated NREMS during the inactive phase of the recovery period. In contrast, the dynamics of homeostatic responses in the SCNCry1 mice were equivalent to WT. Finally, SCNCon mice exhibited poor sleep-dependent memory but this was corrected in SCNCry1mice. Therefore, the SCN clock is sufficient for circadian control of sleep-wake, facilitating initiation and maintenance of wake, promoting sleep consolidation, homeostatic dynamics, and sleep-dependent memory.

Although it has been reported that mesenchymal stem cells isolated from adult tissues can be induced to overcome their mesenchymal fate and transdifferentiate into neural cells, the findings and their interpretation have been challenged. The main argument against this process is that the cells rapidly adopt neuron-like morphologies through retraction of the cytoplasm rather than active neurite extension. In this study, we examined the sequence of biological events during neural differentiation of human periodontal ligament-derived stem cells (hPDLSCs), human bone marrow-derived stem cells (hBMSCs) and human dental pulp-derived stem cells (hDPSCs) by time-lapse microscopy. We have demonstrated that hPDLSCs, hBMSCs and hDPSCs can directly differentiate into neuron-like cells without passing through a mitotic stage and that they shrink dramatically and change their morphology to that of neuron-like cells through active neurite extension. Furthermore, we observed micronuclei movement and transient cell nuclei lobulation concurrent to in vitro neurogenesis from hBMSCs and hDPSCs. Our results demonstrate that the differentiation of hPDLSCs, hBMSCs and hDPSCs towards a neural lineage occurs through a de-differentiation step followed by re-differentiation to neural phenotypes, and therefore we definitively confirm that the rapid acquisition of the neural phenotype is via a differentiation trait.

Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are fatal and incurable neurodegenerative diseases linked to the pathological aggregation of the TDP-43 protein. This is an essential DNA/RNA binding protein involved in transcription regulation, pre-RNA processing and RNA transport. Having suitable animal models to study the mechanisms of TDP-43 aggregation is crucial to develop treatments against disease. We have previously demonstrated that the killifish Nothobranchius furzeri offers the unique advantage as a model system that it is an organism with compressed lifespan and a conserved ageing phenotype that develops within months, making this organism the available shortest-lived vertebrate with a clear ageing phenotype. Here, we show that the two paralogs of TDP-43 from the killifish N. furzeri share high sequence homology with the human protein and recapitulate its cellular and biophysical behaviour. We prove that, during ageing, N. furzeri TDP-43 spontaneously forms insoluble intracellular TDP-43 aggregates that have amyloid characteristics and colocalize with the stress granule core protein G3BP. Our results propose this organism as a valuable model of TDP-43-related pathologies and show that even minute differences between the human and N. furzeri proteins may help to shed new light onto the role of TDP-43 in RNA recognition and granule formation.

Purpose: The objective of this study is to introduce a new quantitative data-driven analysis (QDA) framework for the analysis of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) and use it to investigate the effect of adult age on resting-state functional connectivity (RFC). Methods: Whole-brain R-fMRI measurements were conducted on a 3T clinical MRI scanner in 227 healthy adult volunteers (N=227, aged 18-74 years old, male/female=99/128). With the proposed QDA framework we derived two types of voxel-wise RFC metrics: the connectivity strength index (CSI) and connectivity density index (CDI) utilizing the convolutions of the cross-correlation (CC) histogram with different kernels. Furthermore, we assessed the negative and positive portions of these metrics separately. Results: With the QDA framework we found age-related declines of RFC metrics in the superior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right insula and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the default mode network (DMN), which resembles previously reported results using other types of RFC data processing methods. Our new findings complement previously undocumented results in the following aspects: 1) the PCC and right insula are anti-correlated and tend to manifest simultaneously declines of both the negative and positive connectivity strength with age; 2) separate assessment of the negative and positive RFC metrics provides enhanced sensitivity to the aging effect; 3) the sensorimotor network depicts enhanced negative connectivity strength with the adult age. Conclusion: The proposed QDA framework can produce threshold-free, voxel-wise analysis of R-fMRI data the RFC metrics. The detected adult age effect is largely consistent with previously reported studies using different analysis approaches for R-fMRI data. Moreover, the separate assessment of the negative and positive contributions to the RFC metrics can enhance the RFC sensitivity and clarify some of the mixed results in the literature regarding to the DMN and sensorimotor network involvement in aging.

Sleep is essential for long term memory function. However the neuroanatomical consequences of sleep loss are disputed. Sleep deprivation has been reported to cause both decreases and increases of dendritic spine density. Here we use Thy1-GFP expressing transgenic mice to investigate the effects of acute sleep deprivation on the dendritic architecture of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We found that five hours of sleep deprivation had no effect on either dendritic length or dendritic spine density. Our work suggests that no major neuroanatomical changes result from one episode of sleep deprivation.

A key challenge in systems neuroscience remains to understand where, when and how mass brain signals that reflect network activity dynamically represent, transmit and transform sensory information for task behavior. Here, we used the classic XOR, OR and AND that imply a different computation on the same inputs for correct task behavior. We disentangled MEG source activity into three distinct information processes that linearly represents each input before nonlinearly integrating them for task behavior.

The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry ([≥]2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons ({beta}III tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard-palate innervation included Meissner's corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell-neurite complexes, and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contain end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelium. Fungiform papillae had Meissner's corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed afferent endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.

Exosomes, a component of extracellular vesicles are shown to carry important small RNAs, mRNAs, protein, and bioactive lipid from parent cells and are found in most biological fluids. Investigators have demonstrated the importance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived exosomes in repairing stroke lesions. However, exosomes from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have not been tested in any stroke model nor has there been an evaluation of whether these exosomes target/home to areas of pathology. Targeted delivery of IV administered exosomes has been a great challenge and a targeted delivery system is lacking to deliver naive (unmodified) exosomes from EPCs to the site of interest. Pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) is being used for therapeutic and experimental purposes. There has not been any report showing the use of pulsed low-intensity pFUS to deliver exosomes to the site of interest in models of stroke. In this proof of principle study, we have shown different parameters of pFUS to deliver exosomes in the intact and stroke brain with or without IV administration of nanobubbles. The study results showed that administration of nanobubbles is detrimental to the brain structures (micro bleeding and white matter destruction) at peak negative pressure (PNP) of &gt;0.25 MPa, despite enhanced delivery of IV administered exosomes. However, without nanobubbles, pFUS PNP = 1 to 2 MPa enhances the delivery of exosomes in the stroke area without altering the brain structures.

Interoceptive-exteroceptive integration is fundamental for a unified interactive experience of the world with the body. Predictive coding accounts propose that these integrated signals operate predictively, with regulation by precision-weighting. Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) are one means to investigate integrated processing. In a previous study, consistent with predictive coding characterisations of precision-weighting, we observed modulation of HEPs by attention. However, we found no evidence of HEP modulation by participants' interoceptive ability, despite the characterisation by predictive coding theories of trait abilities as a similar reflection of differential precision-weighting. In this study, we sought to more sensitively test the hypothesised trait-precision influences on HEPs by using an individually-adjusted measure of interoceptive performance. However, contrary to a precision-weighted predictive coding framework, we failed to find evidence in support of the HEP modulations by attentional-precision or trait-precision. Nonetheless, we observed robust HEP effects indicative of an expectation of a sound on the basis of a heartbeat -i.e. interoceptive-exteroceptive integration. It is possible that under our more individually-tailored task, participants relied less on attentional-precision to 'boost' predictions due to an enhanced perception of cardio-audio synchrony. Furthermore, assessing interoceptive ability is challenging, thus variations in performance may not accurately reflect trait-precision variations. Nevertheless, in sum, our findings are inconsistent with a precision-weighted prediction error view of the HEP, and highlight the need for clearer definitions of the manipulation and measurement of precision in predictive coding. Finally, our robust interoceptive-exteroceptive integration HEP effects may provide a valuable tool for investigating such integration in both clinical conditions and cognition.

In a previous study (Neukam, Kroemer et al. 2018), we found for the 5-HTTLPR genotype higher risk-seeking for losses in S/S vs. L/L carrier, which could not be explained by acutely changed central serotonin levels. This finding alternatively may be the result of reduced top-down control from the frontal cortex due to altered signal pathways involving the amygdala and ventral striatum. The serotonergic system is known to be involved in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether structural differences in white matter can explain the differences in risk-seeking behaviour that we observed in our previous study and whether 5-HTTLPR groups differ in their white matter microstructure. These differences can be detected using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). We assumed lower structural connectivity in S/S compared to L/L carrier, and a negative relationship between risk-seeking for losses and connectivity. We used DWI to compute diffusion parameters for the frontostriatal and uncinate tract in 175 individuals (39 S/S, 80 S/L, 56 L/L). Results showed no significant relationship between diffusion parameters and risk-seeking for losses. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences in diffusion parameters of the S/S vs. L/L group. There were only group differences in the frontostriatal tract showing stronger structural connectivity in the S/L group, which is also reflected in the whole brain approach. Therefore, the data do not support our hypothesis that the association between 5-HTTLPR and risk-seeking for losses is related to differences in white matter pathways implicated in decision-making.

Objective. Non-human primates (NHPs) are critical for development of translational neural technologies because of their neurological and neuroanatomical similarities to humans. Large-scale neural interfaces in NHPs with multiple modalities for stimulation and data collection poise us to unveil network-scale dynamics of both healthy and unhealthy neural systems. We aim to develop a large-scale multi-modal interface for NHPs for the purpose of studying large-scale neural phenomena including neural disease, damage, and recovery. Approach. We present a multi-modal artificial dura (MMAD) composed of flexible conductive traces printed into transparent medical grade polymer. Our MMAD provides simultaneous neurophysiological recordings and optical access to large areas of the cortex (~3 cm2) and is designed to mitigate photo-induced electrical artifacts. The MMAD is the centerpiece of the interfaces we have designed to support electrocorticographic recording and stimulation, cortical imaging, and optogenetic experiments, all at the large-scales afforded by the brains of NHPs. We performed electrical and optical experiments bench-side and in vivo with macaques to validate the utility of our MMAD. Main results. Using our MMAD we present large-scale electrocorticography from sensorimotor cortex of three macaques. Furthermore, we validated surface electrical stimulation in one of our animals. Our bench-side testing showed up to 90% reduction of photo-induced artifacts with our MMAD. The transparency of our MMAD was confirmed both via bench-side testing (87% transmittance) and via in vivo imaging of blood flow from the underlying microvasculature using optical coherence tomography angiography. Significance. Our results indicate that our MMAD supports large-scale electrocorticography, large-scale cortical imaging, and, by extension, large-scale optical stimulation. The MMAD prepares the way for both acute and long-term chronic experiments with complimentary data collection and stimulation modalities. When paired with the complex behaviors and cognitive abilities of NHPs, these assets prepare us to study large-scale neural phenomena including neural disease, damage, and recovery.

Neural synchrony and functional connectivity are disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. However, these alterations and how they are affected by commonly prescribed neuropsychiatric medication have not been characterized in depth. Here, we investigated changes in neural dynamics of circuits involving the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus during psychosis induced by the NMDAR antagonist phencyclidine and subsequent recovery by three different antipsychotic drugs (APDs), the classical APD haloperidol and two atypical APDs, clozapine and risperidone, in freely moving mice. We found that the psychotomimetic effects of phencyclidine were associated with hypersynchronization and disrupted communication of prefrontal-hippocampal pathways. Major alterations occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where phencyclidine increased oscillatory power at delta, high gamma and high frequencies (&lt;100 Hz) and generated aberrant cross-frequency coupling, suggesting the presence of hypersynchronous cortical microcircuits. Cross-regional coupling and phase coherence were also enhanced, further reflecting that the circuit's functional connectivity was increased. Phencyclidine also redirected the intrinsic flow of information at theta frequencies that traveled from the hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex into delta rhythms that traveled in the opposite direction. The three APDs rescued most phencyclidine-induced changes in power, coupling, phase coherence, and directionality, suggesting common cellular mechanisms of antipsychotic action. However, some differential effects were identified, likely resulting from the distinct affinity the three APDs have for dopamine and serotonin receptors. We therefore investigated how serotonin 1A (5-HT1AR) and 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) compare to the actions of the APDs. 5-HT2AR antagonism by M100907 and 5-HT1AR agonism by 8-OH-DPAT rescued phencyclidine-induced increased power, coupling and phase coherence but were unable to normalize the circuit's theta directionality. This suggests that other targets of the AAPDs working in tandem with 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT2ARs are required to ameliorate this key feature of the circuit.

Hippocampal sclerosis, the major neuropathological hallmark of temporal lobe epilepsy, is characterized by different patterns of neuronal loss. The mechanisms of cell-type specific vulnerability, their progression and histopathological classification remain controversial. Here using single-cell electrophysiology in vivo and immediate early gene expression, we reveal that superficial CA1 pyramidal neurons are overactive in epileptic rats and mice. Bulk tissue and single-nucleus expression profiling disclosed sublayer-specific transcriptomic signatures and robust microglial pro-inflammatory responses. Transcripts regulating neuronal processes such as voltage-channels, synaptic signalling and cell adhesion molecules were deregulated by epilepsy differently across sublayers, while neurodegenerative signatures primarily involved superficial cells. Pseudotime analysis of gene expression in single-nuclei and in situ validation revealed separated trajectories from health to epilepsy across cell types, and identified a subset of superficial cells undergoing a later stage in neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate sublayer- and cell type-specific changes associated with selective CA1 neuronal damage contributing to progression of hippocampal sclerosis

Previous work has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) change as a function of antidepressant treatment (ADT) response. However, it is unclear how representative these peripherally detected miRNA changes are to those occurring in the brain. This study aimed to use peripherally extracted neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) to circumvent these limitations and investigate neuronal miRNA changes associated with antidepressant response. Samples were collected at two time points (baseline and after 8 weeks of follow-up) from depressed patients who responded (N=20) and did not respond (N=20) to escitalopram treatment, as well as controls (N=20). Total extracellular vesicles (EVs) were extracted from plasma, and then further enriched for NDEVs by immunoprecipitation with L1CAM. EV size was measured using tunable resistive pulse sensing, and NDEV miRNA cargo was extracted and sequenced. Subsequently, studies in cell lines and postmortem tissue were conducted. Characterization of NDEVs revealed they were smaller than other EVs isolated from plasma (p&lt;0.0001), had brain-specific neuronal markers, and contained miRNAs enriched for brain functions (p&lt;0.0001) Furthermore, NDEVs from depressed patients were smaller than controls (p&lt;0.05), and NDEV size increased with ADT response (p&lt;0.01). Finally, changes in NDEV cargo, specifically changes in miR-21-5p, miR-30d-5p and miR-486-5p together (p&lt;0.01), were associated with ADT response. Targets of these three miRNAs were altered in brain tissue from depressed individuals (p&lt;0.05). Together, this study indicates that changes in peripherally isolated NDEVs can act as both a clinically accessible and informative biomarker of ADT response specifically through size and cargo.

The emerging novel therapeutic psilocybin produces psychedelic effects via engagement of cerebral serotonergic targets by psilocin (active metabolite). The serotonin 2A receptor critically mediates these effects by altering distributed neural processes that manifest as increased entropy, reduced functional connectivity (FC) within discrete brain networks (i.e., reduced integrity) and increased FC between networks (i.e., reduced segregation). Reduced integrity of the default mode network (DMN) is proposed to play a particularly prominent role in psychedelic phenomenology, including perceived ego-dissolution. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychoactive oral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) on plasma psilocin level (PPL), subjective drug intensity (SDI) and their association in fifteen healthy individuals. We further evaluate associations between these measures and resting-state FC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, acquired over the course of five hours after psilocybin administration. We show that PPL and SDI correlate negatively with measures of network integrity (including DMN) and segregation, both spatially constrained and unconstrained. We also find that the executive control network and dorsal attention network desegregate, increasing connectivity with other networks and throughout the brain as a function of PPL and SDI. These findings provide direct evidence that psilocin critically shapes the time course and magnitude of changes in the cerebral functional architecture and subjective experience following psilocybin administration. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying profound perceptual experiences evoked by this emerging transnosological therapeutic and implicate the expression of network integrity and segregation in the psychedelic experience and consciousness.

Abstract
Reelin plays a key role in neuronal migration and lamination in the cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that reelin expression decreases with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of reelin in all layers of the human hippocampal formation across three age groups. We used immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded hippocampal tissue from infants (1–10 months; n = 9), children (4–10 years; n = 4), and adults (45–60 years; n = 6) to stain for reelin. Expression was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm2) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ML), the hippocampal fissure (HF), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), CA4/Hilus and the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3, CA2, and CA1. Expression of reelin was highest in the HF irrespective of age, followed by the SLM and ML. Minimal to no expression was seen in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1‐3. With age, reelin expression decreased and was statistically significant from infancy to childhood in the HF (p = .02). This study confirms that reelin expression decreases with age in the human hippocampus, and shows for the first time that the major decrease occurs between infancy and early childhood.

<p>by Linda Martini, Sophie Brameyer, Elisabeth Hoyer, Kirsten Jung, Ulrich Gerland</p>

Membrane proteins account for about one third of the cellular proteome, but it is still unclear how dynamic they are and how they establish functional contacts with cytoplasmic interaction partners. Here, we consider a membrane-integrated one-component receptor that also acts as a transcriptional activator, and analyze how it kinetically locates its specific binding site on the genome. We focus on the case of CadC, the pH receptor of the acid stress response Cad system in <i>E. coli</i>. CadC is a prime example of a one-component signaling protein that directly binds to its cognate target site on the chromosome to regulate transcription. We combined fluorescence microscopy experiments, mathematical analysis, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to probe this target search process. Using fluorescently labeled CadC, we measured the time from activation of the receptor until successful binding to the DNA in single cells, exploiting that stable receptor-DNA complexes are visible as fluorescent spots. Our experimental data indicate that CadC is highly mobile in the membrane and finds its target by a 2D diffusion and capture mechanism. DNA mobility is constrained due to the overall chromosome organization, but a labeled DNA locus in the vicinity of the target site appears sufficiently mobile to randomly come close to the membrane. Relocation of the DNA target site to a distant position on the chromosome had almost no effect on the mean search time, which was between four and five minutes in either case. However, a mutant strain with two binding sites displayed a mean search time that was reduced by about a factor of two. This behavior is consistent with simulations of a coarse-grained lattice model for the coupled dynamics of DNA within a cell volume and proteins on its surface. The model also rationalizes the experimentally determined distribution of search times. Overall our findings reveal that DNA target search does not present a much bigger kinetic challenge for membrane-integrated proteins than for cytoplasmic proteins. More generally, diffusion and capture mechanisms may be sufficient for bacterial membrane proteins to establish functional contacts with cytoplasmic targets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lV4V-GK_v3g" width="1" />

Spatio-temporal patterns of melanocytic proliferations observed in vivo are important for diagnosis but the mechanisms that produce them are poorly understood. Here we present an agent-based model for simulating the emergence of the main biologic patterns found in melanocytic proliferations. Our model portrays the extracellular matrix of the dermo-epidermal junction as a two-dimensional manifold and we simulate cellular migration in terms of geometric translations driven by adhesive, repulsive and random forces. Abstracted cellular functions and melanocyte-matrix interactions are modeled as stochastic events. For identification and validation we use visual renderings of simulated cell populations in a horizontal perspective that reproduce growth patterns observed in vivo by sequential dermatoscopy and corresponding vertical views that reproduce the arrangement of melanocytes observed in histopathologic sections. Our results show that a balanced interplay of proliferation and migration produces the typical reticular pattern of nevi, whereas the globular pattern involves additional cellular mechanisms. We further demonstrate that slight variations in the three basic cellular properties proliferation, migration, and adhesion are sufficient to produce a large variety of morphological appearances of nevi. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for the reproduction of more complex scenarios that will help to establish functional connections between abstracted microscopic behavior and macroscopic patterns in all types of melanocytic proliferations including melanoma.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VBdam3mZDGs" width="1" />

<p>by Raymond A. Haggerty, Jeremy E. Purvis</p>

Individual cells show variability in their signaling dynamics that often correlates with phenotypic responses, indicating that cell-to-cell variability is not merely noise but can have functional consequences. Based on this observation, we reasoned that cell-to-cell variability under the same treatment condition could be explained in part by a single signaling motif that maps different upstream signals into a corresponding set of downstream responses. If this assumption holds, then repeated measurements of upstream and downstream signaling dynamics in a population of cells could provide information about the underlying signaling motif for a given pathway, even when no prior knowledge of that motif exists. To test these two hypotheses, we developed a computer algorithm called MISC (Motif Inference from Single Cells) that infers the underlying signaling motif from paired time-series measurements from individual cells. When applied to measurements of transcription factor and reporter gene expression in the yeast stress response, MISC predicted signaling motifs that were consistent with previous mechanistic models of transcription. The ability to detect the underlying mechanism became less certain when a cell’s upstream signal was randomly paired with another cell’s downstream response, demonstrating how averaging time-series measurements across a population obscures information about the underlying signaling mechanism. In some cases, motif predictions improved as more cells were added to the analysis. These results provide evidence that mechanistic information about cellular signaling networks can be systematically extracted from the dynamical patterns of single cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Skcw6xk1Pao" width="1" />

<p>by K. Seeliger, L. Ambrogioni, Y. Güçlütürk, L. M. van den Bulk, U. Güçlü, M. A. J. van Gerven</p>

Neural information flow (NIF) provides a novel approach for system identification in neuroscience. It models the neural computations in multiple brain regions and can be trained end-to-end via stochastic gradient descent from noninvasive data. NIF models represent neural information processing via a network of coupled tensors, each encoding the representation of the sensory input contained in a brain region. The elements of these tensors can be interpreted as cortical columns whose activity encodes the presence of a specific feature in a spatiotemporal location. Each tensor is coupled to the measured data specific to a brain region via low-rank observation models that can be decomposed into the spatial, temporal and feature receptive fields of a localized neuronal population. Both these observation models and the convolutional weights defining the information processing within regions are learned end-to-end by predicting the neural signal during sensory stimulation. We trained a NIF model on the activity of early visual areas using a large-scale fMRI dataset recorded in a single participant. We show that we can recover plausible visual representations and population receptive fields that are consistent with empirical findings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tKkLhYY_B1E" width="1" />

<p>by Mari Ganesh Kumar, Ming Hu, Aadhirai Ramanujan, Mriganka Sur, Hema A. Murthy</p>

The visual cortex of the mouse brain can be divided into ten or more areas that each contain complete or partial retinotopic maps of the contralateral visual field. It is generally assumed that these areas represent discrete processing regions. In contrast to the conventional input-output characterizations of neuronal responses to standard visual stimuli, here we asked whether six of the core visual areas have responses that are functionally distinct from each other for a given visual stimulus set, by applying machine learning techniques to distinguish the areas based on their activity patterns. Visual areas defined by retinotopic mapping were examined using supervised classifiers applied to responses elicited by a range of stimuli. Using two distinct datasets obtained using wide-field and two-photon imaging, we show that the area labels predicted by the classifiers were highly consistent with the labels obtained using retinotopy. Furthermore, the classifiers were able to model the boundaries of visual areas using resting state cortical responses obtained without any overt stimulus, in both datasets. With the wide-field dataset, clustering neuronal responses using a constrained semi-supervised classifier showed graceful degradation of accuracy. The results suggest that responses from visual cortical areas can be classified effectively using data-driven models. These responses likely reflect unique circuits within each area that give rise to activity with stronger intra-areal than inter-areal correlations, and their responses to controlled visual stimuli across trials drive higher areal classification accuracy than resting state responses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mLYuflk9l1Q" width="1" />

<p>by Lowell T. Edgar, Claudio A. Franco, Holger Gerhardt, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>

During developmental angiogenesis, endothelial cells respond to shear stress by migrating and remodelling the initially hyperbranched plexus, removing certain vessels whilst maintaining others. In this study, we argue that the key regulator of vessel preservation is cell decision behaviour at bifurcations. At flow-convergent bifurcations where migration paths diverge, cells must finely tune migration along both possible paths if the bifurcation is to persist. Experiments have demonstrated that disrupting the cells’ ability to sense shear or the junction forces transmitted between cells impacts the preservation of bifurcations during the remodelling process. However, how these migratory cues integrate during cell decision making remains poorly understood. Therefore, we present the first agent-based model of endothelial cell flow-mediated migration suitable for interrogating the mechanisms behind bifurcation stability. The model simulates flow in a bifurcated vessel network composed of agents representing endothelial cells arranged into a lumen which migrate against flow. Upon approaching a bifurcation where more than one migration path exists, agents refer to a stochastic bifurcation rule which models the decision cells make as a combination of flow-based and collective-based migratory cues. With this rule, cells favour branches with relatively larger shear stress or cell number. We found that cells must integrate both cues nearly equally to maximise bifurcation stability. In simulations with stable bifurcations, we found competitive oscillations between flow and collective cues, and simulations that lost the bifurcation were unable to maintain these oscillations. The competition between these two cues is haemodynamic in origin, and demonstrates that a natural defence against bifurcation loss during remodelling exists: as vessel lumens narrow due to cell efflux, resistance to flow and shear stress increases, attracting new cells to enter and rescue the vessel from regression. Our work provides theoretical insight into the role of junction force transmission has in stabilising vasculature during remodelling and as an emergent mechanism to avoid functional shunting.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E_jO4XzKZpg" width="1" />

Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule with many functions in the nervous system. Derived from the enzymatic conversion of arginine by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS), NO plays significant roles in neuronal developmental events such as the establishment of dendritic branching or arbors. A brief summary of the discovery, molecular biology, and chemistry of NO, and a description of important NO‐mediated signal transduction pathways with emphasis on the role for NO in the development of dendritic branching during neurodevelopment are presented. Important sex differences in neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression during neuronal development are considered. Finally, a survey of endogenous and exogenous substances that disrupt dendritic patterning is presented with particular emphasis on how these molecules may drive NO‐mediated sex differences in dendritic branching.

<p>The intertwined processes of learning and evolution in complex environmental
niches have resulted in a remarkable diversity of morphological forms.
Moreover, many aspects of animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these
evolved morphologies. However, the principles governing relations between
environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of
intelligent control, remain elusive, partially due to the substantial challenge
of performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning. We
introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a novel
computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn
challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments using
only low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate
several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence
and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the
evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a
morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, evolution rapidly
selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late
in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of
their descendants. In agents that learn and evolve in complex environments,
this result constitutes the first demonstration of a long-conjectured
morphological Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic
basis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of morphological
intelligence through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically
stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.

<p>The first-passage-time distribution of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
driven by a characteristically coloured noise is approximated by matching a
transient and a steady-state solution of the membrane voltage distribution.
These approximations follow from a simple manipulation, made possible by the
specific `eigen' colouring of the noise, which allows to express the membrane
potential as a Gaussian diffusion process on top of a deterministic exponential
movement. Following, the presented method is extended to the case of an
arbitrarily coloured noise driving by factoring out the `eigen' noise and
replacing the residue with an equivalent Gaussian process. It is shown that the
obtained expressions agree well with numerical simulations for different values
of the neuron parameters and noise colouring.

<p>Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have recently emerged in the Deep Learning
world for dealing with uncertainty estimation in classification tasks, and are
used in many application domains such as astrophysics, autonomous driving...BNN
assume a prior over the weights of a neural network instead of point estimates,
enabling in this way the estimation of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
of the model prediction.Moreover, a particular type of BNN, namely MC Dropout,
assumes a Bernoulli distribution on the weights by using Dropout.Several
attempts to optimize the dropout rate exist, e.g. using a variational
approach.In this paper, we present a new method called "Dropout Regulation"
(DR), which consists of automatically adjusting the dropout rate during
training using a controller as used in automation.DR allows for a precise
estimation of the uncertainty which is comparable to the state-of-the-art while
remaining simple to implement.

<p>Modern feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now solve some
computer vision tasks at super-human levels. However, these networks only
roughly mimic human visual perception. One difference from human vision is that
they do not appear to perceive illusory contours (e.g. Kanizsa squares) in the
same way humans do. Physiological evidence from visual cortex suggests that the
perception of illusory contours could involve feedback connections. Would
recurrent feedback neural networks perceive illusory contours like humans? In
this work we equip a deep feedforward convolutional network with brain-inspired
recurrent dynamics. The network was first pretrained with an unsupervised
reconstruction objective on a natural image dataset, to expose it to natural
object contour statistics. Then, a classification decision layer was added and
the model was finetuned on a form discrimination task: squares vs. randomly
oriented inducer shapes (no illusory contour). Finally, the model was tested
with the unfamiliar "illusory contour" configuration: inducer shapes oriented
to form an illusory square. Compared with feedforward baselines, the iterative
"predictive coding" feedback resulted in more illusory contours being
classified as physical squares. The perception of the illusory contour was
measurable in the luminance profile of the image reconstructions produced by
the model, demonstrating that the model really "sees" the illusion. Ablation
studies revealed that natural image pretraining and feedback error correction
are both critical to the perception of the illusion. Finally we validated our
conclusions in a deeper network (VGG): adding the same predictive coding
feedback dynamics again leads to the perception of illusory contours.

<p>We present a novel artificial cognitive mapping system using generative deep
neural networks (VAE/GAN), which can map input images to latent vectors and
generate temporal sequences internally. The results show that the distance of
the predicted image is reflected in the distance of the corresponding latent
vector after training. This indicates that the latent space is constructed to
reflect the proximity structure of the data set, and may provide a mechanism by
which many aspects of cognition are spatially represented. The present study
allows the network to internally generate temporal sequences analogous to
hippocampal replay/pre-play, where VAE produces only near-accurate replays of
past experiences, but by introducing GANs, latent vectors of temporally close
images are closely aligned and sequence acquired some instability. This may be
the origin of the generation of the new sequences found in the hippocampus.

<p>In this work we introduce an implementation for which machine learning
techniques helped improve the overall performance of an evolutionary algorithm
for an optimization problem, namely a variation of robust minimum-cost path in
graphs. In this big data optimization problem, a path achieving a good cost in
most scenarios from an available set of scenarios (generated by a simulation
process) must be obtained. The most expensive task of our evolutionary
algorithm, in terms of computational resources, is the evaluation of candidate
paths: the fitness function must calculate the cost of the candidate path in
every generated scenario. Given the large number of scenarios, this task must
be implemented in a distributed environment. We implemented gradient boosting
decision trees to classify candidate paths in order to identify good
candidates. The cost of the not-so-good candidates is simply forecasted. We
studied the training process, gain performance, accuracy, and other variables.
Our computational experiments show that the computational performance was
significantly improved at the expense of a limited loss of accuracy.

<p>Modern extracellular recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording
from large numbers of neurons. This has driven the development of new
statistical models for analyzing and interpreting neural population activity.
Here we provide a broad overview of recent developments in this area. We
compare and contrast different approaches, highlight strengths and limitations,
and discuss biological and mechanistic insights that these methods provide.
While still an area of active development, there are already a number of
powerful models for interpreting large scale neural recordings even in complex
experimental settings.

<p>Synapses change on multiple timescales, ranging from milliseconds to minutes,
due to a combination of both short- and long-term plasticity. Here we develop
an extension of the common Generalized Linear Model to infer both short- and
long-term changes in the coupling between a pre- and post-synaptic neuron based
on observed spiking activity. We model short-term synaptic plasticity using
additive effects that depend on the presynaptic spike timing, and we model
long-term changes in both synaptic weight and baseline firing rate using point
process adaptive smoothing. Using simulations, we first show that this model
can accurately recover time-varying synaptic weights 1) for both depressing and
facilitating synapses, 2) with a variety of long-term changes (including
realistic changes, such as due to STDP), 3) with a range of pre- and
post-synaptic firing rates, and 4) for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
We also show the importance of tracking fast changes in synaptic weights, slow
changes in synaptic weights, and unexplained variations in baseline firing
simultaneously. Omitting any one of these factors can lead to spurious
inferences for the others. Altogether, this model provides a flexible framework
for tracking short- and long-term variation in spike transmission.

<p>Multi-objectivization is a term used to describe strategies developed for
optimizing single-objective problems by multi-objective algorithms. This paper
focuses on multi-objectivizing the sum-of-the-parts combinatorial optimization
problems, which include the traveling salesman problem, the unconstrained
binary quadratic programming and other well-known combinatorial optimization
problem. For a sum-of-the-parts combinatorial optimization problem, we propose
to decompose its original objective into two sub-objectives with controllable
correlation. Based on the decomposition method, two new multi-objectivization
inspired single-objective optimization techniques called non-dominance search
and non-dominance exploitation are developed, respectively. Non-dominance
search is combined with two metaheuristics, namely iterated local search and
iterated tabu search, while non-dominance exploitation is embedded within the
iterated Lin-Kernighan metaheuristic. The resultant metaheuristics are called
ILS+NDS, ITS+NDS and ILK+NDE, respectively. Empirical studies on some TSP and
UBQP instances show that with appropriate correlation between the
sub-objectives, there are more chances to escape from local optima when new
starting solution is selected from the non-dominated solutions defined by the
decomposed sub-objectives. Experimental results also show that ILS+NDS, ITS+NDS
and ILK+NDE all significantly outperform their counterparts on most of the test
instances.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.622405">Orexin-A/Hypocretin-1 Controls the VTA-NAc Mesolimbic Pathway via Endocannabinoid-Mediated Disinhibition of Dopaminergic Neurons in Obese Mice</a></h4>

<p>Disinhibition of orexin-A/hypocretin-1 (OX-A) release occurs to several output areas of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) in the brain of leptin knockout obese ob/ob mice. In this study, we have investigated whether a similar increase of OX-A release occurs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), an orexinergic LH output area with functional effects on dopaminergic signaling at the mesolimbic circuit. By confocal and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) morphological studies coupled to molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches, we investigated OX-A-mediated dopaminergic signaling at the LH-VTA-nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway in obese ob/ob mice compared to wild-type (wt) lean littermates. We found an elevation of OX-A trafficking and release to the VTA of ob/ob mice and consequent orexin receptor-1 (OX1R)-mediated over-activation of dopaminergic (DA) neurons via phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL-α)-induced biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). In fact, by retrograde signaling to cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) at inhibitory inputs to DA neurons, 2-AG inhibited GABA release thus inducing an increase in DA concentration in the VTA and NAc of ob/ob mice. This effect was prevented by the OX1R antagonist SB-334867 (30 mg/Kg, i.p.), or the CB1R antagonist AM251 (10 mg/Kg, i.p.) and mimicked by OX-A injection (40 μg/Kg, i.p.) in wt lean mice. Enhanced DA signaling to the NAc in ob/ob mice, or in OX-A-injected wt mice, was accompanied by β-arrestin2-mediated desensitization of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in a manner prevented by SB-334867 or the D2R antagonist L741 (1.5 mg/Kg, i.p.). These results further support the role of OX-A signaling in the control of neuroadaptive responses, such as compulsive reward-seeking behavior or binge-like consumption of high palatable food, and suggest that aberrant OX-A trafficking to the DA neurons in the VTA of ob/ob mice influences the D2R response at NAc, a main target area of the mesolimbic pathway, via 2-AG/CB1-mediated retrograde signaling.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.613976">The Regulatory Functions of lncRNAs on Angiogenesis Following Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

<p>Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of global mortality and disability. It is a multi-factorial disease involving multiple factors, and gene dysregulation is considered as the major molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. Angiogenesis can promote collateral circulation, which helps the restoration of blood supply in the ischemic area and reduces ischemic necrosis following ischemic injury. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ischemic stroke is associated with various biological functions of endothelial cells and serves essential roles on the angiogenesis of ischemic stroke. The key roles of lncRNAs on angiogenesis suggest their potential as novel therapeutic targets for future diagnosis and treatment.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.639414">Effects of Excess Brain-Derived Human α-Synuclein on Synaptic Vesicle Trafficking</a></h4>

<p>α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein that regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking under physiological conditions. However, in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, α-synuclein accumulates throughout the neuron, including at synapses, leading to altered synaptic function, neurotoxicity, and motor, cognitive, and autonomic dysfunction. Neurons typically contain both monomeric and multimeric forms of α-synuclein, and it is generally accepted that disrupting the balance between them promotes aggregation and neurotoxicity. However, it remains unclear how distinct molecular species of α-synuclein affect synapses where α-synuclein is normally expressed. Using the lamprey reticulospinal synapse model, we previously showed that acute introduction of excess recombinant monomeric or dimeric α-synuclein impaired distinct stages of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis, leading to a loss of synaptic vesicles. Here, we expand this knowledge by investigating the effects of native, physiological α-synuclein isolated from the brain of a neuropathologically normal human subject, which comprised predominantly helically folded multimeric α-synuclein with a minor component of monomeric α-synuclein. After acute introduction of excess brain-derived human α-synuclein, there was a moderate reduction in the synaptic vesicle cluster and an increase in the number of large, atypical vesicles called “cisternae.” In addition, brain-derived α-synuclein increased synaptic vesicle and cisternae sizes and induced atypical fusion/fission events at the active zone. In contrast to monomeric or dimeric α-synuclein, the brain-derived multimeric α-synuclein did not appear to alter clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Taken together, these data suggest that excess brain-derived human α-synuclein impairs intracellular vesicle trafficking and further corroborate the idea that different molecular species of α-synuclein produce distinct trafficking defects at synapses. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which excess α-synuclein contributes to synaptic deficits and disease phenotypes.</p>

<p>Electroencephalographic activity over the sensorimotor cortex has been one of the best studied targets for neurofeedback therapy. Parkinson’s disease patients display abnormal brain rhythms in the motor cortex caused by increased synchrony in the basal ganglia-cortical pathway. Few studies have examined the effects of sensorimotor-based neurofeedback therapy in humans with PD. In this pilot study, one patient, diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease 10 years prior, participated in two consecutive days of EEG neurofeedback training to increase sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) power over the motor cortex. Using a visual display connected to ongoing EEG, the patient voluntarily manipulated SMR power, and he/she was awarded with points to positively reinforce successful increases over a predefined threshold. Recorded EEG data were source localized and analyzed for the occurrence of high amplitude bursts of SMR activity as well as bursts in the beta frequency band in the precentral cortex. The rate of SMR bursts increased with each subsequent training session, while the rate of beta bursts only increased on the final session. Relative power in the beta band, a marker of PD symptom severity, decreased over the motor cortex in the later session. These results provide first evidence for the feasibility of SMR neurofeedback training as a non-invasive therapy for reducing Parkinson’s disease related activity and upregulating SMR in the human motor cortex.</p>

<p>Computational visual encoding models play a key role in understanding the stimulus–response characteristics of neuronal populations in the brain visual cortex. However, building such models typically faces challenges in the effective construction of non-linear feature spaces to fit the neuronal responses. In this work, we propose the GaborNet visual encoding (GaborNet-VE) model, a novel end-to-end encoding model for the visual ventral stream. This model comprises a Gabor convolutional layer, two regular convolutional layers, and a fully connected layer. The key design principle for the GaborNet-VE model is to replace regular convolutional kernels in the first convolutional layer with Gabor kernels with learnable parameters. One GaborNet-VE model efficiently and simultaneously encodes all voxels in one region of interest of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance for the primary visual cortex. Moreover, the visualizations demonstrate the regularity of the region of interest fitting to the visual features and the estimated receptive fields. These results suggest that the lightweight region-based GaborNet-VE model based on combining handcrafted and deep learning features exhibits good expressiveness and biological interpretability.</p>

<p>Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has become a priority in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research, as it is a transitional phase between normal aging and dementia. However, information on MCI and AD is scattered across different formats and standards generated by different technologies, making it difficult to work with them manually. Ontologies have emerged as a solution to this problem due to their capacity for homogenization and consensus in the representation and reuse of data. In this context, an ontology that integrates the four main domains of neurodegenerative diseases, diagnostic tests, cognitive functions, and brain areas will be of great use in research. Here, we introduce the first approach to this ontology, the Neurocognitive Integrated Ontology (NIO), which integrates the knowledge regarding neuropsychological tests (NT), AD, cognitive functions, and brain areas. This ontology enables interoperability and facilitates access to data by integrating dispersed knowledge across different disciplines, rendering it useful for other research groups. To ensure the stability and reusability of NIO, the ontology was developed following the ontology-building life cycle, integrating and expanding terms from four different reference ontologies. The usefulness of this ontology was validated through use-case scenarios.</p>

<p>Backgrounds: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique for the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, e.g., mood disorders and schizophrenia. Therapeutic effects of tDCS are suggested to be produced by bi-directional changes in cortical activities, i.e., increased/decreased cortical excitability via anodal/cathodal stimulation. Although tDCS provides a promising approach for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, its neurobiological mechanisms remain to be explored.</p><p>Objectives: To review recent findings from neurophysiological, chemical, and brain-network studies, and consider how tDCS ameliorates psychiatric conditions.</p><p>Findings: Enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmissions through anodal tDCS stimulation is likely to facilitate glutamate transmission and suppress gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission in the cortex. On the other hand, it positively or negatively modulates the activities of dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine transmissions in the central nervous system. These neural events by tDCS may change the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Specifically, multi-session tDCS is thought to promote/regulate information processing efficiency in the cerebral cortical circuit, which induces long-term potentiation (LTP) by synthesizing various proteins.</p><p>Conclusions: This review will help understand putative mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of tDCS from the perspective of neurotransmitters, network dynamics, intracellular events, and related modalities of the brain function.</p>

<p>Visuomotor adaptation to novel environments can occur via non-physical means, such as observation. Observation does not appear to activate the same implicit learning processes as physical practice, rather it appears to be more strategic in nature. However, there is evidence that interspersing observational practice with physical practice can benefit performance and memory consolidation either through the combined benefits of separate processes or through a change in processes activated during observation trials. To test these ideas, we asked people to practice aiming to targets with visually rotated cursor feedback or engage in a combined practice schedule comprising physical practice and observation of projected videos showing successful aiming. Ninety-three participants were randomly assigned to one of five groups: massed physical practice (Act), distributed physical practice (Act+Rest), or one of 3 types of combined practice: alternating blocks (Obs_During), or all observation before (Obs_Pre) or after (Obs_Post) blocked physical practice. Participants received 100 practice trials (all or half were physical practice). All groups improved in adaptation trials and showed savings across the 24-h retention interval relative to initial practice. There was some forgetting for all groups, but the magnitudes were larger for physical practice groups. The Act and Obs_During groups were most accurate in retention and did not differ, suggesting that observation can serve as a replacement for physical practice if supplied intermittently and offers advantages above just resting. However, after-effects associated with combined practice were smaller than those for physical practice control groups, suggesting that beneficial learning effects as a result of observation were not due to activation of implicit learning processes. Reaction time, variable error, and post-test rotation drawings supported this conclusion that adaptation for observation groups was promoted by explicit/strategic processes.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate the correlation between preoperative response to the L-dopa challenge test and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor function in Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p><p>Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 38 patients with idiopathic PD who underwent DBS surgery with a median follow-up duration of 7 months. Twenty underwent bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS, and 18 underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Motor Part (MDS UPDRS-III) was assessed before surgery and at the last follow-up in different medication and stimulation conditions, respectively.</p><p>Results: Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness and GPi-DBS responsiveness on the total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.283, p = 0.016) but not on the non-tremor total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.158, p = 0.083) of MDS UPDRS-III. Such correlation remained significant (R<sup>2</sup>′ = 0.332, p = 0.010) after controlling for age at the time of surgery as confounding factor by partial correlation analysis. The preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness was significantly correlated with the tremor-controlling outcome of GPi-DBS (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.390, p = 0.003). In contrast, we found a positive correlation between preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness and STN-DBS responsiveness on the non-tremor total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.290, p = 0.021), but not on the total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.130, p = 0.141) of MDS UPDRS-III. The partial correlation analysis further demonstrated that the predictive value of preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness on the non-tremor motor outcome of STN-DBS was eliminated (R<sup>2</sup>′ = 0.120, p = 0.174) after controlling for age at the time of surgery as confounding factor.</p><p>Interpretation: The short-term predictive value of preoperative response to the L-dopa challenge test for the motor outcome of GPi-DBS in PD was systematically described. Our findings suggest: (1) a solid therapeutic effect of GPi-DBS in treating L-dopa-responsive tremors; (2) a negative effect of age at the time of surgery on motor outcomes of STN-DBS, (3) a possible preference of STN- to GPi-DBS in L-dopa-resistant tremor control, and (4) a possible preference of GPi- to STN-DBS in elderly PD patients who have a satisfactory dopamine response.</p>

<p>Retrieval practice, relative to further study, leads to long-term memory enhancement known as the “testing effect.” The neurobiological correlates of the testing effect at retrieval, when the learning benefits of testing are expressed, have not been fully characterized. Participants learned Swahili-English word-pairs and were assigned randomly to either the Study-Group or the Test-Group. After a week delay, all participants completed a cued-recall test while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The Test-Group had superior memory for the word-pairs compared to the Study-Group. While both groups exhibited largely overlapping activations for remembered word-pairs, following an interaction analysis the Test-Group exhibited differential performance-related effects in the left putamen and left inferior parietal cortex near the supramarginal gyrus. The same analysis showed the Study-Group exhibited greater activations in the dorsal MPFC/pre-SMA and bilateral frontal operculum for remembered vs. forgotten word-pairs, whereas the Test-Group showed the opposite pattern of activation in the same regions. Thus, retrieval practice during training establishes a unique striatal-supramarginal network at retrieval that promotes enhanced memory performance. In contrast, study alone yields poorer memory but greater activations in frontal regions.</p>

<p>Background: The regulation of muscle force is a vital aspect of sensorimotor control, requiring intricate neural processes. While neural activity associated with upper extremity force control has been documented, extrapolation to lower extremity force control is limited. Knowledge of how the brain regulates force control for knee extension and flexion may provide insights as to how pathology or intervention impacts central control of movement.</p><p>Objectives: To develop and implement a neuroimaging-compatible force control paradigm for knee extension and flexion.</p><p>Methods: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safe load cell was used in a customized apparatus to quantify force (N) during neuroimaging (Philips Achieva 3T). Visual biofeedback and a target sinusoidal wave that fluctuated between 0 and 5 N was provided via an MRI-safe virtual reality display. Fifteen right leg dominant female participants (age = 20.3 ± 1.2 years, height = 1.6 ± 0.10 m, weight = 64.8 ± 6.4 kg) completed a knee extension and flexion force matching paradigm during neuroimaging. The force-matching error was calculated based on the difference between the visual target and actual performance. Brain activation patterns were calculated and associated with force-matching error and the difference between quadriceps and hamstring force-matching tasks were evaluated with a mixed-effects model (z &gt; 3.1, p &lt; 0.05, cluster corrected).</p><p>Results: Knee extension and flexion force-matching tasks increased BOLD signal among cerebellar, sensorimotor, and visual-processing regions. Increased knee extension force-matching error was associated with greater right frontal cortex and left parietal cortex activity and reduced left lingual gyrus activity. Increased knee flexion force-matching error was associated with reduced left frontal and right parietal region activity. Knee flexion force control increased bilateral premotor, secondary somatosensory, and right anterior temporal activity relative to knee extension. The force-matching error was not statistically different between tasks.</p><p>Conclusion: Lower extremity force control results in unique activation strategies depending on if engaging knee extension or flexion, with knee flexion requiring increased neural activity (BOLD signal) for the same level of force and no difference in relative error. These fMRI compatible force control paradigms allow precise behavioral quantification of motor performance concurrent with brain activity for lower extremity sensorimotor function and may serve as a method for future research to investigate how pathologies affect lower extremity neuromuscular function.</p>

With an electroencephalography (EEG) minimum spanning tree (MST) structure, the purpose of this study was to compare the organization of supraspinal neural networks of transfer effect after postural training using full and intermittent visual feedbacks for older adults. Thirty-two older adults were randomly assigned to the stroboscopic vision (SV) (n = 16; age = 64.7 ± 3.0 years) and control (16; 66.3 ± 2.7 years) groups for balance training on a stabilometer (target task) with on-line visual feedback. Center-of-pressure characteristics and an MST-based connectome of the weighted phase-lag index during the bilateral stance on a foam surface (transfer task) were compared before and after stabilometer training. The results showed that both the SV and control groups showed improvements in postural stability in the trained task (p &lt; 0.001). However, unlike the control group (p = 0.030), the SV group who received intermittent visual feedback during the stabilometer training failed to reduce the size of postural sway in the anteroposterior direction of the postural transfer task (unstable stance on the foam surface) in the post-test (p = 0.694). In addition, network integration for the transfer task in the post-test was absent in the SV group (p &gt; 0.05). For the control group in the post-test, it manifested with training-related increases in leaf fraction in beta band (p = 0.015) and maximum betweenness in alpha band (p = 0.018), but a smaller diameter in alpha (p = 0.006)/beta (p = 0.021) bands and average eccentricity in alpha band (p = 0.028). In conclusion, stabilometer training with stroboscopic vision impairs generalization of postural skill to unstable stance for older adults. Adequate visual information is a key mediating factor of supraspinal neural networks to carry over balance skill in older adults.</p>

<p>Purpose: Loss of grip strength and cognitive impairment are prevalent in the elderly, and they may share the pathogenesis in common. Several original studies have investigated the association between them, but the results remained controversial. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to quantitatively determine the relationship between baseline grip strength and the risk of cognitive impairment and provide evidence for clinical work.</p><p>Methods: We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science up to March 23, 2020, and focused on the association between baseline grip strength and onset of cognitive impairment. Next, we conducted a meta-analysis using a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect measures. Heterogeneity between the studies was examined using I<sup>2</sup> and p-value. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed, and publication bias was assessed by Begg's and Egger's tests.</p><p>Results: Fifteen studies were included in this systematic review. After sensitivity analyses, poorer grip strength was associated with more risk of cognitive decline and dementia (HR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.71–2.32; HR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.32–1.79, respectively). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that people with poorer strength had more risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia (HR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.09–1.81; HR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.10–1.91, respectively).</p><p>Conclusions: Lower grip strength is associated with more risk of onset of cognitive decline and dementia despite of subtype of dementia. We should be alert for the individuals with poor grip strength and identify cognitive dysfunction early.</p>

<p>Background: Glucose alterations are associated with impaired cognition.

<p>Stroke is the leading cause of global mortality and disability. Cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are common complications of cerebral infarction and the major causes of mortality. The formation of cerebral edema includes three stages (cytotoxic edema, ionic edema, and vasogenic edema), which involve multiple proteins and ion channels. A range of therapeutic agents that successfully target cerebral edema have been developed in animal studies, some of which have been assessed in clinical trials. Herein, we review the mechanisms of cerebral edema and the research progress of anti-edema therapies for use after ischemic stroke.</p>

<p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are highly susceptible to developing dementia, especially for those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but its underlying cause is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the early detection of white matter structural network changes in T2DM patients with MCI and assess the relationship between cognitive impairment and structural network alterations in T2DM patients. In this study, we performed a battery of neuropsychological tests and diffusion tensor MRI in 30 T2MD-MCI patients, 30 T2DM patients with normal cognition (T2DM-NC) and 30 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy control (HC) individuals. Cognitive performance exhibited obvious differences among the three groups. The structural network was significantly disrupted in both global and regional levels in T2DM patients. The T2DM-MCI group showed more severe impairment of global network efficiency, and lower nodal efficiency and fewer connections within multiple regions like the limbic system, basal ganglia, and several cortical structures. Moreover, a subnetwork impaired in T2DM-MCI patients was characterized by cortical-limbic fibers, and commissural fibers and pathways within the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes. These altered global and nodal parameters were significantly correlated with cognitive function in T2DM-MCI patients. In particular, executive dysfunction and working memory impairment in T2DM-MCI patients correlated with nodal efficiency in the right opercular part and triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, which indicated that white matter disruption in these regions may act as potential biomarkers for T2DM-associated MCI detection. Our investigation provides a novel insight into the neuropathological effects of white matter network disruption on cognition impairments induced by T2DM.</p>

<p>Oculomotor behavior can provide insight into the integrity of widespread cortical networks, which may contribute to the differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Three groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and a sample of cognitively unimpaired elders underwent an eye-tracking evaluation. All participants in the discovery sample, including controls, had a biomarker-supported diagnosis. Oculomotor correlates of neuropsychology and brain metabolism evaluated with 18F-FDG PET were explored. Machine-learning classification algorithms were trained for the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease, bvFTD and controls. A total of 93 subjects (33 Alzheimer's disease, 24 bvFTD, seven svPPA, and 29 controls) were included in the study. Alzheimer's disease was the most impaired group in all tests and displayed specific abnormalities in some visually-guided saccade parameters, as pursuit error and horizontal prosaccade latency, which are theoretically closely linked to posterior brain regions. BvFTD patients showed deficits especially in the most cognitively demanding tasks, the antisaccade and memory saccade tests, which require a fine control from frontal lobe regions. SvPPA patients performed similarly to controls in most parameters except for a lower number of correct memory saccades. Pursuit error was significantly correlated with cognitive measures of constructional praxis and executive function and metabolism in right posterior middle temporal gyrus. The classification algorithms yielded an area under the curve of 97.5% for the differentiation of Alzheimer's disease vs. controls, 96.7% for bvFTD vs. controls, and 92.5% for Alzheimer's disease vs. bvFTD. In conclusion, patients with Alzheimer's disease, bvFTD and svPPA exhibit differentiating oculomotor patterns which reflect the characteristic neuroanatomical distribution of pathology of each disease, and therefore its assessment can be useful in their diagnostic work-up. Machine learning approaches can facilitate the applicability of eye-tracking in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Background: More people with cognitive dysfunction and dementia also fall into the category of high vascular risk, for which aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs. However, previous studies reporting that aspirin buffers against mild cognitive decline (MCI) and dementia remain controversial. We thus conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of aspirin use with the risk of MCI and dementia in older adults.</p><p>Methods: Data sources from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database for randomized controlled trails (RCTs) and cohort studies (published between January 1, 2000 and April 11, 2020). Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to pool data on the occurrence of dementia and MCI with random-effects models.</p><p>Results: Of 3,193 identified articles, 15 studies (12 cohort studies and three RCTs) were eligible and were included in our analysis, which involved a total of 100,909 participants without cognitive dysfunctions or dementia at baseline. In pooled cohort studies, aspirin use did not reduce the incidence of MCI and dementia (the pooled RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.85–1.11; Ifor heterogeneity2 = 65%) compared with non-users. However, low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) was associated with a decreased likelihood of developing dementia or MCI (the pooled RR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.63–0.9; Ifor heterogeneity2 = 50.5%). This association existed in studies including all-cause dementia (the pooled RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.71–0.96) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (the pooled RR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.33–0.89), but not in MCI (the pooled RR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.31–1.08). In RCTs, low-dose aspirin use was not significantly associated with less prevalence of dementia or MCI (RR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.84–1.05; Ifor heterogeneity2 = 0.0%).</p><p>Conclusions: In cohort studies, we found that low-dose aspirin use had a higher likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia, which was not supported by RCTs. The evidence was insufficient to fully evaluate the effect of aspirin on cognitive function and dementia. Well-designed studies and innovative approaches are therefore needed to clarify whether the use of aspirin improves cognitive function and reduces the risk of dementia.</p>

In animal gonads, the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guards genome integrity in part through the co-transcriptional gene silencing of transposon insertions. In <i>Drosophila</i> ovaries, piRNA-loaded Piwi detects nascent transposon transcripts and instructs heterochromatin formation through the <i>P</i>anoramix-<i>i</i>nduced <i>c</i>o-<i>t</i>ranscriptional <i>s</i>ilencing (PICTS) complex, containing Panoramix, Nxf2 and Nxt1. Here, we report that the highly conserved dynein light chain LC8/Cut-up (Ctp) is an essential component of the PICTS complex. Loss of Ctp results in transposon de-repression and a reduction in repressive chromatin marks specifically at transposon loci. In turn, Ctp can enforce transcriptional silencing when artificially recruited to RNA and DNA reporters. We show that Ctp drives dimerisation of the PICTS complex through its interaction with conserved motifs within Panoramix. Artificial dimerisation of Panoramix bypasses the necessity for its interaction with Ctp, demonstrating that conscription of a protein from a ubiquitous cellular machinery has fulfilled a fundamental requirement for a transposon silencing complex.

During navigation, the visual responses of neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are modulated by the animal’s spatial position. Here we show that this spatial modulation is similarly present across multiple higher visual areas but negligible in the main thalamic pathway into V1. Similar to hippocampus, spatial modulation in visual cortex strengthens with experience and with active behavior. Active navigation in a familiar environment, therefore, enhances the spatial modulation of visual signals starting in the cortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63252">Hormone-sensitive lipase couples intergenerational sterol metabolism to reproductive success</a></h4>

Triacylglycerol (TG) and steryl ester (SE) lipid storage is a universal strategy to maintain organismal energy and membrane homeostasis. Cycles of building and mobilizing storage fat are fundamental in (re)distributing lipid substrates between tissues or to progress ontogenetic transitions. In this study we show that Hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) specifically controls SE mobilization to initiate intergenerational sterol transfer in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Tissue-autonomous Hsl functions in the maternal fat body and germline coordinately prevent adult SE overstorage and maximize sterol allocation to embryos. While Hsl-deficiency is largely dispensable for normal development on sterol-rich diets, animals depend on adipocyte Hsl for optimal fecundity when dietary sterol becomes limiting. Notably, accumulation of SE but not of TG is a characteristic of Hsl-deficient cells across phyla including murine white adipocytes. In summary, we identified Hsl as an ancestral regulator of SE degradation, which improves intergenerational sterol transfer and reproductive success in flies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60454">Coupling between fast and slow oscillator circuits in <i>Cancer borealis</i> is temperature compensated</a></h4>

Coupled oscillatory circuits are ubiquitous in nervous systems. Given that most biological processes are temperature sensitive, it is remarkable that the neuronal circuits of poikilothermic animals can maintain coupling across a wide range of temperatures. Within the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <i>Cancer borealis</i>, the fast pyloric rhythm (~1Hz) and the slow gastric mill rhythm (~0.1Hz) are precisely coordinated at ~11°C such that there is an integer number of pyloric cycles per gastric mill cycle (integer coupling). Upon increasing temperature from 7-23°C, both oscillators showed similar temperature-dependent increases in cycle frequency, and integer coupling between the circuits was conserved. Thus, although both rhythms show temperature dependent changes in rhythm frequency, the processes that couple these circuits maintain their coordination over a wide range of temperature. Such robustness to temperature changes could be part of a toolbox of processes that enables neural circuits to maintain function despite global perturbations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59775">Cell-density independent increased lymphocyte production and loss rates post-autologous HSCT</a></h4>

Lymphocyte numbers need to be quite tightly regulated. It is generally assumed that lymphocyte production and lifespan increase homeostatically when lymphocyte numbers are low, and vice versa return to normal once cell numbers have normalized. This widely-accepted concept is largely based on experiments in mice, but is hardly investigated in vivo in humans. Here we quantified lymphocyte production and loss rates in vivo in patients 0.5-1 year after their autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT). We indeed found that the production rates of most T-cell and B-cell subsets in autoHSCT-patients were 2 to 8-times higher than in healthy controls, but went hand in hand with a 3 to 9-fold increase in cell loss rates. Both rates also did not normalize when cell numbers did. This shows that increased lymphocyte production and loss rates occur even long after autoHSCT and can persist in the face of apparently normal cell numbers.

Dysregulation of the histone deacetylase HDAC4 is associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and a feature common to many of these disorders is impaired cognitive function. HDAC4 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both vertebrates and invertebrates and alterations in the amounts of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic HDAC4 have been implicated in these diseases. In Drosophila, HDAC4 also plays a critical role in the regulation of memory however the mechanisms through which it acts are unknown. Nuclear and cytoplasmically-restricted HDAC4 mutants were expressed in the Drosophila brain to investigate a mechanistic link between HDAC4 subcellular distribution, transcriptional changes and neuronal dysfunction. Deficits in mushroom body morphogenesis, eye development and long-term memory correlated with increased abundance of nuclear HDAC4 but were associated with minimal transcriptional changes. Although HDAC4 sequesters MEF2 into punctate foci within neuronal nuclei, no alteration in MEF2 activity was observed on overexpression of HDAC4, and knockdown of MEF2 had no impact on long-term memory, indicating that HDAC4 is likely not acting through MEF2. Similarly, deletion of the MEF2 binding site also had no impact on HDAC4-induced impairments in eye development, however it did significantly reduce the mushroom body deficits, thus nuclear HDAC4 acts through MEF2 to disrupt mushroom body development. These data provide insight into the mechanisms through which dysregulation of HDAC4 subcellular distribution impairs neurological function and provides new avenues for further investigation.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has mobilised scientists around the globe to research all aspects of the coronavirus virus and its infection. For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, <i>a priori</i> interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a context specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LdAO1hqfaaA" width="1" />

<p>by Anjalika Nande, Ben Adlam, Justin Sheen, Michael Z. Levy, Alison L. Hill</p>

In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing is being used worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household “bubbles” can be safe. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control second waves of COVID-19 as well as other similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/21NEY6wHPw8" width="1" />

The aim of this study is to analyze patient movement patterns between hospital departments to derive the underlying intra-hospital movement network, and to assess if movement patterns differ between patients at high or low risk of colonization. For that purpose, we analyzed patient electronic medical record data from five hospitals to extract information on risk stratification and patient intra-hospital movements. Movement patterns were visualized as networks, and network centrality measures were calculated. Next, using an agent-based model where agents represent patients and intra-hospital patient movements were explicitly modeled, we simulated the spread of multidrug resistant enterobacteriacae (MDR-E) inside a hospital. Risk stratification of patients according to certain ICD-10 codes revealed that length of stay, patient age, and mean number of movements per admission were higher in the high-risk groups. Movement networks in all hospitals displayed a high variability among departments concerning their network centrality and connectedness with a few highly connected departments and many weakly connected peripheral departments. Simulating the spread of a pathogen in one hospital network showed positive correlation between department prevalence and network centrality measures. This study highlights the importance of intra-hospital patient movements and their possible impact on pathogen spread. Targeting interventions to departments of higher (weighted) degree may help to control the spread of MDR-E. Moreover, when the colonization status of patients coming from different departments is unknown, a ranking system based on department centralities may be used to design more effective interventions that mitigate pathogen spread.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7W_VP3BxfQM" width="1" />

Abstract
Theta oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) appear during translational movement and arousal, modulate the activity of principal cells, and are associated with spatial cognition and episodic memory function. All known anxiolytics slightly but consistently reduce hippocampal theta frequency. However, whether this electrophysiological effect is mechanistically related to the decreased behavioral expression of anxiety is currently unclear. Here, we propose that a reduction in theta frequency affects synaptic plasticity and mnemonic function and that this can explain the reduction in anxiety behavior. We test this hypothesis in a biophysical model of contextual fear conditioning. First, we confirm that our model reproduces previous empirical results regarding the dependence of synaptic plasticity on presynaptic firing rate. Next, we investigate how theta frequency during contextual conditioning impacts learning. These simulations demonstrate that learned associations between threat and context are attenuated when learning takes place under reduced theta frequency. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that learned associations result in increased theta activity in the amygdala, consistent with empirical data. In summary, we propose a mechanism that can account for the behavioral effect of anxiolytics by impairing the integration of threat attributes of an environment into the cognitive map due to reduced synaptic potentiation.

Wei et al. characterized morpho‐physiological properties and connectivity of VIP+ interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus. VIP+ interneurons comprise four morphologically distinct subtypes with variable physiological properties and preferentially innervate GABAergic interneurons over glutamatergic principal cells.







Abstract
The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex. Local‐circuit inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) regulate the excitation–inhibition balance in the DG principal neurons (PNs) and therefore are critical for information processing. Similar to PNs, GABAergic INs also receive distinct inhibitory inputs. Among various classes of INs, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide‐expressing (VIP+) INs preferentially target other INs in several brain regions and thereby directly modulate the GABAergic system. However, the morpho‐physiological characteristics and postsynaptic targets of VIP+ INs in the DG are poorly understood. Here, we report that VIP+ INs in the mouse DG are highly heterogeneous based on their morpho‐physiological characteristics. In approximately two‐thirds of morphologically reconstructed cells, their axons ramify in the hilus. The remaining cells project their axons exclusively to the molecular layer (15%), to both the molecular layer and hilus (10%), or throughout the entire DG layers (8%). Generally, VIP+ INs display variable intrinsic properties and discharge patterns without clear correlation with their morphologies. Finally, VIP+ INs are recruited with a long latency in response to theta‐band cortical inputs and preferentially innervate GABAergic INs over glutamatergic PNs. In summary, VIP+ INs in the DG are composed of highly diverse subpopulations and control the DG output via disinhibition.

<p>In this research work we present GLaSS, a novel zero-shot framework to
generate an image(or a caption) corresponding to a given caption(or image).
GLaSS is based on the CLIP neural network which given an image and a
descriptive caption provides similar embeddings. Differently, GLaSS takes a
caption (or an image) as an input, and generates the image (or the caption)
whose CLIP embedding is most similar to the input one. This optimal image (or
caption) is produced via a generative network after an exploration by a genetic
algorithm. Promising results are shown, based on the experimentation of the
image generators BigGAN and StyleGAN2, and of the text generator GPT2.

<p>We analyze the computational power of discrete-time recurrent neural networks
(NNs) with the saturated-linear activation function within the Chomsky
hierarchy. This model restricted to integer weights coincides with binary-state
NNs with the Heaviside activation function, which are equivalent to finite
automata (Chomsky level 3) recognizing regular languages (REG), while rational
weights make this model Turing-complete even for three analog-state units
(Chomsky level 0). For the intermediate model $\alpha$ANN of a binary-state NN
that is extended with $\alpha\geq 0$ extra analog-state neurons with rational
weights, we have established the analog neuron hierarchy 0ANNs $\subset$ 1ANNs
$\subset$ 2ANNs $\subseteq$ 3ANNs. The separation 1ANNs $\subsetneqq$ 2ANNs has
been witnessed by the non-regular deterministic context-free language (DCFL)
$L_\#=\{0^n1^n\mid n\geq 1\}$ which cannot be recognized by any 1ANN even with
real weights, while any DCFL (Chomsky level 2) is accepted by a 2ANN with
rational weights. In this paper, we strengthen this separation by showing that
any non-regular DCFL cannot be recognized by 1ANNs with real weights, which
means (DCFLs $\setminus$ REG) $\subset$ (2ANNs $\setminus$ 1ANNs), implying
1ANNs $\cap$ DCFLs = 0ANNs. For this purpose, we have shown that $L_\#$ is the
simplest non-regular DCFL by reducing $L_\#$ to any language in this class,
which is by itself an interesting achievement in computability theory.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01621">Depth separation beyond radial functions. (arXiv:2102.01621v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>High-dimensional depth separation results for neural networks show that
certain functions can be efficiently approximated by two-hidden-layer networks
but not by one-hidden-layer ones in high-dimensions $d$. Existing results of
this type mainly focus on functions with an underlying radial or
one-dimensional structure, which are usually not encountered in practice. The
first contribution of this paper is to extend such results to a more general
class of functions, namely functions with piece-wise oscillatory structure, by
building on the proof strategy of (Eldan and Shamir, 2016). We complement these
results by showing that, if the domain radius and the rate of oscillation of
the objective function are constant, then approximation by one-hidden-layer
networks holds at a $\mathrm{poly}(d)$ rate for any fixed error threshold.
</p>
<p>A common theme in the proof of such results is the fact that one-hidden-layer
networks fail to approximate high-energy functions whose Fourier representation
is spread in the domain. On the other hand, existing approximation results of a
function by one-hidden-layer neural networks rely on the function having a
sparse Fourier representation. The choice of the domain also represents a
source of gaps between upper and lower approximation bounds. Focusing on a
fixed approximation domain, namely the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ in dimension
$d$, we provide a characterization of both functions which are efficiently
approximable by one-hidden-layer networks and of functions which are provably
not, in terms of their Fourier expansion.

<p>When facing many options, we narrow down our focus to very few of them.
Although behaviors like this can be a sign of heuristics, they can actually be
optimal under limited cognitive resources. Here we study the problem of how to
optimally allocate limited sampling time to multiple options, modelled as
accumulators of noisy evidence, to determine the most profitable one. We show
that the effective sampling capacity of an agent increases with both available
time and the discriminability of the options, and optimal policies undergo a
sharp transition as a function of it. For small capacity, it is best to
allocate time evenly to exactly five options and to ignore all the others,
regardless of the prior distribution of rewards. For large capacities, the
optimal number of sampled accumulators grows sub-linearly, closely following a
power law for a wide variety of priors. We find that allocating equal times to
the sampled accumulators is better than using uneven time allocations. Our work
highlights that multi-alternative decisions are endowed with breadth-depth
tradeoffs, demonstrates how their optimal solutions depend on the amount of
limited resources and the variability of the environment, and shows that
narrowing down to a handful of options is always optimal for small capacities.

<p>Many cephalopods such as octopus and squid change their skin color
purposefully within a very short time. Furthermore, it is widely known that
some octopuses have the ability to change the color and unevenness of the skin
and to mimic the surroundings in short time. However, much research has not
been done on the entire mimicry mechanism in which the octopus recognizes the
surrounding landscape and changes the skin pattern. It seems that there is no
hypothetical model to explain the whole mimicry mechanism yet. In this study,
the mechanism of octopus skin pattern formation was assumed to be based on the
Turing model. Here, the pattern formation by the Turing model was realized by
the equivalent filter calculation model using the cellular automaton, instead
of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this model
can create various patterns with two feature parameters. Furthermore, for the
eyes recognition part where two features are extracted from the Turing pattern
image, our study proposed a method that can be calculated back with small
amount of calculation using the characteristics of the cellular Turing pattern
model. These two calculations can be expressed in the same mathematical frame
based on the cellular automaton model using the convolution filter. As a
result, it can be created a model which is capable of extracting features from
patterns and reconstructing patterns in a short time, the model is considered
to be a basic model for considering the mimicry mechanism of octopus. Also, in
terms of application to machine learning, it is considered that it shows the
possibility of leading to a model with a small amount of learning calculation.

<p>Evolutionary Algorithms are naturally inspired approximation optimisation
algorithms that usually interfere with science problems when common
mathematical methods are unable to provide a good solution or finding the exact
solution requires an unreasonable amount of time using traditional exhaustive
search algorithms. The success of these population-based frameworks is mainly
due to their flexibility and ease of adaptation to the most different and
complex optimisation problems. This paper presents a metaheuristic algorithm
called Stochastic Fractal Search, inspired by the natural phenomenon of growth
based on a mathematical concept called the fractal, which is shown to be able
to explore the search space more efficiently. This paper also focuses on the
algorithm steps and some example applications of engineering design
optimisation problems commonly used in the literature being applied to the
proposed algorithm.

<p>To plan safe and comfortable trajectories for automated vehicles on highways,
accurate predictions of traffic situations are needed. So far, a lot of
research effort has been spent on detecting lane change maneuvers rather than
on estimating the point in time a lane change actually happens. In practice,
however, this temporal information might be even more useful. This paper deals
with the development of a system that accurately predicts the time to the next
lane change of surrounding vehicles on highways using long short-term
memory-based recurrent neural networks. An extensive evaluation based on a
large real-world data set shows that our approach is able to make reliable
predictions, even in the most challenging situations, with a root mean squared
error around 0.7 seconds. Already 3.5 seconds prior to lane changes the
predictions become highly accurate, showing a median error of less than 0.25
seconds. In summary, this article forms a fundamental step towards downstreamed
highly accurate position predictions.

<p>When faced with a new dataset, most practitioners begin by performing
exploratory data analysis to discover interesting patterns and characteristics
within data. Techniques such as association rule mining are commonly applied to
uncover relationships between features (attributes) of the data. However,
association rules are primarily designed for use on binary or categorical data,
due to their use of rule-based machine learning. A large proportion of
real-world data is continuous in nature, and discretisation of such data leads
to inaccurate and less informative association rules. In this paper, we propose
an alternative approach called feature relationship mining (FRM), which uses a
genetic programming approach to automatically discover symbolic relationships
between continuous or categorical features in data. To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed approach is the first such symbolic approach with the
goal of explicitly discovering relationships between features. Empirical
testing on a variety of real-world datasets shows the proposed method is able
to find high-quality, simple feature relationships which can be easily
interpreted and which provide clear and non-trivial insight into data.

<p>The computational workload involved in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
is typically out of reach for low-power embedded devices. There are a large
number of approximation techniques to address this problem. These methods have
hyper-parameters that need to be optimized for each CNNs using design space
exploration (DSE). The goal of this work is to demonstrate that the DSE phase
time can easily explode for state of the art CNN. We thus propose the use of an
optimized exploration process to drastically reduce the exploration time
without sacrificing the quality of the output.

<p>To reduce the resource demand of neural network (NN) inference systems, it
has been proposed to use approximate memory, in which the supply voltage and
the timing parameters are tuned trading accuracy with energy consumption and
performance. Tuning these parameters aggressively leads to bit errors, which
can be tolerated by NNs when bit flips are injected during training. However,
bit flip training, which is the state of the art for achieving bit error
tolerance, does not scale well; it leads to massive overheads and cannot be
applied for high bit error rates (BERs). Alternative methods to achieve bit
error tolerance in NNs are needed, but the underlying principles behind the bit
error tolerance of NNs have not been reported yet. With this lack of
understanding, further progress in the research on NN bit error tolerance will
be restrained.
</p>
<p>In this study, our objective is to investigate the internal changes in the
NNs that bit flip training causes, with a focus on binarized NNs (BNNs). To
this end, we quantify the properties of bit error tolerant BNNs with two
metrics. First, we propose a neuron-level bit error tolerance metric, which
calculates the margin between the pre-activation values and batch normalization
thresholds. Secondly, to capture the effects of bit error tolerance on the
interplay of neurons, we propose an inter-neuron bit error tolerance metric,
which measures the importance of each neuron and computes the variance over all
importance values. Our experimental results support that these two metrics are
strongly related to bit error tolerance.

<p>Chaos and Noise are ubiquitous in the Brain. Inspired by the chaotic firing
of neurons and the constructive role of noise in neuronal models, we for the
first time connect chaos, noise and learning. In this paper, we demonstrate
Stochastic Resonance (SR) phenomenon in Neurochaos Learning (NL). SR manifests
at the level of a single neuron of NL and enables efficient subthreshold signal
detection. Furthermore, SR is shown to occur in single and multiple neuronal NL
architecture for classification tasks - both on simulated and real-world spoken
digit datasets. Intermediate levels of noise in neurochaos learning enables
peak performance in classification tasks thus highlighting the role of SR in AI
applications, especially in brain inspired learning architectures.

<p>The human brain prioritises relevant sensory information to perform different
tasks. Enhancement of task-relevant information requires flexible allocation of
attentional resources, but it is still a mystery how this is operationalised in
the brain. We investigated how attentional mechanisms operate in situations
where multiple stimuli are presented in the same location and at the same time.
In two experiments, participants performed a challenging two-back task on
different types of visual stimuli that were presented simultaneously and
superimposed over each other. Using electroencephalography and multivariate
decoding, we analysed the effect of attention on the neural responses to each
individual stimulus. Whole brain neural responses contained considerable
information about both the attended and unattended stimuli, even though they
were presented simultaneously and represented in overlapping receptive fields.
As expected, attention increased the decodability of stimulus-related
information contained in the neural responses, but this effect was evident
earlier for stimuli that were presented at smaller sizes. Our results show that
early neural responses to stimuli in fast-changing displays contain remarkable
information about the sensory environment but are also modulated by attention
in a manner dependent on perceptual characteristics of the relevant stimuli.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09426">How higher goals are constructed and collapse under stress: a hierarchical Bayesian control systems perspective. (arXiv:2004.09426v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>In this paper, we show that organisms can be modeled as hierarchical Bayesian
control systems with small world and information bottleneck (bow-tie) network
structure. Such systems combine hierarchical perception with hierarchical goal
setting and hierarchical action control. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian
control systems produce deep hierarchies of goal states, from which it follows
that organisms must have some form of 'highest goals'. For all organisms, these
involve internal (self) models, external (social) models and overarching
(normative) models. We show that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a
top-down manner under severe and prolonged levels of stress. This produces
behavior that favors short-term and self-referential goals over long term,
social and/or normative goals. The collapse of goal hierarchies is universally
accompanied by an increase in entropy (disorder) in control systems that can
serve as an early warning sign for tipping points (disease or death of the
organism). In humans, learning goal hierarchies corresponds to personality
development (maturation). The failure of goal hierarchies to mature properly
corresponds to personality deficits. A top-down collapse of such hierarchies
under stress is identified as a common factor in all forms of episodic mental
disorders (psychopathology). The paper concludes by discussing ways of testing
these hypotheses empirically.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12287">Deep Randomized Neural Networks. (arXiv:2002.12287v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Randomized Neural Networks explore the behavior of neural systems where the
majority of connections are fixed, either in a stochastic or a deterministic
fashion. Typical examples of such systems consist of multi-layered neural
network architectures where the connections to the hidden layer(s) are left
untrained after initialization. Limiting the training algorithms to operate on
a reduced set of weights inherently characterizes the class of Randomized
Neural Networks with a number of intriguing features. Among them, the extreme
efficiency of the resulting learning processes is undoubtedly a striking
advantage with respect to fully trained architectures. Besides, despite the
involved simplifications, randomized neural systems possess remarkable
properties both in practice, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple
domains, and theoretically, allowing to analyze intrinsic properties of neural
architectures (e.g. before training of the hidden layers' connections). In
recent years, the study of Randomized Neural Networks has been extended towards
deep architectures, opening new research directions to the design of effective
yet extremely efficient deep learning models in vectorial as well as in more
complex data domains. This chapter surveys all the major aspects regarding the
design and analysis of Randomized Neural Networks, and some of the key results
with respect to their approximation capabilities. In particular, we first
introduce the fundamentals of randomized neural models in the context of
feed-forward networks (i.e., Random Vector Functional Link and equivalent
models) and convolutional filters, before moving to the case of recurrent
systems (i.e., Reservoir Computing networks). For both, we focus specifically
on recent results in the domain of deep randomized systems, and (for recurrent
models) their application to structured domains.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24797?af=R">Ethanol modulation of cerebellar neuroinflammation in a postnatal mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders</a></h4>

Postnatal exposure to ethanol resulted in pro‐inflammatory molecule expression in mouse cerebellum that persisted for several days suggesting that anti‐inflammatory agents may be effective in treating infants with FASD. Cerebellar microglial ramification and novel immune molecules were differentially regulated by ethanol. We demonstrate novel mechanisms for ethanol modulation of neuroinflammation.

Abstract
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are alarmingly common, result in significant personal and societal loss, and there is no effective treatment for these disorders. Cerebellar neuropathology is common in FASD and causes aberrant cognitive and motor function. Ethanol‐induced neuroinflammation is believed to contribute to neuropathological sequelae of FASD, and was previously demonstrated in the cerebellum in animal models of FASD. We now demonstrate neuroinflammation persists in the cerebellum several days following cessation of ethanol treatment in an early postnatal mouse model, with meaningful implications for timing of therapeutic intervention in FASD. We also demonstrate by Sholl analysis that ethanol decreases ramification of microglia cell processes in cells located near the Purkinje cell layer but not those near the external granule cell layer. Ethanol did not alter the expression of anti‐inflammatory molecules or molecules that constitute NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Interestingly, ethanol decreased the expression of IL‐23a (P19) and IL‐12Rβ1 suggesting that ethanol may suppress IL‐12 and IL‐23 signaling. Fractalkine‐fractalkine receptor (CX3CL1‐CX3CR1) signaling is believed to suppress microglial activation and our demonstration that ethanol decreases CX3CL1 expression suggests that ethanol modulation of CX3CL1‐CX3CR1 signaling may contribute to cerebellar neuroinflammation and neuropathology. We demonstrate ethanol alters the expression of specific molecules in the cerebellum understudied in FASD, but crucial for immune responses. Ethanol increases the expression of NOX‐2 and NGP and decreases the expression of RAG1, NOS1, CD59a, S1PR5, PTPN22, GPR37, and Serpinb1b. These molecules represent a new horizon as potential targets for development of FASD therapy.

<p>Axonal varicosities are enlarged, heterogeneous structures along axonal shafts, profoundly affecting axonal conduction and synaptic transmission. They represent a key pathological feature believed to develop via slow accumulation of axonal damage that occurs during irreversible degeneration, for example in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Here this review first discusses recent in vitro results showing that axonal varicosities can be rapidly and reversibly induced by mechanical stress in cultured primary neurons from the central nervous system (CNS). This notion is further supported by in vivo studies revealing the induction of axonal varicosities across various brain regions in different mTBI mouse models, as a prominent feature of axonal pathology. Limited progress in understanding intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms of axonal varicosity induction and development is further highlighted. Rapid and reversible formation of axonal varicosities likely plays a key role in CNS neuron mechanosensation and is a new form of neural plasticity. Future investigation in this emerging research field may reveal how to reverse axonal injury, contributing to the development of new strategies for treating brain injuries and related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Depression is a common mental disorder that presents a considerable challenge for public health. The natural product geniposide has neuroprotective effects on depression, but the underlying mechanism behind these effects had remained undefined. The present study was designed to investigate the role of microRNAs (miRs) in this mechanism. It studied mice with depression-like behavior established by exposure to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 2 months. The CUMS mice were intragastrically fed with geniposide at a dose of 10 ml/kg daily for two consecutive weeks. We monitored the depression-like behaviors of the CUMS mice by the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Then, we measured the cerebral expression of miR-298-5p and NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) mRNA in the CUMS mice by the RT-qPCR. The targeting relationship between miR-298-5p and Nox1 was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by the CellTiter-Glo<sup>®</sup> and flow cytometry, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was detected using JC-1 staining. Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β) was determined by ELISA, RT-qPCR, and western blot analysis. We found that miR-298-5p was poorly-expressed while Nox1 was highly-expressed in the brain tissues of the CUMS-induced mice. Intriguingly, Geniposide treatment reversed the behavioral abnormalities of CUMS mice, including shortened immobility time. Geniposide inhibited the Nox1 expression by increasing miR-298-5p levels. There were increased ATP content and MMP and reduced contents of ROS and inflammatory cytokines in the CUMS mice receiving geniposide treatment. Hence, this study revealed an antidepressant effect of geniposide on CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice by down-regulating the miR-298-5p-targeted Nox1. This highlights a novel candidate target for the treatment of depression.</p>

<p>Due to a large number of potential applications, a good deal of effort has been recently made toward creating machine learning models that can recognize evoked emotions from one's physiological recordings. In particular, researchers are investigating the use of EEG as a low-cost, non-invasive method. However, the poor homogeneity of the EEG activity across participants hinders the implementation of such a system by a time-consuming calibration stage. In this study, we introduce a new participant-based feature normalization method, named stratified normalization, for training deep neural networks in the task of cross-subject emotion classification from EEG signals. The new method is able to subtract inter-participant variability while maintaining the emotion information in the data. We carried out our analysis on the SEED dataset, which contains 62-channel EEG recordings collected from 15 participants watching film clips. Results demonstrate that networks trained with stratified normalization significantly outperformed standard training with batch normalization. In addition, the highest model performance was achieved when extracting EEG features with the multitaper method, reaching a classification accuracy of 91.6% for two emotion categories (positive and negative) and 79.6% for three (also neutral). This analysis provides us with great insight into the potential benefits that stratified normalization can have when developing any cross-subject model based on EEG.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by progressively debilitating dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and the striatum, along with various metabolic dysfunctions and molecular abnormalities. Metabolomics is an emerging study and has been demonstrated to play important roles in describing complex human diseases by integrating endogenous and exogenous sources of alterations. Recently, an increasing amount of research has shown that metabolomics profiling holds great promise in providing unique insights into molecular pathogenesis and could be helpful in identifying candidate biomarkers for clinical detection and therapies of PD. In this review, we briefly summarize recent findings and analyze the application of molecular metabolomics in familial and sporadic PD from genetic mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysbacteriosis. We also review metabolic biomarkers to assess the functional stage and improve therapeutic strategies to postpone or hinder the disease progression.</p>

Introduction<p>S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) is also known as macrophage-related protein 8, which is involved in various pathological processes in the central nervous system post-traumatic brain injury (TBI), and plays a critical role in inducing inflammatory cytokines. Accumulating evidences have indicated that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is considered to be involved in inflammatory responses post TBI. The present study was designed to analyze the hypothesis that S100A8 is the key molecule that induces inflammation via TLR4 in TBI.</p>Methods<p>The weight-drop TBI model was used and randomly implemented on mice that were categorized into six groups: Sham, NS, S100A8, S100A8+TAK-242, TBI, and TBI+TAK-242 groups. In the S100A8+TAK-242 and TBI+TAK-242 groups, at half an hour prior to the intracerebroventricular administration of S100A8 or TBI, mice were intraperitoneally treated with TAK-242 that acts as a selective antagonist and inhibitor of TLR4. Furthermore, the protein recombinant of S100A8 was injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain of mice in the S100A8 and S100A8+TAK-242 groups. Sterile normal saline was injected into the lateral ventricle in the NS group. To evaluate the association between S100A8 and TLR4, Western blot, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Nissl staining were employed. Simultaneously, the neurological score and brain water content were assessed. In the in vitro analysis, BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide LPS or S100A8 recombinant protein, with or without TAK-242. The expression of the related proteins was subsequently detected by Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>Results<p>The levels of S100A8 protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated after TBI. There was a reduction in the neurological scores of non-TBI animals with remarkable severe brain edema after the intracerebroventricular administration of S100A8. Furthermore, the TLR4, p-p65, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) levels were elevated after the administration of S100A8 or TBI, which could be restored by TAK-242. Meanwhile, in the in vitro analysis, due to the stimulation of S100A8 or LPS, there was an upregulation of p-p65 and MyD88, which could also be suppressed by TAK-242.</p>Conclusion<p>The present study demonstrated that the TLR4-MyD88 pathway was activated by S100A8, which is essential for the development of inflammation in the brain after TBI.</p>

<p>The aging brain seems to be characterized by neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline and progressively worsening symptoms related to neurodegeneration. Also, pro-inflammatory states, if prolonged, may increase neuronal vulnerability via excessive activation of microglia and their pro-inflammatory by-products, which is seen as individuals increase in age. Consequently, microglial activity is tightly regulated by neuron-microglia communications. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is emerging as a regulator of microglia and the neuronal-microglia communication system. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor signaling on GABAergic interneurons plays a crucial role in regulating microglial activity. Interestingly, if endocannabinoid signaling on GABAergic neurons are disturbed, the phenotypes mimic central nervous system insult models by activating microglia and leading to accelerated brain aging. Investigating the endocannabinoid receptors, ligands, and genetic deletions yields the potential to understand the communication system and mechanism by which the ECS regulates glial cells and aspects of aging. While there remains much to discover with the ECS, the information gathered and identified already could lead to the development of cell-specific therapeutic interventions that help in reducing the effects of age-related pro-inflammatory states and neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>The question of what determines brain laterality for auditory cognitive processing is unresolved. Here, we demonstrate a swap of hemisphere dominance from right to left during semantic interpretation of Chinese lexical tones in native speakers using simultaneously recorded mismatch negativity response and behavioral reaction time during dichotic listening judgment. The mismatch negativity, which is a brain wave response and indexes auditory processing at an early stage, indicated right hemisphere dominance. In contrast, the behavioral reaction time, which reflects auditory processing at a later stage, indicated a right ear listening advantage, or left hemisphere dominance. The observed swap of hemisphere dominance would not occur when the lexical tone was substituted with a meaningless pure tone. This swap reveals dependence of hemisphere labor division initially on acoustic and then on functional cues of auditory inputs in the processing from sound to meaning.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is related to a variety of cognitive impairments that may even progress to dementia. Studies have found the angular gyrus (AG) is a cross-modal integration hub that is involved in a variety of cognitive processes. However, few studies have focused on the patterns of resting-state functional connections (rsFCs) of the AG in patients with T2DM. This study explored the functional connection (FC) between the AG and the whole brain and the relationship between the FC and clinical/cognitive variables in patients with T2DM. 44 patients with T2DM and 43 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI and received neuropsychological assessments. Compared with the control group, the T2DM group showed abnormal rsFCs between the AG and multiple brain regions. The FC between the left AG and the left medial temporal lobe in the T2DM group was positively correlated with scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, after a Bonferroni correction (r = 0.40, P = 0.009). Collectively, patients with T2DM have abnormal FCs between the AG and extensive brain regions that may be related to various cognitive processes.</p>

<p>This exploratory study assessed the use of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine hemodynamic response patterns during sentence processing. Four groups of participants: monolingual English children, bilingual Chinese-English children, bilingual Chinese-English adults and monolingual English adults were given an agent selection syntactic processing task. Bilingual child participants were classified as simultaneous or sequential bilinguals to examine the impact of first language, age of second-language acquisition (AoL2A), and the length of second language experience on behavioral performance and cortical activation. Participants were asked to select the agent of four types of sentences: subject-verb-object (SVO), passive (PAS), subject-extracted relative clause (SR), and object-extracted relative clause (OR) adopted from the “Whatdunit” task by Montgomery et al. (2016). Semantic cues were removed by using inanimate nouns for agents and patients, which constrained participants to make decisions based on syntactic knowledge. Behavioral results showed greater accuracy for canonical SVO and SR sentence types than for noncanonical OR and PAS sentence types, which aligns with prior studies. Neuroimaging results revealed greater hemodynamic responses to relative clauses (i.e., SR and OR sentences) than to simple sentences (SVO and PAS), especially for Chinese-English bilinguals suggesting first-language transfer influencing sentence processing in English. The effects AoL2A and the length of second language experience showed no significant differences between simultaneous and sequential bilinguals or between bilingual adults and children for identifying the correct agent in each sentence. However, neuroimaging results demonstrated greater hemodynamic responses in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in simultaneous bilinguals compared to sequential bilinguals and greater hemodynamic responses in left and right DLPFC and left IPL among bilingual adults. Different behavioral and neural hemodynamic response patterns afford new insights into the effects of syntactic knowledge on sentence processing.</p>

<p>Recording and manipulating neuronal ensemble activity is a key requirement in advanced neuromodulatory and behavior studies. Devices capable of both recording and manipulating neuronal activity brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) should ideally operate un-tethered and allow chronic longitudinal manipulations in the freely moving animal. In this study, we designed a new intracortical BCI feasible of telemetric recording and stimulating local gray and white matter of visual neural circuit after irradiation exposure. To increase the translational reliance, we put forward a Göttingen minipig model. The animal was stereotactically irradiated at the level of the visual cortex upon defining the target by a fused cerebral MRI and CT scan. A fully implantable neural telemetry system consisting of a 64 channel intracortical multielectrode array, a telemetry capsule, and an inductive rechargeable battery was then implanted into the visual cortex to record and manipulate local field potentials, and multi-unit activity. We achieved a 3-month stability of the functionality of the un-tethered BCI in terms of telemetric radio-communication, inductive battery charging, and device biocompatibility for 3 months. Finally, we could reliably record the local signature of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activity in the visual cortex with high bandwidth without complications. The ability to wireless induction charging combined with the entirely implantable design, the rather high recording bandwidth, and the ability to record and stimulate simultaneously put forward a wireless BCI capable of long-term un-tethered real-time communication for causal preclinical circuit-based closed-loop interventions.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate the differences between patients returning to work and those who did not after brain tumor surgery.</p><p>Methods: Patients were evaluated before surgery and after 3 months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, Trail-Making Test (parts A and B), 15-word Rey–Osterrieth Word List (immediate and delayed recall), F-A-S tests, and Karnosfky Performance Status were used to assess cognitive status, attention, executive functions, memory, word fluency, and functional status. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to evaluate emotional distress and disability were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Clinical and work-related variables, PROMs, and cognitive tests were compared using chi-squared, t-test or Mann–Whitney U test.</p><p>Results: Sixty patients were included. Patients returning to work were 61.3 and 31.0% among people with meningioma and glioma, respectively. They reported lower postoperative disability and lesser home-to-work travel time. Patients with meningioma also showed better preoperative and postoperative attention and executive functions, better postoperative functional and cognitive status, and lower frequency of treatments.</p><p>Conclusions: These variables should be considered in a clinical context to plan interventions for people who need support during return to work and in future research to investigate preoperative and postoperative predictive factors of going back to work.</p>

<p>The ability to learn sequential contingencies of actions for predicting future outcomes is indispensable for flexible behavior in many daily decision-making contexts. It remains open whether such ability may be enhanced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The present study combined tDCS with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate potential tDCS-induced effects on sequential decision-making and the neural mechanisms underlying such modulations. Offline tDCS and sham stimulation were applied over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in young male adults (N = 29, mean age = 23.4 years, SD = 3.2) in a double-blind between-subject design using a three-state Markov decision task. The results showed (i) an enhanced dlPFC hemodynamic response during the acquisition of sequential state transitions that is consistent with the findings from a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study; (ii) a tDCS-induced increase of the hemodynamic response in the dlPFC, but without accompanying performance-enhancing effects at the behavioral level; and (iii) a greater tDCS-induced upregulation of hemodynamic responses in the delayed reward condition that seems to be associated with faster decision speed. Taken together, these findings provide empirical evidence for fNIRS as a suitable method for investigating hemodynamic correlates of sequential decision-making as well as functional brain correlates underlying tDCS-induced modulation. Future research with larger sample sizes for carrying out subgroup analysis is necessary in order to decipher interindividual differences in tDCS-induced effects on sequential decision-making process at the behavioral and brain levels.</p>

<p>Cognitive control and decision-making rely on the interplay of medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (mPFC/lPFC), particularly for circumstances in which correct behavior requires integrating and selecting among multiple sources of interrelated information. While the interaction between mPFC and lPFC is generally acknowledged as a crucial circuit in adaptive behavior, the nature of this interaction remains open to debate, with various proposals suggesting complementary roles in (i) signaling the need for and implementing control, (ii) identifying and selecting appropriate behavioral policies from a candidate set, and (iii) constructing behavioral schemata for performance of structured tasks. Although these proposed roles capture salient aspects of conjoint mPFC/lPFC function, none are sufficiently well-specified to provide a detailed account of the continuous interaction of the two regions during ongoing behavior. A recent computational model of mPFC and lPFC, the Hierarchical Error Representation (HER) model, places the regions within the framework of hierarchical predictive coding, and suggests how they interact during behavioral periods preceding and following salient events. In this manuscript, we extend the HER model to incorporate real-time temporal dynamics and demonstrate how the extended model is able to capture single-unit neurophysiological, behavioral, and network effects previously reported in the literature. Our results add to the wide range of results that can be accounted for by the HER model, and provide further evidence for predictive coding as a unifying framework for understanding PFC function and organization.</p>

<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a vision-threatening, chronic, and challenging eye disease in the diabetic population. Despite recent advancements in the clinical management of diabetes, DR remains the major cause of blindness in working-age adults. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of DR development will aid in identifying therapeutic targets. Emerging pieces of evidence from recent research in the field of ER stress have demonstrated a close association between unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated cellular activities and DR development. In this minireview article, we shall provide an emerging understating of how UPR influences DR pathogenesis at the cellular level.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that gestational inflammation accelerates age-related memory impairment in mother mice. An enriched environment (EE) can improve age-related memory impairment, whereas mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain aging. However, it is unclear whether an EE can counteract the accelerated age-related memory impairment induced by gestational inflammation and whether this process is associated with the disruption of mitochondrial quality control (MQC) processes. In this study, CD-1 mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or normal saline (CON group) during gestational days 15–17 and were separated from their offspring at the end of normal lactation. The mothers that received LPS were divided into LPS group and LPS plus EE (LPS-E) treatment groups based on whether the mice were exposed to an EE until the end of the experiment. At 6 and 18 months of age, the Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory abilities. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to measure the messenber RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of MQC-related genes in the hippocampus, respectively. The results showed that all the aged (18 months old) mice underwent a striking decline in spatial learning and memory performances and decreased mRNA/protein levels related to mitochondrial dynamics (Mfn1/Mfn2, OPA1, and Drp1), biogenesis (PGC-1α), and mitophagy (PINK1/parkin) in the hippocampi compared with the young (6 months old) mice. LPS treatment exacerbated the decline in age-related spatial learning and memory and enhanced the reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of MQC-related genes but increased the levels of PGC-1α in young mice. Exposure to an EE could alleviate the accelerated decline in age-related spatial learning and memory abilities and the accelerated changes in MQC-related mRNA or protein levels resulting from LPS treatment, especially in aged mice. In conclusion, long-term exposure to an EE can counteract the accelerated age-related spatial cognition impairment modulated by MQC in CD-1 mother mice that experience inflammation during pregnancy.</p>

<p>The torus longitudinalis (TL) is a midbrain structure unique to ray finned fish. Although previously implicated in orienting behaviors elicited by changes in ambient lighting, the role of TL in visual processing is not well-understood. TL is reciprocally connected to tectum and is the only known source of synaptic input to the stratum marginalis (SM) layer of tectal neuropil. Conversely, tectal pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) are the only identified tectal neuron population that forms a dendrite in SM. In this study we describe a zebrafish gal4 transgenic that labels TL neurons that project to SM. We demonstrate that the axonal TL projection to SM in zebrafish is glutamatergic. Consistent with these axons synapsing directly onto PyrNs, SM-targeted dendrites of PyrNs contain punctate enrichments of the glutamatergic post-synaptic marker protein PSD95. Sparse genetic labeling of individual TL axons and PyrN dendrites enabled quantitative morphometric analysis that revealed (1) large, sparsely branched TL axons in SM and (2) small, densely innervated PyrN dendrites in SM. Together this unique combination of morphologies support a wiring diagram in which TL inputs to PyrNs exhibit a high degree of convergence. We propose that this convergence functions to generate large, compound visual receptive fields in PyrNs. This quantitative anatomical data will instruct future functional studies aimed at identifying the precise contribution of TL-PyrN circuitry to visual behavior.</p>

<p>Purpose: To investigate the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and static parameters of graph theory in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and the associations of DFC and topological properties with cognitive performance.</p><p>Methods: Thirty-three control subjects and 32 SCD individuals were enrolled in this study, and neuropsychological evaluations and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning were performed. Thirty-three components were selected by group independent component analysis to construct 7 functional networks. Based on the sliding window approach and k-means clustering, distinct DFC states were identified. We calculated the temporal properties of fractional windows in each state, the mean dwell time in each state, and the number of transitions between each pair of DFC states. The global and local static parameters were assessed by graph theory analysis. The differences in DFC and topological metrics, and the associations of the altered neuroimaging measures with cognitive performance were assessed.</p><p>Results: The whole cohort demonstrated 4 distinct connectivity states. Compared to the control group, the SCD group showed increased fractional windows and an increased mean dwell time in state 4, characterized by hypoconnectivity both within and between networks. The SCD group also showed decreased fractional windows and a decreased mean dwell time in state 2, dominated by hyperconnectivity within and between the auditory, visual and somatomotor networks. The number of transitions between state 1 and state 2, between state 2 and state 3, and between state 2 and state 4 was significantly reduced in the SCD group compared to the control group. No significant differences in global or local topological metrics were observed. The altered DFC properties showed significant correlations with cognitive performance.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings indicated DFC network reconfiguration in the SCD stage, which may underlie the early cognitive decline in SCD subjects and serve as sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers for the preclinical detection of individuals with incipient Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating form of stroke, which poses a series of intractable challenges to clinical practice. Imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis has been thought to be the crucial pathomechanism in early brain injury (EBI) cascade after SAH. Irisin, a protein related to metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis, has been reported to play pivotal roles in post-stroke neuroprotection. However, whether this myokine can exert neuroprotection effects after SAH remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the protective effects of irisin and the underlying mechanisms related to mitochondrial biogenesis in a SAH animal model. Endovascular perforation was used to induce SAH, and recombinant irisin was administered intracerebroventricularly. Neurobehavioral assessments, TdT-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, immunofluorescence, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed for post-SAH assessments. We demonstrated that irisin treatment improved neurobehavioral scores, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and alleviated oxidative stress in EBI after SAH. More importantly, the administration of exogenous irisin conserved the mitochondrial morphology and promoted mitochondrial biogenesis. The protective effects of irisin were partially reversed by the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) inhibitor. Taken together, irisin may have neuroprotective effects against SAH via improving the mitochondrial biogenesis, at least in part, through UCP-2 related targets.</p>

<p>The cerebral cortex is a highly convoluted structure with distinct morphologic features, namely the gyri and sulci, which are associated with the functional segregation or integration in the human brain. During the lifespan, the brain atrophy that is accompanied by cognitive decline is a well-accepted aging phenotype. However, the detailed patterns of cortical folding change during aging, especially the changing age-dependencies of gyri and sulci, which is essential to brain functioning, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the morphology of the gyral and sulcal regions from pial and white matter surfaces using MR imaging data of 417 healthy participants across adulthood to old age (21–92 years). To elucidate the age-related changes in the cortical pattern, we fitted cortical thickness and intrinsic curvature of gyri and sulci using the quadratic model to evaluate their age-dependencies during normal aging. Our findings show that comparing to gyri, the sulcal thinning is the most prominent pattern during the aging process, and the gyrification of pial and white matter surfaces were also affected differently, which implies the vulnerability of functional segregation during aging. Taken together, we propose a morphological model of aging that may provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying gray matter degeneration.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by an excessive inflammatory response and impaired memory retrieval, including spatial memory, recognition memory, and emotional memory. Acquisition and retrieval of fear memory help one avoid dangers and natural threats. Thus, it is crucial for survival. AD patients with impaired retrieval of fear memory are vulnerable to dangerous conditions. Excessive expression of inflammatory markers is known to impede synaptic transmission and reduce the efficiency of memory retrieval. In wild-type mice, reducing inflammation response can improve fear memory retrieval; however, this effect of this approach is not yet investigated in 3xTg-AD model mice. To date, no satisfactory drug or treatment can attenuate the symptoms of AD despite numerous efforts. In the past few years, the direction of therapeutic drug development for AD has been shifted to natural compounds with anti-inflammatory effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that the compound 4-(phenylsulfanyl) butan-2-one (4-PSB-2) is effective in enhancing fear memory retrieval of wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice by reducing the expression of TNF-α, COX-2, and iNOS. We also found that 4-PSB-2 helps increase dendritic spine density, postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression, and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Our study indicates that 4-PSB-2 may be developed as a promising therapeutic compound for treating fear memory impairment of AD patients.</p>

<p>Accurate detection of the regions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions is critical for early intervention to effectively slow down the progression of the disease. Although gray matter volumetric abnormalities are commonly detected in patients with mild cognition impairment (MCI) and patients with AD, the gray matter surface-based deterioration pattern associated with the progression of the disease from MCI to AD stages is largely unknown. To identify group differences in gray matter surface morphometry, including cortical thickness, the gyrification index (GI), and the sulcus depth, 80 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were split into healthy controls (HCs; N = 20), early MCIs (EMCI; N = 20), late MCIs (LMCI; N = 20), and ADs (N = 20). Regions-of-interest (ROI)-based surface morphometry was subsequently studied and compared across the four stage groups to characterize the gray matter deterioration during AD progression. Co-alteration patterns (Spearman's correlation coefficient) across the whole brain were also examined. Results showed that patients with MCI and AD exhibited a significant reduction in cortical thickness (p &lt; 0.001) mainly in the cingulate region (four subregions) and in the temporal (thirteen subregions), parietal (five subregions), and frontal (six subregions) lobes compared to HCs. The sulcus depth of the eight temporal, four frontal, four occipital, and eight parietal subregions were also significantly affected (p &lt; 0.001) by the progression of AD. The GI was shown to be insensitive to AD progression (only three subregions were detected with a significant difference, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis confirmed that the co-alteration pattern of the cortical thickness and sulcus depth indices is predominant during AD progression. The findings highlight the relevance between gray matter surface morphometry and the stages of AD, laying the foundation for in vivo tracking of AD progression. The co-alteration pattern of surface-based morphometry would improve the researchers' knowledge of the underlying pathologic mechanisms in AD.</p>

Background<p>Cerebral metabolites are associated with different physiological processes in brain aging. Cortical and limbic structures play important roles in cognitive aging; however, the relationship between these structures and age remains unclear with respect to physiological underpinnings. Regional differences in metabolite levels may be related to different structural and cognitive changes in aging.</p>Methods<p>Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy were obtained from 117 cognitively healthy older adults. Limbic and other key structural volumes were measured. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline-containing compounds (Cho) were measured in frontal and parietal regions. Neuropsychological testing was performed including measures of crystallized and fluid intelligence and memory.</p>Results<p>NAA in the frontal voxel was associated with limbic and cortical volumes, whereas Cho in parietal cortex was negatively associated with hippocampal and other regional volumes. Hippocampal volume was associated with forgetting, independent of age. Further, parietal Cho and hippocampal volume contributed independent variance to age corrected discrepancy between fluid and crystallized abilities.</p>Conclusion<p>These findings suggest that physiological changes with age in the frontal and parietal cortices may be linked to structural changes in other connected brain regions. These changes are differentially associated with cognitive performance, suggesting potentially divergent mechanisms.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65878"><i>Drosophila</i> uses a tripod gait across all walking speeds, and the geometry of the tripod is important for speed control</a></h4>

Changes in walking speed are characterized by changes in both the animal's gait and the mechanics of its interaction with the ground. Here we study these changes in walking <i>Drosophila</i>. We measured the fly's center of mass (CoM) movement with high spatial resolution and the position of its footprints. Flies predominantly employ a modified tripod gait that only changes marginally with speed. The mechanics of a tripod gait can be approximated with a simple model – angular and radial spring-loaded inverted pendulum (ARSLIP) – which is characterized by two springs of an effective leg that become stiffer as the speed increases. Surprisingly, the change in the stiffness of the spring is mediated by the change in tripod shape rather than a change in stiffness of the individual leg. The effect of tripod shape on mechanics can also explain the large variation in kinematics among insects, and ARSLIP can model these variations.

The ventrolateral frontal lobe (Broca's area) of the human brain is crucial in speech production. In macaques, neurons in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the suggested monkey homologue of Broca's area, signal the volitional initiation of vocalizations. We explored whether this brain area became specialized for vocal initiation during primate evolution and trained macaques to alternate between a vocal and manual action in response to arbitrary cues. During task performance, single neurons recorded from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the rostroventral premotor cortex of the inferior frontal cortex predominantly signaled the impending vocal or, to a lesser extent, manual action, but not both. Neuronal activity was specific for volitional action plans and differed during spontaneous movement preparations. This implies that the primate inferior frontal cortex controls the initiation of volitional utterances via a dedicated network of vocal selective neurons that might have been exploited during the evolution of Broca’s area.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60969">Tripartite suppression of fission yeast TORC1 signaling by the GATOR1-Sea3 complex, the TSC complex, and Gcn2 kinase</a></h4>

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is controlled by the GATOR complex composed of the GATOR1 subcomplex and its inhibitor, the GATOR2 subcomplex, sensitive to amino acid starvation. Previously, we identified fission yeast GATOR1 that prevents deregulated activation of TORC1 (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib9">Chia et al., 2017</a>). Here, we report identification and characterization of GATOR2 in fission yeast. Unexpectedly, the GATOR2 subunit Sea3, an ortholog of mammalian WDR59, is physically and functionally proximal to GATOR1, rather than GATOR2, attenuating TORC1 activity. The fission yeast GATOR complex is dispensable for TORC1 regulation in response to amino acid starvation, which instead activates the Gcn2 pathway to inhibit TORC1 and induce autophagy. On the other hand, nitrogen starvation suppresses TORC1 through the combined actions of the GATOR1-Sea3 complex, the Gcn2 pathway, and the TSC complex, another conserved TORC1 inhibitor. Thus, multiple, parallel signaling pathways implement negative regulation of TORC1 to ensure proper cellular starvation responses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54792">Gut <i>Helicobacter</i> presentation by multiple dendritic cell subsets enables context-specific regulatory T cell generation</a></h4>

Generation of tolerogenic peripheral regulatory T (pTreg) cells is commonly thought to involve CD103<sup>+</sup> gut dendritic cells (DCs), yet their role in commensal-reactive pTreg development is unclear. Using two <i>Helicobacter-</i>specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse lines, we found that both CD103<sup>+</sup> and CD103<sup>–</sup> migratory, but not resident, DCs from the colon-draining mesenteric lymph node presented <i>Helicobacter </i>antigens to T cells <i>ex vivo</i>. Loss of most CD103<sup>+</sup> migratory DCs <i>in vivo </i>using murine genetic models did not affect the frequency of <i>Helicobacter</i>-specific pTreg cell generation or induce compensatory tolerogenic changes in the remaining CD103<sup>–</sup> DCs. By contrast, activation in a Th1-promoting niche <i>in vivo</i> blocked <i>Helicobacter</i>-specific pTreg generation. Thus, these data suggest a model where DC-mediated effector T cell differentiation is 'dominant', necessitating that all DC subsets presenting antigen are permissive for pTreg cell induction to maintain gut tolerance.

<p>by Benjamin Allen, Christine Sample, Patricia Steinhagen, Julia Shapiro, Matthew King, Timothy Hedspeth, Megan Goncalves</p>

A population’s spatial structure affects the rate of genetic change and the outcome of natural selection. These effects can be modeled mathematically using the Birth-death process on graphs. Individuals occupy the vertices of a weighted graph, and reproduce into neighboring vertices based on fitness. A key quantity is the probability that a mutant type will sweep to fixation, as a function of the mutant’s fitness. Graphs that increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutations, and decrease that of deleterious mutations, are said to amplify selection. However, fixation probabilities are difficult to compute for an arbitrary graph. Here we derive an expression for the fixation probability, of a weakly-selected mutation, in terms of the time for two lineages to coalesce. This expression enables weak-selection fixation probabilities to be computed, for an arbitrary weighted graph, in polynomial time. Applying this method, we explore the range of possible effects of graph structure on natural selection, genetic drift, and the balance between the two. Using exhaustive analysis of small graphs and a genetic search algorithm, we identify families of graphs with striking effects on fixation probability, and we analyze these families mathematically. Our work reveals the nuanced effects of graph structure on natural selection and neutral drift. In particular, we show how these notions depend critically on the process by which mutations arise.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/44-W4ntRh6c" width="1" />

<p>by Yiran Huang, Yusi Xie, Cheng Zhong, Fengfeng Zhou</p>

Finding non-standard or new metabolic pathways has important applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and the analysis and reconstruction of metabolic networks. Branched metabolic pathways dominate in metabolic networks and depict a more comprehensive picture of metabolism compared to linear pathways. Although progress has been developed to find branched metabolic pathways, few efforts have been made in identifying branched metabolic pathways via atom group tracking. In this paper, we present a pathfinding method called BPFinder for finding branched metabolic pathways by atom group tracking, which aims to guide the synthetic design of metabolic pathways. BPFinder enumerates linear metabolic pathways by tracking the movements of atom groups in metabolic network and merges the linear atom group conserving pathways into branched pathways. Two merging rules based on the structure of conserved atom groups are proposed to accurately merge the branched compounds of linear pathways to identify branched pathways. Furthermore, the integrated information of compound similarity, thermodynamic feasibility and conserved atom groups is also used to rank the pathfinding results for feasible branched pathways. Experimental results show that BPFinder is more capable of recovering known branched metabolic pathways as compared to other existing methods, and is able to return biologically relevant branched pathways and discover alternative branched pathways of biochemical interest. The online server of BPFinder is available at http://114.215.129.245:8080/atomic/.

The availability of bacterial transcriptomes has dramatically increased in recent years. This data deluge could result in detailed inference of underlying regulatory networks, but the diversity of experimental platforms and protocols introduces critical biases that could hinder scalable analysis of existing data. Here, we show that the underlying structure of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> transcriptome, as determined by Independent Component Analysis (ICA), is conserved across multiple independent datasets, including both RNA-seq and microarray datasets. We subsequently combined five transcriptomics datasets into a large compendium containing over 800 expression profiles and discovered that its underlying ICA-based structure was still comparable to that of the individual datasets. With this understanding, we expanded our analysis to over 3,000 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> expression profiles and predicted three high-impact regulons that respond to oxidative stress, anaerobiosis, and antibiotic treatment. ICA thus enables deep analysis of disparate data to uncover new insights that were not visible in the individual datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EcNJqX3LQOQ" width="1" />

<p>by Jordan Douglas, Rong Zhang, Remco Bouckaert</p>

Relaxed clock models enable estimation of molecular substitution rates across lineages and are widely used in phylogenetics for dating evolutionary divergence times. Under the (uncorrelated) relaxed clock model, tree branches are associated with molecular substitution rates which are independently and identically distributed. In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments. The results are available via the open source optimised relaxed clock (ORC) package for BEAST 2 under a GNU licence (https://github.com/jordandouglas/ORC).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f31NdELZDlI" width="1" />

<p>by Sam Gijsen, Miro Grundei, Robert T. Lange, Dirk Ostwald, Felix Blankenburg</p>

Tracking statistical regularities of the environment is important for shaping human behavior and perception. Evidence suggests that the brain learns environmental dependencies using Bayesian principles. However, much remains unknown about the employed algorithms, for somesthesis in particular. Here, we describe the cortical dynamics of the somatosensory learning system to investigate both the form of the generative model as well as its neural surprise signatures. Specifically, we recorded EEG data from 40 participants subjected to a somatosensory roving-stimulus paradigm and performed single-trial modeling across peri-stimulus time in both sensor and source space. Our Bayesian model selection procedure indicates that evoked potentials are best described by a non-hierarchical learning model that tracks transitions between observations using leaky integration. From around 70ms post-stimulus onset, secondary somatosensory cortices are found to represent confidence-corrected surprise as a measure of model inadequacy. Indications of Bayesian surprise encoding, reflecting model updating, are found in primary somatosensory cortex from around 140ms. This dissociation is compatible with the idea that early surprise signals may control subsequent model update rates. In sum, our findings support the hypothesis that early somatosensory processing reflects Bayesian perceptual learning and contribute to an understanding of its precise mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O3XzADZGdIk" width="1" />

Evolutionarily conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) usually have high copy numbers in the genome. The redundant and specific roles of each member of a multimember miRNA gene family are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the miR156-SPL-miR172 axis constitutes a signaling cascade in regulating plant developmental transitions. Here, we report the feasibility and utility of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to investigate the functions of all 5 <i>MIR172</i> family members in Arabidopsis. We show that an Arabidopsis plant devoid of miR172 is viable, although it displays pleiotropic morphological defects. <i>MIR172</i> family members exhibit distinct expression pattern and exert functional specificity in regulating meristem size, trichome initiation, stem elongation, shoot branching, and floral competence. In particular, we find that the miR156-SPL-miR172 cascade is bifurcated into specific flowering responses by matching pairs of coexpressed <i>SPL</i> and <i>MIR172</i> genes in different tissues. Our results thus highlight the spatiotemporal changes in gene expression that underlie evolutionary novelties of a miRNA gene family in nature. The expansion of <i>MIR172</i> genes in the Arabidopsis genome provides molecular substrates for the integration of diverse floral inductive cues, which ensures that plants flower at the optimal time to maximize seed yields.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Tg40oSdlBOo" width="1" />

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating flowering and reproduction of angiosperms. Mature miRNAs are encoded by multiple <i>MIRNA</i> genes that can differ in their spatiotemporal activities and their contributions to gene regulatory networks, but the functions of individual <i>MIRNA</i> genes are poorly defined. We functionally analyzed the activity of all 5 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MIR172</i> genes, which encode miR172 and promote the floral transition by inhibiting the accumulation of APETALA2 (AP2) and APETALA2-LIKE (AP2-LIKE) transcription factors (TFs). Through genome editing and detailed confocal microscopy, we show that the activity of miR172 at the shoot apex is encoded by 3 <i>MIR172</i> genes, is critical for floral transition of the shoot meristem under noninductive photoperiods, and reduces accumulation of AP2 and TARGET OF EAT2 (TOE2), an AP2-LIKE TF, at the shoot meristem. Utilizing the genetic resources generated here, we show that the promotion of flowering by miR172 is enhanced by the MADS-domain TF FRUITFULL, which may facilitate long-term silencing of <i>AP2-LIKE</i> transcription, and that their activities are partially coordinated by the TF SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING-LIKE PROTEIN 15. Thus, we present a genetic framework for the depletion of AP2 and AP2-LIKE TFs at the shoot apex during floral transition and demonstrate that this plays a central role in floral induction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0b1Xm_ge5bc" width="1" />

Expression patterns of all CRH/UCN family genes have not been thoroughly described in any fish species. In a highly social cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, we used in situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of crhb, uts1, ucn2, and ucn3.

Abstract
The corticotropin‐releasing hormone and urocortin family of peptides consists of five members in many vertebrates: CRH (crha/crhb in teleosts), CRH2, UCN/UTS1, UCN2, and UCN3. These genes differ in expression pattern, as well as receptor affinity, allowing them to serve a wide range of functions in a variety of species. To better understand the roles of these genes in a single species, we examined their expression patterns in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. In situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of crhb, uts1, ucn2, and ucn3 in the brain revealed conserved and distinct spatial features of expression. crhb‐ and uts1‐expressing cells were the most broadly distributed, with several areas of co‐regionalization. ucn3 was less abundant but was found in discrete regions throughout the extent of the brain, with high expression in the cerebellum, while ucn2 was restricted to only a few areas. RT‐PCR showed that while crhb, uts1, and ucn3 are found in several body tissues and widespread throughout the brain, ucn2 is quite restricted in the brain, and crha is only expressed in the eye. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses identified detailed relationships and novel orthologs in the urocortin family. We found evidence for a UCN2 gene loss in some reptiles. Our detailed description of the complete family of genes in the central nervous system of a model organism will inform future studies on the function of these genes in A. burtoni and provides a foundation for comparative studies with teleosts and other vertebrates.

In this work, we describe the association of a novel homozygous VPS11 variant with adult‐onset generalized dystonia, providing a detailed clinical report and biological evidence of disease mechanism. Vps11 is a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which promotes the fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with the lysosome. Functional studies on mutated fibroblasts showed marked lysosomal and autophagic abnormalities, which improved after overexpression of the wild type Vps11 protein. In conclusion, a deleterious VPS11 variant, damaging the autophagic and lysosomal pathways, is the probable genetic cause of a novel form of generalized dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2021

We followed a group of older adults longitudinally (mean interval time of 53 months) and characterized changes in white matter structural brain networks. We found decreases in intra‐hemispheric connections alongside with increases in inter‐hemispheric connections (a) and decrease in connector‐hub inter‐modular connectivity and increase of detected provincial hubs (b).

Abstract
Normal aging is characterized by structural and functional changes in the brain contributing to cognitive decline. Structural connectivity (SC) describes the anatomical backbone linking distinct functional subunits of the brain and disruption of this communication is thought to be one of the potential contributors for the age‐related deterioration observed in cognition. Several studies already explored brain network's reorganization during aging, but most focused on average connectivity of the whole‐brain or in specific networks, such as the resting‐state networks. Here, we aimed to characterize longitudinal changes of white matter (WM) structural brain networks, through the identification of sub‐networks with significantly altered connectivity along time. Then, we tested associations between longitudinal changes in network connectivity and cognition. We also assessed longitudinal changes in topological properties of the networks. For this, older adults were evaluated at two timepoints, with a mean interval time of 52.8 months (SD = 7.24). WM structural networks were derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive status from neurocognitive testing. Our results show age‐related changes in brain SC, characterized by both decreases and increases in connectivity weight. Interestingly, decreases occur in intra‐hemispheric connections formed mainly by association fibers, while increases occur mostly in inter‐hemispheric connections and involve association, commissural, and projection fibers, supporting the last‐in‐first‐out hypothesis. Regarding topology, two hubs were lost, alongside with a decrease in connector‐hub inter‐modular connectivity, reflecting reduced integration. Simultaneously, there was an increase in the number of provincial hubs, suggesting increased segregation. Overall, these results confirm that aging triggers a reorganization of the brain structural network.

Objective
Perinatal intracranial hemorrhage (pICH) is a rare event that occurs during the fetal/neonatal period with potentially devastating neurological outcome. However, the etiology of pICH is frequently hard to depict. We investigated the role of rare genetic variations in unexplained cases of pICH.


Methods
We performed whole‐exome sequencing (WES) in fetuses and term neonates with otherwise unexplained pICH, and their parents. Variant causality was determined according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria, consistency between suggested genes and phenotypes, and mode of inheritance.


Results
Twenty‐six probands (25 families) were included in the study (9 with a prenatal diagnosis and 17 with a postnatal diagnosis). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was the most common type of hemorrhage (n = 16, 62%), followed by subpial (n = 4, 15%), subdural (n = 4, 15%), and parenchymal (n = 2, 8%) hemorrhage. Causative/likely causative variants were found in 4 subjects from 3 of the 25 families (12%) involving genes related to the brain microenvironment (COL4A1, COL4A2, and TREX‐1). Additionally, potentially causative variants were detected in genes related to coagulation (GP1BA, F11, VWF, FGA, F7) (n = 4, 16%). A potential candidate gene for phenotypic expansion related to microtubular function (DNAH5) was identified in one case (4%). Fifty five percent of the variants were inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Overall, these findings showed a monogenic cause for pICH in 12% to 32% of the families.


Interpretation
Our findings reveal a clinically significant diagnostic yield of WES in apparently idiopathic pICH and support the use of WES in the evaluation of these cases.

Objectives
Patients with established Parkinson’s disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood biomarkers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared to controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.


Methods
We examined the relationship between incident PD and baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank, a longitudinal cohort with &gt;500 000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.


Results
After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07‐1.32, padjusted=0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil and monocyte counts and CRP were associated with increased PD risk, as was higher neutrophil count. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count; ORMR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01‐1.18, p=0.02).


Interpretation
We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD.

This study provides data on how sensory inputs from the perineal region interact with sensorimotor circuits that generate locomotor‐like activity and reflexes from the foot in spinal cats. We observed that inputs from the perineal region facilitate spinal locomotor activity and modulate cutaneous reflexes.

Abstract
It is well known that mechanically stimulating the perineal region potently facilitates hindlimb locomotion and weight support in mammals with a spinal transection (spinal mammals). However, how perineal stimulation mediates this excitatory effect is poorly understood. We evaluated the effect of mechanically stimulating (vibration or pinch) the perineal region on ipsilateral (9–14 ms onset) and contralateral (14–18 ms onset) short‐latency cutaneous reflex responses evoked by electrically stimulating the superficial peroneal or distal tibial nerve in seven adult spinal cats where hindlimb movement was restrained. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked before, during, and after mechanical stimulation of the perineal region. We found that vibration or pinch of the perineal region effectively triggered rhythmic activity, ipsilateral and contralateral to nerve stimulation. When electrically stimulating nerves, adding perineal stimulation modulated rhythmic activity by decreasing cycle and burst durations and by increasing the amplitude of flexors and extensors. Perineal stimulation also disrupted the timing of the ipsilateral rhythm, which had been entrained by nerve stimulation. Mechanically stimulating the perineal region decreased ipsilateral and contralateral short‐latency reflex responses evoked by cutaneous inputs, a phenomenon we observed in muscles crossing different joints and located in different limbs. The results suggest that the excitatory effect of perineal stimulation on locomotion and weight support is mediated by increasing the excitability of central pattern‐generating circuitry and not by increasing excitatory inputs from cutaneous afferents of the foot. Our results are consistent with a state‐dependent modulation of reflexes by spinal interneuronal circuits.

<p>Background: A considerable number of competitive antagonists/inverse agonists of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) have progressed to clinical assessment, with pitolisant approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. H3R, highly expressed in the CNS, is regarded as a relevant target in CNS disorders. At the same time, new compounds including ABT-239 H3R antagonist (ABT; benzonitrile, 4-[2-[2-[(2R)-2-methyl-1-pyrrolidinyl]ethyl]-5-benzofuranyl]-) are continually being tested. The study aimed to test ABT-239 as a prophylactic agent in stress-induced memory impairments.</p><p>Methods: Stressed and non-stressed rats were pre-treated with ABT-239 and subsequently subjected to several behavioral tests aimed at assessing the animals’ working and spatial reference memory [Morris water maze (MWM), Barnes maze (BM)], assessing the locomotor function and anxiety-like behavior [Open field (OF), elevated “plus” maze—EPM].</p><p>Results: Chronically stressed rats displayed a significant decline in spatial (working and reference) memory. In the MWM test, we observed an improvement in spatial reference memory in stressed animals and a positive after ABT-239 pre-treatment. In the BM test, the effect of ABT-239 administration on spatial memory changed in successive attempts, from negative initially to favorable in subsequent attempts, and negative in the last trial of the test in the control group of rats. However, a beneficial effect is noted in the group of stressed animals, which remained throughout the entire testing period.</p><p>Conclusions: Presented findings demonstrate that ABT-239 shows the potential to abolish or prevent restraint stress-induced spatial memory impairments and cognitive deficits. However, in conditions of appetitive modulation, it could increase damage to memory (unstressed animals).</p>

<p>Socioeconomic status (SES)-related health disparities persist for numerous chronic diseases, with lower-SES individuals exhibiting greater risk of morbidity and mortality compared to their higher-SES counterparts. One likely contributor is disparities in health messaging efforts, which are currently less effective for motivating health behavior change among those lower in SES. Drawing on communication neuroscience and social neuroscience research, we describe a conceptual framework to improve health messaging effectiveness in lower SES communities. The framework is based on evidence that health-message-induced activity in the ventral striatum (VS) and subdivisions of the medial pre-frontal cortex (MPFC) predicts behavior change. Additionally, we draw from social neuroscience work showing that activity in these regions during valuation and the processing of self-related vs. social information, differs as a function of SES. Bringing together these previously disparate lines of work, we argue that health messages emphasizing the benefits to close others (vs. the self) of engaging in behavior change will be more effective among lower SES individuals. We also outline a research agenda based on our framework. Ultimately, we hope that this framework utilizing a “brain-as-predictor” approach generates novel insights about the neural underpinnings of message-induced behavior change among lower SES individuals, and helps to close the gap in SES-based health disparities by harnessing the power of neuroimaging.</p>

<p>The globus pallidus internus and the subthalamic nucleus are common targets for deep brain stimulation to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. In the rodent models, however, their direct targeting is hindered by the relatively large dimensions of applied electrodes. To reduce the neurological damage, the electrodes are usually implanted cranial to the nuclei, thus exposing the non-targeted brain regions to large electric fields and, in turn, possible undesired stimulation effects. In this numerical study, we analyze the spread of the fields for the conventional electrodes and several modifications. As a result, we present a relatively simple electrode design that allows an efficient focalization of the stimulating field in the inferiorly located nuclei.</p>

<p>Feeding is essential for survival and taste greatly influences our feeding behaviors. Palatable tastes such as sweet trigger feeding as a symbol of a calorie-rich diet containing sugar or proteins, while unpalatable tastes such as bitter terminate further consumption as a warning against ingestion of harmful substances. Therefore, taste is considered a criterion to distinguish whether food is edible. However, perception of taste is also modulated by physiological changes associated with internal states such as hunger or satiety. Empirically, during hunger state, humans find ordinary food more attractive and feel less aversion to food they usually dislike. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging studies performed in primates and in humans have indicated that some brain areas show state-dependent response to tastes, the mechanisms of how the brain senses tastes during different internal states are poorly understood. Recently, using newly developed molecular and genetic tools as well as in vivo imaging, researchers have identified many specific neuronal populations or neural circuits regulating feeding behaviors and taste perception process in the central nervous system. These studies could help us understand the interplay between homeostatic regulation of energy and taste perception to guide proper feeding behaviors.</p>

<p>High-affinity, Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glutamate transporters are the primary means by which synaptically released glutamate is removed from the extracellular space. They restrict the spread of glutamate from the synaptic cleft into the perisynaptic space and reduce its spillover to neighboring synapses. Thereby, glutamate uptake increases the spatial precision of synaptic communication. Its dysfunction and the entailing rise of the extracellular glutamate concentration accompanied by an increased spread of glutamate result in a loss of precision and in enhanced excitation, which can eventually lead to neuronal death via excitotoxicity. Efficient glutamate uptake depends on a negative resting membrane potential as well as on the transmembrane gradients of the co-transported ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup>) and thus on the proper functioning of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Consequently, numerous studies have documented the impact of an energy shortage, as occurring for instance during an ischemic stroke, on glutamate clearance and homeostasis. The observations range from rapid changes in the transport activity to altered expression of glutamate transporters. Notably, while astrocytes account for the majority of glutamate uptake under physiological conditions, they may also become a source of extracellular glutamate elevation during metabolic stress. However, the mechanisms of the latter phenomenon are still under debate. Here, we review the recent literature addressing changes of glutamate uptake and homeostasis triggered by acute metabolic stress, i.e., on a timescale of seconds to minutes.</p>

<p>Sensory perception underlies how we internalize and interact with the external world. In order to adapt to changing circumstances and interpret signals in a variety of contexts, sensation needs to be reliable, but perception of sensory input needs to be flexible. An important mediator of this flexibility is top-down regulation from the cholinergic basal forebrain. Basal forebrain projection neurons serve as pacemakers and gatekeepers for downstream neural networks, modulating circuit activity across diverse neuronal populations. This top-down control is necessary for sensory cue detection, learning, and memory, and is disproportionately disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive decline. Intriguingly, cholinergic signaling acts locally within the basal forebrain to sculpt the activity of basal forebrain output neurons. To determine how local cholinergic signaling impacts basal forebrain output pathways that participate in top-down regulation, we sought to define the dynamics of cholinergic signaling within the basal forebrain during motivated behavior and learning. Toward this, we utilized fiber photometry and the genetically encoded acetylcholine indicator GAChR2.0 to define temporal patterns of cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain during olfactory-guided, motivated behaviors and learning. We show that cholinergic signaling reliably increased during reward seeking behaviors, but was strongly suppressed by reward delivery in a go/no-go olfactory-cued discrimination task. The observed transient reduction in cholinergic tone was mirrored by a suppression in basal forebrain GABAergic neuronal activity. Together, these findings suggest that cholinergic tone in the basal forebrain changes rapidly to reflect reward-seeking behavior and positive reinforcement and may impact downstream circuitry that modulates olfaction.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the study was to investigate the antiapoptotic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in the acute stage of ischaemic stroke in rats. The cerebral ischemia model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion in rats. A single EA treatment was performed at the acute stage of ischaemic stroke. The neurological function, brain water content, apoptotic cell number, and cerebral infarct volume were assessed in stroke rats. The expression of autophagy-related proteins (LC3II/I, Beclin1, P62, and LAMP1), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), p-JNK, p-ERK1/2, and cleaved caspase-3 (CCAS3) were measured by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Rapamycin (RAP, an activator of autophagy) was used to confirm the antiapoptotic effect of EA via regulating autophagy. The brain edema infarct size and apoptotic cell number were increasing within 3 days following stroke, and brain edema reached its peak at 24 h after stroke. EA treatment at 24 h after ischaemic stroke obviously suppressed the number of apoptotic cells and brain edema. However, there were no significant differences in infarct volumes among EA-12 h, EA-24 h, and MCAO/R group. Moreover, EA treatment at 24 h after ischaemic stroke obviously suppressed the expression of CCAS3, LC3II/I, Beclin1 while increasing the level of P62 and LAMP1 and hence mediating autophagy, which was reversed by RAP. Meanwhile, the expression of SIRT1, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK were promoted by EA at 24 h after ischaemic stroke. In conclusion, EA treatment may suppress apoptosis possibly via regulating autophagy in the acute period after ischaemic stroke, hence reducing brain injury.</p>

<p>More than 30 human disorders are caused by the expansion of simple sequence DNA repeats, among which triplet repeats remain the most frequent. Most trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders affect primarily the nervous system, through mechanisms of neurodysfunction and/or neurodegeneration. While trinucleotide repeat tracts are short and stably transmitted in unaffected individuals, disease-associated expansions are highly dynamic in the germline and in somatic cells, with a tendency toward further expansion. Since longer repeats are associated with increasing disease severity and earlier onset of symptoms, intergenerational repeat size gains account for the phenomenon of anticipation. In turn, higher levels of age-dependent somatic expansion have been linked with increased disease severity and earlier age of onset, implicating somatic instability in the onset and progression of disease symptoms. Hence, tackling the root cause of symptoms through the control of repeat dynamics may provide therapeutic modulation of clinical manifestations. DNA repair pathways have been firmly implicated in the molecular mechanism of repeat length mutation. The demonstration that repeat expansion depends on functional DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, points to MMR as a potential therapeutic target. Similarly, a role of DNA base excision repair (BER) in repeat expansion has also been suggested, particularly during the removal of oxidative lesions. Using a well-characterized mouse cell model system of an unstable CAG•CTG trinucleotide repeat, we tested if expanded repeat tracts can be stabilized by small molecules with reported roles in both pathways: cadmium (an inhibitor of MMR activity) and a variety of antioxidants (capable of neutralizing oxidative species). We found that chronic exposure to sublethal doses of cadmium and antioxidants did not result in significant reduction of the rate of trinucleotide repeat expansion. Surprisingly, manganese yielded a significant stabilization of the triplet repeat tract. We conclude that treatment with cadmium and antioxidants, at doses that do not interfere with cell survival and cell culture dynamics, is not sufficient to modify trinucleotide repeat dynamics in cell culture.</p>

<p>Tau is a key protein in neurons, where it affects the dynamics of the microtubule system. The hyperphosphorylation of Tau (PP-Tau) commonly leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, as it occurs in tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. Hypothermia-related accumulation of PP-Tau has been described in hibernators and during synthetic torpor (ST), a torpor-like condition that has been induced in rats, a non-hibernating species. Remarkably, in ST PP-Tau is reversible and Tau de-phosphorylates within a few hours following the torpor bout, apparently not evolving into pathology. These observations have been limited to the brain, but in animal models of tauopathies, PP-Tau accumulation also appears to occur in the spinal cord (SpCo). The aim of the present work was to assess whether ST leads to PP-Tau accumulation in the SpCo and whether this process is reversible. Immunofluorescence (IF) for AT8 (to assess PP-Tau) and Tau-1 (non-phosphorylated Tau) was carried out on SpCo coronal sections. AT8-IF was clearly expressed in the dorsal horns (DH) during ST, while in the ventral horns (VH) no staining was observed. The AT8-IF completely disappeared after 6 h from the return to euthermia. Tau-1-IF disappeared in both DH and VH during ST, returning to normal levels during recovery. To shed light on the cellular process underlying the PP-Tau pattern observed, the inhibited form of the glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (the main kinase acting on Tau) was assessed using IF: VH (i.e., in motor neurons) were highly stained mainly during ST, while in DH there was no staining. Since tauopathies are also related to neuroinflammation, microglia activation was also assessed through morphometric analyses, but no ST-induced microglia activation was found in the SpCo. Taken together, the present results show that, in the DH of SpCo, ST induces a reversible accumulation of PP-Tau. Since during ST there is no motor activity, the lack of AT8-IF in VH may result from an activity-related process at a cellular level. Thus, ST demonstrates a newly-described physiological mechanism that is able to resolve the accumulation of PP-Tau and apparently avoid the neurodegenerative outcome.</p>

<p>Here we analyze existing quantitative data available for cephalopod brains based on classical contributions by J.Z. Young and colleagues, to cite some. We relate the relative brain size of selected regions (area and/or lobe), with behavior, life history, ecology and distribution of several cephalopod species here considered. After hierarchical clustering we identify and describe ten clusters grouping 52 cephalopod species. This allows us to describe cerebrotypes, i.e., differences of brain composition in different species, as a sign of their adaptation to specific niches and/or clades in cephalopod molluscs for the first time. Similarity reflecting niche type has been found in vertebrates, and it is reasonable to assume that it could also occur in Cephalopoda. We also attempted a phylogenetic PCA using data by Lindgren et al. (2012) as input tree. However, due to the limited overlap in species considered, the final analysis was carried out on &lt;30 species, thus reducing the impact of this approach. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that the phylogenetic signal alone cannot be a justification for the grouping of species, although biased by the limited set of data available to us. Based on these preliminary findings, we can only hypothesize that brains evolved in cephalopods on the basis of different factors including phylogeny, possible development, and the third factor, i.e., life-style adaptations. Our results support the working hypothesis that the taxon evolved different sensorial and computational strategies to cope with the various environments (niches) occupied in the oceans. This study is novel for invertebrates, to the best of our knowledge.</p>

<p>Background: This study aims to evaluate ocular changes in patients with ischemic stroke using multimodal imaging and explore the predictive value of ocular abnormalities for ischemic stroke.</p><p>Methods: A total of 203 patients (ischemic stroke group, 62; control group, 141) were enrolled in this study. Basic data from patients, including age; gender; height; weight; history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, alcohol use, and coronary heart disease; and smoking status, were collected. Consequently, Doppler color ultrasound, color fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations were conducted. Differences in traditional risk factors and ocular parameters between the two groups were compared, and binary logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis.</p><p>Results: The central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) in the ischemic stroke group was 150.72 ± 20.15 μm and that in the control group was 159.68 ± 20.05 μm. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.004). Moreover, the subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFChT) in the ischemic stroke group was 199.90 ± 69.27 μm and that in the control group was 227.40 ± 62.20 μm. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.006). Logistic regression results showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 2.823; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.477–5.395], CRAE (OR = 0.980; 95% CI = 0.965–0.996), and SFChT (OR = 0.994; 95% CI = 0.989–0.999) are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke when ocular parameters were combined with traditional risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.726, which shows good diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>Conclusion: SFChT may be a diagnostic marker for early detection and monitoring of ischemic stroke. Combined with traditional risks, retinal artery diameter, and choroidal thickness, the prediction model can improve ischemic stroke prediction.</p>

<p>Objectives: Asymmetric disease characteristics on neuroimaging are common in structural and functional imaging of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer‘s disease (AD). However, a standardized clinical evaluation of asymmetric neuronal degeneration and its impact on clinical findings has only sporadically been investigated for F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG-PET). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of lateralized neuronal degeneration on the detection of AD by detailed clinical testing. Furthermore, we compared associations between clinical evaluation and lateralized neuronal degeneration between FDG-PET hypometabolism and hippocampal atrophy. Finally, we investigated if specific subtests show associations with lateralized neuronal degeneration.</p><p>Methods: One-hundred and forty-six patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD (age 71 ± 8) were investigated by FDG-PET and the “Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease” (CERAD) test battery. For assessment of neuronal degeneration, FDG-PET hypometabolism in brain regions typically affected in AD were graded by visual (3D-surface projections) and semiquantitative analysis. Asymmetry of the hippocampus (left-right) in magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) was rated visually by the Scheltens scale. Measures of asymmetry were calculated to quantify lateralized neuronal degeneration and asymmetry scores were subsequently correlated with CERAD.</p><p>Results: Asymmetry with left-dominant neuronal degeneration to FDG-PET was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment (visual: β = −0.288, p &lt; 0.001; semiquantitative: β = −0.451, p &lt; 0.001) when controlled for age, gender, years of education and total burden of neuronal degeneration, whereas hippocampal asymmetry to MRI was not (β = −0.034; p = 0.731). Direct comparison of CERAD-PET associations in cases with right- and left-lateralized neuronal degeneration estimated a detection gap of 2.7 years for right-lateralized cases. Left-hemispheric neuronal degeneration was significantly associated with the total CERAD score and multiple subscores, whereas only MMSE (semiquantitative: β = 0.429, p &lt; 0.001) and constructional praxis (semiquantitative: β = 0.292, p = 0.008) showed significant associations with right-hemispheric neuronal degeneration.</p><p>Conclusions: Asymmetry of deteriorated cerebral glucose metabolism has a significant impact on the coupling between neuronal degeneration and cognitive function. Right dominant neuronal degeneration shows a delayed detection by global CERAD testing and requires evaluation of specific subdomains of cognitive testing.</p>

<p>Background: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator fingolimod (FTY720), which is commonly used as an immunomodulator in multiple sclerosis treatment, has recently been found to reduce pathological changes in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models, but this has yet to be verified in human brain tissue. In this study, network pharmacology methods were applied to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of fingolimod in the frontal cortex of AD patients.</p><p>Methods: The pharmacological macromolecular targets of fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate were downloaded from SwissTarget and DrugBank. Systematic intersection analysis of the expression profiles of brain frontal cortex tissues (423 AD tissues and 266 control tissues) was performed to obtain AD-associated fingolimod targets (F-ADGs). Immune cell infiltration analysis and a primary mouse cortical culture RNA-seq drug screen database were used to identify immune-related F-ADGs and cortex-related F-ADGs. Then, the expression values of F-ADGs were correlated with the disease severity score (MMSE score) of AD patients to identify severity-related F-ADGs. We also analyzed miRNA expression microarray data in the frontal cortex of AD patients associated with disease severity to obtain severity-related F-ADG-miRNAs.</p><p>Results: A total of 188 F-ADGs were detected in the frontal cortices of AD patients and were enriched in biological processes such as synaptic signaling, inflammatory response, and response to oxygen-containing compounds. Eleven immune-related F-ADGs (like FPR1, BLNK.) and 17 cortex-related F-ADGs (like ALDH1L1, DUSP1.) were detected. Other F-ADGs, such as S1PR1 and GABBR2, although not classified into the above two categories, were still predicted by bioinformatics methods to play an important role in the development of AD. Two F-ADGs (GNAQ and MMP14) and 28 miRNAs (like miR- 323a-3p, miR-181a-5p.) were found to be associated with AD severity (MMSE 0-27 group). Fifteen F-ADGs (like ALDH1L1, FPR1, and IL6.) and 46 miRNAs (like miR-212-5p, miR-93-5p.) were found to be associated with mild or moderate dementia AD patients' severity (MMSE11-22 subgroup).</p><p>Conclusions: Fingolimod may affect the brain frontal cortex function of AD patients in many different ways, such as affecting immune cell infiltration, nerve cell, or glial cell function, and synaptic function. miRNAs may also be involved. ALDH1L1, FPR1, S1PR1, and GABBR2 may be core drug targets.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65905">Convergent organization of aberrant MYB complex controls oncogenic gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

Dysregulated gene expression contributes to most prevalent features in human cancers. Here, we show that most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the aberrant assembly of MYB transcriptional co-activator complex. By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL1, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300 co-activation of a distinct set of transcription factor complexes. These MYB complexes assemble aberrantly with LYL1, E2A, C/EBP family members, LMO2 and SATB1. They are organized convergently in genetically diverse subtypes of AML, and are at least in part associated with inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. Peptidomimetic remodeling of oncogenic MYB complexes is accompanied by specific proteolysis and dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors such as RUNX1 to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, aberrant assembly and sequestration of MYB:CBP/P300 complexes provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene expression in AML. This work establishes a compelling strategy for their pharmacologic reprogramming and therapeutic targeting for diverse leukemias and possibly other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65180">Gross ways to live long: Parasitic worms as an anti-inflammaging therapy?</a></h4>

Evolutionary medicine argues that disease can arise because modern conditions do not match those in which we evolved. For example, a decline in exposure to commensal microbes and gastrointestinal helminths in developed countries has been linked to increased prevalence of allergic and autoimmune inflammatory disorders (the hygiene hypothesis). Accordingly, probiotic therapies that restore ‘old friend’ microbes and helminths have been explored as Darwinian treatments for these disorders. A further possibility is that loss of old friend commensals also increases the sterile, aging-associated inflammation known as inflammaging, which contributes to a range of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer. Interestingly, Crowe et al., 2020 recently reported that treatment with a secreted glycoprotein from a parasitic nematode can protect against murine aging by induction of anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Here, we explore the hypothesis that restorative helminth therapy would have anti-inflammaging effects. Could worm infections provide broad-spectrum protection against age-related disease?

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64370">SATB2 induction of a neural crest mesenchyme-like program drives melanoma invasion and drug resistance</a></h4>

Recent genomic and scRNA-seq analyses of melanoma demonstrated a lack of recurrent genetic drivers of metastasis, while identifying common transcriptional states correlating with invasion or drug resistance. To test whether transcriptional adaptation can drive melanoma progression, we made use of a zebrafish mitfa:<i>BRAFV600E</i>;<i>tp53-/-</i> model, in which malignant progression is characterized by minimal genetic evolution. We undertook an overexpression-screen of 80 epigenetic/transcriptional regulators and found neural crest-mesenchyme developmental regulator SATB2 to accelerate aggressive melanoma development. Its overexpression induces invadopodia formation and invasion in zebrafish tumors and human melanoma cell lines. SATB2 binds and activates neural crest-regulators, including <i>pdgfab</i> and <i>snai2</i>. The transcriptional program induced by SATB2 overlaps with known MITF<sup>low</sup>AXL<sup>high</sup> and AQP1<sup>+</sup>NGFR1<sup>high </sup>drug resistant states and functionally drives enhanced tumor propagation and resistance to Vemurafenib <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that melanoma transcriptional rewiring by SATB2 to a neural crest mesenchyme-like program can drive invasion and drug resistance in endogenous tumors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63671">Leptin-receptor neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus regulate diurnal patterns of feeding, locomotion, and metabolism</a></h4>

Animal behavior and metabolism are tightly coordinated with sleep-wake cycles governed by the brain in harmony with environmental light:dark cycles. Within the brain, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) has been implicated in the integrative control of feeding, energy homeostasis, and circadian rhythms,<sup>1</sup> but the underlying cell types are unknown. Here, we identify a role for DMH leptin receptor-expressing neurons (DMH<sup>LepR</sup>) in this integrative control. Using a viral approach, we show that silencing neurotransmission in DMH<sup>LepR</sup> neurons in adult mice not only increases body weight and adiposity, but also phase-advances diurnal rhythms of feeding and metabolism into the light-cycle and abolishes the normal increase in dark-cycle locomotor activity (LMA) characteristic of nocturnal rodents. Finally, DMH<sup>LepR</sup>-silenced mice fail to entrain to a restrictive change in food availability. Together, these findings identify DMH<sup>LepR</sup> neurons as critical determinants of the daily time of feeding and associated metabolic rhythms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63284">A small-molecule ICMT inhibitor delays senescence of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome cells</a></h4>

A farnesylated and methylated form of prelamin A called progerin causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Inhibiting progerin methylation by inactivating the isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) gene stimulates proliferation of HGPS cells and improves survival of <i>Zmpste24</i>-deficient mice. However, we don't know whether <i>Icmt</i> inactivation improves phenotypes in an authentic HGPS mouse model. Moreover, it is unknown whether pharmacologic targeting of ICMT would be tolerated by cells and produce similar cellular effects as genetic inactivation. Here, we show that knockout of <i>Icmt</i> improves survival of HGPS mice and restores vascular smooth muscle cell numbers in the aorta. We also synthesized a potent ICMT inhibitor called C75 and found that it delays senescence and stimulates proliferation of late-passage HGPS cells and <i>Zmpste24</i>-deficient mouse fibroblasts. Importantly, C75 did not influence proliferation of wild-type human cells or <i>Zmpste24</i>-deficient mouse cells lacking <i>Icmt</i>, indicating drug specificity. These results raise hopes that ICMT inhibitors could be useful for treating children with HGPS.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63009">A modular approach to integrating multiple data sources into real-time clinical prediction for pediatric diarrhea</a></h4>

Traditional clinical prediction models focus on parameters of the individual patient. For infectious diseases, sources external to the patient, including characteristics of prior patients and seasonal factors, may improve predictive performance. We describe the development of a predictive model that integrates multiple sources of data in a principled statistical framework using a post-test odds formulation. Our method enables electronic real-time updating and flexibility, such that components can be included or excluded according to data availability. We apply this method to the prediction of etiology of pediatric diarrhea, where 'pre-test’ epidemiologic data may be highly informative. Diarrhea has a high burden in low-resource settings, and antibiotics are often over-prescribed. We demonstrate that our integrative method outperforms traditional prediction in accurately identifying cases with a viral etiology, and show that its clinical application, especially when used with an additional diagnostic test, could result in a 61% reduction in inappropriately prescribed antibiotics.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62174">Iron derived from autophagy-mediated ferritin degradation induces cardiomyocyte death and heart failure in mice</a></h4>

Heart failure is a major public health problem, and abnormal iron metabolism is common in patients with heart failure. Although iron is necessary for metabolic homeostasis, it induces a programmed necrosis. Iron release from ferritin storage is through nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated autophagic degradation, known as ferritinophagy. However, the role of ferritinophagy in the stressed heart remains unclear. Deletion of <i>Ncoa4</i> in mouse hearts reduced left ventricular chamber size and improved cardiac function along with the attenuation of the upregulation of ferritinophagy-mediated ferritin degradation 4 weeks after pressure overload. Free ferrous iron overload and increased lipid peroxidation were suppressed in NCOA4-deficient hearts. A potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, ferrostatin-1, significantly mitigated the development of pressure overload-induced dilated cardiomyopathy in wild-type mice. Thus, the activation of ferritinophagy results in the development of heart failure, whereas inhibition of this process protects the heart against hemodynamic stress.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62097">Celsr1 adhesive interactions mediate the asymmetric organization of planar polarity complexes</a></h4>

To orchestrate collective polarization across tissues, planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins localize asymmetrically to cell junctions, a conserved feature of PCP that requires the atypical cadherin Celsr1. We report that mouse Celsr1 engages in both <i>trans</i>- and <i>cis</i>-interactions, and organizes into dense and highly stable punctate assemblies. We provide evidence suggesting that PCP-mutant variant of Celsr1, Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>, selectively impairs lateral <i>cis</i>-interactions. Although Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> mediates cell adhesion in trans, it displays increased mobility, diminishes junctional enrichment, and fails to engage in homophilic adhesion with the wild-type protein, phenotypes that can be rescued by ectopic <i>cis</i>-dimerization. Using biochemical and super-resolution microscopy approaches, we show that although Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> physically interacts with PCP proteins Frizzled6 and Vangl2, it fails to organize these proteins into asymmetric junctional complexes. Our results suggest mammalian Celsr1 functions not only as a <i>trans</i>-adhesive homodimeric bridge, but also as an organizer of intercellular Frizzled6 and Vangl2 asymmetry through lateral, <i>cis</i>-interactions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60200">Emergence and propagation of epistasis in metabolic networks</a></h4>

Epistasis is often used to probe functional relationships between genes, and it plays an important role in evolution. However, we lack theory to understand how functional relationships at the molecular level translate into epistasis at the level of whole-organism phenotypes, such as fitness. Here, I derive two rules for how epistasis between mutations with small effects propagates from lower- to higher-level phenotypes in a hierarchical metabolic network with first-order kinetics and how such epistasis depends on topology. Most importantly, weak epistasis at a lower level may be distorted as it propagates to higher levels. Computational analyses show that epistasis in more realistic models likely follows similar, albeit more complex, patterns. These results suggest that pairwise inter-gene epistasis should be common and it should generically depend on the genetic background and environment. Furthermore, the epistasis coefficients measured for high-level phenotypes may not be sufficient to fully infer the underlying functional relationships.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58756">Regenerative neurogenic response from glia requires insulin driven neuron-glia communication</a></h4>

Understanding how injury to the Central Nervous System (CNS) induces de novo neurogenesis in animals would help promote regeneration in humans. Regenerative neurogenesis could originate from glia and glial Neuron-Glia antigen-2 (NG2) may sense injury-induced neuronal signals, but these are unknown. Here, we used <i>Drosophila</i> to search for genes functionally related the <i>NG2</i> homologue <i>kon-tiki (kon),</i> and identified <i>Islet Antigen-2 (Ia-2),</i> required in neurons for insulin secretion. Alterations in Ia-2 function induced neural stem cell gene expression, injury increased <i>ia-2</i> expression and induced ectopic neural stem cells. Using genetic analysis and lineage tracing, we demonstrate that Ia-2 and Kon regulate <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like peptide 6 (Dilp-6), to induce glial proliferation and neural stem cells from glia. Ectopic neural stem cells can divide, and limited de novo neurogenesis could be traced back to glial cells. Altogether, Ia-2 and Dilp-6 drive a neuron-glia relay that restores glia, and reprograms glia into neural stem cells for regeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58744">Seizures are a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and subsequent tauopathy</a></h4>

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prominent risk factor for dementias including tauopathies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, in part due to lack of tractable animal models. Here, we test the putative role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. We introduce ‘tauopathy reporter’ zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death, post–traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.

Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate patients with ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody (gAChR‐Ab) positive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy using a multimodal testing protocol to characterize their full clinical phenotype and explore biomarkers to quantify immunotherapy response.


Methods
We conducted a cohort study of 13 individuals (7 women, 21–69 years of age) with autonomic failure and gAChR‐Ab &gt;100 pM identified between 2005 and 2019. From 2018, all patients were longitudinally assessed with cardiovascular, pupillary, urinary, sudomotor, lacrimal and salivary testing, and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS‐31) autonomic symptom questionnaires. The orthostatic intolerance ratio was calculated by dividing change in systolic blood pressure over time tolerated on head‐up tilt. Eleven patients received immunotherapy.


Results
At first assessment, all 13 patients had cardiovascular and pupillary impairments, 7 of 8 had postganglionic sudomotor dysfunction, 9 of 11 had urinary retention and xeropthalmia, and 6 of 8 had xerostomia. After immunotherapy, there were significant improvements in orthostatic intolerance ratio (33.3 [17.8–61.3] to 5.2 [1.4–8.2], p = 0.007), heart rate response to deep breathing (1.5 [0.0–3.3] to 4.5 [3.0–6.3], p = 0.02), pupillary constriction to light (12.0 [5.5–18.0] to 19.0 [10.6–23.8]%, p = 0.02), saliva production (0.01 [0.01–0.05] to 0.08 [0.02–0.20] g/min, p = 0.03), and COMPASS‐31 scores (52 to 17, p = 0.03). Orthostatic intolerance ratio correlated with autonomic symptoms at baseline (r = 0.841, p = 0.01) and following immunotherapy (r = 0.889, p = 0.02). Immunofluorescence analyses of skin samples from a patient 32 years after disease onset showed loss of nerve fibers supplying the dermal autonomic adnexa and epidermis, with clear improvements following immunotherapy.


Interpretation
Patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy demonstrated objective evidence of widespread sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic failure, with significant improvements after immunotherapy. Quantitative autonomic biomarkers should be used to define initial deficits, guide therapeutic decisions, and document treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
The perirhinal cortex is situated on the border between sensory association cortex and the hippocampal formation. It serves an important function as a transition area between the sensory neocortex and the medial temporal lobe. While the perirhinal cortex has traditionally been associated with object coding and the “what” pathway of the temporal lobe, current evidence suggests a broader function of the perirhinal cortex in solving feature ambiguity and processing complex stimuli. Besides fulfilling functions in object coding, recent neurophysiological findings in freely moving rodents indicate that the perirhinal cortex also contributes to spatial and contextual processing beyond individual sensory modalities. Here, we address how these two opposing views on perirhinal cortex—the object‐centered and spatial‐contextual processing hypotheses—may be reconciled. The perirhinal cortex is consistently recruited when different features can be merged perceptually or conceptually into a single entity. Features that are unitized in these entities include object information from multiple sensory domains, reward associations, semantic features and spatial/contextual associations. We propose that the same perirhinal network circuits can be flexibly deployed for multiple cognitive functions, such that the perirhinal cortex performs similar unitization operations on different types of information, depending on behavioral demands and ranging from the object‐related domain to spatial, contextual and semantic information.

<p>by Aidan I. Brown, Elena F. Koslover</p>

Newly-translated glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) often undergo cycles of chaperone binding and release in order to assist in folding. Quality control is required to distinguish between proteins that have completed native folding, those that have yet to fold, and those that have misfolded. Using quantitative modeling, we explore how the design of the quality-control pathway modulates its efficiency. Our results show that an energy-consuming cyclic quality-control process, similar to the observed physiological system, outperforms alternative designs. The kinetic parameters that optimize the performance of this system drastically change with protein production levels, while remaining relatively insensitive to the protein folding rate. Adjusting only the degradation rate, while fixing other parameters, allows the pathway to adapt across a range of protein production levels, aligning with <i>in vivo</i> measurements that implicate the release of degradation-associated enzymes as a rapid-response system for perturbations in protein homeostasis. The quantitative models developed here elucidate design principles for effective glycoprotein quality control in the ER, improving our mechanistic understanding of a system crucial to maintaining cellular health.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hXRSeWZJ-NQ" width="1" />

<p>by Rustom Antia, Hasan Ahmed, James J. Bull</p>

Many viral infections can be prevented by immunizing with live, attenuated vaccines. Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, now much improved by genetic engineering. However, even current methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the virus’s ability to grow. Reduced viral growth has the undesired side-effect of reducing the host immune response below that of infection with wild-type. Might some methods of attenuation instead lead to an increased immune response? We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus with innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus pathology and immunity. We find that modification of some virus immune-evasion pathways can indeed reduce pathology yet enhance immunity. Thus, attenuated vaccines can, in principle, be directed to be safe yet create better immunity than is elicited by the wild-type virus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5bnJLe9pnVE" width="1" />

While large datasets of HIV-1 sequences are increasingly being generated, many studies rely on a single gene or fragment of the genome and few comparative studies across genes have been done. We performed genome-based and gene-specific Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to investigate how certain factors impact estimates of the infection dates in an acute HIV-1 infection cohort, RV217. In this cohort, HIV-1 diagnosis corresponded to the first RNA positive test and occurred a median of four days after the last negative test, allowing us to compare timing estimates using BEAST to a narrow window of infection. We analyzed HIV-1 sequences sampled one week, one month and six months after HIV-1 diagnosis in 39 individuals. We found that shared diversity and temporal signal was limited in acute infection, and insufficient to allow timing inferences in the shortest HIV-1 genes, thus dated phylogenies were primarily analyzed for <i>env</i>, <i>gag</i>, <i>pol</i> and near full-length genomes. There was no one best fitting model across participants and genes, though relaxed molecular clocks (73% of best fitting models) and the Bayesian skyline (49%) tended to be favored. For infections with single founders, the infection date was estimated to be around one week pre-diagnosis for <i>env</i> (IQR: 3–9 days) and <i>gag</i> (IQR: 5–9 days), whilst the genome placed it at a median of 10 days (IQR: 4–19). Multiply-founded infections proved problematic to date. Our ability to compare timing inferences to precise estimates of HIV-1 infection (within a week) highlights that molecular dating methods can be applied to within-host datasets from early infection. Nonetheless, our results also suggest caution when using uniform clock and population models or short genes with limited information content.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXOEKAnlRoA" width="1" />

<p>by Filip Stefaniak, Janusz M. Bujnicki</p>

RNA is considered as an attractive target for new small molecule drugs. Designing active compounds can be facilitated by computational modeling. Most of the available tools developed for these prediction purposes, such as molecular docking or scoring functions, are parametrized for protein targets. The performance of these methods, when applied to RNA-ligand systems, is insufficient. To overcome these problems, we developed AnnapuRNA, a new knowledge-based scoring function designed to evaluate RNA-ligand complex structures, generated by any computational docking method. We also evaluated three main factors that may influence the structure prediction, i.e., starting conformer of a ligand, the docking program, and the scoring function used. We applied the AnnapuRNA method for a <i>post-hoc</i> study of the recently published structures of the FMN riboswitch.

<p>by Casey A. Cole, Nourhan S. Daigham, Gaohua Liu, Gaetano T. Montelione, Homayoun Valafar</p>

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the three primary experimental means of characterizing macromolecular structures, including protein structures. Structure determination by solution NMR spectroscopy has traditionally relied heavily on distance restraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements. While structure determination of proteins from NOE-based restraints is well understood and broadly used, structure determination from Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) is relatively less well developed. Here, we describe the new features of the protein structure modeling program REDCRAFT and focus on the new Adaptive Decimation (AD) feature. The AD plays a critical role in improving the robustness of REDCRAFT to missing or noisy data, while allowing structure determination of larger proteins from less data. In this report we demonstrate the successful application of REDCRAFT in structure determination of proteins ranging in size from 50 to 145 residues using experimentally collected data, and of larger proteins (145 to 573 residues) using simulated RDC data. In both cases, REDCRAFT uses only RDC data that can be collected from perdeuterated proteins. Finally, we compare the accuracy of structure determination from RDCs alone with traditional NOE-based methods for the structurally novel PF.2048.1 protein. The RDC-based structure of PF.2048.1 exhibited 1.0 Å BB-RMSD with respect to a high-quality NOE-based structure. Although optimal strategies would include using RDC data together with chemical shift, NOE, and other NMR data, these studies provide proof-of-principle for robust structure determination of largely-perdeuterated proteins from RDC data alone using REDCRAFT.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E5RdJCBzSo8" width="1" />

The capacity for T cells to become activated and clonally expand during pathogen invasion is pivotal for protective immunity. Our understanding of how T cell receptor (TCR) signaling prepares cells for this rapid expansion remains limited. Here we provide evidence that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-4b (Cul4b) regulates this process. The abundance of total and neddylated Cul4b increased following TCR stimulation. Disruption of Cul4b resulted in impaired proliferation and survival of activated T cells. Additionally, Cul4b-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulated DNA damage. In T cells, Cul4b preferentially associated with the substrate receptor DCAF1, and Cul4b and DCAF1 were found to interact with proteins that promote the sensing or repair of damaged DNA. While Cul4b-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed evidence of DNA damage sensing, downstream phosphorylation of SMC1A did not occur. These findings reveal an essential role for Cul4b in promoting the repair of damaged DNA to allow survival and expansion of activated T cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zlBCtKQDXOQ" width="1" />

Our results show that high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (HF‐rMS) is a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the ischemic‐induced neuron loss, neurite degeneration and synaptic loss. Moreover, we show that the observed neuroprotective effects of HF‐rMS were dependent on astrocytes.

Abstract
After decades of effort, there are no effective clinical treatments to induce the recovery of ischemia‐injured tissues, and among the several strategies that have been explored, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has proven to be one of the most promising, with beneficial effects in limb motor function, aphasia, hemispatial neglect, or dysphagia. Despite the clinical evidences, little is known about the mechanisms underlying those effects. The present study aimed to explore the cellular and molecular effects of high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (HF‐rMS) on an in vitro model of ischemia. Using primary cortical cultures exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion, we observed that HF‐rMS treatment prevents the ischemia‐induced neuronal death by 21.2%, and the neurite degeneration triggered by ischemia. Our results also demonstrate that with this treatment there is an increase of 89.2% on the number cells expressing ERK1/2, of 20.1% on the number of cells expressing c‐Fos, and a synaptogenic effect, through an increase of 62.9% in the number of synaptic puncta as well as of 49.4% in their intensity. Interestingly, our results indicate that astrocytes are crucial to the beneficial effects triggered by HF‐rMS after ischemia, thus suggesting a direct effect of HF‐rMS on these cells. The modulation of astrocytes with this non‐invasive brain stimulation technique is a promising approach to promote the recovery of ischemia‐induced injured tissues; however, it is essential to understand how these effects can be modulated in order to optimize the protocols and enhance the beneficial outcomes.

Limited data exists regarding the disease course of Huntington's Disease (HD) in children and young adults. Here, we evaluate the trajectory various cognitive skill development as a function of CAG repeat length in children and adolescents that carry the mutation that causes HD. We discovered that the development of verbal skills seems to plateau earlier as CAG repeat length increases. These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment and may have far‐reaching implications for future gene‐therapy treatment strategies.

<p>Neurodynamic organizations are information-based abstractions, expressed in bits, of the structure of long duration EEG amplitude levels. Neurodynamic information (NI, the variable of neurodynamic organization) is thought to continually accumulate as EEG amplitudes cycle through periods of persistent activation and deactivation in response to the activities and uncertainties of teamwork. Here we show that (1) Neurodynamic information levels were a better predictor of uncertainty and novice and expert behaviors than were the EEG power levels from which NI was derived. (2) Spatial and temporal parsing of team NI from experienced submarine navigation and healthcare teams showed that it was composed of discrete peaks with durations up to 20–60 s, and identified the involvement of activated delta waves when precise motor control was needed. (3) The relationship between NI and EEG power was complex varying by brain regions, EEG frequencies, and global vs. local brain interactions. The presence of an organizational system of information that parallels the amplitude of EEG rhythms is important as it provides a greatly reduced data dimension while retaining the essential system features, i.e., linkages to higher scale behaviors that span temporal and spatial scales of teamwork. In this way the combinatorial explosion of EEG rhythmic variables at micro levels become compressed into an intermediate system of information and organization which links to macro-scale team and team member behaviors. These studies provide an avenue for understanding how complex organizations arise from the dynamics of underlying micro-scale variables. The study also has practical implications for how micro-scale variables might be better represented, both conceptually and in terms of parsimony, for training machines to recognize human behaviors that span scales of teams.</p>

<p>Neurotransmitter expression is widely used as a criterion for classifying neurons. It was initially thought that neurons express a single type of neurotransmitter, a phenomenon commonly recognized as Dale's principle: “one neuron, one transmitter.” Consequently, the expression of a single neurotransmitter should determine stable and distinguishable neuronal characteristics. However, this notion has been largely challenged and increasing evidence accumulates supporting a different scenario: “one neuron, multiple neurotransmitters.” Single-cell transcriptomics provides an additional path to address coexpression of neurotransmitters, by investigating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and transmission of fast-acting neuromodulators. Here, we study neuronal phenotypes based on the expression of neurotransmitters, at single-cell resolution, across different animal species representing distinct clades of the tree of life. We take advantage of several existing scRNAseq datasets and analyze them in light of neurotransmitter plasticity. Our results show that while most neurons appear to predominantly express a single type of neurotransmitter, a substantial number of neurons simultaneously expresses a combination of them, across all animal species analyzed.</p>

<p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a master regulator of mitochondria biogenesis and cell stress playing a role in metabolic and degenerative diseases. In the brain PGC-1α expression has been localized mainly to GABAergic interneurons but its overall role is not fully understood. We observed here that the protein levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor-α2 subunit (GABARα2) were increased in hippocampus and brain cortex in transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing PGC-1α in neurons. Along with this, GABARα2 expression was enhanced in the hippocampus of the PGC-1α Tg mice, as shown by quantitative PCR. Double immunostaining revealed that GABARα2 co-localized with the synaptic protein gephyrin in higher amounts in the striatum radiatum layer of the hippocampal CA1 region in the Tg compared with Wt mice. Electrophysiology revealed that the frequency of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was increased in the CA1 region in the Tg mice, indicative of an augmented GABAergic transmission. Behavioral tests revealed an increase for anxiety-like behavior in the PGC-1α Tg mice compared with controls. To study whether drugs acting on PPARγ can affect GABARα2, we employed pioglitazone that elevated GABARα2 expression in primary cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained using the specific PPARγ agonist, N-(2-benzoylphenyl)-O-[2-(methyl-2-pyridinylamino) ethyl]-L-tyrosine hydrate (GW1929). These results demonstrate that PGC-1α regulates GABARα2 subunits and GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus with behavioral consequences. This indicates further that drugs like pioglitazone, widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, can influence GABARα2 expression via the PPARγ/PGC-1α system.</p>

<p>Ionotropic receptors (IRs) are a highly divergent subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and are conserved across Protostomia, a major branch of the animal kingdom that encompasses both Ecdysozoa and Lophothrochozoa. They are broadly expressed in peripheral sensory systems, concentrated in sensory dendrites, and function in chemosensation, thermosensation, and hygrosensation. As iGluRs, four IR subunits form a functional ion channel to detect environmental stimuli. Most IR receptors comprise individual stimulus-specific tuning receptors and one or two broadly expressed coreceptors. This review summarizes the discoveries of the structure of IR complexes and the expression and function of each IR, as well as discusses the future direction for IR studies.</p>

<p>Background: Dysregulated expression of microRNAs and potassium channels have been reported for their contributions to seizure onset. However, the microRNA–potassium channel gene interactions in traumatic brain injury-induced post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) remain unknown.</p><p>Methods: PTE was induced in male rats by intracranial injection with ferrous chloride (0.1 mol/L, 1 μl/min) at the right frontal cortex. Electroencephalography was recorded at 60 min, as well as day 1, 7, and 30, and the behavioral seizures were assessed before injection and at different time points after injection. Rats were killed on day 30 after injection. The right frontal cortex samples were collected and subjected to high throughput messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA sequencing. A network of differentially expressed potassium channel mRNAs and microRNAs was constructed using OryCun2.0 and subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. The differential mRNA and microRNA expressions were verified using quantitative real-time-PCR. The microRNA–mRNA was subject to the Pearson correlation analysis.</p><p>Results: A PTE rat model was successfully established, as evidenced by behavioral seizures and epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography in PTE rats compared with sham rats. Among the 91 mRNAs and 40 microRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed in the PTE rat brain, 4 mRNAs and 10 microRNAs were associated with potassium channels. Except for potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 2, the other three potassium channel mRNAs were negatively correlated with seven microRNAs. These microRNA–mRNA pairs were enriched in annotations and pathways related to neuronal ion channels and neuroinflammation. Quantitative real-time-PCR and correlation analysis verified negative correlations in miR-449a-5p-KCNH2, miR-98-5p-KCNH2, miR-98-5p-KCNK15, miR-19b-3p-KCNK15, and miR-301a-3p-KCNK15 pairs.</p><p>Conclusion: We identified microRNA–potassium channel mRNA interactions associated with PTE, providing potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PTE.</p>

<p>Axons in the central nervous system often fail to regenerate after injury due to the limited intrinsic regeneration ability of the central nervous system (CNS) and complex extracellular inhibitory factors. Therefore, it is of vital importance to have a better understanding of potential methods to promote the regeneration capability of injured nerves. Evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs play an essential role in nerve regeneration, especially long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA). In this review, we profile their separate roles in axon regeneration after CNS injuries, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and optic nerve injury. In addition, we also reveal the interactive networks among non-coding RNAs.</p>

<p>The investigation of abstract cognitive tasks, e.g., semantic processing of speech, requires the simultaneous use of a carefully selected stimulus design and sensitive tools for the analysis of corresponding neural activity that are comparable across different studies investigating similar research questions. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods are commonly used in neuroimaging to investigate BOLD responses corresponding to neural activation associated with specific cognitive tasks. Regions of significant activation are identified by a thresholding operation during multivariate pattern analysis, the results of which are susceptible to the applied threshold value. Investigation of analysis approaches that are robust to a large extent with respect to thresholding, is thus an important goal pursued here. The present paper contributes a novel statistical analysis method for fMRI experiments, searchlight classification informative region mixture model (SCIM), that is based on the assumption that the whole brain volume can be subdivided into two groups of voxels: spatial voxel positions around which recorded BOLD activity does convey information about the present stimulus condition and those that do not. A generative statistical model is proposed that assigns a probability of being informative to each position in the brain, based on a combination of a support vector machine searchlight analysis and Gaussian mixture models. Results from an auditory fMRI study investigating cortical regions that are engaged in the semantic processing of speech indicate that the SCIM method identifies physiologically plausible brain regions as informative, similar to those from two standard methods as reference that we compare to, with two important differences. SCIM-identified regions are very robust to the choice of the threshold for significance, i.e., less “noisy,” in contrast to, e.g., the binomial test whose results in the present experiment are highly dependent on the chosen significance threshold or random permutation tests that are additionally bound to very high computational costs. In group analyses, the SCIM method identifies a physiologically plausible pre-frontal region, anterior cingulate sulcus, to be involved in semantic processing that other methods succeed to identify only in single subject analyses.</p>

<p>Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a neuromodulation tool used for treating several clinical disorders, including insomnia, anxiety, and depression. More recently, a limited number of studies have examined CES for altering affect, physiology, and behavior in healthy, non-clinical samples. The physiological, neurochemical, and metabolic mechanisms underlying CES effects are currently unknown. Computational modeling suggests that electrical current administered with CES at the earlobes can reach cortical and subcortical regions at very low intensities associated with subthreshold neuromodulatory effects, and studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) show some effects on alpha band EEG activity, and modulation of the default mode network during CES administration. One theory suggests that CES modulates brain stem (e.g., medulla), limbic (e.g., thalamus, amygdala), and cortical (e.g., prefrontal cortex) regions and increases relative parasympathetic to sympathetic drive in the autonomic nervous system. There is no direct evidence supporting this theory, but one of its assumptions is that CES may induce its effects by stimulating afferent projections of the vagus nerve, which provides parasympathetic signals to the cardiorespiratory and digestive systems. In our critical review of studies using CES in clinical and non-clinical populations, we found severe methodological concerns, including potential conflicts of interest, risk of methodological and analytic biases, issues with sham credibility, lack of blinding, and a severe heterogeneity of CES parameters selected and employed across scientists, laboratories, institutions, and studies. These limitations make it difficult to derive consistent or compelling insights from the extant literature, tempering enthusiasm for CES and its potential to alter nervous system activity or behavior in meaningful or reliable ways. The lack of compelling evidence also motivates well-designed and relatively high-powered experiments to assess how CES might modulate the physiological, affective, and cognitive responses to stress. Establishing reliable empirical links between CES administration and human performance is critical for supporting its prospective use during occupational training, operations, or recovery, ensuring reliability and robustness of effects, characterizing if, when, and in whom such effects might arise, and ensuring that any benefits of CES outweigh the risks of adverse events.</p>

<p>Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the electroencephalographic (EEG) waveform obtained by subtracting event-related potential (ERP) responses evoked by unexpected deviant stimuli from responses evoked by expected standard stimuli. While the MMN is thought to reflect an unexpected change in an ongoing, predictable stimulus, it is unknown whether MMN responses evoked by changes in different stimulus features have different magnitudes, latencies, and topographies. The present study aimed to investigate whether MMN responses differ depending on whether sudden stimulus change occur in pitch, duration, location or vowel identity, respectively. To calculate ERPs to standard and deviant stimuli, EEG signals were recorded in normal-hearing participants (N = 20; 13 males, 7 females) who listened to roving oddball sequences of artificial syllables. In the roving paradigm, any given stimulus is repeated several times to form a standard, and then suddenly replaced with a deviant stimulus which differs from the standard. Here, deviants differed from preceding standards along one of four features (pitch, duration, vowel or interaural level difference). The feature levels were individually chosen to match behavioral discrimination performance. We identified neural activity evoked by unexpected violations along all four acoustic dimensions. Evoked responses to deviant stimuli increased in amplitude relative to the responses to standard stimuli. A univariate (channel-by-channel) analysis yielded no significant differences between MMN responses following violations of different features. However, in a multivariate analysis (pooling information from multiple EEG channels), acoustic features could be decoded from the topography of mismatch responses, although at later latencies than those typical for MMN. These results support the notion that deviant feature detection may be subserved by a different process than general mismatch detection.</p>

<p>The impact of stroke on motor functioning is analyzed at different levels. ‘Impairment’ denotes the loss of basic characteristics of voluntary movement. ‘Activity limitation’ denotes the loss of normal capacity for independent execution of daily activities. Recovery from impairment is accomplished by ‘restitution’ and recovery from activity limitation is accomplished by the combined effect of ‘restitution’ and ‘compensation.’ We aimed to unravel the long-term effects of variation in lesion topography on motor impairment of the hemiparetic lower limb (HLL), and gait capacity as a measure of related activity limitation. Gait was assessed by the 3 m walk test (3MWT) in 67 first-event chronic stroke patients, at their homes. Enduring impairment of the HLL was assessed by the Fugl–Meyer Lower Extremity (FMA-LE) test. The impact of variation in lesion topography on HLL impairment and on walking was analyzed separately for left and right hemispheric damage (LHD, RHD) by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). In the LHD group, HLL impairment tended to be affected by damage to the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC). Walking capacity tended to be affected by a larger array of structures: PLIC and corona radiata, external capsule and caudate nucleus. In the RHD group, both HLL impairment and walking capacity were sensitive to damage in a much larger number of brain voxels. HLL impairment was affected by damage to the corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus and insula. Walking was affected by damage to the same areas, plus the internal and external capsules, putamen, thalamus and parts of the perisylvian cortex. In both groups, voxel clusters have been found where damage affected FMA-LE and also 3MWT, along with voxels where damage affected only one of the measures (mainly 3MWT). In stroke, enduring ‘activity limitation’ is affected by damage to a much larger array of brain structures and voxels within specific structures, compared to enduring ‘impairment.’ Differences between the effects of left and right hemisphere damage are likely to reflect variation in motor-network organization and post-stroke re-organization related to hemispheric dominance. Further studies with larger sample size are required for the validation of these results.</p>

<p>For successful goal-directed behavior, a performance monitoring system is essential. It detects behavioral errors and initiates behavioral adaptations to improve performance. Two electrophysiological potentials are known to follow errors in reaction time tasks: the error-related negativity (ERN), which is linked to error processing, and the error positivity (Pe), which is associated with subjective error awareness. Furthermore, the correct-related negativity (CRN) is linked to uncertainty about the response outcome. Here we attempted to identify the involvement of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the aforementioned performance monitoring processes. To this end, we simultaneously recorded cortical activity (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) during a flanker task performed by four patients with severe opioid abuse disorder who underwent electrode implantation in the NAc for deep brain stimulation. We observed significant accuracy-related modulations in the LFPs at the time of the ERN/CRN in two patients and at the time of Pe in three patients. These modulations correlated with the ERN in 2/8, with CRN in 5/8 and with Pe in 6/8, recorded channels, respectively. Our results demonstrate the functional interrelation of striatal and cortical processes in performance monitoring specifically related to error processing and subjective error awareness.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.629380">Identification of Exploration and Exploitation Balance in the Silkmoth Olfactory Search Behavior by Information-Theoretic Modeling</a></h4>

<p>Insects search for and find odor sources as their basic behaviors, such as when looking for food or a mate. This has motivated research to describe how they achieve such behavior under turbulent odor plumes with a small number of neurons. Among different insects, the silk moth has been studied owing to its clear motor response to olfactory input. In past studies, the “programmed behavior” of the silk moth has been modeled as the average duration of a sequence of maneuvers based on the duration of periods without odor hits. However, this model does not fully represent the fine variations in their behavior. In this study, we used silk moth olfactory search trajectories from an experimental virtual reality device. We achieved an accurate input by using optogenetic silk moths that react to blue light. We then modeled such trajectories as a probabilistic learning agent with a belief of possible source locations. We found that maneuvers mismatching the programmed behavior are related to larger entropy decrease, that is, they are more likely to increase the certainty of the belief. This implies that silkmoths include some stochasticity in their search policy to balance the exploration and exploitation of olfactory information by matching or mismatching the programmed behavior model. We believe that this information-theoretic representation of insect behavior is important for the future implementation of olfactory searches in artificial agents such as robots.</p>

<p>Objective: To explore microstructural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) abnormalities in individuals with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD plus) using diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and three-dimensional (3D) arterial spin labeling (ASL).</p><p>Methods: Twenty-seven patients with SCD plus, 31 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 33 elderly controls (ECs) were recruited and underwent DKI and 3D ASL using a GE 3.0-T MRI. Mean kurtosis (MK), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and CBF values were acquired from 24 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain, including the bilateral hippocampal (Hip) subregions (head, body, and tail), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, dorsal thalamus subregions (anterior nucleus, ventrolateral nucleus, and medial nucleus), lenticular nucleus, caput nuclei caudati, white matter (WM) of the frontal lobe, and WM of the occipital lobe. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships among the DKI-derived parameters, CBF values, and key neuropsychological tests for SCD plus.</p><p>Results: Compared with ECs, participants with SCD plus showed a significant decline in MK and CBF values, mainly in the Hip head and PCC, and participants with aMCI exhibited more significant abnormalities in the MK and CBF values than individuals with ECs and SCD plus in multiple regions. Combined MK values showed better discrimination between patients with SCD plus and ECs than that obtained using CBF levels, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.874 and 0.837, respectively. Similarly, the AUC in discriminating SCD plus from aMCI patients obtained using combined MK values was 0.823, which was also higher than the combined AUC of 0.779 obtained using CBF values. Moreover, MK levels in the left Hip (h) and left PCC positively correlated with the auditory verbal learning test-delayed recall (AVLT-DR) score in participants with SCD plus. By contrast, only the CBF value in the left Hip head positively correlated with the AVLT-DR score.</p><p>Conclusions: Our results provide new evidence of microstructural and CBF changes in patients with SCD plus. MK may be used as an early potential neuroimaging biomarker and may be a more sensitive DKI parameter than CBF at the very early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>

<p>Objective: This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers of diabetic vascular dementia (DVD) and unravel the underlying mechanisms using mass spectrometry (MS).</p><p>Methods: Label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analysis was applied to urine samples from four groups, including 14 patients with vascular dementia (VD), 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 12 patients with DVD, and 21 normal controls (NCs). Searching the MS data by Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA), protein abundances were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared between these groups. Combining bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology (GO), pathway crosstalk analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using STRING, and literature searching, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of DVD can be comprehensively judged and were further quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods.</p><p>Results: The proteomic findings showed quantitative changes in patients with DVD compared to patients with NC, T2DM, and VD groups; among 4,744 identified urine proteins, 1,222, 1,152, and 1,180 proteins displayed quantitative changes unique to DVD vs. NC, T2DM, and VD, respectively, including 481 overlapped common DEPs. Then, nine unique proteins [including HP, SERPIND, ATP5PB, VNN2, ALDH3A1, U2AF2, C6, A0A5C2GRG5 (no name), and A0A5C2FZ29 (no name)] and two composite markers (CM) (A0A5C2GRG5+U2AF2 and U2AF2+C6) were confirmed by a ROC curve method.</p><p>Conclusion: This study provided an insight into the potential pathogenesis of DVD and elucidated a method for early detection.</p>

<p>Age-related changes in cortico-cortical connectivity in the human motor network in older adults are associated with declines in hand dexterity. Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is strongly interconnected with motor areas and plays a critical role in many aspects of motor planning. Functional connectivity measures derived from dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (dsTMS) studies have found facilitatory inputs from PPC to ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) in younger adults. In this study, we investigated whether facilitatory inputs from PPC to M1 are altered by age. We used dsTMS in a conditioning-test paradigm to characterize patterns of functional connectivity between the left PPC and ipsilateral M1 and a standard pegboard test to assess skilled hand motor function in 13 young and 13 older adults. We found a PPC-M1 facilitation in young adults but not older adults. Older adults also showed a decline in motor performance compared to young adults. We conclude that the reduced PPC-M1 facilitation in older adults may be an early marker of age-related decline in the neural control of movement.</p>

<p>Background: The long-term administration of levodopa (L-dopa), the gold-standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), is irreparably associated with L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which dramatically affects the quality of life of patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how LID exacerbates remain unknown. Neuroinflammation in the striatum plays an active role in LID. These findings prompt an investigation of non-neuronal mechanisms of LID. This study will examine the effects of systemic inflammation in the development and progression of LID.</p><p>Methods: To evaluate the possible influence of systemic inflammation in the appearance of LID, the PD rats received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of various concentrations of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg) or saline. One day later, these PD rats started to receive daily treatment with L-dopa (6 mg/kg) along with benserazide (6 mg/kg) or saline for 21 days, and dyskinesia was evaluated at several time points. Moreover, the activation of microglia and astrocytes and the molecular changes in NR2B and mGLUR5 signaling pathways were measured.</p><p>Results: We found that systemic inflammatory stimulation with LPS exacerbated the intensity of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) induced by L-dopa treatment in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. The LPS injection activated the gliocytes and increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the striatum in LID rats. The PD rats that received the LPS injection showed the overexpression of p-NR2B and NR2B, as well as activated PKC/MEK/ERK and NF-κB signal pathways in response to the L-dopa administration. On the contrary, clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (Clo-lipo), which could suppress the inflammatory response induced by peripheral LPS injection, improved behavioral dysfunction, inhibited neuroinflammation, prevented NR2B overexpression, and decreased the phosphorylation of PKC/MEK/ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.</p><p>Conclusion: This study suggests that systemic inflammation, by exacerbating preexisting neuroinflammation and facilitating NR2B subunit activity, may play a crucial role in the development of LID. The administration of Clo-lipo restores the effects of LPS and decreases the susceptibility to LID in 6-OHDA lesioned rats.</p>

<p>by Shinsuke Koyama, Taiki Horie, Shigeru Shinomoto</p>

After slowing down the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, many countries have started to relax their confinement measures in the face of critical damage to socioeconomic structures. At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l3J0qpBlzNo" width="1" />

<p>by Alessandro Toso, Arash Fassihi, Luciano Paz, Francesca Pulecchi, Mathew E. Diamond</p>

The connection between stimulus perception and time perception remains unknown. The present study combines human and rat psychophysics with sensory cortical neuronal firing to construct a computational model for the percept of elapsed time embedded within sense of touch. When subjects judged the duration of a vibration applied to the fingertip (human) or whiskers (rat), increasing stimulus intensity led to increasing perceived duration. Symmetrically, increasing vibration duration led to increasing perceived intensity. We modeled real spike trains recorded from vibrissal somatosensory cortex as input to dual leaky integrators–an intensity integrator with short time constant and a duration integrator with long time constant–generating neurometric functions that replicated the actual psychophysical functions of rats. Returning to human psychophysics, we then confirmed specific predictions of the dual leaky integrator model. This study offers a framework, based on sensory coding and subsequent accumulation of sensory drive, to account for how a feeling of the passage of time accompanies the tactile sensory experience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qk53SeMoaUo" width="1" />

<p>by Martina Conte, Sergio Casas-Tintò, Juan Soler</p>

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, due to its great infiltration capacity. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the Glioblastoma invasion front is a major challenge with preeminent potential clinical relevances. In the infiltration front, the key features of tumor dynamics relate to biochemical and biomechanical aspects, which result in the extension of cellular protrusions known as tumor microtubes. The coordination of metalloproteases expression, extracellular matrix degradation, and integrin activity emerges as a leading mechanism that facilitates Glioblastoma expansion and infiltration in uncontaminated brain regions. We propose a novel multidisciplinary approach, based on in vivo experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> and mathematical models, that describes the dynamics of active and inactive integrins in relation to matrix metalloprotease concentration and tumor density at the Glioblastoma invasion front. The mathematical model is based on a non-linear system of evolution equations in which the mechanisms leading chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and front dynamics compete with the movement induced by the saturated flux in porous media. This approach is able to capture the relative influences of the involved agents and reproduce the formation of patterns, which drive tumor front evolution. These patterns have the value of providing biomarker information that is related to the direction of the dynamical evolution of the front and based on static measures of proteins in several tumor samples. Furthermore, we consider in our model biomechanical elements, like the tissue porosity, as indicators of the healthy tissue resistance to tumor progression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vza9Fm7jS7Q" width="1" />

A key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the generation time, or more generally the distribution of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account. Although the existence of a chronically infected population still remains largely hypothetical, we believe that our results provide tentative evidence to consider a chronically infected population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Vs3a-TSzn0" width="1" />

We consider the following general family of algorithmic problems that arises in transcriptomics, metabolomics and other fields: given a weighted graph G and a subset of its nodes S, find subsets of S that show significant connectedness within G. A specific solution to this problem may be defined by devising a scoring function, the Maximum Clique problem being a classic example, where S includes all nodes in G and where the score is defined by the size of the largest subset of S fully connected within G. Major practical obstacles for the plethora of algorithms addressing this type of problem include computational efficiency and, particularly for more complex scores which take edge weights into account, the computational cost of permutation testing, a statistical procedure required to obtain a bound on the p-value for a connectedness score. To address these problems, we developed CTD “Connect the Dots”, a fast algorithm based on data compression that detects highly connected subsets within S. CTD provides information-theoretic upper bounds on p-values when S contains a small fraction of nodes in G without requiring computationally costly permutation testing. We apply the CTD algorithm to interpret multi-metabolite perturbations due to inborn errors of metabolism and multi-transcript perturbations associated with breast cancer in the context of disease-specific Gaussian Markov Random Field networks learned directly from respective molecular profiling data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Wd4YcxPwLg" width="1" />

<i>Gambiense</i> human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a virulent disease declining in burden but still endemic in West and Central Africa. Although it is targeted for elimination of transmission by 2030, there remain numerous questions about the drivers of infection and how these vary geographically.
In this study we focus on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which accounted for 84% of the global case burden in 2016, to explore changes in transmission across the country and elucidate factors which may have contributed to the persistence of disease or success of interventions in different regions. We present a Bayesian fitting methodology, applied to 168 endemic health zones (∼100,000 population size), which allows for calibration of a mechanistic gHAT model to case data (from the World Health Organization HAT Atlas) in an adaptive and automated framework.
It was found that the model needed to capture improvements in passive detection to match observed trends in the data within former Bandundu and Bas Congo provinces indicating these regions have substantially reduced time to detection. Health zones in these provinces generally had longer burn-in periods during fitting due to additional model parameters.
Posterior probability distributions were found for a range of fitted parameters in each health zone; these included the basic reproduction number estimates for pre-1998 (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) which was inferred to be between 1 and 1.14, in line with previous gHAT estimates, with higher median values typically in health zones with more case reporting in the 2000s.
Previously, it was not clear whether a fall in active case finding in the period contributed to the declining case numbers. The modelling here accounts for variable screening and suggests that underlying transmission has also reduced greatly—on average 96% in former Equateur, 93% in former Bas Congo and 89% in former Bandundu—Equateur and Bandundu having had the highest case burdens in 2000. This analysis also sets out a framework to enable future predictions for the country.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tPdTwUVzmjI" width="1" />

Beta-lactam- and in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent a major public health threat. Despite strong variation of resistance across geographical settings, there is limited understanding of the underlying drivers. To assess these drivers, we developed a transmission model of cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The model is parameterized using antibiotic consumption and demographic data from eleven European countries and fitted to the resistance rates for <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> for these settings. The impact of potential drivers of resistance is then assessed in counterfactual analyses. Based on reported consumption data, the model could simultaneously fit the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (ESBL and CRK) across eleven European countries over eleven years. The fit could explain the large between-country variability of resistance in terms of consumption patterns and fitted differences in hospital transmission rates. Based on this fit, a counterfactual analysis found that reducing nosocomial transmission and antibiotic consumption in the hospital had the strongest impact on ESBL and CRK prevalence. Antibiotic consumption in the community also affected ESBL prevalence but its relative impact was weaker than inpatient consumption. Finally, we used the model to estimate a moderate fitness cost of CRK and ESBL at the population level. This work highlights the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and of nosocomial transmission for resistance in gram-negative bacteria at a European level. This indicates that infection control and antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role in limiting resistance even at the national or regional level.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GGttMT652VA" width="1" />

Gene regulatory network inference is essential to uncover complex relationships among gene pathways and inform downstream experiments, ultimately enabling regulatory network re-engineering. Network inference from transcriptional time-series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time-series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance and additionally infers whether causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time-series data of differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2768 genes and 31, 945 directed edges (FDR ≤ 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: Overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project. BETS is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/lujonathanh/BETS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zCJP259WSfo" width="1" />

The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best explored neuroethological model systems. The study presents a histological investigation of the nuclei of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), a songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience.







Abstract
The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best studied neuroethological model systems. So far, it has been treated as a relatively constrained sensorimotor system. Songbirds such as crows, however, are also known for their capability to cognitively control their audio‐vocal system. Yet, the neuroanatomy of the corvid song system has never been explored systematically. We aim to close this scientific gap by presenting a stereotactic investigation of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), an oscine songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience. In order to identify and delineate the song nuclei, the ascending auditory nuclei, and the descending vocal‐motor nuclei, four stains were applied. In addition to the classical Nissl‐, myelin‐, and a combination of Nissl‐and‐myelin staining, staining for tyrosine hydroxylase was used to reveal the distribution of catecholaminergic neurons (dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic) in the song system. We show that the crow brain contains the important song‐related nuclei, including auditory input and motor output structures, and map them throughout the brain. Fiber‐stained sections reveal putative connection patterns between the crow's song nuclei comparable to other songbirds.

Objective
Severe complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of incident pediatric strokes with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the first 3 months of the pandemic in an international cohort.


Methods
We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (≤ 18 years) patients with SARS‐CoV‐2; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing for pediatric patients with stroke; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March 1 to May 31, 2020.


Results
Of 42 centers with SARS‐CoV‐2 hospitalization numbers, 8 of 971 (0.82%) pediatric patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March to May 2020 were: 1 of 108 with neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0 of 33 with neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6 of 166 with childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1 of 54 with childhood CSVT (1.9%). However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9, 0, 6.1, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Seven of 8 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and stroke had additional established stroke risk factors.


Interpretation
As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS‐CoV‐2, and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in only 4.6% of pediatric patients with ischemic stroke tested for the virus. However, &lt; 50% of strokes were tested. To understand the role of SARS‐CoV‐2 in pediatric stroke better, SARS‐CoV‐2 testing should be considered in pediatric patients with stroke as the pandemic continues. ANN NEUROL 2021

Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal’s directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed 1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, 2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, 3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and 4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus . Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain’s spatial processing circuitry.

Our study demonstrates that simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in rats is feasible with an MRI‐compatible electrode montage. We found that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neural activity and functional connectivity in rat brain, while cortical functional connectivity is differentially affected under the tDCS cathode and anode.

Abstract
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique implicated as a promising adjunct therapy to improve motor function through the neuromodulation of brain networks. Particularly bilateral tDCS, which affects both hemispheres, may yield stronger effects on motor learning than unilateral stimulation. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory study was to develop an experimental model for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bilateral tDCS in rats, to measure instant and resultant effects of tDCS on network activity and connectivity. Naïve, male Sprague‐Dawley rats were divided into a tDCS (n = 7) and sham stimulation group (n = 6). Functional MRI data were collected during concurrent bilateral tDCS over the sensorimotor cortex, while resting‐state functional MRI and perfusion MRI were acquired directly before and after stimulation. Bilateral tDCS induced a hemodynamic activation response, reflected by a bilateral increase in blood oxygenation level‐dependent signal in different cortical areas, including the sensorimotor regions. Resting‐state functional connectivity within the cortical sensorimotor network decreased after a first stimulation session but increased after a second session, suggesting an interaction between multiple tDCS sessions. Perfusion MRI revealed no significant changes in cerebral blood flow after tDCS. Our exploratory study demonstrates successful application of an MRI‐compatible bilateral tDCS setup in an animal model. Our results indicate that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neuronal activity and connectivity, which may underlie its therapeutic potential.

<p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is an epileptic syndrome caused by mutations in the Scn1a gene encoding the α1 subunit of the sodium channel Nav1.1, which is associated with febrile seizures that progress to severe tonic-clonic seizures and associated comorbidities. Treatment with cannabidiol has been approved to reduce seizures in DS, but it may also be active against these comorbidities. The aim of this study was to validate a new mouse model of DS having lower mortality than previous models, which may serve to further evaluate therapies for the long-term comorbidities. This new model consists of heterozygous conditional knock-in mice carrying a missense mutation (A1783V) in Scn1a gene expressed exclusively in neurons of the CNS (Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup>). These mice have been used here to determine the extent and persistence of the behavioral deterioration in different postnatal days (PND), as well as to investigate the alterations that the disease produces in the endocannabinoid system and the contribution of inflammatory events and impaired neurogenesis in the pathology. Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice showed a strong reduction in hindlimb grasp reflex at PND10, whereas at PND25, they presented spontaneous convulsions and a greater susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures, marked hyperactivity, deficient spatial working memory, lower levels of anxiety, and altered social interaction behavior. These differences disappeared at PND40 and PND60, except the changes in social interaction and anxiety. The analysis of CNS structures associated with these behavioral alterations revealed an elevated glial reactivity in the prefrontal cortex and the dentate gyrus. This was associated in the dentate gyrus with a greater cell proliferation detected with Ki67 immunostaining, whereas double-labeling analyses identified that proliferating cells were GFAP-positive suggesting failed neurogenesis but astrocyte proliferation. The analysis of the endocannabinoid system of Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice confirmed reductions in CB<sub>1</sub> receptors and MAGL and FAAH enzymes, mainly in the cerebellum but also in other areas, whereas CB<sub>2</sub> receptors became upregulated in the hippocampus. In conclusion, Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice showed seizuring susceptibility and several comorbidities (hyperactivity, memory impairment, less anxiety, and altered social behavior), which exhibited a pattern of age expression similar to DS patients. Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice also exhibited greater glial reactivity and a reactive response in the neurogenic niche, and regional changes in the status of the endocannabinoid signaling, events that could contribute in behavioral impairment.</p>

<p>According to ancient texts on poetics, the concept of representation is deeply bound to that of “mimesis;” this last was intended in two main ways: as “imitation” and as “world construction.” In Aristotle's Poetics, mimesis is theorized as the main form of “world simulation,” giving rise to the complex universe of fiction. The concept of simulation plays a pivotal role in the neurocognitive theories on the embodied mind: within this frame, embodied simulation is intended as a functional prelinguistic activation of the human sensorimotor mechanism. This happens not only with regard to intercorporeality and intersubjectivity in the real world but also in relation to the process of imagination giving rise to literary imagery and to the reader's reception of the fictional world, since human beings share a common sensorimotor apparatus. Imagination is a central concept in the recent neurocognitive studies since it plays a core role in human life and in artistic production and reception. Imagination has been considered as a complex emergent cognitive faculty deeply intertwined with perception, memory, and consciousness, shaping human life and transforming the limited horizon of our perceptual affective understanding, being, and acting. Although there is an immense bulk of literature on this topic, imagination is still an elusive concept: its definition and understanding change according to different heuristic frames—mainly the philosophical, aesthetic, poetic, and cognitive ones—giving rise to debates about its modalities and effects, particularly in relation to the construction of aesthetic and symbolic constraints. In this paper, we claim that scientific research may take advantage from the literary representation of the imaginative faculties, which occurs in specific tests characterized by dynamic images and motion. In such meta-representation of the imagination, we witness the phenomenological emergence of endogenous dynamic processes involving a cluster of cognitive faculties, activated by triggering the reader's embodied simulation. One of the main German poets, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in the second part of his masterwork Faust II, intuitively represents the very process of the imagination and its responding to embodied simulation with regard both to the author's creative act and to its reception by the reader. At the crossway between literary and neurocognitive, this study aims to highlight the advantage offered to future transdisciplinary inquiries by the literary representation showing features and dynamics of the still mysterious phenomenon of the imagination.</p>

<p>The potential benefits of priming intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) have not been examined in regard to sensorimotor oscillatory activities recorded in electroencephalography (EEG). The objective of this study was to investigate the modulatory effect of priming iTBS (cTBS followed by iTBS) delivered to the motor cortex on movement-related and mirror visual feedback (MVF)-induced sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD), compared with iTBS alone, on healthy adults. Twenty participants were randomly allocated into Group 1: priming iTBS—cTBS followed by iTBS, and Group 2: non-priming iTBS—sham cTBS followed by iTBS. The stimulation was delivered to the right primary motor cortex daily for 4 consecutive days. EEG was measured before and after 4 sessions of stimulation. Movement-related ERD was evaluated during left-index finger tapping and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD was evaluated by comparing the difference between right-index finger tapping with and without MVF. After stimulation, both protocols increased movement-related ERD and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD in high mu and low beta bands, indicated by significant time effects. A significant interaction effect favoring Group 1 in enhancing movement-related ERD was observed in the high mu band [F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 4.47, p = 0.049], compared with Group 2. Our experiment suggests that among healthy adults priming iTBS with cTBS delivered to the motor cortex yields similar effects with iTBS alone on enhancing ERD induced by MVF-based observation, while movement-related ERD was more enhanced in the priming iTBS condition, specifically in the high mu band.</p>

<p>Visual attention evolved as an adaptive mechanism allowing us to cope with a rapidly changing environment. It enables the facilitated processing of relevant information, often automatically and governed by implicit motives. However, despite recent advances in understanding the relationship between consciousness and visual attention, the functional scope of unconscious attentional control is still under debate. Here, we present a novel masking paradigm in which volunteers were to distinguish between varying orientations of a briefly presented, masked grating stimulus. Combining signal detection theory and subjective measures of awareness, we show that performance on unaware trials was consistent with visual selection being weighted towards repeated orientations of Gabor patches and reallocated in response to a novel unconsciously processed orientation. This was particularly present in trials in which the prior feature was strongly weighted and only if the novel feature was invisible. Thus, our results provide evidence that invisible orientation stimuli can trigger the reallocation of history-guided visual selection weights.</p>

<p>The middle longitudinal fascicle (MdLF) is a long, associative white matter tract connecting the superior temporal gyrus (STG) with the parietal and occipital lobe. Previous studies show different cortical terminations, and a possible segmentation pattern of the tract. In this study, we performed a post-mortem white matter dissection of 12 human hemispheres and an in vivo deterministic fiber tracking of 24 subjects acquired from the Human Connectome Project to establish whether a constant organization of fibers exists among the MdLF subcomponents and to acquire anatomical information on each subcomponent. Moreover, two clinical cases of brain tumors impinged on MdLF territories are reported to further discuss the anatomical results in light of previously published data on the functional involvement of this bundle. The main finding is that the MdLF is consistently organized into two layers: an antero-ventral segment (aMdLF) connecting the anterior STG (including temporal pole and planum polare) and the extrastriate lateral occipital cortex, and a posterior-dorsal segment (pMdLF) connecting the posterior STG, anterior transverse temporal gyrus and planum temporale with the superior parietal lobule and lateral occipital cortex. The anatomical connectivity pattern and quantitative differences between the MdLF subcomponents along with the clinical cases reported in this paper support the role of MdLF in high-order functions related to acoustic information. We suggest that pMdLF may contribute to the learning process associated with verbal-auditory stimuli, especially on left side, while aMdLF may play a role in processing/retrieving auditory information already consolidated within the temporal lobe.</p>

<p>Background/Aim: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RT), which can reflect the status of the retinal optic nerve cells, may be affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are few studies on the correlation of RT of patients with AD (AD-RT) with clinical symptoms of various cognitive domains, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living (ADL). This study is to investigate the relationships between RT and the abovementioned clinical symptoms of AD.</p><p>Methods: A total of 96 patients with AD were included in this study. RT was measured in these patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Demographic variables, RT, and clinical symptoms were compared between the normal and the abnormal AD-RT groups. Clinical symptoms, including cognitive symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and ADL, were evaluated using a series of rating scales.</p><p>Results: The relationships between RT and cognitive symptoms scores were analyzed in patients with AD. Reduced RT was found in 54.4% of patients with AD. The average RT, RT of the superior 1/2 quadrant, and RT of the inferior 1/2 quadrant of both eyes were all significantly decreased in the abnormal AD-RT group (p &lt; 0.001). Overall cognitive function and performance in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention, and executive function, were also significantly impaired in the abnormal AD-RT group (p &lt; 0.05). For lower RT value, the global cognitive function and the performance in multiple cognitive domains were worse. ADL was significantly compromised in patients with AD having lower RT values (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: Lower RT value appear to be correlated with cognitive impairment, and RT may be an indicator of cognitive decline in patients with AD. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.</p>

Microstructural changes in the middle brain.

Abstract
A recent randomized controlled trial in young patients with long‐term post‐concussion symptoms showed that a novel behavioral intervention “Get going After concussIoN” is superior to enhanced usual care in terms of symptom reduction. It is unknown whether these interventional effects are associated with microstructural brain changes. The aim of this study was to examine whether diffusion‐weighted MRI indices, which are sensitive to the interactions between cellular structures and water molecules' Brownian motion, respond differently to the interventions of the above‐mentioned trial and whether such differences correlate with the improvement of post‐concussion symptoms. Twenty‐three patients from the intervention group (mean age 22.8, 18 females) and 19 patients from the control group (enhanced usual care) (mean age 23.9, 14 females) were enrolled. The primary outcome measure was the mean kurtosis tensor, which is sensitive to the microscopic complexity of brain tissue. The mean kurtosis tensor was significantly increased in the intervention group (p = 0.003) in the corpus callosum but not in the thalamus (p = 0.78) and the hippocampus (p = 0.34). An increase in mean kurtosis tensor in the corpus callosum tended to be associated with a reduction in symptoms, but this association did not reach significance (p = 0.059). Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics did not differ between intervention groups and were not associated with symptoms. The current study found different diffusion‐weighted MRI responses from the microscopic cellular structures of the corpus callosum between patients receiving a novel behavioral intervention and patients receiving enhanced usual care. Correlations with improvement of post‐concussion symptoms were not evident.

iTBS has a stronger decision promoting effect than 20 Hz, which can be used as an effective way to alter choice and presents an improvement on standard rTMS protocols.

Abstract
Traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can only produce a significant but weak effect on the cortex while theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned accelerated form of stimulation, can produce a stronger poststimulation effect, which may improve decision‐making abilities. We designed a comparative assessment of the effect of intermittent TBS (iTBS), 20 Hz, in two risk decision‐making tasks on healthy controls. Participants were randomized and assigned to the iTBS (n = 29), 20 Hz (n = 29), or sham (n = 29) groups. The effects of the different methods of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on risk decision‐making functions were compared based on subjects’ performance in the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and Risky Gains Task (RGT). The main indicators were positive and negative feedback utilization rates of GDT and RGT. Both iTBS and 20 Hz stimulation resulted in significant improvements upon negative feedback in the GDT, with increases in safe options and reductions in risky options; iTBS stimulation increased subjects’ use of positive feedback in the GDT and RGT (all p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group had a stronger feedback risk reduction effect than the 20 Hz or sham group following RGT negative feedback (p &lt; 0.05). Individuals would integrate positive and negative information more efficiently, leading to them making rational choices after excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, iTBS has a stronger risk reduction effect following negative feedback than the 20Hz stimulation did. In summary, iTBS might have clinical value in decision promotion.

Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with g‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.

Abstract
Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath g‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not vice versa. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) elicit inhibitory modulation of synaptic transmission at various brain sites. We now show that neither a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55212 nor an eCB affect GABA release from axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) making synaptic contacts with their target neurons, globular cells in the cerebellar cortex and principal neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The finding is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic modulation, suggesting that the synapse type‐selective action of eCBs in the cerebellar neural circuitry allows the precise control of motor coordination and learning associated with the cerebellum.

Abstract
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as ubiquitous modulators of synaptic transmission via the activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make strong inhibitory synaptic contacts not only with neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but also with Lugaro cells and globular cells, whose cell bodies are located underneath the PC layer. However, little is known about the modulatory actions of eCBs on GABA release from PC axon terminals. Here, we examined the effects of eCBs on the GABAergic transmission at PC‐globular cell synapses and PC‐large DCN neuron synapses electrophysiologically using mouse cerebellar slices. We showed that the types 1 and 2 CBR agonist WIN55212 did not affect either spontaneous or miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in globular cells under control conditions and in a state of enhanced synaptic activity. By contrast, another Gi/o protein‐coupled receptor agonist, baclofen, significantly reduced the miniature IPSC frequency in globular cells. WIN55212 had no effects on IPSCs in large DCN neurons. A type 2 CBR agonist, HU308, also had no effects on IPSCs in either globular cells or large DCN neurons. Moreover, the PCs' target neurons did not elicit depolarization‐induced suppression of inhibition. These results suggest the lack of a functional role of CBRs at PCs' axon terminals. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic inhibitory modulation. The actions of eCBs are selective to distinct synapses and possibly contribute to information processes and rigorous signal transmission in the cerebellum.

Following permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion, we measured plasmin activity in mouse brain slices utilizing a novel direct method. Positive correlation between plasmin level and infarct volume was found and demonstrated by a representative tetrazolium chloride staining of slice no. 6. Scale bars: 1 mm.

Abstract
Many coagulation factor proteases are increased in the brain during ischemic stroke. One of these proteases is plasmin. In this study we established a novel method for direct quantitative measurement of plasmin activity in male mouse brain slices using a sensitive fluorescent substrate in the presence of specific protease inhibitors. In both the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, plasmin activity increased 3, 6, and 24 hr following stroke in comparison to healthy mice (F(3, 72) = 39.5, p &lt; 0.0001, repeated measures ANOVA) after the induction of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAo). Plasmin activity was higher in the ischemic hemisphere (F(1,36) = 9.1, p = 0.005) and there was a significant interaction between time and ischemic hemisphere (F(3,36) = 4.4, p = 0.009). Plasmin activity was correlated with infarct volume (R2 = 0.5289, p = 0.0009 by Spearman). The specificity of the assay was verified utilizing tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA)‐deficient mice which, as expected, had significantly lower levels of plasmin 24 hr following ischemia compared to wild‐type mice (ischemic (0.6 ± 0.23 and 1.94 ± 0.5, respectively), p = 0.049 and contralateral hemispheres (0.13 ± 0.14 and 0.75 ± 0.10, respectively), p = 0.018 by t test). There is a time‐dependent increase in plasmin levels and an association of higher levels of plasmin with larger infarct volumes in an experimental stroke model. This suggests caution in the use of recombinant tPA (rtPA) and that plasmin inhibition in the brain may be a therapeutic target in acute ischemic stroke.

We find that the levels of the m6A methylase Mettl3 are upregulated following spinal cord injury (SCI) in both zebrafish and mice. Additionally, Mettl3 disruption leads to poor motor function recovery in zebrafish SCI.

Abstract
RNA methylation is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of RNA methylation in spinal cord regeneration has not been reported. In this study, we find an altered m6A (N6‐methyladenosine) RNA methylation profiling following zebrafish spinal cord injury (SCI), in line with an altered transcription level of the m6A methylase Mettl3. Interestingly, many of the differential m6A‐tagged genes associated with neural regeneration are hypomethylated, but their transcription levels are upregulated in SCI. Moreover, we find that METTL3 may be important for spinal cord regeneration. We also show a conserved feature of METTL3 changes in mouse SCI model, in which the expression of METTL3 is increased in both astrocytes and neural stem cells. Together, our results indicate that m6A RNA methylation is dynamic and conserved following SCI and may contribute to spinal cord regeneration.

Graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in brain networks that may be missed by regional comparisons. The present study found evidence that compensatory network reorganization likely occurs in a frontal dopamine D2 receptor network to preserve cognitive function in Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive impairment. 

Abstract
Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common sequela of the disorder that has a large impact on patient well‐being. Its physiological etiology, however, remains elusive. Our study used graph theory analysis to investigate the large‐scale topological patterns of the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor network. We used positron emission tomography with [11C]FLB‐457 to measure the binding potential of cortical dopamine D2 receptors in two networks: the meso‐cortical dopamine network and the meso‐limbic dopamine network. We also investigated the application of partial volume effect correction (PVEC) in conjunction with graph theory analysis. Three groups were investigated in this study divided according to their cognitive status as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with a score ≤25 considered cognitively impaired: (a) healthy controls (n = 13, 11 female), (b) cognitively unimpaired PD patients (PD‐CU, n = 13, 5 female), and (c) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI, n = 17, 4 female). In the meso‐cortical network, we observed increased small‐worldness, normalized clustering, and local efficiency in the PD‐CU group compared to the PD‐MCI group, as well as a hub shift in the PD‐MCI group. Compensatory reorganization of the meso‐cortical dopamine D2 receptor network may be responsible for some of the cognitive preservation observed in PD‐CU. These results were found without PVEC applied and PVEC proved detrimental to the graph theory analysis. Overall, our findings demonstrate how graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in the brain that would otherwise be missed by regional comparisons of receptor density.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamine synthetase (GS), ALDH1L1, and SOX9 stained different percentages of cortical and spinal cord astrocytes in vitro. SOX9 in cortical and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures consistently stained astrocytes in naïve and transforming growth factor‐β‐treated cultures.

Abstract
Astrocytes are responsible for a wide variety of essential functions throughout the central nervous system. The protein markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1), glutamine synthetase (GS), 10‐formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1), and the transcription factor SOX9 are routinely used to label astrocytes in primary rodent cultures. However, GLAST, GLT‐1, GS, and SOX9 are also produced by microglia and oligodendrocytes and GFAP, GLAST, GLT‐1, and GS production levels are affected by astrocyte phenotypic changes associated with reactive astrogliosis. No group has performed a comprehensive immunocytochemical evaluation to quantify the percentage of cells labeled by these markers in vitro, nor compared changes in staining between cortex‐ and spinal cord‐derived cells in naïve and stimulated cultures. Here, we quantified the percentage of cells positively stained for these six markers in astrocyte, microglia, and oligodendrocyte cultures isolated from neonatal rat cortices and spinal cords. Additionally, we incubated the astrocytes with transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 or TGF‐β3 to determine if the labeling of these markers is altered by these stimuli. We found that only SOX9 in cortical cultures and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures labeled more than 75% of the cells in naïve and stimulated astrocyte cultures and stained less than 5% of the cells in microglia and oligodendrocyte cultures. Furthermore, significantly more cortical than spinal cord astrocytes stained for GFAP, GLAST, and ALDH1L1 in naïve cultures, whereas significantly more spinal cord than cortical astrocytes stained for GLAST and GS in TGF‐β1‐treated cultures. These findings are important as variability in marker staining may lead to misinterpretation of the astrocyte response in cocultures, migration assays, or engineered disease models.

(c) The image on the left shows a cartoon representation of the cornea corresponding to the immunostained images (panels on the right) from the central cornea (dotted circle, top panel) and limbal/peripheral area (dotted rectangle, bottom panel). Detailed magnified views reveal DKK1‐positive staining in nm‐cSCs of the central cornea, as well as myelinated SCs of the peripheral cornea. Scale bars, 10 µm. 

Abstract
The cornea is the most innervated tissue in the human body. Myelinated axons upon inserting into the peripheral corneal stroma lose their myelin sheaths and continue into the central cornea wrapped by only nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs). This anatomical organization is believed to be important for central vision. Here we employed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), microscopy, and transgenics to characterize these nm‐cSCs of the central cornea. Using principal component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection, and unsupervised hierarchal cell clustering of scRNA‐seq data derived from central corneal cells of male rabbits, we successfully identified several clusters representing different corneal cell types, including a unique cell cluster representing nm‐cSCs. To confirm protein expression of cSC genes, we performed cross‐species validation, employing corneal whole‐mount immunostaining with confocal microscopy in mouse corneas. The expression of several representative proteins of nm‐cSCs were validated. As the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene was also expressed in nm‐cSCs, we explored the Plp1‐eGFP transgenic reporter mouse line to visualize cSCs. Specific and efficient eGFP expression was observed in cSCs in adult mice of different ages. Of several putative cornea‐specific SC genes identified, Dickkopf‐related protein 1 was shown to be present in nm‐cSCs. Taken together, our findings, for the first time, identify important insights and tools toward the study nm‐cSCs in isolated tissue and adult animals. We expect that our results will advance the future study of nm‐cSCs in applications of nerve repair, and provide a resource for the study of corneal sensory function.

All neurons possess a primary cilium that projects from the cell body into the extracellular space. This study investigates the behavioral responses of mice engineered to lack a primary cilium on either Gad2 expressing GABAergic neurons, or Dopaminergic neurons, to injections of amphetamine.

Abstract
The neural mechanisms that underlie responses to drugs of abuse are complex, and impacted by a number of neuromodulatory peptides. Within the past 10 years it has been discovered that several of the receptors for neuromodulators are enriched in the primary cilia of neurons. Primary cilia are microtubule‐based organelles that project from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. Despite what we know about cilia, our understanding of how cilia regulate neuronal function and behavior is still limited. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of primary cilia on specific neuronal populations to behavioral responses to amphetamine. To test the consequences of cilia loss on amphetamine‐induced locomotor activity we selectively ablated cilia from dopaminergic or GAD2‐GABAergic neurons in mice. Cilia loss had no effect on baseline locomotion in either mouse strain. In mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons, locomotor activity compared to wild‐ type mice was reduced in both sexes in response to acute administration of 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine. In contrast, changes in the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons were primarily driven by reductions in locomotor activity in males. Following repeated amphetamine administration (1.0 mg kg−1 day−1 over 5 days), mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons exhibited enhanced sensitization of the locomotor stimulant response to the drug, whereas mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons did not differ from wild‐type controls. These results indicate that cilia play neuron‐specific roles in both acute and neuroplastic responses to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.

Abstract
Without protective and/or therapeutic agents the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 is quickly spreading worldwide. It has surprising transmissibility potential, since it could infect all ages, gender, and human sectors. It attacks respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, hepatic, and endovascular systems and can reach the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) through known and unknown mechanisms. The reports on the neurological manifestations and complications of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are increasing exponentially. Herein, we enumerate seven candidate routes, which the mature or immature SARS‐CoV‐2 components could use to reach the CNS and PNS, utilizing the within‐body cross talk between organs. The majority of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients suffer from some neurological manifestations (e.g., confusion, anosmia, and ageusia). It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune‐mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS. This means that the blood–endothelial barrier may be considered as the main route for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the nervous system, with the barrier disruption being more logical than barrier permeability, as evidenced by postmortem analyses.

Abstract
Preterm birth is a global public health problem. A large number of preterm infants survive with preterm white matter injury (PWMI), which leads to neurological deficits, and has multifaceted etiology, clinical course, monitoring, and outcomes. The principal upstream insults leading to PWMI initiation are hypoxia‐ischemia and infection and/or inflammation and the key target cells are late oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Current PWMI treatments are mainly supportive, and thus have little effect in terms of protecting the immature brain or repairing injury to improve long‐term outcomes. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells comprise abundant immunomodulatory and stem cells, which have the potential to reduce brain injury, mainly due to anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms, and also through their release of neurotrophic or growth factors to promote endogenous neurogenesis. In this review, we briefly summarize PWMI pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and the specific properties of different cell types in UCB. We further explore the potential mechanism by which UCB can be used to treat PWMI, and discuss the advantages of and potential issues related to UCB cell therapy. Finally, we suggest potential future studies of UCB cell therapy in preterm infants.

By using targeted metabolomics methods, the differential metabolites of hippocampal tissues of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and wild‐type mice at an early age and the pathogenesis associated with these metabolites were obtained.

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease in people of age 65 or above. The detailed etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not been elucidated yet. In this study, the hippocampi of 2‐ and 6‐month‐old triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and age–sex‐matched wild‐type (WT) mice were analyzed by using targeted metabolomics approach. Compared with WT mice, 24 and 60 metabolites were found with significant differences in 2‐ and 6‐month‐old AD mice. Among these, 14 metabolites were found common while 10 metabolites showed consistent variable trends in both groups. These differential metabolites are found associated with amino acid, lipid, vitamin, nucleotide‐related base, neurotransmitter and energy metabolisms, and oxidative stress. The results suggest that these differential metabolites might play a critical role in AD pathophysiology, and may serve as potential biomarkers for AD. Moreover, the results highlight the involvement of abnormal purine, pyrimidine, arginine, and proline metabolism, along with glycerophospholipid metabolism in early pathology of AD. For the first time, several differential metabolites are found to be associated with AD in this study. Targeted metabolomics can be used for rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of specific target metabolites associated with AD.

Activation of TRPV4 inhibited IK through activating CaMKII in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and decreased the expression of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 in hippocampi.

TRPV4‐induced decrease of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.










Abstract
Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) can increase hippocampal neuronal excitability. TRPV4 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Voltage‐gated potassium channels (VGPCs) play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and abnormal VGPCs expression or function is related to epilepsy. Here, we examined the effect of TRPV4 activation on the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on the Kv subunits expression in male mice. We also explored the role of TRPV4 in changes in Kv subunits expression in male mice following pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus (PISE). Application of TRPV4 agonists, GSK1016790A and 5,6‐EET, markedly reduced IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and shifted the voltage‐dependent inactivation curve to the hyperpolarizing direction. GSK1016790A‐ and 5,6‐EET‐induced inhibition of IK was blocked by TRPV4 specific antagonists, HC‐067047 and RN1734. GSK1016790A‐induced inhibition of IK was markedly attenuated by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II (CaMKII) antagonist. Application of GSK1016790A for up to 1 hr did not change the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv2.1. Intracerebroventricular injection of GSK1016790A for 3 d reduced the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1, leaving that of Kv1.1 unchanged. Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 protein levels as well as IK reduced markedly in hippocampi on day 3 post PISE, which was significantly reversed by HC‐067047. We conclude that activation of TRPV4 inhibits IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, possibly by activating CaMKII. TRPV4‐induced decrease in Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.

Standard phase lag index (standard‐PLI) and offset‐PLI (insensitive and sensitive to zero‐lag connectivity, respectively) for pairs of electrodes separated by more than 105 mm plotted against their homotopic distance. Significant connectivity (dots above the red‐dashed line) is found only between homotopic regions and mostly for zero‐lag connectivity (offset‐PLI).

Abstract
Whether neuronal populations exhibit zero‐lag (in‐phase or in‐antiphase) functional connectivity is a fundamental question when conceptualizing communication between cell assemblies. It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long‐distance zero‐lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero‐lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (&lt;20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero‐lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.

Objective
Neurology residency program websites often serve as the initial face of a program for prospective residents early in the application process. We evaluated adult neurology residency program websites to determine their comprehensiveness to identify areas for improvement.


Methods
A list of adult neurology residency programs in the United States was compiled using information on the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) websites. A total of 24 website criteria covering educational, recruitment, and compensation content were assessed for comprehensiveness. Programs’ website comprehensiveness was compared based on geographic location, program affiliation (community and/or academic), program size, and program/hospital Doximity and U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings.


Results
A total of 153 US adult neurology residency program websites were evaluated. Fewer than one‐half of program websites were accessible with a direct link from either FREIDA or ERAS. The number of residency program websites reporting each content criterion varied greatly. Mean percentage of overall website comprehensiveness among neurology residency programs was 65.9%. Northeast location, academic affiliation, larger programs, and top‐ranked programs on Doximity were associated with greater program website comprehensiveness.


Interpretation
There is opportunity for all neurology residency programs to improve their websites to provide prospective applicants with a more informed and comprehensive perspective of programs during the application process. ANN NEUROL 2021

The synaptic circuitry of primary sensory thalamic nuclei has been well characterized and shows striking similarities both in terminal morphology and chemical characteristics. The exception to this is the taste thalamus, the VPMP. A past study of synaptic circuitry in the rat taste thalamus (VPMpc) revealed marked differences from other nuclei like the LGN and MGN. Our data demonstrate that the tree shrew VPMP shares synaptic characteristics common to primary sensory thalamic nuclei including presynaptic interneuron dendrites, large VGluT2 positive terminals, and triadic arrangements in glomeruli.







Abstract
Ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis (VPMP) nucleus of the primate thalamus receives direct input from the nucleus of the solitary tract, whereas the homologous thalamic structure in the rodent does not. To reveal whether the synaptic circuitries in these nuclei lend evidence for conservation of design principles in the taste thalamus across species or across sensory thalamus in general, we characterized the ultrastructural and molecular properties of the VPMP in a close relative of primates, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), and compared these to known properties of the taste thalamus in rodent, and the visual thalamus in mammals. Electron microscopy analysis to categorize the synaptic inputs in the VPMP revealed that the largest‐size terminals contained many vesicles and formed large synaptic zones with thick postsynaptic density on multiple, medium‐caliber dendrite segments. Some formed triads within glomerular arrangements. Smaller‐sized terminals contained dark mitochondria; most formed a single asymmetric or symmetric synapse on small‐diameter dendrites. Immuno‐EM experiments revealed that the large‐size terminals contained VGLUT2, whereas the small‐size terminal populations contained VGLUT1 or ChAT. These findings provide evidence that the morphological and molecular characteristics of synaptic circuitry in the tree shrew VPMP are similar to that in nonchemical sensory thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the results indicate that all primary sensory nuclei of the thalamus in higher mammals share a structural template for processing thalamocortical sensory information. In contrast, substantial morphological and molecular differences in rodent versus tree shrew taste nuclei suggest a fundamental divergence in cellular processing mechanisms of taste input in these two species.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23306?af=R">A selective role for the mPFC during choice and deliberation, but not spatial memory retention over short delays</a></h4>

Abstract
Important interactions between memory and decision‐making processes are required to maintain high‐levels of spatial working memory task performance. Past research reveals that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) are both vital structures involved in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that interactions between these two structures are dynamic and task dependent. However, there exists uncertainty surrounding the specific conditions that recruit mPFC contributions to these tasks, specifically regarding its role in retaining information online during delay periods. To address this issue, we tested rats on a spatial‐delayed alternation task in which we utilized a closed‐loop optogenetic system to transiently disrupt mPFC activity during different task epochs (delay, choice, return). By analyzing the effects of mPFC disruption on choice accuracy and a deliberative behavior known as vicarious‐trial‐and‐error (VTE), our study revealed several interesting findings regarding the role of the mPFC in spatial‐working memory tasks. The main findings include: (a) choice accuracy in the spatial‐delayed alternation (SDA) task was impaired when the mPFC was disrupted during the choice epoch and not delay or return epochs, (b) mPFC disruption resulted in a non‐epoch specific reduction in VTE occurrence which correlated with impairments in task performance. Taken together, findings from this study suggest that, during spatial decision‐making, contributions made by the mPFC are specific to points of deliberation and choice (not delay), and that VTEs are a deliberative behavior which relies on intact mPFC function.

<p>by Peter J. Hotez</p>

The United States witnessed an unprecedented politicization of biomedical science starting in 2015 that has exploded into a complex, multimodal anti-science empire operating through mass media, political elections, legislation, and even health systems. Anti-science activities now pervade the daily lives of many Americans, and threaten to infect other parts of the world. We can attribute the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans from COVID-19, measles, and other vaccine-preventable diseases to anti-science. The acceleration of anti-science activities demands not only new responses and approaches but also international coordination. Vaccines and other biomedical advances will not be sufficient to halt COVID-19 or future potentially catastrophic illnesses, unless we simultaneously counter anti-science aggression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Vk3iDm8mdcc" width="1" />

Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick–vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick–host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cQR89AeJ09s" width="1" />

Objective
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4+‐lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations, which could implicate imbalance of axon‐myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis.


Methods
Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from patients with MS and non‐neurological/non‐MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity.


Results
In MS brains, we detected blister‐like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non‐neurological/non‐MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution, and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin.


Interpretation
Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post‐translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS. ANN NEUROL 2021

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25099?af=R">Identification and localization of a gonadotropin‐releasing hormone‐related neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an intermediate host for schistosomiasis</a></h4>

Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone in the central nervous system and periphery of Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within Biomphalaria, S. mansoni larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as “parasitic castration.” As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate Biomphalaria reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in Biomphalaria alexandrina that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH2 (designated Biom‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against Biom‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of Biomphalaria glabrata. GnRH‐like immunoreactive fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of Biomphalaria could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.

The diabetic patients with A-waves showed faster conduction velocity in all quartiles in the motor peroneal nerves compared to the patients without A-waves, and their CVD histograms were shifted to the right side, consisting of a significantly larger percentage of fast conducting fibers. There was no significant difference in the CVD values of the upper extremity nerves among the patients with and without A-waves and the healthy controls.</p><p>Conclusion: A-waves could occur in type II diabetes as early as when NCS showed normal, and represented as a sign of neuropathy as well as a sign of rescued motor nerve function.</p>

<p>Experts apply their experience to the proper development of their routine activities. Their acquired expertise or professionalization is expected to help in the development of those recurring tasks. Media professionals spend their daily work watching narrative contents on screens, so learning how they manage visual perception of those contents could be of interest in an increasingly audiovisual society. Media works require not only the understanding of the storytelling, but also the decoding of the formal rules and presentations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 36 participants (18 media professionals and 18 non-media professionals) while they were watching audiovisual contents, and compared their eyeblink rate and their brain activity and connectivity. We found that media professionals decreased their blink rate after the cuts, suggesting that they can better manage the loss of visual information that blinks entail by sparing them when new visual information is being presented. Cuts triggered similar activation of basic brain processing in the visual cortex of the two groups, but different processing in medial and frontal cortical areas, where media professionals showed a lower activity. Effective brain connectivity occurred in a more organized way in media professionals–possibly due to a better communication between cortical areas that are coordinated for decoding new visual content after cuts.</p>

<p>Background: Regaining control of movement following a spinal cord injury (SCI) requires utilization and/or functional reorganization of residual descending, and likely ascending, supraspinal sensorimotor pathways, which may be facilitated via task-specific training through body weight supported treadmill (BWST) training. Recently, epidural electrical stimulation (ES) combined with task-specific training demonstrated independence of standing and stepping functions in individuals with clinically complete SCI. The restoration of these functions may be dependent upon variables such as manipulation of proprioceptive input, ES parameter adjustments, and participant intent during step training. However, the impact of each variable on the degree of independence achieved during BWST stepping remains unknown.</p><p>Objective: To describe the effects of descending intentional commands and proprioceptive inputs, specifically body weight support (BWS), on lower extremity motor activity and vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) during ES-enabled BWST stepping in humans with chronic sensorimotor complete SCI. Furthermore, we describe perceived changes in the level of assistance provided by clinicians when intent and BWS are modified.</p><p>Methods: Two individuals with chronic, mid thoracic, clinically complete SCI, enrolled in an IRB and FDA (IDE G150167) approved clinical trial. A 16-contact electrode array was implanted in the epidural space between the T11-L1 vertebral regions. Lower extremity motor output and vertical ground reaction forces were obtained during clinician-assisted ES-enabled treadmill stepping with BWS. Consecutive steps were achieved during various experimentally-controlled conditions, including intentional participation and varied BWS (60% and 20%) while ES parameters remain unchanged.</p><p>Results: During ES-enabled BWST stepping, the knee extensors exhibited an increase in motor activation during trials in which stepping was passive compared to active or during trials in which 60% BWS was provided compared to 20% BWS. As a result of this increased motor activation, perceived clinician assistance increased during the transition from stance to swing. Intentional participation and 20% BWS resulted in timely and purposeful activation of the lower extremities muscles, which improved independence and decreased clinician assistance.</p><p>Conclusion: Maximizing participant intention and optimizing proprioceptive inputs through BWS during ES-enabled BWST stepping may facilitate greater independence during BWST stepping for individuals with clinically complete SCI.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02592668.</p>

<p>Findings regarding sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as far as core symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities (PC) are concerned, are inconsistent, inconclusive, or conflicting among studies. The lower prevalence of ASD in females than in males and the age and intelligence quotient (IQ) heterogeneity among samples made it difficult to investigate these differences. This case–control study tries to deepen the impact of sex differences on core symptoms of autism and PC in 214 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 45.26) without impairment in non-verbal IQ (nvIQ ≥70). A total of 107 ASD females (mean age, 44.51 ± 13.79 months) were matched one by one with 107 males (mean age, 46.01 ± 13.42 months) for chronological age (±6 months) and nvIQ (±6 points). We used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5–5 to explore autism severity and PC. The results highlight that ASD females did not significantly differ from ASD males regarding the severity of autism. Statistically significant lower levels of emotionally reactive (p = 0.005, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.04), anxious-depressed (p = 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.05), internalizing problems (p = 0.04, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.02), and DSM-Oriented Scales anxiety problems (p = 0.02, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.04) in ASD females than in ASD males were also detected. Our findings of no difference in the autism severity and lower internalizing problems in females than males with ASD extend the knowledge of autism in females during preschool years. Compared to other similar studies on this topic, we can state that these results are not supported by differences in nvIQ between sexes nor by the presence of cognitive impairment. It confirms the need for clinicians to consider sex differences when describing autism psychopathology.</p>

<p>The first families with LRRK2 related Parkinson’s disease (PD) were presented around 15 years ago and numerous papers have described the characteristics of the LRRK2 phenotype. The prevalence of autosomal dominant PD varies around the world mainly depending on local founder effects. The highest prevalence of LRRK2 G2019S PD in Norway is located to the central part of the country and most families could be traced back to common ancestors. The typical Norwegian LRRK2 phenotype is not different from classical PD and similar to that seen in most other LRRK2 families. The discovery of LRRK2 PD has allowed us to follow-up multi-incident families and to study their phenotype longitudinally. In the Norwegian LRRK2 families there has been a significantly higher incidence of inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis that seen in other PD populations. Recent studies in LRRK2 mechanisms have indicated that this protein may be crucial in initiating disease processes. In this short survey of 100 Norwegian mutation carriers followed through more than 15 years are presented. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases among these cases is highlighted. The role of LRRK2 in the conversion process from carrier status to PD phenotype is still unknown and disease generating mechanisms important for initiating LRRK2 PD are still to be identified.</p>

<p>The advent of mobile electroencephalography (mEEG) has created a means for large scale collection of neural data thus affording a deeper insight into cognitive phenomena such as cognitive fatigue. Cognitive fatigue – a neural state that is associated with an increased incidence of errorful performance – is responsible for accidents on a daily basis which at times can cost human lives. To gain better insight into the neural signature of cognitive fatigue in the present study we used mEEG to examine the relationship between perceived cognitive fatigue and human-event related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in a sample of 1,000 people. As a secondary goal, we wanted to further demonstrate the capability of mEEG to accurately measure ERP and EEG data. To accomplish these goals, participants performed a standard visual oddball task on an Apple iPad while EEG data were recorded from a Muse EEG headband. Counter to traditional EEG studies, experimental setup and data collection was completed in less than seven minutes on average. An analysis of our EEG data revealed robust N200 and P300 ERP components and neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. In line with previous findings we observed correlations between ERP components and EEG power and perceived cognitive fatigue. Further, we demonstrate here that a linear combination of ERP and EEG features is a significantly better predictor of perceived cognitive fatigue than any ERP or EEG feature on its own. In sum, our results provide validation of mEEG as a viable tool for research and provide further insight into the impact of cognitive fatigue on the human brain.</p>

<p>Response inhibition (RI) and error monitoring (EM) are important processes of adaptive goal-directed behavior, and neural correlates of these processes are being increasingly used as transdiagnostic biomarkers of risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Potential utility of these purported biomarkers relies on the assumption that individual differences in brain activation are reproducible over time; however, available data on test-retest reliability (TRR) of task-fMRI are very mixed. This study examined TRR of RI and EM-related activations using a stop signal task in young adults (n = 56, including 27 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins) in order to identify brain regions with high TRR and familial influences (as indicated by MZ twin correlations) and to examine factors potentially affecting reliability. We identified brain regions with good TRR of activations related to RI (inferior/middle frontal, superior parietal, and precentral gyri) and EM (insula, medial superior frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). No subcortical regions showed significant TRR. Regions with higher group-level activation showed higher TRR; increasing task duration improved TRR; within-session reliability was weakly related to the long-term TRR; motion negatively affected TRR, but this effect was abolished after the application of ICA-FIX, a data-driven noise removal method.</p>

<p>15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome causes a spectrum of cognitive disorders, including intellectual disability and autism. We assessed the ability of the EEG analysis algorithm Brain Network Analysis (BNA) to measure cognitive function in 15q13.3 deletion patients, and to differentiate between patient and control groups. EEG data was collected from 10 individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14–18 years of age), as well as 30 age-matched healthy controls, as the subjects responded to Auditory Oddball (AOB) and Go/NoGo cognitive tasks. It was determined that BNA can be used to evaluate cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. This analysis also significantly differentiates between patient and control groups using 5 scores, all of which are produced from ERP peaks related to late cortical components that represent higher cognitive functions of attention allocation and response inhibition (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p>Nesfatin-1 is one of several brain-gut peptides that have a close relationship with the central dopaminergic system. Our previous studies have shown that nesfatin-1 is capable of protecting nigral dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity. A recent study also revealed a reduced blood level of nesfatin-1 in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The current study was designed to investigate whether reduced nesfatin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) induces nigrostriatal system degeneration. An intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection technique was used to administer anti-nesfatin-1 antibody directly into the lateral ventricle of the brain. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that ICV injection of anti-nesfatin-1 antibody into the lateral ventricle of the brain once daily for 2 weeks caused a significant reduction in nesfatin-1 levels in the CSF (93.1%). Treatment with anti-nesfatin-1 antibody resulted in a substantial loss (23%) of TH-positive (TH+) dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as shown by immunofluorescence staining, a depletion in dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and obvious nuclear shrinkage and mitochondrial lesions in dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the results from our Western blot and ELISA experiments demonstrated that anti-nesfatin-1 antibody injection induced an upregulation of caspase-3 activation, increased the expression of p-ERK, and elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the SNpc. Taken together, these observations suggest that reduced nesfatin-1 in the brain may induce nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degeneration; this effect may be mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction-related apoptosis. Our data support a role of nesfatin-1 in maintaining the normal physiological function of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.</p>

<p>Surgical decompression is the primary treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients with compressive spinal cord injury (CSCI). However, the prognosis of patients with CSCI varies, and the pathophysiological changes following decompression remain poor. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological changes and the role of Notch-1 activation after decompression in a rat CSCI model. Surgical decompression was conducted at 1 week post-injury (wpi). DAPT was intraperitoneally injected to down-regulate Notch-1 expression. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores and an inclined plane test were used to evaluate the motor function recovery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess pathophysiological changes, while hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, Notch-1, and Hes-1 expression in the spinal cord were examined by immunohistochemical analysis or quantitative PCR. The results show that early decompression can partially promote motor function recovery. Improvements in structural and cellular damage and hypoxic levels were also observed in the decompressed spinal cord. Moreover, decompression resulted in increased VEGF and vWF expression, but decreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression at 3 wpi. Expression levels of Notch-1 and its downstream gene Hes-1 were increased after decompression, and the inhibition of Notch-1 significantly reduced the decompression-induced motor function recovery. This exploratory study revealed preliminary pathophysiological changes in the compressed and decompressed rat spinal cord. Furthermore, we confirmed that early surgical decompression partially promotes motor function recovery may via activation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway after CSCI. These results could provide new insights for the development of drug therapy to enhance recovery following surgery.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with behavioral and cognitive impairment and brings huge burdens to the patients’ families and the society. To accurately identify patients with ASD from typical controls is important for early detection and early intervention. However, almost all the current existing classification methods for ASD based on structural MRI (sMRI) mainly utilize the independent local morphological features and do not consider the covariance patterns of these features between regions. In this study, by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and individual structural covariance network, we proposed a new framework to classify ASD patients with sMRI data from the ABIDE consortium. Moreover, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to characterize the weight of features contributing to the classification. The experimental results showed that our proposed method outperforms the currently used methods for classifying ASD patients with the ABIDE data and achieves a high classification accuracy of 71.8% across different sites. Furthermore, the discriminative features were found to be mainly located in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, which may be the early biomarkers for the diagnosis of ASD. Our study demonstrated that CNN is an effective tool to build the framework for the diagnosis of ASD with individual structural covariance brain network.</p>

<p>The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a typical neurophysiological application which helps paralyzed patients with human-machine communication. Stroke patients with motor disabilities are able to perform BCI tasks for clinical rehabilitation. This paper proposes an effective scheme of transfer calibration for BCI rehabilitation. The inter- and intra-subject transfer learning approaches can improve the low-precision classification performance for experimental feedback. The results imply that the systematical scheme is positive in increasing the confidence of voluntary training for stroke patients. In addition, it also reduces the time consumption of classifier calibration.</p>

<p>Leukodystrophies are a class of rare inherited central nervous system (CNS) disorders that affect the white matter of the brain, typically leading to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are characterized by the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath during development. POLR3-related or 4H (hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) leukodystrophy is one of the most common types of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy for which no curative treatment or disease-modifying therapy is available. This review aims to describe potential therapies that could be further studied for effectiveness in pre-clinical studies, for an eventual translation to the clinic to treat the neurological manifestations associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Here, we discuss the therapeutic approaches that have shown promise in other leukodystrophies, as well as other genetic diseases, and consider their use in treating POLR3-related leukodystrophy. More specifically, we explore the approaches of using stem cell transplantation, gene replacement therapy, and gene editing as potential treatment options, and discuss their possible benefits and limitations as future therapeutic directions.</p>
