                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Despite recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) techniques, primary rodent astrocytes remain the gold standard in coculture with human neurons. We demonstrate that a combination of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) directs hPSC-derived neural precursor cells to a highly pure population of astroglia in 28&nbsp;d. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we confirm the astroglial identity of these cells and highlight profound transcriptional adaptations in cocultured hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons, consistent with their further maturation. In coculture with human neurons, multielectrode array recordings revealed robust network activity of human neurons in a coculture with hPSC-derived or rat astrocytes [3.63 &plusmn; 0.44&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (hPSC-derived), 2.86 &plusmn; 0.64&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>= 0.19]. In comparison, we found increased spike frequency within network bursts of human neurons cocultured with hPSC-derived astrocytes [56.31 &plusmn; 8.56&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 24.77 &plusmn; 4.04&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.01], and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase of postsynaptic currents [2.76 &plusmn; 0.39&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 1.07 &plusmn; 0.14&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001], consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density [14.90 &plusmn; 1.27/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (hPSC-derived), 8.39 &plusmn; 0.63/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001]. Taken together, we show that hPSC-derived astrocytes compare favorably with rat astrocytes in supporting human neural network activity and maturation, providing a fully human platform for investigating astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.</p>

                <p>Much of what has been discovered concerning neurophysiological mechanisms can be credited to ex vivo biomedical experiments. Beyond these discoveries, ex vivo research techniques have enhanced the global understanding of human physiology and pathology in almost every biomedical specialty. Naturally, ex vivo experiments are among the most desired methods of research, particularly in the field of neuroscience. Ex vivo experiment platforms may be purchased commercially. However, their substantial cost and sometimes limited availability can render them inaccessible to many research labs. Moreover, these manufactured systems are often rigid in function with no possibility of customization, severely narrowing their capabilities. However, developing essential components for ex vivo laboratory systems with a fused deposition modeling printer provides a practical solution to each of these obstacles. Here, we provide the designs and construction process for an easily accessible, highly adaptable recording stage with modifiable submersion chambers using a 3D printer for a total cost under $15.00. With the versatility afforded by the exchangeable custom chambers, the system may be used to conduct research on a variety of ex vivo tissue preparations, paving the way for novel research.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background The current report describes a unimodular thyroid goiter (TGo), identified unilaterally in a female cadaver, causing displacement or compression effects in the adjacent neck structures (common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV),). Methods Routine dissection of the neck of an 86-year-old female donated a Greek cadaver. Results A thyroid gland variant was identified coexisting with a TGo originating from the left thyroid lobe. The variant is a pyramidal lobe located on the left side of the isthmus. Owing to the presence of the TGo, the left CCA, along with the left IJV, deviated 50.6 mm ipsilaterally from the midline of the neck. The right CCA had a minor deviation of 30.8 mm, from the midline to the right side due to the proximity of the shifted trachea and esophagus with the CCA origin. The trachea and esophagus deviated contralaterally to the TGo, 24.4 mm from the midline. Conclusions CCA compression, stenosis, and angulation may cause dizziness, weakness, and hypomnesia. The potential outcomes were worse with IJV compression. Atherosclerosis tends to occur more often in arteries with inclined (angulated) parts.

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. Methods This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. Discussion The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. Conclusion The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

In this study we characterize ten CSNK1A1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Monitoring and strict control of anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. The objective of this research was to explore the association of the quality of anticoagulation control with the occurrence of stroke, thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, or death during follow-up in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) on vitamin K antagonists. Methods A retrospective and observational study was carried out in clinical practice (real world data). Data were collected on age, sex, income level, occupational status, ischemic stroke, thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, death, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was measured using TAONet software and TTR ≥60% was considered indicative of good anticoagulation control. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models to compare time-to-event by quality of anticoagulation control. Determinants of anticoagulation quality were identified using logistic regression. Results Of 856 patients recruited, only 286 (33%) had a TTR ≥60%. Cox models including sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that the risk of all four events was much higher in the subsample with TTR <60% and the differences were statistically significant. Specifically, the hazard ratios (HRs) for this group were 1.94 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.30) for stroke, 1.60 (CI: 1.10-2.33) for thrombotic events, 1.61 (CI: 1.08-2.42) for hemorrhagic events and 2.97 (CIs: 1.86-4.75) for death. Conclusions The positive conclusion of the study was the markedly lower rate of events associated with TTR ≥60% and the negative conclusion was the low percentage of patients achieving good anticoagulation control. This implies that despite being “protected”, they continue to have a high risk of stroke, embolism, hemorrhagic complications and death. We believe it is necessary to develop and implement strategies to tackle this problem.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                <p>by Brian C. O’Meara, Jeremy M. Beaulieu</p>

Across a variety of biological datasets, from genomes to conservation to the fossil record, evolutionary rates appear to increase toward the present or over short time scales. This has long been seen as an indication of processes operating differently at different time scales, even potentially as an indicator of a need for new theory connecting macroevolution and microevolution. Here we introduce a set of models that assess the relationship between rate and time and demonstrate that these patterns are statistical artifacts of time-independent errors present across ecological and evolutionary datasets, which produce hyperbolic patterns of rates through time. We show that plotting a noisy numerator divided by time versus time leads to the observed hyperbolic pattern; in fact, randomizing the amount of change over time generates patterns functionally identical to observed patterns. Ignoring errors can not only obscure true patterns but create novel patterns that have long misled scientists.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Friedl De Groote, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

The metabolic energy rate of individual muscles is impossible to measure without invasive procedures. Prior studies have produced models to predict metabolic rates based on experimental observations of isolated muscle contraction from various species. Such models can provide reliable predictions of metabolic rates in humans if muscle properties and control are accurately modeled. This study aimed to examine how muscle-tendon model individualization and metabolic energy models influenced estimation of muscle-tendon states and time-series metabolic rates, to evaluate the agreement with empirical data, and to provide predictions of the metabolic rate of muscle groups and gait phases across walking speeds. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations with prescribed kinematics and dynamics were performed. An optimal control formulation was used to compute muscle-tendon states with four levels of individualization, ranging from a scaled generic model and muscle controls based on minimal activations, inclusion of calibrated muscle passive forces, personalization of Achilles and quadriceps tendon stiffnesses, to finally informing muscle controls with electromyography. We computed metabolic rates based on existing models. Simulations with calibrated passive forces and personalized tendon stiffness most accurately estimate muscle excitations and fiber lengths. Interestingly, the inclusion of electromyography did not improve our estimates. The whole-body average metabolic cost was better estimated with a subset of metabolic energy models. We estimated metabolic rate peaks near early stance, pre-swing, and initial swing at all walking speeds. Plantarflexors accounted for the highest cost among muscle groups at the preferred speed and were similar to the cost of hip adductors and abductors combined. Also, the swing phase accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total cost in a gait cycle, and its relative cost decreased with walking speed. Our prediction might inform the design of assistive devices and rehabilitation treatment. The code and experimental data are available online.

In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access R package that quantifies the impact of vector control interventions depending on mosquito species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 <i>Anopheles</i> species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.

An understanding of human brain individuality requires the integration of data on brain organization across people and brain regions, molecular and systems scales, as well as healthy and clinical states. Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known genetic–ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the <i>p</i>-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

     alt="Covariation of Skull and Brain Morphology in Domestic Dogs"/>
<p>Using T2-weighted MRI studies of 79 dogs, we find that skull shape covaries with brain morphology. Dogs with extreme skull shapes – brachycephaly and dolichocephaly – show regional reductions in relative gray matter volume.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite their distinct embryonic origins, the skull and brain are highly integrated. Understanding the covariation between the skull and brain can shed light on anatomical, cognitive, and behavioral traits in extant and extinct species. Domestic dogs offer a unique opportunity to investigate skull–brain covariation due to their diverse skull morphologies and neural anatomy. To assess this question, we examined <i>T</i>2-weighted MRI studies of 62 dogs from 33 breeds, plus an additional 17 dogs of mixed or unknown breeds. Scans were opportunistically collected from a veterinary teaching hospital of dogs that were referred for neurological examination but did not have grossly observable structural brain abnormalities. As the neurocrania of dogs become broader and shorter, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the right olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, marginal gyrus, and cerebellum. On the other hand, as the neurocrania of dogs become narrower and longer, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, and brainstem. Selective breeding for specific skull shapes may impact canine brain anatomy and function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1394/v7?src=rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 7; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to acid-catalysed cyclization of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 413 hemp-based products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 48 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Caggiano et al. report that short-term U2 snRNP inhibition elicits transient splicing defects while inducing long-lasting depletion of DNA repair factors, causing persistent DNA damage in genomically unstable triple-negative breast cancer. Pulsed inhibition of splicing mimics a sustained BRCAness condition and is a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance.

                Woo et al. developed and implemented a computational and experimental platform to identify and characterize non-coding driver regulatory regions in metastatic prostate cancer patient data. They find that the enhancer region GH22I030351 acts on a bidirectional promoter that simultaneously regulates the previously uncharacterized genes SF3A1 and CCDC157 in a tumor-promoting manner.

                Zhang et al. discovered that bookmarking factor FOXA1 undergoes dynamic phosphorylation at Serine 221 by Aurora B during mitosis, orchestrating its different DNA binding patterns and the periodic FOXA1 condensate formation during the cell cycle. Moreover, this phosphorylation regulates the target gene reactivation post-mitosis and cancer cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91636">Language experience shapes predictive coding of rhythmic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual systems heavily rely on prior knowledge and predictions to make sense of the environment. Predictions can originate from multiple sources of information, including contextual short-term priors, based on isolated temporal situations, and context-independent long-term priors, arising from extended exposure to statistical regularities. While the effects of short-term predictions on auditory perception have been well-documented, how long-term predictions shape early auditory processing is poorly understood. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography data from native speakers of two languages with different word orders (Spanish: functor-initial vs Basque: functor-final) listening to simple sequences of binary sounds alternating in duration with occasional omissions. We hypothesized that, together with contextual transition probabilities, the auditory system uses the characteristic prosodic cues (duration) associated with the native language’s word order as an internal model to generate long-term predictions about incoming non-linguistic sounds. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the amplitude of the mismatch negativity elicited by sound omissions varied orthogonally depending on the speaker’s linguistic background and was most pronounced in the left auditory cortex. Importantly, listening to binary sounds alternating in pitch instead of duration did not yield group differences, confirming that the above results were driven by the hypothesized long-term ‘duration’ prior. These findings show that experience with a given language can shape a fundamental aspect of human perception – the neural processing of rhythmic sounds – and provides direct evidence for a long-term predictive coding system in the auditory cortex that uses auditory schemes learned over a lifetime to process incoming sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87935">Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates sepsis by targeting p65 for NDP52-mediated autophagic degradation</a></h4>

              
                Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity component, plays an important role in polarized cellular and tissue morphology induction, growth development, and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<i>Vangl2</i><sup>ΔM</sup>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2-deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-κB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95888">TMC7 deficiency causes acrosome biogenesis defects and male infertility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a highly conserved ion channel family consisting of eight members (TMC1–TMC8) in mammals. TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <i>Tmc7</i> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <i>Tmc7</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the <i>cis</i>-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.

                Burden of stroke differs by region, which could be attributed to differences in comorbid conditions and ethnicity. Genomewide variation acts as a proxy marker for ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We present an integrated approach to understand this variation by considering prevalence and mortality rates of stroke and its comorbid risk for 204 countries from 2009 to 2019, and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk variant for all these conditions. Global and regional trend analysis of rates using linear regression, correlation, and proportion analysis, signifies ethnogeographic differences. Interestingly, the comorbid conditions that act as risk drivers for stroke differed by regions, with more of metabolic risk in America and Europe, in contrast to high systolic blood pressure in Asian and African regions. GWAS risk loci of stroke and its comorbid conditions indicate distinct population stratification for each of these conditions, signifying for population-specific risk. Unique and shared genetic risk variants for stroke, and its comorbid and followed up with ethnic-specific variation can help in determining regional risk drivers for stroke. Unique ethnic-specific risk variants and their distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium further uncover the drivers for phenotypic variation. Therefore, identifying population- and comorbidity-specific risk variants might help in defining the threshold for risk, and aid in developing population-specific prevention strategies for stroke.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97568">The bacterial quorum sensing signal 2’-aminoacetophenone rewires immune cell bioenergetics through the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis to mediate tolerance to infection</a></h4>

              
                How bacterial pathogens exploit host metabolism to promote immune tolerance and persist in infected hosts remains elusive. To achieve this, we show that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>PA</i>)<i>,</i> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2’-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in murine macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from decreased pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<i>Mpc1</i>), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (Esrra). Consequently, Esrra exhibits weakened binding to the <i>Mpc1</i> promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between Esrra and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and, consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized murine and human macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <i>Mpc1</i> and <i>Esrra and</i> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the in vitro findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <i>PA</i> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <i>PA</i> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedented mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis in its influence on Mpc1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <i>PA</i> clearance. These paradigmatic findings pave the way for developing treatments to bolster host resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91619">Conserved regulatory motifs in the juxtamembrane domain and kinase N-lobe revealed through deep mutational scanning of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase domain</a></h4>

              
                MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of the MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild-type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C-helix, pointing to potential differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for the kinase domain in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.

                Tumor neoantigen peptide vaccines hold potential for boosting cancer immunotherapy, yet efficiently co-delivering peptides and adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells in vivo remains challenging. Virus-like particle (VLP), which is a kind of multiprotein structure organized as virus, can deliver therapeutic substances into cells and stimulate immune response. However, the weak targeted delivery of VLP in vivo and its susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies hinder their clinical applications. Here, we first designed a novel protein carrier using the mammalian-derived capsid protein PEG10, which can self-assemble into endogenous VLP (eVLP) with high protein loading and transfection efficiency. Then, an engineered tumor vaccine, named ePAC, was developed by packaging genetically encoded neoantigen into eVLP with further modification of CpG-ODN on its surface to serve as an adjuvant and targeting unit to dendritic cells (DCs). Significantly, ePAC can efficiently target and transport neoantigens to DCs, and promote DCs maturation to induce neoantigen-specific T cells. Moreover, in mouse orthotopic liver cancer and humanized mouse tumor models, ePAC combined with anti-TIM-3 exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy. Overall, these results support that ePAC could be safely utilized as cancer vaccines for antitumor therapy, showing significant potential for clinical translation.

                Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

                We identified a novel mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) lineage derived from the common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) that is dependent on expression of <i>Bcl11a</i>. These CLP-derived pDCs, which we refer to as ‘B-pDCs’, have a unique gene expression profile that includes hallmark B cell genes, normally not expressed in conventional pDCs. Despite expressing most classical pDC markers such as SIGLEC-H and PDCA1, B-pDCs lack IFN-α secretion, exhibiting a distinct inflammatory profile. Functionally, B-pDCs induce T cell proliferation more robustly than canonical pDCs following Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. B-pDCs, along with another homogeneous subpopulation of myeloid-derived pDCs, display elevated levels of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, mirroring human AXL<sup>+</sup> transitional DCs in function and transcriptional profile. Murine B-pDCs therefore represent a phenotypically and functionally distinct CLP-derived DC lineage specialized in T cell activation and previously not described in mice.

">Overcoming the limitations of motion sensor models by considering dendritic computations</a></h4>

              
                The estimation of motion is a fundamental process for any sighted animal. Computational models for motion sensors have a long and successful history but they still suffer from fundamental shortcomings, as they disagree with physiological evidence and each model is dedicated to a specific type of motion, which is controversial from a biological standpoint. In this work we propose a new approach for modeling motion sensors that considers dendritic computations, a key aspect for predicting single-neuron responses that had previously been absent from motion models. We show how, by taking into account the dynamic and input-dependent nature of dendritic nonlinearities, our motion sensor model is able to overcome the fundamental limitations of standard approaches.

">A unified model of hippocampal spatial and object cells involving bidirectionally coupled Lateral and Medial Entorhinal Cortical layers</a></h4>

              
                Popularly referred to as the GPS of the brain, the hippocampus has a variety of neurons that encode spatial properties of the environment. These spatial cells of the hippocampus may be broadly placed under two categories - those that encode spatial locations (e.g., place cells, grid cells, etc.) and those that encode spatial objects (e.g., Object-sensitive cells. Object-trace cells, etc.). Some computational models explain the emergence of specific types of spatial cells, but it is challenging to construct integrative models that can demonstrate the emergence of the complete range of spatial cells, both space and object type. We present a simple, unified computational model that explains the emergence of a wide variety of object- and spatially-sensitive neurons in the hippocampus. The model is essentially a deep neural network that combines visual and path integration information. The visual information is received by a part of the model analogous to the Lateral Entorhinal Cortex (LEC), and path integration information is received by a layer analogous to the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC). LEC and MEC in the model are connected laterally using a Graph Neural Network to arrive at a consistent position estimate. The model is trained to predict the position, orientation, and reward of a simulated agent. The agent explores a box-like environment with colored walls and objects on the floor and is rewarded based on its encounters with objects. The model demonstrates the emergence of the following 7 types of spatial and object cells - place, grid, border, object, object-sensitive, object-vector, and object-trace cells. The model findings compare favorably with a large body of experimental literature on hippocampal spatial cells.

">Effort in Oculomotor Control: Role of Instructions and Reward on Spatio-temporal Eye Movement Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Effort is an important construct in several psychological disciplines, yet there is little consensus on how it manifests in behavior. Here, we focus on effort in terms of performance improvements beyond speed-accuracy tradeoffs and argue that oculomotor kinematics are conducive to a more fine-grained understanding of effortful behavior. Specifically, we investigated the efficiency and persistence of mere task instructions to induce transient effort. In a saccadic selection task, participants were instructed to look at targets as quickly and accurately as possible (standard instructions) or to mobilize all resources and respond even faster and more accurately ('to give 110%', effort instructions). We compared results to standard speeded performance (baseline block) and to a potential upper performance limit linking effort to performance-contingent rewards (reward block). Performance improved beyond speed-accuracy tradeoffs when reward was present. Effort instructions reduced saccade latencies, increased amplitudes and changed the saccade main sequence relationship. Yet, these effects were more strongly pronounced and more persistent over time when effort was additionally rewarded. Altogether, the present findings underscore the possibility to intentionally activate cognitive resources for regulating oculomotor performance. Yet, its effectiveness and maintenance over time are more successful when behavior is rendered purposeful by the presence of reward.

">Unsupervised, piecewise linear decoding enables an accurate prediction of muscle activity in a multi-task brain computer interface</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Creating an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) capable of seamless transitions between tasks and contexts would greatly enhance user experience. However, the nonlinearity in neural activity presents challenges to computing a global iBCI decoder. We aimed to develop a method that differs from a globally optimized decoder to address this issue. Approach. We devised an unsupervised approach that relies on the structure of a low-dimensional neural manifold to implement a piecewise linear decoder. We created a distinctive dataset in which monkeys performed a diverse set of tasks, some trained, others innate, while we recorded neural signals from the motor cortex (M1) and electromyographs (EMGs) from upper limb muscles. We used both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques to discover neural manifolds and applied unsupervised algorithms to identify clusters within those spaces. Finally, we fit a linear decoder of EMG for each cluster. A specific decoder was activated corresponding to the cluster each new neural data point belonged to. Main results. We found clusters in the neural manifolds corresponding with the different tasks or task sub-phases. The performance of piecewise decoding improved as the number of clusters increased and plateaued gradually. With only two clusters it already outperformed a global linear decoder, and unexpectedly, it outperformed even a global recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with 10-12 clusters. Significance. This study introduced a computationally lightweight solution for creating iBCI decoders that can function effectively across a broad range of tasks. EMG decoding is particularly challenging, as muscle activity is used, under varying contexts, to control interaction forces and limb stiffness, as well as motion. The results suggest that a piecewise linear decoder can provide a good approximation to the nonlinearity between neural activity and motor outputs, a result of our increased understanding of the structure of neural manifolds in motor cortex.

">Cognitive-and lifestyle-related microstructural variation in the ageing human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Ageing is a biological process associated with the natural degeneration of various regions of the brain. Alteration of neural tissue in the hippocampus with ageing typically results in cognitive decline that may serve as a risk factor for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. Modifiable lifestyle factors may help preserve hippocampal neural tissue (microstructure) and slow down neurodegeneration and thus promote healthy cognition in old age. In this study, we sought to identify potential modifiable lifestyle factors that may help preserve microstructure in the hippocampus. We used data from 494 subjects (36-100 years old) without clinical cognitive impairment from the Human Connectome Project-Aging study. We estimated hippocampal microstructure using myelin-sensitive (T1w/T2w ratio), inflammation-sensitive (MD) and fiber-sensitive (FA) MRI markers. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to integrate the signals of these images into a multivariate spatial signature of microstructure covariance across the hippocampus. The associations between hippocampal microstructural patterns and lifestyle factors & cognition were identified using partial least squares analysis. Our results reveal that the preservation of axon density and myelin in regions corresponding to subicular regions and CA1 to CA3 regions of the hippocampi of younger adults is associated with improved performance in executive function tasks, however, this is also associated with a decreased performance in memory tasks. We also show that microstructure is preserved across the hippocampus when there is normal hearing levels, physical fitness and normal insulin levels in younger adults of our study even in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors like high body mass index, blood pressure, triglycerides and blood glucose known to be associated with hippocampal neurodegeneration. This preservation is not observed in older adults when there are no normal levels of insulin, physical fitness and hearing. Taken together, our results suggest that certain lifestyle factors like normal hearing, physical fitness and normal insulin levels may help preserve hippocampal microstructure which may be useful in maintaining optimum performance on executive function tasks and potentially other modes of cognition.

">Probing other's Presence: Probabilistic Inference Across Brain Scales Reveals Enhanced Excitatory Synaptic Efficacy</a></h4>

              
                The presence of conspecifics is a fundamental and arguably invariant prerequisite of social cognition across numerous animal species. While the influence of social presence on behavior has been among the focal points of investigation in social psychology for over a century, its underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by investigating how the presence of conspecifics changes synaptic efficacy from measurements across spatiotemporal brain scales, and how such changes could lead to modulations of task performance in monkeys and humans. In monkeys performing an association learning task, social presence increased excitatory synaptic efficacy in attention-oriented regions dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. In humans performing a visuomotor task, the presence of conspecifics facilitated performance in one of the subject groups, and this facilitation was linked to enhanced excitatory synaptic efficacy within the dorsal and ventral attention networks. We propose that presence-induced improvements in task performance arise from attentional modulation mediated by changes in excitatory synaptic efficacy across three spatiotemporal brain scales, namely, micro-scale (single neurons), meso-scale (cortical columns) and macro-scale (whole-brain). Our findings from Bayesian learning converge to establish a novel, multi-scale framework for understanding the neural underpinnings of social presence effects. This probabilistic framework offers a fresh perspective on social presence research, and lays the groundwork for future investigations into the complex interplay between social presence, neural dynamics, and behavior.

">Chronobiological rhythms control of site- and cell-specific miRNA and mRNA genes and networks across the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Biological rhythms control gene expression, but effects on central nervous system (CNS) cells and structures remain undefined. While circadian (24-hour) rhythms are most studied, many genes have periods of greater and less than 24-hours; these fluctuations can be both site- and cell-specific. Identifying patterns of gene rhythmicity across the CNS is necessary for both the study of chronobiology and to make sense of data obtained in the laboratory. We now identify cycling mRNAs, miRNAs, gene networks and novel mRNA-miRNA co-expression pairs in the cortex, hypothalamus, and corpus striatum using high-dimensional datasets. A searchable catalogue (https://www.ghasemloulab.ca/chronoCNS) was created to help refine the analysis of cellular/molecular rhythmicity across the CNS. Immunofluorescence was also used to confirm the rhythmicity of key targets across cells in these structures, with strong cycling signatures in resting oligodendrocytes. Our study sheds light on the contribution of circadian, ultradian, and infradian rhythms and mRNA-miRNA interactions to CNS function.

">Respiration shapes response speed and accuracy with a systematic time lag</a></h4>

              
                Sensory-cognitive functions are intertwined with physiological processes such as the heart beat or respiration. For example, we tend to align our respiratory cycle to expected events or actions. This happens during sports but also in computer-based tasks and systematically structures respiratory phase around relevant events. However, studies also show that trial-by-trial variations in respiratory phase shape brain activity and the speed or accuracy of individual responses. We show that both phenomena, the alignment of respiration to expected events and the explanatory power of the respiratory phase on behaviour co-exist. In fact, both the average respiratory phase of an individual relative to the experimental trials and trial-to-trial variations in respiratory phase hold significant predictive power on behavioural performance, in particular for reaction times. This co-modulation of respiration and behaviour emerges regardless of whether an individual generally breathes faster or slower and is strongest for the respiratory phase about two seconds prior to participant's responses. The persistence of these effects across 12 datasets with 277 participants performing sensory-cognitive tasks confirm the robustness of these results, and suggest a profound and time-lagged influence of structured respiration on sensory-motor responses.

">Functional separation of long-range inputs by intrinsic dynamics of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons</a></h4>

              
                The serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receives diverse long-range synaptic inputs, yet the processing rules governing their contribution to DRN output spiking patterns are largely unknown. Here, we use electrophysiological, optogenetic and computational approaches to compare electrophysiological features of two major excitatory inputs onto DRN 5-HT neurons - the lateral habenula (LHb) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Dual-color opsin strategies revealed that a population of 5-HT neurons receive inputs from both mPFC and LHb. Subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered by both inputs were largely indistinguishable, yet suprathreshold spiking behavior exhibited input-specific latencies and dispersion statistics. A support vector machine classifier demonstrated that input identity can be accurately decoded from spike timing, but not subthreshold events, of under ten 5-HT neurons. Upon examining the intrinsic cellular mechanisms in 5-HT neurons that couple EPSPs to spiking dynamics, we uncovered two likely candidate mechanisms: a low-threshold calcium conductance that selectively boosts slow excitatory inputs, and a subthreshold, voltage-dependent membrane noise that generates variation of spike latency and jitter. Stochastic simulations suggest that these two intrinsic properties of 5-HT neurons are sufficient to transform LHb and mPFC inputs into distinct output spiking patterns. These results reveal that hub-like networks like the DRN can segregate distinct informational streams by a cell-intrinsic mechanism. The resulting emergent population spike synchrony code provides a means for the DRN to widely broadcast these streams as a multiplexed signals.

">Understanding The Myelin g ratio From First Principles, Its Derivation, Uses And Artifacts</a></h4>

              
                In light of the increasing importance for measuring myelin g ratios - the ratio of axon-to-fiber (axon + myelin) diameters in myelin internodes - to understand normal physiology, disease states, repair mechanisms and myelin plasticity, there is urgent need to minimize processing and statistical artifacts in current methodologies. Unfortunately, many contemporary studies fall prey to a variety of artifacts, which reduce study outcome robustness and slow development of novel therapeutics. Underlying causes stem from a lack of understanding of the myelin g ratio, which has persisted more than a century. An extended exploratory data analysis from first principles (the axon-fiber diameter relation) is presented herein and has major consequences for interpreting published g ratio studies. Indeed, a model of the myelin internode naturally emerges because of (1) the strong positive correlation between axon and fiber diameters and (2) the demonstration that the relation between these variables is one of direct proportionality. From this model, a robust framework for data analysis, interpretation and understanding allows specific predictions about myelin internode structure under normal physiological conditions. Further, the model establishes that a regression fit to g ratio plots has zero slope, and it identifies the underlying causes of several data processing artifacts that can be mitigated by plotting g ratios against fiber diameter (not axon diameter). Hypothesis testing can then be used for extending the model and evaluating myelin internodal properties under pathophysiological conditions (accompanying article). For without a statistical model as anchor, hypothesis testing is aimless like a rudderless ship on the ocean.

">In vivo quantification of creatine kinase kinetics in mouse brain using 31P-MRS at 7 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                31P-MRS is a method of choice for studying neuroenergetics in vivo, but its application in the mouse brain have been limited, often restricted to ultra-high field (>7 Tesla) MRI scanners. Establishing its feasibility on more readily available preclinical 7 Tesla (T) scanners would create new opportunities to study metabolism and physiology in murine models of brain disorders. Here, we demonstrate that the apparent forward rate constant (kf) of creatine kinase (CK) can be accurately quantified using a progressive saturation-transfer approach in the mouse brain at 7T. We also find that a reduction of approximately 20% in the breathing rate of anesthetized mice can lead to a 36% increase in kf attributable to a drop in intracellular pH and mitochondrial ATP production. To achieve this, we used a test-retest analysis to assess the reliability and repeatability of 31P-MRS acquisition, analysis and experimental design protocols. We report that most 31P-containing metabolites can be reliably measured using a localized 3D-ISIS sequence, which showed highest SNR amplitude, SNR consistency and minimal T2 relaxation signal loss. Using this protocol, our study identifies, for the first time, key physiological factors influencing mouse brain energy homeostasis in vivo and provides a methodological basis that will guide future studies interested in implementing 31P-MRS on preclinical 7T scanners.

">Test-retest reliability of resting-state EEG intrinsic neural timescales</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), which reflect the duration of neural information storage within local brain regions and capacity for information integration, are typically measured using autocorrelation windows (ACWs). Extraction of INTs from resting-state brain activity has been extensively applied in psychiatric disease research. Given the potential of INTs as a neural marker for psychiatric disorders, investigating their reliability is crucial. This study, using an open-source database, aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of ACW-0 and ACW-50 under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions across three sessions. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were employed to quantify the reliability of the INTs. Our results showed that INTs exhibited good reliability (ICC > 0.6) at the whole-brain level across different index types and eye states. Spatially, except for the right temporal region in the eyes-open condition, all other regions showed moderate-to-high ICCs. Over 60% of the electrodes demonstrated moderate-to-high INT ICCs under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, with ACW-0 being more stable than ACW-50. This present study comprehensively assessed the reliability of INT under various conditions, providing robust evidence for their stability in neuroscience and psychiatry.

">LM11a-31 Inhibits p75 Neurotrophin Receptor (p75NTR) Cleavage and is Neuroprotective in a Cell Culture Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                The p75 Neurotrophin Receptor (p75NTR) is a multifunctional transmembrane protein that mediates neuronal responses to pathological conditions in specific regions of the nervous system. In many biological contexts, p75NTR signaling is initiated through sequential cleavage of the receptor by - and {gamma}-secretases, which releases receptor fragments for downstream signaling. Our previous work demonstrated that proteolytic processing of p75NTR in this manner is stimulated by oxidative stress in Lund Human Mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells, a dopaminergic neuronal cell line derived from human mesencephalic tissue. Considering the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral mesencephalon to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigated the role of this signaling cascade in neurodegeneration and explored cellular processes that govern oxidative stress-induced p75NTR signaling. In the present study, we provide evidence that oxidative stress induces cleavage of p75NTR by promoting c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)-dependent internalization of p75NTR from the cell surface. This activation of p75NTR signaling is counteracted by tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor signaling; however, oxidative stress leads to Trk receptor downregulation, thereby enhancing p75NTR processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that this pathway can be inhibited by LM11a-31, a small molecule modulator of p75NTR, thereby conferring protection against neurodegeneration. Treatment with LM11a-31 significantly reduced p75NTR cleavage and neuronal death associated with oxidative stress. These findings reveal novel mechanisms underlying activation of p75NTR in response to oxidative stress, underscore a key role for p75NTR in dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and highlight p75NTR as a potential therapeutic target for reducing neurodegeneration in PD.

">Neural representation of vocalization self-monitoring in the bat auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                During acoustic interaction, mammals, including humans, not only monitor sounds from external sources but also their own vocalizations, the latter of which is known as vocalization feedback monitoring. Yet, it is unclear whether subcortical auditory regions process vocalization feedback. Here, we established an experimental paradigm that allows recording chronically the single-unit activity of the auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus) in freely vocalizing bats. We report that most collicular neurons represented self-produced biosonar vocalizations distinctively from pure tones and vocalization playbacks. Some neurons showed robust excitatory responses to vocalization feedback yet lacked any excitatory response to pure tones covering the entire frequency range of the vocalizations. Surprisingly, some collicular neurons even reversed the response polarity, from vocalization-induced suppression to vocalization-playback-induced excitation. Moreover, approximately a third of the neurons responded faster to self-produced vocalizations than to both vocalization playbacks and pure tones. These findings show that the midbrain inferior colliculus is involved in vocalization feedback processing, an ability suggested to arise locally in the auditory cortex.

                Climate change presents a fundamental threat to human populations and ecosystems across the globe. Neuroscience researchers have recently started developing ways to advance research on this topic. However, validated questionnaires, experimental stimuli, and fMRI tasks are still needed. Here we describe the CLIMATE BRAIN dataset, a multimodal collection of questionnaire, behavioural, and neuroimaging data related to climate change, acquired from 160 healthy individuals. In particular, it includes data from (1) various questionnaire measures, including the Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE); (2) a neuroimaging task for measuring emotional reactions to standardized Emotional Climate Change Stories (ECCS); and (3) a neuroimaging task based on Carbon Emission Task (CET) to measure climate action-taking. For technical validation, we provide image quality metrics and show the evidence for the effectiveness of tasks consistent with prior studies. To our knowledge, the proposed dataset is currently the only publicly available resource specifically designed to investigate human brain responses to climate change.

">Virally encoded single-chain antibody fragments targeting alpha-synuclein protect against motor impairments and neuropathology in a mouse model of synucleinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. Affected neurons exhibit intracellular aggregates primarily composed of misfolded and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (aSyn). In pathological conditions, this presynaptic protein has been shown to be transmitted from cell to cell in a prion-like manner, which contributes to the progression of the disease. Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are small polypeptides derived from the binding domains of antibodies that are less immunogenic and have better tissue penetration compared to full antibodies. In this work, we aimed to demonstrate the potential of extracellular scFvs to slow down the propagation of pathological aSyn in an in vivo model of synucleinopathy. We generated scFvs that target aSyn, and tested two of them in a PD mouse model consisting of transgenic M83 mice injected with human aSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs). The sequence encoding each anti-aSyn scFv was cloned in a self-complementary AAV2 viral vector, and purified particles were administered intravenously. CNS expression of either scFv protected against the development of paralysis and limb weakness, in addition to significantly reducing pathologic aggregates of phosphorylated aSyn in the brain. Moreover, in vitro results in human iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons suggest that the scFvs can mitigate aSyn spreading by preventing its internalization. Overall, our findings demonstrate that single-chain antibody fragments exhibit strong therapeutic potential in a preclinical mouse model. Thus, our minimally invasive, gene-mediated immunotherapy approach has the potential to serve as an effective treatment for halting the progression of Lewy body diseases.

">Burst firing optimizes invariant coding of natural communication signals by electrosensory neural populations</a></h4>

              
                Accurate perception of objects within the environment independent of context is essential for the survival of an organism. While neurons that respond in an invariant manner to identity-preserving transformations of objects are thought to provide a neural correlate of context-independent perception, how these emerge in the brain remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that burst firing in neural populations can give rise to an invariant representation of highly heterogeneous natural communication stimuli. Multi-unit recordings from central sensory neural populations showed that considering burst spike trains led to invariant representations at the population but not the single neuron level. Computational modeling further revealed that optimal invariance is achieved for levels of burst firing seen experimentally. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel function for burst firing towards establishing invariant representations of sensory input in neural populations.

">Differential Impact of Multiple Sensory Deprivation on Spatial-coding Cells in Medial Entorhinal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Spatial navigation depends on anchoring internal spatial maps to external environments, guided by sensory cues such as visual and tactile stimuli. The Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) is crucial for integrating these sensory inputs during the formation of spatial maps. While the responsiveness of many spatial-coding cells to visual stimuli is well-established, the role of tactile sensation in spatial representation is less understood. Rodents primarily gather tactile information through their whiskers, which provide essential spatial and textural details via whisking movements, potentially vital for constructing accurate spatial map. In our study, we employed advanced miniature two-photon microscopy to monitor neural activity in the MEC of freely moving mice subjected to sensory deprivation. Our findings revealed that head direction cells and border cells exhibited impaired spatial representation after either light deprivation or whisker trimming. In contrast, grid cells and speed cells were less affected by whisker trimming compared to visual deprivation, suggesting a stronger dependence on visual cues for these cell types. Notably, distinct subpopulations within each type of spatial-coding cell exhibited varying sensitivity to sensory deprivation-some neurons significantly changed their spatial-coding patterns, while others remained unaffected. This indicates that cells within the MEC may differ in their spatial-coding based on their sensitivity to external sensory inputs. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the activity of certain MEC neurons and whisker movement. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of how the MEC processes spatial information, particularly in relation to tactile sensation.

">Population coding of auditory space in the dorsal inferior colliculus persists with altered binaural cues</a></h4>

              
                Sound localization is critical for real-world hearing, such as segregating overlapping sound streams. For optimal flexibility, central representations of auditory space must adapt to peripheral changes in binaural cue availability, such as following asymmetric hearing loss in adulthood. However, whether the mature auditory system can reliably encode spatial auditory representations upon abrupt changes in binaural input is unclear. Here we use 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in awake head-fixed mice to determine how the higher-order shell layers of the inferior colliculus (IC) encode sound source location in the frontal azimuth, under binaural conditions and after acute monaural hearing loss induced by an ear plug ipsilateral to the imaged hemisphere. Spatial receptive fields were typically broad and not exclusively contralateral: Neurons responded reliably to multiple positions in the contra- and ipsilateral hemifields, with preferred positions tiling the entire frontal azimuth. Ear plugging broadened receptive fields and reduced spatial selectivity in a subset of neurons, in agreement with an inhibitory influence of ipsilateral sounds. However ear plugging also enhanced spatial tuning and/or unmasked receptive fields in other neurons, shifting the distribution of preferred angles ipsilaterally with minimal impact on the neuronal population's overall spatial resolution; these effects occurred within 2 hours of ear plugging. Consequently, linear classifiers trained on fluorescence data from control and ear-plugged conditions had similar classification accuracy when tested on held out data from within, but not across hearing conditions. Spatially informative neuronal population codes therefore arise rapidly following monaural hearing loss, in absence of overt experience.

">Sex differences in contextual fear expression are associated with altered medial prefrontal cortex activity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis of fear expression in rodents has implications for understanding pathological fear responses that characterize posttraumatic stress disorder. Even though posttraumatic stress disorder is more common in females, little is known about the neural circuit interactions supporting fear expression in female rodents. In this study, we were interested in determining whether neural activity associated with the expression of contextual fear differed between males and females within the projections from the medial prefrontal cortex to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and in the medial prefrontal cortex in neurons that do not project to the periaqueductal gray. We infused a viral retrograde tracer into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray in male and female rats and trained them in a contextual fear conditioning task. The following day rats were re-exposed to the conditioning context and were sacrificed shortly thereafter. Neural activity was measured using EGR1 immunofluorescence. The behavioral results showed that males exhibited higher levels of freezing during the context test than females. Male rats that underwent training and testing showed an increase in the proportion of viral infected cells that express EGR1 in the PL compared to rats that had only received context exposure. Trained female rats were not different than controls, however a direct comparison between sexes was not different. In cells not labeled by the tracer, males showed higher levels of fear-induced EGR1 expression in the prelimbic cortex than females. Conversely, females showed higher levels of EGR1 expression in the infralimbic cortex following testing as compared to males. These results suggest that sex differences in the expression of contextual fear may involve differences in the relative activity levels of the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex.

">The neurotrophin artemin and its receptor GFRα3 mediate migraine-like pain via the ion channel TRPM8</a></h4>

              
                Background Migraine has a strong genetic foundation, including both monogenic and polygenic types. The former are rare, with most migraine considered polygenic, supported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying numerous genetic variants associated with migraine risk. Surprisingly, some of the most common mutations are associated with TRPM8, a non-selective cation channel that is the primary sensor of cold temperatures in primary afferent neurons of the somatosensory system. However, it is unlikely that the temperature sensitivity of TRPM8 underlies its role in migraine pathogenesis. To define the basis of the channels involvement, we reasoned that cellular processes that increase cold sensitivity in the skin, such as the neurotrophin artemin, via its receptor GFR3, also mediate TRPM8-associated migraine-like pain in the meninges. Methods To investigate the role of artemin and GFR3 in preclinical rodent migraine models, we infused nitroglycerin acutely and chronically, and measured changes in periorbital and hind paw mechanical sensitivity in male and female mice lacking GFR3, after neutralization of free artemin with specific monoclonal antibodies, or by systemic treatment with a TRPM8-specific antagonist. Further, in wildtypes and mice lacking either GFR3 or TRPM8, we tested the effects of supradural infusions of a mix of inflammatory mediators, artemin, and a TRPM8-specific agonist on migraine-related pain in mice. Results We find that mechanical allodynia induced by systemic nitroglycerin, or supradural infusion of inflammatory mediators, involves GFR3. In addition, neutralization of circulating artemin reduces the nitroglycerin phenotype, demonstrating the importance of this neurotrophic pathway. Further, we show TRPM8 expression in the meninges and that direct supradural infusion of either a TRPM8-specific agonist or artemin itself produces mechanical allodynia, the latter dependent on TRPM8 and ameliorated by concurrent treatment with sumatriptan. Conclusions These results indicate that neuroinflammatory events in the meninges can produce migraine-like pain in mice via artemin and GFR3, likely acting upstream of TRPM8, providing a novel pathway that may contribute to migraine pathogenesis.

">Barcode activity in a recurrent network model of the hippocampus enables efficient memory binding</a></h4>

              
                Forming an episodic memory requires binding together disparate elements that co-occur in a single experience. One model of this process is that neurons representing different components of a memory bind to an "index" --- a subset of neurons unique to that memory. Evidence for this model has recently been found in chickadees, which use hippocampal memory to store and recall locations of cached food. Chickadee hippocampus produces sparse, high-dimensional patterns ("barcodes") that uniquely specify each caching event. Unexpectedly, the same neurons that participate in barcodes also exhibit conventional place tuning. It is unknown how barcode activity is generated, and what role it plays in memory formation and retrieval. It is also unclear how a memory index (e.g. barcodes) could function in the same neural population that represents memory content (e.g. place). Here, we design a biologically plausible model that generates barcodes and uses them to bind experiential content. Our model generates barcodes from place inputs through the chaotic dynamics of a recurrent neural network and uses Hebbian plasticity to store barcodes as attractor states. The model matches experimental observations that memory indices (barcodes) and content signals (place tuning) are randomly intermixed in the activity of single neurons. We demonstrate that barcodes reduce memory interference between correlated experiences. We also show that place tuning plays a complementary role to barcodes, enabling flexible, contextually-appropriate memory retrieval. Finally, our model is compatible with previous models of the hippocampus as generating a predictive map. Distinct predictive and indexing functions of the network are achieved via an adjustment of global recurrent gain. Our results suggest how the hippocampus may use barcodes to resolve fundamental tensions between memory specificity (pattern separation) and flexible recall (pattern completion) in general memory systems.

">Mutations in PSEN1 predispose inflammation in an astrocyte model of familial Alzheimer's disease through disrupted regulated intramembrane proteolysis</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in PSEN1 cause familial Alzheimer's disease with almost complete penetrance. Age at onset is highly variable between different PSEN1 mutations and even within families with the same mutation. Current research into late onset Alzheimer's disease implicates inflammation in both disease onset and progression. PSEN1 is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, responsible for regulated intramembrane proteolysis of numerous substrates that include cytokine receptors. For this reason, we tested the hypothesis that mutations in PSEN1 impact inflammatory responses in astrocytes, thereby contributing to disease progression. Here, using iPSC-astrocytes, we show that PSEN1 is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, and this upregulation is disrupted by pathological PSEN1 mutations. Using transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that PSEN1 mutant astrocytes have an augmented inflammatory profile in their basal state, concomitant with an upregulation of genes coding for regulated intramembrane proteolytic and robust activation of JAK-STAT signalling. Using JAK-STAT2 as an example signalling pathway, we show altered phosphorylation cascades in PSEN1 mutant astrocytes, reinforcing the notion of altered cytokine signalling cascades. Finally, we use small molecule modulators of gamma-secretase to confirm a role for PSEN1/gamma-secretase in regulating the astrocytic response to inflammatory stimuli. Together, these data suggest that mutations in PSEN1 enhance cytokine signalling via impaired regulated intramembrane proteolysis, thereby predisposing astrocytic inflammatory profiles. These findings support a two-hit contribution of PSEN1 mutations to fAD pathogenesis, not only impacting APP and Abeta processing but also altering the cellular response to inflammation.

">Stronger premicrosaccadic sensitivity enhancement for dark contrasts in the primate superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Microsaccades are associated with enhanced visual perception and neural sensitivity right before their onset, and this has implications for interpreting experiments involving the covert allocation of peripheral spatial attention. However, the detailed properties of premicrosaccadic enhancement are not fully known. Here we investigated how such enhancement in the superior colliculus depends on luminance polarity. Rhesus macaque monkeys fixated a small spot while we presented either dark or bright image patches of different contrasts within the recorded neurons' response fields. Besides replicating premicrosaccadic enhancement of visual sensitivity, we observed stronger enhancement for dark contrasts. This was especially true at moderate contrast levels (such as 10-20%), and it occurred independent of an individual neuron's preference for either darks or brights. On the other hand, postmicrosaccadic visual sensitivity suppression was similar for either luminance polarity. Our results reveal an intriguing asymmetry in the properties of perimicrosaccadic modulations of superior colliculus visual neural sensitivity.

">Predicting speech-in-noise ability with static and dynamic auditory figure-ground analysis using structural equation modelling</a></h4>

              
                Auditory figure-ground paradigms assess the ability to extract a foreground figure from a random background, a crucial part of central hearing. Previous studies have shown that the ability to extract static figures (with fixed frequencies) predicts real-life listening: speech-in-noise ability. In this study we assessed both fixed and dynamic figures: the latter comprised component frequencies that vary over time like natural speech. 159 participants (aged 18-79) with a range of peripheral hearing sensitivity were studied. We used hierarchal linear regression and structural equation modelling to examine how well speech-in-noise ability (for words and sentences) could be predicted by age, peripheral hearing, and static and dynamic figure-ground. Regression demonstrated that in addition to the audiogram and age, the low-frequency dynamic figure-ground accounted for significant variance of speech-in-noise, higher than the static figure-ground. The structural models showed that a combination of all types of figure-ground tasks predicted speech-in-noise with a higher effect size than the audiogram or age. Age influenced word perception in noise directly but sentence perception indirectly via effects on peripheral and central hearing. Overall, this study demonstrates that dynamic figure-ground explains more variance of real-life listening than static figure-ground, and the combination of both predicts real-life listening better than hearing sensitivity or age.

">Development of sensorimotor responses in larval zebrafish: a comparison between wild-type and GCaMP6s transgenic line</a></h4>

              
                During early development, zebrafish larvae exhibit stereotypical behaviors, which rapidly become more complex. Thus, the generation of mutant transgenic lines that maintain transparency throughout their larval stage and that can be used to record brain activity has offered strategic opportunities to investigate the underlying neural correlates of behavior establishment. However, few studies have documented the behavioral profile of these lines during larval development. Here, we set up a behavioral characterization using diverse stimuli (light and vibration) throughout larval development to compare the responses of a transgenic strain expressing a pan-neuronal calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) with that of a wild-type strain. Interestingly, we report a drastic switch in behavioral responses to light transitions at 11 days post-fertilization (dpf) and to vibration stimuli at 14 dpf in both lines. These data highlight a specific time window of behavioral complexification. Meanwhile, we found no major difference in the maturation of sensorimotor responses between GCaMP6s and wild-type strains. Thus, these results support using GCaMP6s strain in investigating the neural mechanisms underlying the developmental maturation of sensorimotor responses. We observed nevertheless some minor differences that suggest careful attention should be taken when using mutant/transgenic lines for behavioral studies.

">Phenotype Prediction Using BEN-Based Predictive Modeling (BPM)</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) has been successfully used to predict cognitive functions, behaviors, and other phenotypes using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). One limitation is that FC reflects the covariation or synchrony relationship of the temporal profile in two regions and neglects the local temporal features of the brain activity. In this study, we used brain entropy (BEN) mapping to characterize regional brain activity and developed a BEN-Based Predictive Modeling (BPM) to predict phenotype. BEN measures the disorder and complexity of brain activity and has been shown to effectively capture brain activity features related to cognition and neurological disorders. Using data from the HCP 7T fMRI and corresponding 3T structural images, we calculated gray matter volume (GMV) as well as BEN from resting state and movie-watching data. We constructed prediction models based on BEN and GMV using different numbers of parcellation of the brain atlas, applying 10-fold cross-validation. Our results indicated that the BEN-based predictive model not only outperformed GMV-based predictive modeling but also achieved prediction accuracy comparable to that of CPM. Our study demonstrates that BEN can capture extensive brain activity information for accurate phenotype prediction, providing information at least as valuable as that from connectome. Additionally, our research lays the groundwork for future applications of BPM in developmental and clinical practice.

">Sympathetic innervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue is not a predominant mediator of OT-elicited reductions of body weight gain and adiposity in male diet-induced obese rats</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies indicate that central administration of oxytocin (OT) reduces body weight (BW) in high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents by reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure (EE). Previous studies in our lab have shown that administration of OT into the fourth ventricle (4V; hindbrain) elicits weight loss and stimulates interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT) in DIO rats. We hypothesized that OT-elicited stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation of IBAT contributes to its ability to activate BAT and reduce BW in DIO rats. To test this, we determined the effect of disrupting SNS activation of IBAT on OT-elicited stimulation of TIBAT and reduction of BW in DIO rats. We first confirmed that bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT was successful based on having achieved [&ge;] 60% reduction in IBAT norepinephrine (NE) content from DIO rats. NE content was selectively reduced in IBAT by 94.7 {+/-} 2.7, 96.8 {+/-} 1.8 and 85.9 {+/-} 6.1% (P<0.05) at 1, 6 and 7-weeks post-denervation, respectively, and was unchanged in liver or inguinal white adipose tissue. We then measured the impact of bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT on the ability of acute 4V OT (1, 5 g) to stimulate TIBAT in DIO rats. We found that the high dose of 4V OT (5 g) stimulated TIBAT similarly between sham and denervated rats (P=NS) and that the effects of 4V OT to stimulate TIBAT did not require beta-3 adrenergic receptor signaling. We subsequently measured the effect of bilateral surgical denervation of IBAT on the effect of chronic 4V OT (16 nmol/day) or vehicle infusion to reduce BW, adiposity and energy intake in DIO rats. Chronic 4V OT reduced BW gain by -7.2 {+/-} 9.6 g and -14.1 {+/-} 8.8 g in sham and denervated rats (P<0.05 vs vehicle treatment), respectively, and this effect was similar between groups (P=NS). These effects were associated with reductions in adiposity and energy intake (P<0.05). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sympathetic innervation of IBAT is not required for central OT to increase BAT thermogenesis and reduce BW gain and adiposity in male DIO rats.

">Controlled retrieval relies on directed interactions between semantic control regions and visual cortex: MEG evidence from oscillatory dynamics</a></h4>

              
                To navigate the world, we store knowledge about the relationships between concepts and retrieve this information flexibly to suit our goals. The semantic control network, comprising left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), is thought to orchestrate this flexible retrieval by modulating sensory inputs. However, interactions between semantic control and input regions are not sufficiently understood. Moreover, pMTG's well-formed structural connections to both IFG and visual cortex suggests it as a candidate region to integrate control and input processes. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate oscillatory dynamics during semantic decisions to pairs of words, presented one at a time, when participants did or did not know the type of semantic relation between them. IFG showed early increases and decreases in oscillatory responses to prior task knowledge, while pMTG only showed positive effects of task knowledge at a later time window. Furthermore, both regions provided feedback to visual cortex when goals were absent, while IFG also provided feedback when goals were known. This goal-dependent feedback coincided with an earlier onset of feedforward signalling from visual cortex to pMTG, indicating rapid retrieval of task-relevant features. Knowledge of task goals also enhanced simultaneous inputs to pMTG from both IFG and visual cortex, consistent with the view that pMTG integrates top-down control with bottom-up input. Our findings elucidate the separate roles of anterior and posterior components of the semantic control network and reveal the spectro-temporal cascade of interactions between semantic control and visual regions that underlie our ability to flexibly adapt cognition to the current goals.

">Diffusion Wavelets on Connectome: Localizing the Sources of Diffusion Mediating Structure-Function Mapping Using Graph Diffusion Wavelets</a></h4>

              
                The intricate link between brain functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) is explored through models performing diffusion on SC to derive FC, using varied methodologies from single to multiple graph diffusion kernels. However, existing studies have not correlated diffusion scales with specific brain regions of interest (RoIs), limiting the applicability of graph diffusion. We propose a novel approach using graph heat diffusion wavelets to learn the appropriate diffusion scale for each RoI to accurately estimate the SC-FC mapping. Using the open HCP dataset, we achieve an average Pearson's correlation value of 0.833, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods for prediction of FC. It is important to note that the proposed architecture is entirely linear, computationally efficient, and notably demonstrates the power-law distribution of diffusion scales. Our results show that the bilateral frontal pole, by virtue of it having large diffusion scale, forms a large community structure. The finding is in line with the current literature on the role of the frontal pole in resting-state networks. Overall, the results underscore the potential of graph diffusion wavelet framework for understanding how the brain structure leads to functional connectivity.

	<p>Social withdrawal in rodents is a measure of asociality, an important negative symptom of schizophrenia. The Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rat strains have been reported to exhibit differential profiles in schizophrenia-relevant behavioral phenotypes. This investigation was focused on the study of social and non-social behavior of these two rat strains following acute administration of dizocilpine (MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist), a pharmacological model of schizophrenia-like features used to produce asociality and hyperactivity. Also, since oxytocin (OXT) has been proposed as a natural antipsychotic and a potential adjunctive therapy for social deficits in schizophrenia, we have evaluated the effects of OXT administration and its ability to reverse the MK801-impairing effects on social and non-social behavior and MK801-induced hyperactivity. MK801 administration produced hyperlocomotion and a decrease in social and non-social behavior in both rat strains, but these drug effects were clearly more marked in RHA rats. OXT (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) attenuated MK801-induced hyperlocomotion in both rat strains, although this effect was more marked in RHA rats. The MK801-decreasing effect on exploration of the &amp;amp;ldquo;social hole&amp;amp;rdquo; was moderately but significantly attenuated only in RLA rats. This study is the first to demonstrate the differential effects of OXT on MK801-induced impairments in the two Roman rat strains, providing some support for the potential therapeutic effects of OXT against schizophrenia-like symptoms, including both a positive-like symptom (i.e., MK801-induced hyperlocomotion) and a negative-like symptom (i.e., MK801 decrease in social behavior), while highlighting the importance of the genetic background (i.e., the rat strain) in influencing the effects of both MK801 and oxytocin.</p>

	<p>Background: Developing and testing methods for reliably measuring the state of consciousness of individuals is important for both basic research and clinical purposes. In recent years, several promising measures of consciousness, grounded in theoretical developments, have been proposed. However, the degrees to which these measures are affected by changes in brain activity that are not related to changes in the degree of consciousness has not been well tested. In this study, we examined whether several of these measures are modulated by the loading of cognitive resources. Methods: We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 12 participants in two conditions: (1) while passively attending to sensory stimuli related to the measures and (2) during increased cognitive load consisting of a demanding working memory task. We investigated whether a set of proposed objective EEG-based measures of consciousness differed between the passive and the cognitively demanding conditions. Results: The P300b event-related potential (sensitive to conscious awareness of deviance from an expected pattern in auditory stimuli) was significantly affected by concurrent performance on a working memory task, whereas various measures based on signal diversity of spontaneous and perturbed EEG were not. Conclusion: Because signal diversity-based measures of spontaneous or perturbed EEG are not sensitive to the degree of cognitive load, we suggest that these measures may be used in clinical situations where attention, sensory processing, or command following might be impaired.</p>

	<p>This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) method on chronic subjective tinnitus. The research was planned as an observational study. The study group comprises individuals who applied to the training and research hospital in Ankara between 2019 and 2020 and were aged between 15 and 60 years old. They were identified as having tinnitus. The study samples were determined as 36 participants selected through purposeful sampling. The samples of the 36 participants included in the study. 12 were assigned to the 1st Group EMDR and Masking Group, 12 to the 2nd Group Masking and EMDR Group, and 12 to the 3rd Control Group. The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s dependent variable was the tinnitus levels of the participants, and the independent variable was EMDR and the Masking method. The dependent variable data of the study was collected with the Visual Analog Scale and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). EMDR and Masking methods used as independent variables in the study were conducted in eight sessions for two months. As a result of the Wilcoxon Sign test used to determine whether the EMDR Method is effective on tinnitus severity level, the difference between tinnitus severity level pretest and post-test median scores of tinnitus patients was found to be statistically significant. Our research findings show that the EMDR method reduces and improves chronic subjective tinnitus, and further studies with a larger sample size could confirm our results.</p>

	<p>Background: As one of the leading causes of disability in the world, stroke can determine a reduction of balance performance with a negative impact on daily activity and social life. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sensor-based balance training with exergaming feedback on balance skills in chronic stroke patients. Methods: 21 individuals (11F, 57.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.82 years) with a single event of ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to the sensor-based balance training group (SB-group) or the usual care balance training group (UC-group). Both groups received 10 add-on sessions with exergaming feedback (SB-group) or conventional training (UC-group). Clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (t0), after (t1), and after one month (t2) from intervention. Participation level was assessed using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale at the end of each session. Results: The SB-group showed an improvement in postural stability (p = 0.02) when compared to the UC-group. In the evaluation of motivational level, the score was statistically higher in the SB-group with respect to the UC-group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Except for the improvement in postural stability, no difference was recorded in clinical score, suggesting a comparable gain in both groups. However, patients undergoing sensor-based training exhibited a higher participation score, ultimately indicating the use of this training to improve the adherence to rehabilitation settings, especially in patients with lower compliance.</p>

                <p>Contrast sensitivity (CS), which constrains human vision, decreases from fovea to periphery, from the horizontal to the vertical meridian, and from the lower vertical to the upper vertical meridian. It also depends on spatial frequency (SF), and the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) depicts this relation. To compensate for these visual constraints, we constantly make saccades and foveate on relevant objects in the scene. Already before saccade onset, presaccadic attention shifts to the saccade target and enhances perception. However, it is unknown whether and how it modulates the interplay between CS and SF, and if this effect varies around polar angle meridians. CS enhancement may result from a horizontal or vertical shift of the CSF, increase in bandwidth, or any combination. In addition, presaccadic attention could enhance CS similarly around the visual field, or it could benefit perception more at locations with poorer performance (i.e., vertical meridian). Here, we investigated these possibilities by extracting key attributes of the CSF of human observers. The results reveal that presaccadic attention (1) increases CS across SF, (2) increases the most preferred and the highest discernable SF, and (3) narrows the bandwidth. Therefore, presaccadic attention helps bridge the gap between presaccadic and postsaccadic input by increasing visibility at the saccade target.

                <p>When presented shortly after another, discrete pictures are naturally perceived as continuous. The neuronal mechanism underlying such continuous or discrete perception is not well understood. While continuous alpha oscillations are a candidate for orchestrating such neuronal mechanisms, recent evidence is mixed. In this study, we investigated the influence of prestimulus alpha oscillation on visual temporal perception. Specifically, we were interested in whether prestimulus alpha phase modulates neuronal and perceptual processes underlying discrete or continuous perception. Participants had to report the location of a missing object in a visual temporal integration task, while simultaneously MEG data were recorded. Using source reconstruction, we evaluated local phase effects by contrasting phase angle values between correctly and incorrectly integrated trials. Our results show a phase opposition cluster between &ndash;0.8 and &ndash;0.5&nbsp;s (relative to stimulus presentation) and between 6 and 20&nbsp;Hz. These momentary phase angle values were correlated with behavioral performance and event-related potential amplitude. There was no evidence that frequency defined a window of temporal integration.</p>

                Background Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high-burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many rural Nigerians and have been useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effectiveness of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods A cluster randomized control trial with three arms was conducted. Arm A received cash incentives and training, Arm B received only training, and the control arm (C) received neither. CHWs already working in the communities participated. TB case notification and number of community outreaches held were used to assess intervention effects. Data were analyzed using STATA (v.13) and GraphPad Prism (v.8). Effect sizes were calculated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Associations were tested using Chi-square (χ²) tests, with significance set at P=0.05. Results Arm A had a 14.4% increase in case notification, Arm B showed a 7.4% increase, and the control arm showed a 39.7% increase from the previous year. Arms A and B had lower odds of TB case notification post-intervention, compared to the control (OR = 0.819 and 0.769, respectively), with no significant difference between them. Arm A also saw a 144.8% increase in community outreaches, compared to 46.7% in Arm B and 22.7% in Control Arm C. Arms A and B had higher odds of carrying out community outreaches post-intervention compared to the control (OR = 1.995 and 1.195, respectively), but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding community outreach. Conclusion While the interventions resulted in an increased number of community outreaches compared to the control, case notification improved more in the control arm than in the intervention arms. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the potential of combining cash incentives with training to improve TB control efforts at the community level. Further exploration of the implementation process may shed light on the observed outcomes and guide future intervention strategies.

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                Background In acute settings around the globe, renal/ureteric colic remains one of the most common diagnoses for patients presenting with loin-to-groin pain. Even though management spans from medical expulsive therapies to surgical options, pain as a significant component of a patient’s presentation must be dealt with quickly, decisively, and safely, as it can be excruciating and its effects on overall health are dire. This study aimed to explore compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for pain management in patients with suspected renal/ureteric colic. It includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous paracetamol, and opioids as first-, second-, and third-line analgesics, respectively, and does not offer antispasmodics. In the event of deviations from the standard, the aim was to put in corrective measures, followed by re-exploration of compliance with patient care. Methods This study involved a single healthcare facility with the study type being retrospective before interventions and prospective after interventions. In the first cycle, we retrieved and analysed 78 patients records whom had been suspected to have renal/ureteric colic between July and September 2022. The inclusion criteria were documented complaints of “flank/loin-to-groin pain” and diagnosis prior to performing diagnostic tests. We surveyed the first-, second-, and third-line painkillers issued, and whether an antispasmodic was given. We collected and entered data into a Microsoft Excel file and correlated it with NICE standards. Having found deviations from the standard, we conducted interventions, allowed time for clinicians to adapt, and re-explored compliance using patient case records [n=58] between February and May 2023. Results In the 1st cycle, 78 patients were suspected of having renal/ureteric colic. M: F = 1.2:1. Non-contrast computerized tomography of the kidney ureters and bladder (NC-CTKUB) confirmed 87% of patients with stones and 3% had no stones. NC-CTKUB was not performed in 9% of patients because they were young, and urinalysis showed no microscopic hematuria. One patient had discharged against medical advise before the NC-CTKUB was performed. Compliance with the NICE pain management guidelines for suspected renal/ureteric colic was full in 23% of cases but unsatisfactory in 78% of cases. In the 2nd cycle, M: F = 1.5:1, NC-CTKUB was not re-audited, as the first cycle study yielded excellent results, and our action plan resulted in an NICE pain management compliance rate of 56%. Although our interventions resulted in improvements of more than twice the initial results, work still needs to be performed. Conclusion Clinicians’ ability to correctly diagnose renal/ureteric colic is remarkable. However, the pain management compliance rate indicates room for improvement. This may be due to the limited awareness of the NICE guideline or the fact that the clinical team has an affinity for certain analgesics compared to others. We propose the need to consider select variables to existing standard guidelines to enhance compliance for improved patient care.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Ω load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

                Background Sudden and unexpected deaths are increasing drastically. The main cause of sudden death is cardiovascular disease, out of which coronary artery disease predominates forming 80% of the cases. Most of the time, detecting early changes in myocardial infarction during the autopsy is challenging since gross infarct changes do not appear until after 24 to 48 hours of myocardial ischemia injury. So, the aim of this study was to compare two test to detect early changes of Myocardial Infarction one by using Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining of the myocardial tissue, during autopsy and other by histopathological examination. Methods The sample size of 60 hearts taken from all the sudden deaths cases brought to Mortuary with suspected cause of death due to cardiac origin. The heart was obtained from the deceased by standard post-mortem technique. Serial full-thickness transverse sections of the heart were taken at 2 cm intervals from the apex to the atrioventricular groove. All the serial slices of heart are taken for histochemical staining and TTC staining. Results In histopathological examination 34 hearts were diagnosed with myocardial infarction and 26 hearts reported non myocardial infarction. With TTC 40 hearts remained unstained suggestive of myocardial infarction and 20 hearts were stained suggestive of non-infarcted hearts. TTC staining in our study shows an accuracy of 88.33%. Conclusion The result of this study shows that the Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride test, a histochemical staining technique of heart, is reliable approach for forensic pathologists to diagnose early myocardial infarction during the post-mortem examination.

                <p>by Constance Creux, Farida Zehraoui, François Radvanyi, Fariza Tahi</p>

The involvement of non-coding RNAs in biological processes and diseases has made the exploration of their functions crucial. Most non-coding RNAs have yet to be studied, creating the need for methods that can rapidly classify large sets of non-coding RNAs into functional groups, or classes. In recent years, the success of deep learning in various domains led to its application to non-coding RNA classification. Multiple novel architectures have been developed, but these advancements are not covered by current literature reviews. We present an exhaustive comparison of the different methods proposed in the state-of-the-art and describe their associated datasets. Moreover, the literature lacks objective benchmarks. We perform experiments to fairly evaluate the performance of various tools for non-coding RNA classification on popular datasets. The robustness of methods to non-functional sequences and sequence boundary noise is explored. We also measure computation time and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. With regard to these results, we assess the relevance of the different architectural choices and provide recommendations to consider in future methods.

Cyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment including the light intensity and spectrum. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimizing strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model can reproduce a variety of physiologically measured quantities, e.g. experimentally reported partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O<sub>2</sub> evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation for ambient and saturated CO<sub>2</sub>. By capturing the interactions between different components of a photosynthetic system, our model helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving system behavior. Our model qualitatively reproduces fluorescence emitted under various light regimes, replicating Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry experiments with saturating pulses. Using our model, we test four hypothesized mechanisms of cyanobacterial state transitions for ensemble of parameter sets and found no physiological benefit of a model assuming phycobilisome detachment. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colors and irradiances. We suggest gene targets for overexpression under different illuminations to increase the yield. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances the basic understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behavior and sets the first wavelength-dependent framework to systematically test their producing capacity for biocatalysis.

                <p>by Justin Lin, Julia Fukuyama</p>

The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction—overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.

Background <p>In the modern era, the growth of scientific literature presents a daunting challenge for researchers to keep informed of advancements across multiple disciplines.</p> Objective <p>We apply natural language processing (NLP) and embedding learning concepts to design PubDigest, a tool that combs PubMed literature, aiming to pinpoint potential drugs that could be repurposed.</p> Methods <p>Using NLP, especially term associations through word embeddings, we explored unrecognized relationships between drugs and diseases. To illustrate the utility of PubDigest, we focused on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare disease with an overall limited number of scientific publications.</p> Results <p>Our literature analysis identified key clinical features linked to CTEPH by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring, a technique measuring a term’s significance in a text corpus. This allowed us to map related diseases. One standout was venous thrombosis (VT), which showed strong semantic links with CTEPH. Looking deeper, we discovered potential repurposing candidates for CTEPH through large-scale neural network-based contextualization of literature and predictive modeling on both the CTEPH and the VT literature corpora to find novel, yet unrecognized associations between the two diseases. Alongside the anti-thrombotic agent caplacizumab, benzofuran derivatives were an intriguing find. In particular, the benzofuran derivative amiodarone displayed potential anti-thrombotic properties in the literature. Our <i>in vitro</i> tests confirmed amiodarone’s ability to reduce platelet aggregation significantly by 68% (p = 0.02). However, real-world clinical data indicated that CTEPH patients receiving amiodarone treatment faced a significant 15.9% higher mortality risk (p<0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>While NLP offers an innovative approach to interpreting scientific literature, especially for drug repurposing, it is crucial to combine it with complementary methods like <i>in vitro</i> testing and real-world evidence. Our exploration with benzofuran derivatives and CTEPH underscores this point. Thus, blending NLP with hands-on experiments and real-world clinical data can pave the way for faster and safer drug repurposing approaches, especially for rare diseases like CTEPH.</p>

As genomics technologies advance, there is a growing demand for computational biologists trained for genomics analysis but instructors face significant hurdles in providing formal training in computer programming, statistics, and genomics to biology students. Fully online learners represent a significant and growing community that can contribute to meet this need, but they are frequently excluded from valuable research opportunities which mostly do not offer the flexibility they need. To address these opportunity gaps, we developed an asynchronous course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for computational genomics specifically for fully online biology students. We generated custom learning materials and leveraged remotely accessible computational tools to address 2 novel research questions over 2 iterations of the genomics CURE, one testing bioinformatics approaches and one mining cancer genomics data. Here, we present how the instructional team distributed analysis needed to address these questions between students over a 7.5-week CURE and provided concurrent training in biology and statistics, computer programming, and professional development. Scores from identical learning assessments administered before and after completion of each CURE showed significant learning gains across biology and coding course objectives. Open-response progress reports were submitted weekly and identified self-reported adaptive coping strategies for challenges encountered throughout the course. Progress reports identified problems that could be resolved through collaboration with instructors and peers via messaging platforms and virtual meetings. We implemented asynchronous communication using the Slack messaging platform and an asynchronous journal club where students discussed relevant publications using the Perusall social annotation platform. The online genomics CURE resulted in unanticipated positive outcomes, including students voluntarily discussing plans to continue research after the course. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of this genomics CURE for scientific training, recruitment and student-mentor relationships, and student successes. Asynchronous genomics CUREs can contribute to a more skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce for the advancement of biomedical science.

                <p>by Peter S. Back, Vignesh Senthilkumar, Charles P. Choi, Justin J. Quan, Qing Lou, Anne K. Snyder, Andrew M. Ly, Justin G. Lau, Z. Hong Zhou, Gary E. Ward, Peter J. Bradley</p>

Apicomplexan parasites possess several specialized structures to invade their host cells and replicate successfully. One of these is the inner membrane complex (IMC), a peripheral membrane-cytoskeletal system underneath the plasma membrane. It is composed of a series of flattened, membrane-bound vesicles and a cytoskeletal subpellicular network (SPN) comprised of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. While the alveolin proteins are conserved throughout the Apicomplexa and the broader Alveolata, their precise functions and interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the function of one of these alveolin proteins in <i>Toxoplasma</i>, IMC6. Disruption of IMC6 resulted in striking morphological defects that led to aberrant invasion and replication but surprisingly minor effects on motility. Deletion analyses revealed that the alveolin domain alone is largely sufficient to restore localization and partially sufficient for function. As this highlights the importance of the IMC6 alveolin domain, we implemented unnatural amino acid photoreactive crosslinking to the alveolin domain and identified multiple binding interfaces between IMC6 and 2 other cytoskeletal IMC proteins—IMC3 and ILP1. This provides direct evidence of protein–protein interactions in the alveolin domain and supports the long-held hypothesis that the alveolin domain is responsible for filament formation. Collectively, our study features the conserved alveolin proteins as critical components that maintain the parasite’s structural integrity and highlights the alveolin domain as a key mediator of SPN architecture.

Transitions between the fed and fasted state are common in mammals. The liver orchestrates adaptive responses to feeding/fasting by transcriptionally regulating metabolic pathways of energy usage and storage. Transcriptional and enhancer dynamics following cessation of fasting (refeeding) have not been explored. We examined the transcriptional and chromatin events occurring upon refeeding in mice, including kinetic behavior and molecular drivers. We found that the refeeding response is temporally organized with the early response focused on ramping up protein translation while the later stages of refeeding drive a bifurcated lipid synthesis program. While both the cholesterol biosynthesis and lipogenesis pathways were inhibited during fasting, most cholesterol biosynthesis genes returned to their basal levels upon refeeding while most lipogenesis genes markedly overshoot above pre-fasting levels. Gene knockout, enhancer dynamics, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that lipogenic gene overshoot is dictated by LXRα. These findings from unbiased analyses unravel the mechanism behind the long-known phenomenon of refeeding fat overshoot.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that has a significant impact on quality of life. The immune response and allergy symptoms in AD are triggered by the recognition of specific allergens by IgE antibodies. Cross-reactivity can lead to auto-IgE responses, potentially worsening AD symptoms. Our research aimed to enhance our understanding of allergenic sources, including A. fumigatus, and their role in AD. We focused on molecular mimicry between human AQP3 and A. fumigatus aquaporin. Methods In our in-silico analysis, we compared the amino acid sequences of human aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and A. fumigatus aquaporin with 25 aquaporins from various allergenic sources, sourced from the UniProt and NCBI databases. Phylogenetic relationship analysis and homology-based modeling were conducted. We identified conserved antigenic regions located within the 3D structures. Results The global identity levels among the studied aquaporins averaged 32.6%. One antigenic site exhibited a remarkable local region, with a conserved identity of 71.4%. We categorized the aquaporins into five monophyletic clades (A–E), with group B showing the highest identity (95%), including six mammalian aquaporins, including AQP3. When comparing A. fumigatus aquaporins, the highest identity was observed with Malassezia sympodialis at 35%. Both human and A. fumigatus aquaporins have three linear and three discontinuous epitopes. Conclusions We identified potential linear and conformational epitopes of AQP3, indicating a possible molecular mimicry between humans and A. fumigatus aquaporins. This suggests autoreactivity and potential cross-reactivity, although further validation using in vitro and in vivo experiments is required.

                We present the results of the human genomic small variant calling benchmarking initiative of the German Research Foundation (DFG) funded Next Generation Sequencing Competence Network (NGS-CN) and the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). In this effort, we developed NCBench, a continuous benchmarking platform for the evaluation of small genomic variant callsets in terms of recall, precision, and false positive/negative error patterns. NCBench is implemented as a continuously re-evaluated open-source repository. We show that it is possible to entirely rely on public free infrastructure (Github, Github Actions, Zenodo) in combination with established open-source tools. NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset. Most importantly, for authors, it will enable the omission of repeated re-implementation of paper-specific variant calling benchmarks for the publication of new tools or pipelines, while readers will benefit from being able to (continuously) observe the performance of tools and pipelines at the time of reading instead of at the time of writing.

                Project planning and scheduling are essential parts of project management. While project planning and scheduling tools are already available to support traditional project management approaches, flexible project management approaches, such as agile, extreme, and hybrid project planning, are less well supported by software tools, especially freely available software packages. To our knowledge, no existing R package for project planning and scheduling can support flexible projects. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing and describing the R package mfpp for matrix-based flexible project planning/scheduling. This package includes a comprehensive set of tools for project managers to schedule both traditional and flexible project plans. The use of the package is illustrated through examples.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B due to GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (<i>FGF14</i>) gene has recently been recognized as a common cause of late-onset hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Here we present the first report of this disease in the US population, characterizing its clinical manifestations, disease progression, pathological abnormalities, and response to 4-aminopyridine in a cohort of 102 patients bearing GAA repeat expansions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In our cohort of 102 patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57 ± 12.5 years) slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1049/v1?src=rss">A guide to selecting high-performing antibodies for STING1 (Uniprot ID: Q86WV6) for use in western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                STING1 is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. Its role in modulating inflammation links STING1 to various pathologic conditions, positioning it as a key target for therapeutic interventions aimed at regulating immune responses. To advance our understanding of STING1-associated diseases, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies readily accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Migraine is highly prevalent and debilitating. The persistent headaches in this condition are thought to arise from the activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway. Both clinical and animal model studies have suggested that neuroimmune interactions contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine headache. In this review, we first summarize the findings from human studies implicating the dysregulation of the immune system in migraine, including genetic analyses, measurement of circulatory factors, and neuroimaging data. We next discuss recent advances from rodent studies aimed at elucidating the neuroimmune interactions that manifest at various levels of the trigeminovascular pathway and lead to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells as well as immunocompetent glial cells. These cells reciprocally modulate neuronal activity via multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby regulating peripheral and central sensitization. Throughout the discussions, we highlight the potential clinical and translational implications of the findings.

                Why do we “choke under pressure,” underperforming when we want to succeed the most? Smoulder et al. identify a neural basis of this paradoxical phenomenon in the motor cortex, where greater rewards influence movement preparatory neural states to be closer to, then farther from, an optimal zone for upcoming movements.

                Ren et al. characterize a mechanical circuit formed by two connected and mutually regulated protein domains during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This circuit ensures robust force transmission from the actin cytoskeleton to the membrane and may represent a universal mechanism to synergize catch bonds and protein condensates at the membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95412">Altered firing output of VIP interneurons and early dysfunctions in CA1 hippocampal circuits in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leads to progressive memory decline, and alterations in hippocampal function are among the earliest pathological features observed in human and animal studies. GABAergic interneurons (INs) within the hippocampus coordinate network activity, among which type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calretinin play a crucial role. These cells provide primarily disinhibition to principal excitatory cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA1 region, regulating incoming inputs and memory formation. However, it remains unclear whether AD pathology induces changes in the activity of I-S3 cells, impacting the hippocampal network motifs. Here, using young adult 3xTg-AD mice, we found that while the density and morphology of I-S3 cells remain unaffected, there were significant changes in their firing output. Specifically, I-S3 cells displayed elongated action potentials and decreased firing rates, which was associated with a reduced inhibition of CA1 INs and their higher recruitment during spatial decision-making and object exploration tasks. Furthermore, the activation of CA1 PCs was also impacted, signifying early disruptions in CA1 network functionality. These findings suggest that altered firing patterns of I-S3 cells might initiate early-stage dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 circuits, potentially influencing the progression of AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95549">Fine-scale tracking reveals visual field use for predator detection and escape in collective foraging of pigeon flocks</a></h4>

              
                During collective vigilance, it is commonly assumed that individual animals compromise their feeding time to be vigilant against predators, benefiting the entire group. One notable issue with this assumption concerns the unclear nature of predator ‘detection’, particularly in terms of vision. It remains uncertain how a vigilant individual utilizes its high-acuity vision (such as the fovea) to detect a predator cue and subsequently guide individual and collective escape responses. Using fine-scale motion-capture technologies, we tracked the head and body orientations of pigeons (hence reconstructed their visual fields and foveal projections) foraging in a flock during simulated predator attacks. Pigeons used their fovea to inspect predator cues. Earlier foveation on a predator cue was linked to preceding behaviors related to vigilance and feeding, such as head-up or down positions, head-scanning, and food-pecking. Moreover, earlier foveation predicted earlier evasion flights at both the individual and collective levels. However, we also found that relatively long delay between their foveation and escape responses in individuals obscured the relationship between these two responses. While our results largely support the existing assumptions about vigilance, they also underscore the importance of considering vision and addressing the disparity between detection and escape responses in future research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89470">Improved inference of population histories by integrating genomic and epigenomic data</a></h4>

              
                With the availability of high-quality full genome polymorphism (SNPs) data, it becomes feasible to study the past demographic and selective history of populations in exquisite detail. However, such inferences still suffer from a lack of statistical resolution for recent, for example bottlenecks, events, and/or for populations with small nucleotide diversity. Additional heritable (epi)genetic markers, such as indels, transposable elements, microsatellites, or cytosine methylation, may provide further, yet untapped, information on the recent past population history. We extend the Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC) framework to jointly use SNPs and other hyper-mutable markers. We are able to (1) improve the accuracy of demographic inference in recent times, (2) uncover past demographic events hidden to SNP-based inference methods, and (3) infer the hyper-mutable marker mutation rates under a finite site model. As a proof of principle, we focus on demographic inference in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using DNA methylation diversity data from 10 European natural accessions. We demonstrate that segregating single methylated polymorphisms (SMPs) satisfy the modeling assumptions of the SMC framework, while differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are not suitable as their length exceeds that of the genomic distance between two recombination events. Combining SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site- and region-level epimutation processes, we provide new estimates of the glacial age bottleneck and post-glacial population expansion of the European <i>A. thaliana</i> population. Our SMC framework readily accounts for a wide range of heritable genomic markers, thus paving the way for next-generation inference of evolutionary history by combining information from several genetic and epigenetic markers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94302">S-acylation of NLRP3 provides a nigericin sensitive gating mechanism that controls access to the Golgi</a></h4>

              
                NLRP3 is an inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor activated in response to multiple danger signals which perturb intracellular homeostasis. Electrostatic interactions between the NLRP3 polybasic (PB) region and negatively charged lipids on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) have been proposed to recruit NLRP3 to the TGN. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane association of NLRP3 is critically dependant on S-acylation of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-130), which traps NLRP3 in a dynamic S-acylation cycle at the Golgi, and a series of hydrophobic residues preceding Cys-130 which act in conjunction with the PB region to facilitate Cys-130 dependent Golgi enrichment. Due to segregation from Golgi localised thioesterase enzymes caused by a nigericin induced breakdown in Golgi organisation and function, NLRP3 becomes immobilised on the Golgi through reduced de-acylation of its Cys-130 lipid anchor, suggesting that disruptions in Golgi homeostasis are conveyed to NLRP3 through its acylation state. Thus, our work defines a nigericin sensitive S-acylation cycle that gates access of NLRP3 to the Golgi.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98181">Upregulated expression of ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 promotes PKM2 nuclear translocation and astrocyte activation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrocytes play critical roles in the occurrence of various neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of mice primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-κB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in mice primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the pathological function of nuclear glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism that are involved in astrocyte activation. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of astrocyte-involved neurological disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96907">Dysfunction of Calcyphosine-Like gene impairs retinal angiogenesis through the MYC axis and is associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina and associated symptoms that can lead to vision loss. However, the underlying genetic causes of approximately 50% of FEVR cases remain unknown. Here, we report two heterozygous variants in calcyphosine-like gene (<i>CAPSL</i>) that is associated with FEVR. Both variants exhibited compromised CAPSL protein expression. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific inactivation of <i>Capsl</i> resulted in delayed radial/vertical vascular progression, compromised endothelial proliferation/migration, recapitulating the human FEVR phenotypes. <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) exhibited impaired tube formation, decreased cell proliferation, disrupted cell polarity establishment, and filopodia/lamellipodia formation, as well as disrupted collective cell migration. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that <i>CAPSL</i> abolition inhibited the MYC signaling axis, in which the expression of core MYC targeted genes were profoundly decreased. Furthermore, a combined analysis of <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted HRECs and <i>c-MYC</i>-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells uncovered similar transcription patterns. Collectively, this study reports a novel FEVR-associated candidate gene, <i>CAPSL</i>, which provides valuable information for genetic counseling of FEVR. This study also reveals that compromised CAPSL function may cause FEVR through MYC axis, shedding light on the potential involvement of MYC signaling in the pathogenesis of FEVR.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology, resulting in various impairments that necessitate continuous rehabilitation to enhance functionality, quality of life, and motor function, including through Virtual Reality (VR) therapy. Comparing tasks in virtual environments and their potential skill transfer to real-world settings could aid in optimizing treatment programs to improve motor performance in individuals with MS. This study aimed to determine whether practicing acquisition and retention phases using two distinct interfaces (concrete&amp;amp;mdash;Touch Screen or abstract&amp;amp;mdash;Kinect system) affects performance in a subsequent task using a different interface (transfer phase). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 56 volunteers with MS and 41 controls. Participants engaged in a computer game where they burst as many bubbles as possible within 10 s per attempt. After the acquisition and retention phases, all participants switched interfaces (e.g., those using Kinect switched to Touchscreen and vice versa). Significant performance improvements were observed in both groups during the acquisition phase, which were maintained in the retention phase. Although the abstract interface was more challenging for both groups, only the MS group that practiced with the abstract interface successfully transferred their improvements to the concrete interface. Thus, despite the increased difficulty of the abstract task during practice, it led to better performance transfer when required to complete a subsequent concrete task, suggesting that abstract devices may be beneficial in clinical practice for improving motor function in people with MS.</p>

                <p>The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Preparatory activity in the frontal cortex predicts upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks have made it challenging to determine whether the spatial information is in a self-centered direction reference frame or a world-centered position reference frame. Here, we trained male rats to make delayed visually guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle direction versus position tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in the secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. Population analyses revealed that the FOF encodes two separate 2D maps of space. First, a 2D map of the planned and ongoing movement in a self-centered direction reference frame. Second, a 2D map of the animal&rsquo;s current position on the port wall in a world-centered reference frame. Thus, preparatory activity in the FOF represents self-centered upcoming movement directions, but FOF neurons multiplex both self- and world-reference frame variables at the level of single neurons. Neural network model comparison supports the view that despite the presence of world-centered representations, the FOF receives the target information as self-centered input and generates self-centered planning signals.</p>

                <p>The act of recalling memories can paradoxically lead to the forgetting of other associated memories, a phenomenon known as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). Inhibitory control mechanisms, primarily mediated by the prefrontal cortex, are thought to contribute to RIF. In this study, we examined whether stimulating the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation modulates RIF and investigated the associated electrophysiological correlates. In a randomized study, 50 participants (27 males and 23 females) received either real or sham stimulation before performing retrieval practice on target memories. After retrieval practice, a final memory test to assess RIF was administered. We found that stimulation selectively increased the retrieval accuracy of competing memories, thereby decreasing RIF, while the retrieval accuracy of target memories remained unchanged. The reduction in RIF was associated with a more pronounced beta desynchronization within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC), in an early time window (&lt;500&nbsp;ms) after cue onset during retrieval practice. This led to a stronger beta desynchronization within the parietal cortex in a later time window, an established marker for successful memory retrieval. Together, our results establish the causal involvement of the mPFC in actively suppressing competing memories and demonstrate that while forgetting arises as a consequence of retrieving specific memories, these two processes are functionally independent. Our findings suggest that stimulation potentially disrupted inhibitory control processes, as evidenced by reduced RIF and stronger beta desynchronization in fronto-parietal brain regions during memory retrieval, although further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this effect.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum plays an important role in diverse brain functions, ranging from motor learning to cognition. Recent studies have suggested that molecular and cellular heterogeneity within cerebellar lobules contributes to functional differences across the cerebellum. However, the specific relationship between molecular and cellular heterogeneity and diverse functional outputs of different regions of the cerebellum remains unclear. Here, we describe a previously unappreciated form of synaptic heterogeneity at parallel fiber synapses to Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum (both sexes). In contrast to uniform fast synaptic transmission, we found that the properties of slow synaptic transmission varied by up to threefold across different lobules of the mouse cerebellum, resulting in surprising heterogeneity. Depending on the location of a Purkinje cell, the time of peak of slow synaptic currents varied by hundreds of milliseconds. The duration and decay time of these currents also spanned hundreds of milliseconds, based on lobule. We found that, as a consequence of the heterogeneous synaptic dynamics, the same brief input stimulus was transformed into prolonged firing patterns over a range of timescales that depended on Purkinje cell location.</p>

                <p>To test a Chinese character version of the phonemic verbal fluency task in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and assess the verbal fluency deficiency pattern in TLE with and without hippocampal sclerosis, a cross-sectional study was conducted including 30 patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), 28 patients with TLE and without hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-NHS), and 29 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). Both sexes were enrolled. Participants finished a Chinese character verbal fluency (VFC) task during functional MRI. The activation/deactivation maps, functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of the left frontal and temporal regions were compared. A neural network classification model was applied to differentiate TLE-HS and TLE-NHS using functional statistics. The VFC scores were correlated with semantic fluency in HC while correlated with phonemic fluency in TLE-NHS. Activation and deactivation deficiency was observed in TLE-HS and TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.001, <I>k</I> &ge; 10). Functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of anterior inferior temporal gyri were impaired in TLE-HS and retained or even enhanced in TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The functional connectivity was correlated with phonemic fluency (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The neural network classification reached an area under the curve of 0.90 in diagnosing hippocampal sclerosis. The VFC task is a Chinese phonemic verbal fluency task suitable for clinical application in TLE. During the VFC task, functional connectivity of phonemic circuits was impaired in TLE-HS and was enhanced in TLE-NHS, representing a compensative phonemic searching strategy applied by patients with TLE-NHS.</p>

                <p>Our repertoire of motor skills is filled with sequential movements that need to be performed in a specific order. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether the human hippocampus, a region known to support temporal order in non-motor memory, represents information about the order of sequential motor actions in human participants (both sexes). We also examined such representations in other regions of the motor network (i.e., the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior superior parietal lobule, and striatum) already known for their critical role in motor sequence learning. Results showed that the hippocampus represents information about movements in their learned temporal position in the sequence, but not about movements or temporal positions in random movement patterns. Other regions of the motor network coded for movements in their learned temporal position, as well as movements and positions in random movement patterns. Importantly, movement coding contributed to sequence learning patterns in primary, supplementary, and premotor cortices but not in striatal and parietal regions. Our findings deepen our understanding of how striatal and cortical regions contribute to motor sequence learning and point to the capacity of the hippocampus to represent movements in their temporal context, an ability possibly explaining its contribution to motor learning.</p>

                <p>Neuronal excitatory synapses are primarily located on small dendritic protrusions called spines. During synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) initiates signaling pathways that coordinate changes in dendritic spine structure and synaptic function. During long-term potentiation (LTP), high levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote increases in both synaptic strength and dendritic spine size through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases. In contrast, during long-term depression (LTD), low levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote decreased synaptic strength and spine shrinkage and elimination through activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), which is anchored at synapses via the scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological agent amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) may impair learning and memory through biasing NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways toward LTD and spine elimination. By employing AKAP150 knock-in mice of both sexes with a mutation that disrupts CaN anchoring to AKAP150, we revealed that local, postsynaptic AKAP&ndash;CaN&ndash;LTD signaling was required for A&beta;-mediated impairment of NMDAR synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, inhibition of LTP, and dendritic spine loss. Additionally, we found that A&beta; acutely engages AKAP&ndash;CaN signaling through activation of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) leading to dephosphorylation of NMDAR GluN2B subunits, which decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to favor LTD over LTP, and cofilin, which promotes F-actin severing to destabilize dendritic spines. These findings reveal a novel interplay between NMDAR and mGluR1 signaling that converges on AKAP-anchored CaN to coordinate dephosphorylation of postsynaptic substrates linked to multiple aspects of A&beta;-mediated synaptic dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Although the locus ceruleus (LC) is recognized as a crucial modulator for attention and perception by releasing norepinephrine into various cortical regions, the impact of LC&ndash;noradrenergic (LC&ndash;NE) modulation on auditory discrimination behavior remains elusive. In this study, we firstly recorded local field potential and single-unit activity in multiple cortical regions associated with auditory&ndash;motor processing, including the auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, secondary motor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in response to optogenetic activation (40&nbsp;Hz and 0.5&nbsp;s) of the LC&ndash;NE neurons in awake mice (male). We found that phasic LC stimulation induced a persistent high gamma oscillation (50&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in the OFC. Phasic activation of LC&ndash;NE neurons also resulted in a corresponding increase in norepinephrine levels in the OFC, accompanied by a pupillary dilation response. Furthermore, when mice were performing a go/no-go auditory discrimination task, we optogeneticaly activated the neural projections from LC to OFC and revealed a shortened latency in behavioral responses to sound stimuli and an increased false alarm rate. These impulsive behavioral responses may be associated with the gamma neural activity in the OFC. These findings have broadened our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in the role of LC in auditory&ndash;motor processing.</p>

                <p>For better decisions in social interactions, humans often must understand the thinking of others and predict their actions. Since such predictions are uncertain, multiple predictions may be necessary for better decision-making. However, the neural processes and computations underlying such social decision-making remain unclear. We investigated this issue by developing a behavioral paradigm and performing functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational modeling. In our task, female and male participants were required to predict others&rsquo; choices in order to make their own value-based decisions, as the outcome depended on others&rsquo; choices. Results showed, to make choices, the participants mostly relied on a value difference (primary) generated from the case where others would make a likely choice, but sometimes they additionally used another value difference (secondary) from the opposite case where others make an unlikely choice. We found that the activations in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) correlated with the primary difference while the activations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC) correlated with the secondary difference. Analysis of neural coupling and temporal dynamics suggested a three-step processing network, beginning with the left amygdala signals for predictions of others&rsquo; choices. Modulated by these signals, the PCC and rdlPFC reflect the respective value differences for self-decisions. Finally, the medial prefrontal cortex integrated these decision signals for a final decision. Our findings elucidate the neural process of constructing value-based decisions by predicting others and illuminate their key variables with social modulations, providing insight into the differential functional roles of these brain regions in this process.</p>

                <p>Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare sensory and autonomic neuropathy that results from a mutation in the <I>ELP1</I> gene. Virtually all patients report gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and we have recently shown that FD patients have a dysbiotic gut microbiome and altered metabolome. These findings were recapitulated in an FD mouse model and moreover, the FD mice had reduced intestinal motility, as did patients. To understand the cellular basis for impaired GI function in FD, the enteric nervous system (ENS; both female and male mice) from FD mouse models was analyzed during embryonic development and adulthood. We show here that not only is <I>Elp1</I> required for the normal formation of the ENS, but it is also required in adulthood for the regulation of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and for target innervation in both the mucosa and in intestinal smooth muscle. In particular, CGRP innervation was significantly reduced as was the number of dopaminergic neurons. Examination of an FD patient's gastric biopsy also revealed reduced and disoriented axons in the mucosa. Finally, using an FD mouse model in which <I>Elp1</I> was deleted exclusively from neurons, we found significant changes to the colon epithelium including reduced E-cadherin expression, perturbed mucus layer organization, and infiltration of bacteria into the mucosa. The fact that deletion of <I>Elp1</I> exclusively in neurons is sufficient to alter the intestinal epithelium and perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier highlights a critical role for neurons in regulating GI epithelium homeostasis.</p>

                <p>During infancy and adolescence, language develops from a predominantly interhemispheric control&mdash;through the corpus callosum (CC)&mdash;to a predominantly intrahemispheric control, mainly subserved by the left arcuate fasciculus (AF). Using multimodal neuroimaging, we demonstrate that human left-handers (both male and female) with an atypical language lateralization show a rightward participation of language areas from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal cortex when contrasting speech to tone perception and an enhanced interhemispheric anatomical and functional connectivity. Crucially, musicianship determines two different structural pathways to this outcome. Nonmusicians present a relation between atypical lateralization and intrahemispheric underdevelopment across the anterior AF, hinting at a dysregulation of the ontogenetic shift from an interhemispheric to an intrahemispheric brain. Musicians reveal an alternative pathway related to interhemispheric overdevelopment across the posterior CC and the auditory cortex. We discuss the heterogeneity in reaching atypical language lateralization and the relevance of early musical training in altering the normal development of language cognitive functions.</p>

We and others recently published data demonstrating proof-of-concept of utilising lymphopenic severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) or Recombination Activating Gene (RAG)2 deficient mice with additional knockout of the IL-2/7 receptor gamma chain (γc) as alternative preventative drug screening research models of dirofilariasis. Here we summarise the current knowledge of candidate immunodeficient mouse models tested, including a comparison of susceptibility using different background strains of mice, different D. immitis isolates, following use of anti-inflammatory treatments to further suppress residual innate immunity, and efficacies achieved against different reference anthelmintics. We supplement this precis with new data on treatment response to the veterinary anthelmintic, oxfendazole, and initial evaluation of D. immitis susceptibility in CB.17 SCID and C57BL/6 RAG2-/-γc-/- mice. We conclude that in addition to NSG and NXG mice, RAG2-/-γc-/- mice on either a BALB/c or C57BL/6 background offer an alternative screening model option, widening access to academic and commercial laboratories wishing to pursue initial rapid in vivo drug screening whilst avoiding potentially unnecessary cat or dog testing.

                <p>by Mario Grassi, Barbara Tarantino</p>

Large-scale studies of gene expression are commonly influenced by biological and technical sources of expression variation, including batch effects, sample characteristics, and environmental impacts. Learning the causal relationships between observable variables may be challenging in the presence of unobserved confounders. Furthermore, many high-dimensional regression techniques may perform worse. In fact, controlling for unobserved confounding variables is essential, and many deconfounding methods have been suggested for application in a variety of situations. The main contribution of this article is the development of a two-stage deconfounding procedure based on Bow-free Acyclic Paths (BAP) search developed into the framework of Structural Equation Models (SEM), called SEMbap(). In the first stage, an exhaustive search of missing edges with significant covariance is performed via Shipley d-separation tests; then, in the second stage, a Constrained Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) is fitted or a low dimensional representation of bow-free edges structure is obtained via Graph Laplacian Principal Component Analysis (gLPCA). We compare four popular deconfounding methods to BAP search approach with applications on simulated and observed expression data. In the former, different structures of the hidden covariance matrix have been replicated. Compared to existing methods, BAP search algorithm is able to correctly identify hidden confounding whilst controlling false positive rate and achieving good fitting and perturbation metrics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012429">Oscillations in an artificial neural network convert competing inputs into a temporal code</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katharina Duecker, Marco Idiart, Marcel van Gerven, Ole Jensen</p>

The field of computer vision has long drawn inspiration from neuroscientific studies of the human and non-human primate visual system. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for example, was informed by the properties of simple and complex cells in early visual cortex. However, the computational relevance of oscillatory dynamics experimentally observed in the visual system are typically not considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Computational models of neocortical dynamics, on the other hand, rarely take inspiration from computer vision. Here, we combine methods from computational neuroscience and machine learning to implement multiplexing in a simple ANN using oscillatory dynamics. We first trained the network to classify individually presented letters. Post-training, we added temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing refraction in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, indicating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activate sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model implements the idea that inhibitory oscillations segregate competing inputs in time. The results of our simulations pave the way for applications in deeper network architectures and more complicated machine learning problems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011806">Creating cell-specific computational models of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes using optical experiments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Janice Yang, Neil J. Daily, Taylor K. Pullinger, Tetsuro Wakatsuki, Eric A. Sobie</p>

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help to predict cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters. We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created <i>in silico</i> datasets by simulating various protocols applied to a population of models with known conductance variations, and then fitted parameters to those datasets. We found that calibrating to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation also held when the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses.

                <p>by Wen Wen, Shrey Grover, Douglas Hazel, Peyton Berning, Frederik Baumgardt, Vighnesh Viswanathan, Olivia Tween, Robert M. G. Reinhart</p>

Maintaining and removing information in mind are 2 fundamental cognitive processes that decline sharply with age. Using a combination of beta-band neural oscillations, which have been implicated in the regulation of working memory contents, and cross-trial neural variability, an undervalued property of brain dynamics theorized to govern adaptive cognitive processes, we demonstrate an age-related dissociation between distinct working memory functions—information maintenance and post-response deletion. Load-dependent decreases in beta variability during maintenance predicted memory performance of younger, but not older adults. Surprisingly, the post-response phase emerged as the predictive locus of working memory performance for older adults, with post-response beta variability correlated with memory performance of older, but not younger adults. Single-trial analysis identified post-response beta power elevation as a frequency-specific signature indexing memory deletion. Our findings demonstrate the nuanced interplay between age, beta dynamics, and working memory, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of cognitive decline in agreement with the inhibition deficit theory of aging.

                Background Entomopathogenic fungi exists naturally in plants as an asymptote and have the potential to reduce the population of insect pests through indirect interactions. This study was conducted to detect and characterize the endophytic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii from the rhizosphere soil of tomato plants and their virulence effect on Galleria melonella. Methods From the rhizosphere soil of 40 tomato fields, three Beauveria bassiana and seven Metarhizium robertsii isolates were isolated using the galleria bait method. All fungi isolate were morphologically characterized by their colony color, shape, and surface texture. Isolates with the highest percentages of germination, conidial yield, and radial growth were selected, and their virulence was evaluated on second instar larvae of Galleria melonella under laboratory conditions. Results In this study, Beauveria bassiana showed white colony color and aseptate hyphae, whereas Metarhizium robertsii showed dark green to light green colony color and septate hyphal structures. Maximum spore production and conidial length were obtained by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 with 2.67x107 spores ml-1 and 3.24 µm, respectively. Colony radial growth rates ranged from 1.73 to 3.24 mm day-1. The results revealed that the highest mortality rate of Galleria melonella (100%) was obtained by Metarhizium robertsii isolates K-61 and K-102 at a concentration of 1x108 conidial ml-1 at 7 days post-inoculation. The lowest mortality rate was registered by Metarhizium robertsii isolate RST-11. Conclusions In the present study, isolates that produced the most spores and had the highest germination rates were the most virulent to Galleria mellonella second instar larvae. Therefore, virulent entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of insect pests.

                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields perform specific roles in normal cognitive functioning and have distinct vulnerabilities in neurological disorders. However, measurement of subfields with MRI is technically difficult in the head and tail of the hippocampus. Recent studies have utilized curved multiplanar reconstruction (CMPR) to improve subfield visualization in the head and tail, but this method has not yet been applied to histological data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized BigBrain data, an open-source database of serially sectioned histological data for our analyses. The left hippocampus was segmented according to histological criteria by two raters in order to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability of histology-based segmentation throughout the long axis. Segmentation according to our previous protocol for the hippocampal body was then compared to these histological measurements to evaluate for histological validity. Agreement between segmentations was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intra-rater reliability (DSCs) of histological segmentation was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8599), CA2 (0.7586), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8907), SLM (0.9123), subiculum (0.8149). Similarly, inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated excellent agreement (DSCs) for all subfield locations: CA1 (0.8203), CA2 (0.7253), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8439), SLM (0.8700), subiculum (0.7794). Finally, histological accuracy (DSCs) for our previous protocol was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8821), CA2 (0.8810), CA3/CA4/DG (0.9802), SLM (0.9879), subiculum (0.8774). When subfields in the hippocampus head, body, and tail were analyzed independently, DSCs also showed excellent agreement.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>CMPR allows reliable subfield segmentation based on histological criteria throughout the hippocampal head, body, and tail. Our previous protocol for the hippocampal body can be applied to provide histologically valid subfield measurements throughout the entire hippocampal long axis.</p>

                The concept of secondary range symmetric matrices is introduced here. Some characterizations as well as the equivalent conditions for a range symmetric matrix to be secondary range symmetric matrix is given. The idea of range symmetric matrices, range symmetric matrices over Minkowski space and secondary range symmetric matrices are different, and is depicted with the help of suitable examples. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for a secondary range symmetric matrix to have a secondary generalized inverse has been obtained.
