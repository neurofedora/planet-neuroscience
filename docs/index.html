">The temporal refinement of Dach1 is a key step in the functional maturation of primary somatosensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                During somatosensory neurogenesis, neurons are born in an unspecialized transcriptional state, with several transcription factors following a broad-to-restricted expression dynamic as development proceeds, supporting neuron subtype identities. The relevance of this temporal refinement remains however unclear, these broad-to-restricted transcription factors being selectively involved in neurons in which they are ultimately maintained. Here we found that Dach1 encodes for a bona fide broad-to-restricted transcription factor retained and required in tactile somatosensory neurons. Within developing nociceptors, we demonstrate that Prdm12 contributes to Dach1 extinction. Using genetic approaches to prevent its temporal restriction during somatosensory development, we reveal that Dach1 refinement is a prerequisite for the appropriate transcriptional maturation of somatosensory subtypes from which it becomes ultimately excluded. These findings highlight the essential role played by Dach1 during somatosensory neuron development. They further demonstrate that the broad-to-restricted temporal pattern followed by several transcription factors is physiologically relevant to achieve appropriate transcriptional maturation of somatosensory neurons.

	<p>Background: Stroke guideline statements are important references for clinicians due to the rapidly evolving nature of treatments. Guideline statements should be informed by up-to-date systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) because they provide the highest level of evidence. To investigate the utilization of SRs/MAs in stroke management guidelines, we conducted a literature review of guidelines and extracted relevant information regarding SRs/MAs. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed with supplementation using the Trip medical database with the term &amp;amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;amp;rdquo; as the target population, followed by using the filter &amp;amp;ldquo;guidelines&amp;amp;rdquo;. We extracted the number of included SRs/MAs, the years of publication, the country of origin, and other characteristics of interest. Descriptive statistics were generated using the R software version 4.2.1. Results: We included 27 guideline statements. The median number of overall SRs or MAs within the guidelines was 4.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2&amp;amp;ndash;9). For MAs only, the median number included in the guidelines was 3.0 (IQR = 2.0&amp;amp;ndash;5.5). Canadian guidelines had the oldest citations, with a median gap of 12.0 (IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;18.0) years for the oldest citation, followed by European (median = 12; IQR = 9.5&amp;amp;ndash;13.5) and US (median = 10.0; IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;16) guidelines. Conclusions: Stroke guideline writing groups and issuing bodies should devote greater effort to the inclusion of up-to-date SRs/MAs in their guideline statements so that clinicians can reference recent data with the highest level of evidence.</p>

                <p>Glutamatergic synapses exhibit significant molecular diversity, but circuit-specific mechanisms that underlie synaptic regulation are not well characterized. Prior reports show that Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Tiam1 regulates perforant path-&gt;dentate gyrus granule neuron synapses. In the present study, we report Tiam1's homolog Tiam2 is implicated in glutamatergic neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that Tiam2 regulates evoked excitatory glutamatergic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the catalytic Dbl-homology domain. Overall, we present evidence for RhoGEF Tiam2's role in glutamatergic synapse function at Schaffer collateral-&gt;CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses.</p>

                Fibroadenoma of the breast most often arises during the late teens and early reproductive years. It is the most prevalent tumor in women < 30 years. After the age of 40 to 45, fibroadenomas are rarely observed as new masses in women. Fibroadenomas are made up of both epithelial and stromal components. Fibroadenoma is the most frequent type of breast tumor. It is crucial to diagnose preoperatively, both clinically and pathologically, by using F.N.A.C. Postoperatively, Fibroadenoma is confirmed histopathology. However, malignant transformation is very rare in Fibroadenoma of the breast. Early identification, accurate analysis, and appropriate management are advantageous. The current study's goal is to examine preoperative and postoperative clinicopathological aspects of Fibroadenoma and to assess any differences between preoperative and postoperative diagnosis in patients admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi (M), Wardha, Maharashtra, India.

                Background/Objectives A drug-related problem (DRP) is an event or circumstance involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify and categorize the DRPs associated with the use of antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean delivery and to analyze the causes of these problems, making an improvement proposal of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) use in accordance with international guidelines. Methods Observational, retrospective, descriptive study of 814 women undergoing cesarean delivery. Prescription adequacy was assessed based on the selection, administration, dose and duration of the antibiotic therapy. DRP analysis and characterization was conducted using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) Classification V 9.1. Results DRPs were detected in all women (1125, 1.38 DRPs/patient), the most frequent ones associated to failure to administer PAP (30.10% of patients) and to unnecessary postsurgical antibiotic (100%). Of the 1935 possible causes for DRPs identified, most of them were related to inappropriate drug selection. Cefazolin was administered to 98.07% of women with PAP and 71.45% of patients received postsurgical cefalexin, with 13 different antibiotics being used in total. Conclusions The implementation of therapeutic protocols and early identification of DRPs is proposed in order to optimize antibiotic use in the institution.

                Synaptotagmin-1 is a synaptic vesicle transmembrane protein that senses calcium influx via its tandem C2-domains, triggering synchronous neurotransmitter release. Disruption to SYT1 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of identifying high-quality research reagents to enhance understanding of Synaptotagmin-1 in health and disease. Here we have characterized thirteen Synaptotagmin-1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile shelter for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds from unwanted environmental factors, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Methods Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). Physical, mechanical, microstructural, thermal, microbiological, and oxidative measurements were also performed. Results The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of films double-layered with a film containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layer films. Conclusions GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-815/v1?src=rss">Factors Influencing Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices Adoption and Crop Productivity among Smallholder Farmers in Nyimba District, Zambia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The profound impacts of climate change on the environment, economy, and society are anticipated to significantly influence smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods and traditional ways of life are inextricably intertwined with the natural environment. This comprehensive study delves into the multifaceted factors shaping the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and their subsequent effects on crop productivity among the small-scale farming communities in Nyimba District, situated within Zambia. Methods The study collected data from 194 smallholder farmer households across 12 villages in 4 agricultural camps of Nyimba District between June and July 2022. A logistic regression model was utilized to assess the factors influencing crop production and the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in response to climate change and variability within the study area. Furthermore, propensity score matching was performed to evaluate the impacts of adopting climate-smart agriculture by comparing adopter households with their non-adopter counterparts. Results The logit regression model’s findings from the research indicate that several factors influence smallholder farmer households’ adoption of climate-smart agricultural techniques and crop productivity. These factors include the farmer’s educational level, household size, fertilizer utilization, the household head’s age and gender, farming experience duration, livestock ownership status, annual household income, farmland size, the household head’s marital status, and access to climate-related information. Additionally, the propensity score matching analysis revealed that crop yields among smallholder farmers who adopted climate-smart agricultural practices were 20.20% higher compared to non-adopters. Furthermore, the analysis showed that implementing such practices in the study area led to a 21.50% increase in maize yields for adopter households relative to their non-adopter counterparts. Conclusion The findings of this research offer valuable insights to policymakers, guiding them in enhancing farmers’ climate change adaptation strategies and formulating relevant policies. Nevertheless, these initiatives and concerted efforts possess the potential to mitigate the detrimental impacts posed by climate change and climatic variability.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS), characterized by slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) of alternating active and silent states in the thalamocortical network, is a primary brain state during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. In the last two decades, the traditional view of SWS as a global and uniform whole-brain state has been challenged by a growing body of evidence indicating that SO can be local and can coexist with wake-like activity. However, the mechanisms by which global and local SOs arise from micro-scale neuronal dynamics and network connectivity remain poorly understood. We developed a multi-scale, biophysically realistic human whole-brain thalamocortical network model capable of transitioning between the awake state and SWS, and we investigated the role of connectivity in the spatio-temporal dynamics of sleep SO. We found that the overall strength and a relative balance between long and short-range synaptic connections determined the network state. Importantly, for a range of synaptic strengths, the model demonstrated complex mixed SO states, where periods of synchronized global slow-wave activity were intermittent with the periods of asynchronous local slow-waves. An increase in the overall synaptic strength led to synchronized global SO, while a decrease in synaptic connectivity produced only local slow-waves that would not propagate beyond local areas. These results were compared to human data to validate probable models of biophysically realistic SO. The model producing mixed states provided the best match to the spatial coherence profile and the functional connectivity estimated from human subjects. These findings shed light on how the spatio-temporal properties of SO emerge from local and global cortical connectivity and provide a framework for further exploring the mechanisms and functions of SWS in health and disease.

                <p>by Heejin Jun, Shanshan Liu, Alexander J. Knights, Kezhou Zhu, Yingxu Ma, Jianke Gong, Ashley E. Lenhart, Xiaoling Peng, Yunying Huang, Jared P. Ginder, Christopher H. Downie, Erika Thalia Ramos, Klas Kullander, Robert T. Kennedy, X. Z. Shawn Xu, Jun Wu</p>

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the progressive form of liver steatosis, the most common liver disease, and substantially increases the mortality rate. However, limited therapies are currently available to prevent MASH development. Identifying potential pharmacological treatments for the condition has been hampered by its heterogeneous and complex nature. Here, we identified a hepatic nonneuronal cholinergic signaling pathway required for metabolic adaptation to caloric overload. We found that cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit (CHRNA2) is highly expressed in hepatocytes of mice and humans. Further, CHRNA2 is activated by a subpopulation of local acetylcholine-producing macrophages during MASH development. The activation of CHRNA2 coordinates defensive programs against a broad spectrum of MASH-related pathogenesis, including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific loss of CHRNA2 signaling accelerates the disease onset in different MASH mouse models. Activation of this pathway via pharmacological inhibition of acetylcholine degradation protects against MASH development. Our study uncovers a hepatic nicotinic cholinergic receptor pathway that constitutes a cell-autonomous self-defense route against prolonged metabolic stress and holds therapeutic potential for combatting human MASH.

                Background Improving awareness in patients with stroke to detect risk factors of recurrent stroke has recently become a major challenge for all health professionals in preventing recurrence among stroke survivors. Utilization of advanced technology, such as digital sensors, (a non-invasive device) is among the breakthroughs in detecting the risk of disease and promotes more effective prevention and improves quality of care. This study aims to conduct a systematic review on studies addressing early detection of the risk factors of recurrent stroke through the utilization of digital sensors. Methods A literature search was carried out on articles published between 2011 - 2018 on EBSCO, Elsevier, Science Direct, ProQuest, Springer link, PubMed, MEDLINE, PLoS, and the Journal of Community Nursing. The search identified quantitative research studies on the utilization of digital sensors in cases of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiac disorders that contributed to stroke recurrence. Each study’s bias was assessed using Review Manager 5. Results Ten articles were analyzed through data extraction. Robust assessment of independent risk factors which provoke recurrent stroke such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and heart diseases could lead to conservation of health resources. It is very important to monitor these factors. With the development of technology, the potential use of non-invasive monitoring for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and heart diseases as risk factors for recurrent stroke events is considered effective because it is easy, simple, low cost, sensitive, and does not cause additional suffering for patients. Conclusion A practical and non-invasive method for early detection and monitoring of risk factors may reduce the risk of stroke recurrence among stroke survivors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90964">Myelin dystrophy impairs signal transmission and working memory in a multiscale model of the aging prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Normal aging leads to myelin alterations in the rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which are positively correlated with degree of cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized that remyelination with shorter and thinner myelin sheaths partially compensates for myelin degradation, but computational modeling has not yet explored these two phenomena together systematically. Here, we used a two-pronged modeling approach to determine how age-related myelin changes affect a core cognitive function: spatial working memory. First, we built a multicompartment pyramidal neuron model fit to monkey dlPFC empirical data, with an axon including myelinated segments having paranodes, juxtaparanodes, internodes, and tight junctions. This model was used to quantify conduction velocity (CV) changes and action potential (AP) failures after demyelination and subsequent remyelination. Next, we incorporated the single neuron results into a spiking neural network model of working memory. While complete remyelination nearly recovered axonal transmission and network function to unperturbed levels, our models predict that biologically plausible levels of myelin dystrophy, if uncompensated by other factors, can account for substantial working memory impairment with aging. The present computational study unites empirical data from ultrastructure up to behavior during normal aging, and has broader implications for many demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95849">Prediction error determines how memories are organized in the brain</a></h4>

              
                How is new information organized in memory? According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: a small prediction error leads to the updating of existing memory, large prediction error leads to encoding of a new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses, and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92110">Allosteric activation of the co-receptor BAK1 by the EFR receptor kinase initiates immune signaling</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane signaling by plant receptor kinases (RKs) has long been thought to involve reciprocal trans-phosphorylation of their intracellular kinase domains. The fact that many of these are pseudokinase domains, however, suggests that additional mechanisms must govern RK signaling activation. Non-catalytic signaling mechanisms of protein kinase domains have been described in metazoans, but information is scarce for plants. Recently, a non-catalytic function was reported for the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RK subfamily XIIa member EFR (elongation factor Tu receptor) and phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes were proposed to regulate signaling of RKs with non-RD kinase domains. Here, using EFR as a model, we describe a non-catalytic activation mechanism for LRR-RKs with non-RD kinase domains. EFR is an active kinase, but a kinase-dead variant retains the ability to enhance catalytic activity of its co-receptor kinase BAK1/SERK3 (brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 3). Applying hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis and designing homology-based intragenic suppressor mutations, we provide evidence that the EFR kinase domain must adopt its active conformation in order to activate BAK1 allosterically, likely by supporting αC-helix positioning in BAK1. Our results suggest a conformational toggle model for signaling, in which BAK1 first phosphorylates EFR in the activation loop to stabilize its active conformation, allowing EFR in turn to allosterically activate BAK1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88905">Deficiency of IQCH causes male infertility in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                IQ motif-containing proteins can be recognized by calmodulin (CaM) and are essential for many biological processes. However, the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the novel gene IQ motif-containing H (<i>IQCH</i>) in a Chinese family with male infertility characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. To verify the function of IQCH, <i>Iqch</i> knockout (KO) mice were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 technology. As expected, the <i>Iqch</i> KO male mice exhibited impaired fertility, which was related to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structures of the axoneme and mitochondria, mirroring the patient phenotypes. Mechanistically, IQCH can bind to CaM and subsequently regulate the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis. Overall, this study revealed the function of IQCH, expanded the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in reproductive processes, and provided important guidance for genetic counseling and genetic diagnosis of male infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91054">Caenorhabditis elegans SEL-5/AAK1 regulates cell migration and cell outgrowth independently of its kinase activity</a></h4>

              
                During <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development, multiple cells migrate long distances or extend processes to reach their final position and/or attain proper shape. The Wnt signalling pathway stands out as one of the major coordinators of cell migration or cell outgrowth along the anterior-posterior body axis. The outcome of Wnt signalling is fine-tuned by various mechanisms including endocytosis. In this study, we show that SEL-5, the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of mammalian AP2-associated kinase AAK1, acts together with the retromer complex as a positive regulator of EGL-20/Wnt signalling during the migration of QL neuroblast daughter cells. At the same time, SEL-5 in cooperation with the retromer complex is also required during excretory canal cell outgrowth. Importantly, SEL-5 kinase activity is not required for its role in neuronal migration or excretory cell outgrowth, and neither of these processes is dependent on DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation. We further establish that the Wnt proteins CWN-1 and CWN-2 together with the Frizzled receptor CFZ-2 positively regulate excretory cell outgrowth, while LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Frizzled together generate a stop signal inhibiting its extension.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90690">Alzheimer’s disease linked Aβ42 exerts product feedback inhibition on γ-secretase impairing downstream cell signaling</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of γ-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Aβ, as well as cell-based and <i>ex vivo</i> assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Aβ on γ-secretases. We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17–42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.

">Brain responses to predictable structure in auditory sequences: From complex regular patterns to tone repetition</a></h4>

              
                In classical studies of auditory pattern learning, neuronal responses exhibit repetition suppression, where sequences of repeated tones show a reduced evoked response. This may be due in part to adaptation, but is also hypothesized to indicate suppression of expected stimuli. Repetition suppression is thought to form a building block of regularity learning, and is the paradigmatic example of predictive coding in humans and other animals. However, stimuli with more complex patterns appear to show the opposite effect. Predictable regular (REG) patterns distributed over a range of frequencies show a strongly enhanced sustained brain response compared to frequency-matched random (RAND) sequences, sitting at odds with the usual reduced evoked responses to predictable stimuli. A limiting factor in reconciling these findings is that they are obtained using different stimuli and analysis methods. This human EEG study (N=20) brings together auditory sequence predictability and repetition in a single paradigm, based on rapidly unfolding tone pip patterns, incorporating sequences consisting of exactly repeating tones at a single frequency, alongside REG and RAND of varying complexity. We demonstrate that regularity is associated with increased sustained responses, offset responses, tone locked responses and cycle-locked responses. We further show that both repetition suppression and repetition enhancement occur over different timescales, and that sustained brain responses to simple repetition show qualitatively different effects than to more complex regularities during automatic tracking of stimulus statistics. Our results indicate a system for automatic monitoring of predictability in the auditory environment, which is distinct from, but concurrent with, repetition suppression.

">Loss of PINK1 causes age-dependent mitochondrial trafficking deficits in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons through aberrant activation of p38 MAPK</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause early-onset, autosomal-recessive familial inherited Parkinson disease (PD). Previous studies have shown age-related declines in dopamine release and ATP levels in the striatum of Pink1-/- mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. While, the role of PINK1 in mitochondrial transport has been studied in cell culture and Drosophila, its impacts on axonal transport in dopaminergic neurons and the consequent synaptic and axonal degeneration in vivo remain critical questions that warrant further investigation. In this study, we developed a TH-mito-Dendra2 transgenic mouse model to label mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons with Dendra2 protein. Using this model, we found that loss of PINK1 causes age-dependent deficits in mitochondrial axonal trafficking, with reduced anterograde movement and increased static mitochondria in acute brain slices. Inducing ROS and calcium release pharmacologically impaired mitochondrial motility, and Pink1-/- mice exhibited elevated mitochondrial calcium and ROS levels. Furthermore, Pink1-/- mice showed p38 MAPK hyperactivation and reduced Miro1 expression. Treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 restored mitochondrial motility and increased anterograde transport. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of PINK1 disrupts mitochondrial trafficking by disturbing calcium homeostasis and ROS production via the p38 pathway for PD pathogenesis.

">The noncoding circular RNA circHomer1 regulates developmental experience-dependent plasticity in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs abundant in brain tissue, and many are derived from activity-dependent, linear mRNAs encoding for synaptic proteins, suggesting that circRNAs may directly or indirectly play a role in regulating synaptic development, plasticity, and function. However, it is unclear if the circular forms of these RNAs are similarly regulated by activity and what role these circRNAs play in developmental plasticity. Here, we employed transcriptome-wide analysis comparing differential expression of both mRNAs and circRNAs in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) following monocular deprivation (MD), a model of developmental plasticity. Among the differentially expressed mRNAs and circRNAs following 3-day MD, the circular and the activity-dependent linear forms of the Homer1 gene, circHomer1 and Homer1a respectively, were of interest as their expression changed in opposite directions: circHomer1 expression increased while the expression of Homer1a decreased following MD. Knockdown of circHomer1 prevented the depression of closed-eye responses normally observed after 3-day MD. circHomer1-knockdown led to a reduction in average dendritic spine size prior to MD, but critically there was no further reduction after 3-day MD, consistent with impaired structural plasticity. circHomer1-knockdown also prevented the reduction of surface AMPA receptors after 3-day MD. Synapse-localized puncta of the AMPA receptor endocytic protein Arc increased in volume after MD but were smaller in circHomer1-knockdown neurons, suggesting that circHomer1 regulates plasticity through mechanisms of activity-dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis. Thus, activity-dependent circRNAs are regulated by developmental synaptic plasticity, and our findings highlight the essential role of circHomer1 in V1 plasticity induced by short-term MD.

">Surfing beta burst waveforms to improve motor imagery-based BCI</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of motor-related, macroscale brain processes has been significantly shaped by the description of the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) phenomena in the mu and beta frequency bands prior to, during and following movement. The demonstration of reproducible, spatially- and band-limited signal power changes has, consequently, attracted the interest of non invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) research for a long time. BCIs often rely on motor imagery (MI) experimental paradigms that are expected to generate brain signal modulations analogous to movement-related ERD and ERS. However, a number of recent neuroscience studies has questioned the nature of these phenomena. Beta band activity has been shown to occur, on a single-trial level, in short, transient and heterogeneous events termed bursts rather than sustained oscillations. In a previous study, we established that an analysis of hand MI binary classification tasks based on beta bursts can be superior to beta power in terms of classification score. In this article we elaborate on this idea, proposing a signal processing algorithm that is comparable to- and compatible with state-of-the-art techniques. Our pipeline filters brain recordings by convolving them with kernels extracted from beta bursts and then applies spatial filtering before classification. This data-driven filtering allowed for a simple and efficient analysis of signals from multiple sensors thus being suitable for online applications. By adopting a time-resolved decoding approach we explored MI dynamics and showed the specificity of the new classification features. In accordance with previous results, beta bursts improved classification performance compared to beta band power, while often increasing information transfer rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

">Social Decision Preferences for Close Others are Embedded in Neural and Linguistic Representations</a></h4>

              
                Humans frequently make decisions that impact close others. Prior research has shown that people have stable preferences regarding such decisions and maintain rich, nuanced mental representations of their close social partners. Yet, if and how such mental representations shape social decisions preferences remains to be seen. Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and natural language processing (NLP), this study investigated how neural and linguistic representations of close others influence social decision-making. Participants nominated a parent and a friend, rated their characteristics, and made hypothetical social decisions while undergoing fMRI. Neural representations of parents and friends, relative to the self, predicted social decision preferences. Specifically, greater neural similarity between self and parent in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was associated with a preference for parents, while greater self-friend similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) predicted friend-preference. Additionally, linguistic analysis of written descriptions of close others revealed that social decision preferences could be reliably predicted from semantic features of the text. The convergence of neural and linguistic data further strengthened the prediction of social decision preferences. These findings elucidate the neural and linguistic underpinnings of social decision-making, emphasizing the critical role of mental representations in guiding choices involving familiar others.

">Mapping activity and functional organisation of the motor and visual pathways using ADC-fMRI in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI), which relies on changes in blood flow and oxygenation levels to infer brain activity, diffusion fMRI (DfMRI) investigates brain dynamics by monitoring alterations in the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) of water. These ADC changes may arise from fluctuations in neuronal morphology, providing a distinctive perspective on neural activity. The potential of ADC as an fMRI contrast (ADC-fMRI) lies in its capacity to reveal neural activity independently of neurovascular coupling, thus yielding complementary insights into brain function. To demonstrate the specificity and value of ADC-fMRI, both ADC- and BOLD-fMRI data were collected at 3T in human subjects during visual stimulation and motor tasks. The first aim of this study was to identify an acquisition design for ADC that minimises BOLD contributions. By examining the timings in responses, we report that ADC 0/1 timeseries (acquired with b-values of 0 and 1 ms/um2 exhibit residual vascular contamination while ADC 0.2/1 timeseries (with b-values of 0.2 and 1 ms/um2 show minimal BOLD influence and higher sensitivity to neuromorphological coupling. Second, a General Linear Model was employed to identify activation clusters for ADC 0.2/1 and BOLD, from which average ADC and BOLD responses were calculated. The negative ADC response exhibited a significantly reduced delay relative to the task onset and offset as compared to BOLD. This early onset further supports the notion that ADC is sensitive to neuromorphological rather than neurovascular coupling. Remarkably, in the group-level analysis, positive BOLD activation clusters were detected in the visual and motor cortices, while the negative ADC clusters mainly highlighted pathways in white matter connected to the motor cortex. In the averaged individual level analysis, negative ADC activation clusters were also present in the visual cortex. This finding confirmed the reliability of negative ADC as an indicator of brain function, even in regions with lower vascularisation such as white matter. Finally, we established that ADC-fMRI timecourses yield the expected functional organisation of the visual system, including both gray and white matter regions of interest. Functional connectivity matrices were used to perform hierarchical clustering of brain regions, where ADC-fMRI successfully reproduced the expected structure of the dorsal and ventral visual pathways. This organisation was not replicated with the b=0.2 ms/um2 diffusion-weighted time courses, which can be seen as a proxy for BOLD (via T2-weighting). These findings underscore the robustness of ADC time courses in functional MRI studies, offering complementary insights to BOLD-fMRI regarding brain function and connectivity patterns.

">Oscillations create groove: A reservoir model for learning complex drumming performances</a></h4>

              
                Musical performances, particularly drumming, intricately balance rhythmic patterns and creative expression, all heavily influenced by the concept of 'groove'. This study explored how the brain learns and internalizes complex rhythms and grooves from a computational perspective. The cerebellum and basal ganglia play key roles in rhythm perception, production, and timing. We utilized an oscillation-driven reservoir computing model, which is a simplified recurrent neural network designed for timing learning, to acquire complex rhythms. The model was trained to replicate the drumming style of Jeff Porcaro by learning his hi-hat patterns. Analyses revealed that the model's outputs, including fluctuations in interbeat timings and amplitudes, were similar to the original drumming. Next, it was trained to generate multidimensional drum kit performances for various genres (funk, jazz, samba, and rock). Model outputs had timing deviation and audio features related to a sense of groove, similar to the original performances. By incorporating the oscillations of multiple frequencies into the reservoir, the model reproduced fluctuations of timing intervals (microtiming) and amplitudes, as well as audio features of each musical genre. Our results indicated that oscillation-driven reservoir computing can successfully replicate the timing and rhythmic complexity of professional drumming, suggesting that it is a common computational principle for motor timing and rhythm generation. Furthermore, this approach offers insights into the neural underpinnings of musical groove, shedding light on how the brain processes and reproduces intricate rhythmic patterns.

">Temporal asymmetry of neural representations predicts memory decisions</a></h4>

              
                A stimulus can be familiar for multiple reasons. It might have been recently encountered, or is similar to recent experience, or is similar to 'typical' experience. Understanding how the brain translates these sources of similarity into memory decisions is a fundamental, but challenging goal. Here, using fMRI, we computed neural similarity between a current stimulus and events from different temporal windows in the past and future (from seconds to days). We show that trial-by-trial memory decisions (is this stimulus 'old'?) were predicted by the difference in similarity to past vs. future events (temporal asymmetry). This relationship was (i) evident in lateral parietal and occipitotemporal cortices, (ii) strongest when considering events from the recent past (minutes ago), and (iii) most pronounced when veridical (true) memories were weak. These findings suggest a new perspective in which the brain supports memory decisions by comparing what actually occurred to what is likely to occur.

                Facial skin texture provides crucial visual cues that reflect an individual's impressions and health conditions. In this study, we focused on the texture attribute of "moisture" and investigated which visual cues influenced skin moisture perception. The stimuli consisted of images from three facial areas (the whole face, cheek, and eyebrow areas) with and without makeup under two lighting directions. The participants rated the presented stimuli on the three texture attributes (moisture, glossiness, and attractiveness) using a five-point scale. The results from Experiment 1 revealed correlations between the ratings and histogram statistics of each channel in the CIELAB color space, with variations depending on the conditions and facial regions. A negative correlation was observed between the cheek moisture perception and the variance in the L* channel. We subsequently obtained similar ratings by enhancing the high-frequency components of skin lightness for artificially dried stimuli (Experiment 2) and for images depicting different skin conditions due to various types of makeup (Experiment 3). Both experiments confirmed a decrease in moisture and attractiveness and an increase in glossiness; these were correlated with the degree of artificial drying. These findings indicated that the high-frequency components of skin lightness could be visual cues for determining the perceived dryness.

">Spatiotemporal transcriptomic profiling and modeling of mouse brain at single-cell resolution reveals cell proximity effects of aging and rejuvenation</a></h4>

              
                Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk. Brain aging is complex and accompanied by many cellular changes. However, the influence that aged cells have on neighboring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in aging tissues have not yet been developed. Here, we generate spatiotemporal data at single-cell resolution for the mouse brain across lifespan, and we develop the first machine learning models based on spatial transcriptomics ('spatial aging clocks') to reveal cell proximity effects during brain aging and rejuvenation. We collect a single-cell spatial transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages and across two rejuvenating interventions--exercise and partial reprogramming. We identify spatial and cell type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of aging, rejuvenation, and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial aging clocks and deep learning models, we find that T cells, which infiltrate the brain with age, have a striking pro-aging proximity effect on neighboring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating effect on neighboring cells. By developing computational tools to identify mediators of these proximity effects, we find that pro-aging T cells trigger a local inflammatory response likely via interferon-gamma; whereas pro-rejuvenating neural stem cells impact the metabolism of neighboring cells possibly via growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor) and extracellular vesicles, and we experimentally validate some of these predictions. These results suggest that rare cells can have a drastic influence on their neighbors and could be targeted to counter tissue aging. We anticipate that these spatial aging clocks will not only allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for aging and disease but also represent a new tool for studying cell-cell interactions in many spatial contexts.

">RAB12-LRRK2 Complex Suppresses Primary Ciliogenesis and Regulates Centrosome Homeostasis in Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) phosphorylates a subset of RAB GTPases, and the phosphorylation levels are elevated by Parkinson's disease (PD)-linked mutations of LRRK2. However, the precise function of the specific RAB GTPase targeted by LRRK2 signaling in the brain remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify RAB12 as a robust LRRK2 substrate in the mouse brains through phosphoproteomics profiling and solve the structure of RAB12-LRRK2 protein complex through Cryo-EM analysis. Mechanistically, RAB12 cooperates with LRRK2 to inhibit primary ciliogenesis and regulate centrosome homeostasis in astrocytes through enhancing the phosphorylation of RAB10 and recruiting Rab interacting lysosomal protein like 1 (RILPL1), while the functions of RAB12 require a direct interaction with LRRK2 and LRRK2 kinase activity. Furthermore, the ciliary deficits and centrosome alteration caused by the PD-linked LRRK2-G2019S mutation are prevented by the deletion of Rab12 in astrocytes. Thus, our study reveals a physiological function of the RAB12-LRRK2 complex in regulating ciliogenesis and centrosome homeostasis. The RAB12-LRRK2 structure offers a guidance in the therapeutic development of PD by targeting the RAB12-LRRK2 interaction.

">All-optical mapping of Ca2+ transport and homeostasis in dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Calcium mediates many important signals in dendrites. However, the basic transport properties of calcium in dendrites have been difficult to measure: how far and how fast does a local influx of calcium propagate? We developed an all-optical system for simultaneous targeted Ca2+ import and concentration mapping. We co-expressed a blue light-activated calcium selective channelrhodopsin, CapChR2, with a far-red calcium sensor, FR-GECO1c, in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, and used patterned optogenetic stimulation to introduce calcium into cells with user-defined patterns of space and time. We determined a mean steady-state length constant for Ca2+ transport {phi} ~ 5.8 m, a half-life for return to baseline t1/2 ~ 1.7 s, and an effective diffusion coefficient D ~ 20 m2/s, though there were substantial differences in Ca2+ dynamics between proximal and distal dendrites. At high Ca2+ concentration, distal dendrites showed nonlinear activation of Ca2+ efflux, which we pharmacologically ascribed to the NCX1 antiporter. Genetically encoded tools for all-optical study of Ca2+ transport and handling provide a powerful capability for studying this important messenger.

">Beyond Auditory Relay: Dissecting the Inferior Colliculus's Role in Sensory Prediction, Cognitive Decision-Making, and Reward Prediction</a></h4>

              
                The Inferior Colliculus (IC) has traditionally been regarded as an important relay in the auditory pathway, primarily involved in relaying auditory information from the brainstem to the thalamus. However, this study uncovers the multifaceted role of the IC in bridging auditory processing, sensory prediction, and reward prediction. Through extracellular recordings in monkeys engaged in a sound duration-based novelty detection task, we observed a "climbing effect" in neuronal firing rates, indicative of an enhanced response over sound sequences linked to sensory prediction rather than reward anticipation. Further exploration revealed a direct correlation between IC neuronal activity and behavioral choices, suggesting its involvement in decision-making processes. Additionally, our findings demonstrate reward prediction errors within the IC, highlighting its complex integration in auditory and reward processing. This research challenges conventional views of the IC, showcasing its integral role in cognitive and sensory processing and emphasizing its importance in integrated brain functions.

">Social odors drive hippocampal CA2 place cell responses to social stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal region CA2 is essential for social memory processing. Interaction with social stimuli induces changes in CA2 place cell firing during active exploration and sharp wave-ripples during rest following a social interaction. However, it is unknown whether these changes in firing patterns are caused by integration of multimodal social stimuli or by a specific sensory modality associated with a social interaction. Rodents rely heavily on chemosensory cues in the form of olfactory signals for social recognition processes. To determine the extent to which olfactory signals contribute to CA2 place cell responses to social stimuli, we recorded CA2 place cells in rats freely exploring environments containing social stimuli that included or lacked olfactory content. We found that CA2 place cell firing patterns significantly changed only when social odors were prominent. Also, place cells that increased their firing in the presence of social odors alone preferentially increased their firing during subsequent sharp wave-ripples. Our results suggest that olfactory cues are essential for changing CA2 place cell firing patterns during and after social interactions. These results support prior work suggesting CA2 performs social functions and shed light on processes underlying CA2 responses to social stimuli.

">A cafeteria diet blunts effects of exercise on adult hippocampal neurogenesis but not neurogenesis-dependent behaviours in adult male rats</a></h4>

              
                Animal studies have shown that a cafeteria (CAF) diet (high in saturated fat and sugar), is associated with memory impairments and increased anxiety, while exercise can enhance antidepressant-like effects and cognitive function. The mechanisms underlying the effects of a CAF diet, exercise, or their convergence on memory, mood and anxiety are not fully understood, but alterations in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), gut microbial metabolites, or plasma metabolic hormones may play a role. Therefore, this study investigated whether a 7.5-week voluntary running exercise intervention in young adult male rats could alter the effects of a concurrent CAF diet on depression-like, anxiety-like and cognitive behaviours and AHN, and determined associated changes in metabolic hormones and gut microbial metabolites. We found that exercise produced a mild anxiolytic effect, regardless of diet, and increased PYY, a hormone previously shown to reduce anxiety-like behaviour. CAF diet induced differential abundance of caecal metabolites, and exercise attenuated CAF diet-induced decreases in certain metabolites implicated in cognitive function or depression-like behaviour. Although exercise exerted antidepressant-like effects in the FST, induced subtle improvements in spatial learning strategy, and increased plasma metabolic hormones previously implicated in depression-like behaviour in CAF diet-fed animals, CAF diet blunted exercise-induced increases in plasma GLP-1 and AHN, suggesting that exercise should be accompanied by a healthy diet to increase AHN. Together, these findings highlight the importance of exercise and healthy diet for hippocampal health and provide insight into potential metabolite and hormone-mediated mechanisms underlying the effects of CAF diet and exercise on brain and behaviour.

">Altered resting-state brain entropy (BEN) by rTMS across the human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method effective in treating various neuropsychiatric disorders, yet its mechanisms are not fully understood. In general, rTMS protocols are categorized into excitatory protocols including high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), and inhibitory protocols including low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS). Brain entropy (BEN) measures irregularity, disorders, and complexity of brain activity, our previous studies have indicated that BEN affects excitatory rTMS, including HF-rTMS and iTBS. However, two important questions remain whether rTMS is equally sensitive to inhibitory rTMS and whether it can induce opposite brain activities, another question concerns whether rTMS can induce specific changes across brain regions. To address these issues, we utilized our own cTBS targeted on the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) dataset and publicly available LF-rTMS dataset with stimulating sites including the L-DLPFC, left temporal parietal junction (L-TPJ), and left occipital cortex (L-OCC), from the OpenNeuro. BEN maps were calculated before and after stimulation. The results showed that L-DLPFC cTBS increased BEN in the MOFC and L-DLPFC LF-rTMS increased BEN in the MOFC, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (MOFC/sgACC) and putamen, the regions are consistent with our previous findings with HF-rTMS and iTBS. Additionally, L-TPJ LF-rTMS resulted in increased BEN in the right TPJ, while L-OCC LF-rTMS led to decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Our findings suggest that BEN is not only sensitive to excitatory rTMS but also to inhibitory rTMS. Moreover, LF-rTMS induces different effects across brain regions, as detected by BEN.

">Neural dynamics underlying minute-timescale persistent behavior in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The ability to pursue long-term goals relies on a representations of task context that can both be maintained over long periods of time and switched flexibly when goals change. Little is known about the neural substrate for such minute-scale maintenance of task sets. Utilizing recordings in neurosurgical patients, we examined how groups of neurons in the human medial frontal cortex and hippocampus represent task contexts. When cued explicitly, task context was encoded in both brain areas and changed rapidly at task boundaries. Hippocampus exhibited a temporally dynamic code with fast decorrelation over time, preventing cross-temporal generalization. Medial frontal cortex exhibited a static code that decorrelated slowly, allowing generalization across minutes of time. When task context needed to be inferred as a latent variable, hippocampus encoded task context with a static code. These findings reveal two possible regimes for encoding minute-scale task-context representations that were engaged differently based on task demands.

                Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) GABAergic interneurons play a key role in maintaining the excitation inhibition balance in the mammalian neocortex. Here we address the function of thyroid hormones in PV neurons in the mouse neocortex. To this end, Cre/loxP recombination system was used to express a dominant negative mutated receptor of thyroid hormones only in PV neurons. We analyzed the neocortical phenotype of these mice, in which thyroid hormone signaling is eliminated specifically in PV neurons, by combining genomics, histology, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis. We found significantly altered gene expression, reduced expression of key perineuronal net components, reduced PV neuron excitability, behavioral hyperactivity and increased susceptibility to seizures. These results highlight that thyroid hormones are not only required for the differentiation of PV interneurons, but also for the maintenance of their inhibitory function after the onset of parvalbumin expression.

                Active and passive sensing strategies are integral to an animal's behavioral repertoire. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the neuronal circuitry that underpins these strategies, particularly at the thalamus level. We evaluated how active versus passive whisker deflections are represented in single neurons of the ventral posterior thalamus (VPM) and the posterior medial thalamus (POm) in awake mice. These are the first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei of the whisker system, respectively. VPM neurons robustly responded to both active and passive whisker deflections, while POm neurons showed a preference for passive deflections and responded poorly to active touches. This response disparity could not be explained by the animal's voluntary whisking state or stimulus kinetics. In contrast, cortical activity significantly influenced POm's responses to passive touch. Inhibition of the barrel cortex strongly attenuated whisker responses in POm and simultaneously increased the whisking phase coding. This suggests that POm receives touch information from the cortex and phase information from the brainstem. Together, these findings suggest two thalamic relay streams, where VPM robustly relays both active and passive deflection, while POm's sensitivity requires top-down cortical involvement to signal salient events such as unexpected passive deflections.

">Genetic Foundations of Neurophysiological and Behavioural Variability Across the Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological brain activity underpins cognitive functions and behavioural traits. Here, we sought to establish to what extent individual neurophysiological traits spontaneously expressed in ongoing brain activity are primarily driven by genetic variation. We also investigated whether changes in such neurophysiological features observed across the lifespan are supported by longitudinal changes in cortical gene expression. We studied the heritability of neurophysiological traits from task-free brain activity of monozygotic and dizygotic twins as well as non-related individuals recorded with magnetoencephalography. We found that these traits were more similar between monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins, and that these heritable core dynamical properties of brain activity are predominantly influenced by genes involved in neurotransmission processes. These genes are expressed in the cortex along a topographical gradient aligned with the distribution of major cognitive functions and psychological processes. Our data also show that the impact of these genetic determinants on cognitive and psychological traits increases with age. These findings collectively highlight the persistent genetic influence across the lifespan on neurophysiological brain activity that supports individual cognitive and behavioural traits.

">Brain Structural Correlates of an Impending Initial Major Depressive Episode</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuroimaging research has yet to elucidate, whether reported gray matter volume (GMV) alterations in major depressive disorder (MDD) exist already before the onset of the first episode. Recruitment of presently healthy individuals with a known future transition to MDD (converters) is extremely challenging but crucial to gain insights into neurobiological vulnerability. Hence, we compared converters to patients with MDD and sustained healthy controls (HC) to distinguish pre-existing neurobiological markers from those emerging later in the course of depression. Methods: Combining two clinical cohorts (n=1709), voxel-wise GMV of n=45 converters, n=748 patients with MDD, and n=916 HC were analyzed in regions-of-interest approaches. By contrasting the subgroups and considering both remission state and reported recurrence at a 2-year clinical follow-up, we stepwise disentangled effects of 1) vulnerability, 2) the acute depressive state, and 3) an initial vs. a recurrent episode. Results: Analyses revealed higher amygdala GMV in converters relative to HC (pTFCE-FWE=.037, d=0.447) and patients (pTFCE-FWE=.005, d=0.508), remaining significant when compared to remitted patients with imminent recurrence. Lower GMV in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (pTFCE-FWE<.001, d=0.188) and insula (pTFCE-FWE=.010, d=0.186) emerged in patients relative to HC but not to converters, driven by patients with acute MDD. Conclusion: By examining one of the largest available converter samples in psychiatric neuroimaging, this study allowed a first determination of neural markers for an impending initial depressive episode. Our findings suggest a temporary vulnerability, which in combination with other common risk factors might facilitate prediction and in turn improve prevention of depression.

">Auditory-motor entrainment and listening experience shape the perceptual learning of concurrent speech</a></h4>

              
                Background: Plasticity from auditory experience shapes the brain's encoding and perception of sound. Though prior research demonstrates that neural entrainment (i.e., brain-to-acoustic synchronization) aids speech perception, how long- and short-term plasticity influence entrainment to concurrent speech has not been investigated. Here, we explored neural entrainment mechanisms and the interplay between short- and long-term neuroplasticity for rapid auditory perceptual learning of concurrent speech sounds in young, normal-hearing musicians and nonmusicians. Method: Participants learned to identify double-vowel mixtures during ~45 min training sessions with concurrent high-density EEG recordings. We examined the degree to which brain responses entrained to the speech-stimulus train (~9 Hz) to investigate whether entrainment to speech prior to behavioral decision predicted task performance. Source and directed functional connectivity analyses of the EEG probed whether behavior was driven by group differences auditory-motor coupling. Results: Both musicians and nonmusicians showed rapid perceptual learning in accuracy with training. Interestingly, listeners' neural entrainment strength prior to target speech mixtures predicted behavioral identification performance; stronger neural synchronization was observed preceding incorrect compared to correct trial responses. We also found stark hemispheric biases in auditory-motor coupling during speech entrainment, with greater auditory-motor connectivity in the right compared to left hemisphere for musicians (R>L) but not in nonmusicians (R=L). Conclusions: Our findings confirm stronger neuroacoustic synchronization and auditory-motor coupling during speech processing in musicians. Stronger neural entrainment to rapid stimulus trains preceding incorrect behavioral responses supports the notion that alpha-band (~10 Hz) arousal/suppression in brain activity is an important modulator of trial-by-trial success in perceptual processing.

">Altered Cortical Network Dynamics during Observing and Preparing Action in Patients with Corticobasal Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Besides parkinsonism, higher order cortical dysfunctions such as apraxia are hallmarks of the corticobasal syndrome (CBS). To date, little is known about the electrophysiological underpinnings of these symptoms. To shed more light on the pathophysiology of CBS, we recorded the magnetoencephalogram of 17 CBS patients and 20 age-matched controls engaged in an observe-to-imitate task. The task involved the display of a tool-use video in first person view (action observation), a written instruction to withhold movement until the presentation of a Go cue (movement preparation), and unilateral tool-use imitation. We investigated modulations of spectral power on the source level. Action observation was associated with an event-related desynchronization in the beta-band (13-30Hz), which was weaker in CBS patients than in healthy controls. The group effect localized to superior parietal, primary motor, premotor and inferior frontal cortex bilaterally. While participants awaited the Go cue, beta power was again suppressed in the hemisphere contralateral to movement, and the rate of suppression correlated with reaction time. This modulation, too, was weaker in the CBS group. Immediately before movement onset, however, beta power was similar in both groups. Our results reveal that action observation triggers beta suppression, likely reflecting motor cortical disinhibition, which is reduced in CBS patients. This pathological alteration might be a neural correlate of a selective deficit in the embedding of observed action into a motor representation (visuo-motor mapping). The suboptimal timing of the beta-power suppression to the upcoming Go cue presumably reflects a deficit in learning the trial's temporal structure rather than a deficit in movement initialization.

">Happiness promotes global processing in haptic perception</a></h4>

              
                Happy and sad mood promote global and local visual processing, respectively. However, it is unclear whether mood also affects the processing level in haptic perception. Here, we used classical music to induce happy and sad mood in blindfolded participants before they scanned 3D-printed configurations with their fingers. Global shapes were triangles, circles, or squares (33mm) composed of smaller local relief shapes (3 mm): either triangles, circles, or squares. Participants explored a probe stimulus with identical local and global shapes, and two comparison stimuli, matching the probe in local, or global shape. They reported which comparison stimulus appeared more similar to the probe. In the 'sad' group, participants chose the locally-matching comparison more frequently than in the 'happy' group, revealing that sad mood promotes local processing also in touch. Overall, participants chose the globally-matching comparison more often, suggesting that global processing is more prominent in touch than assumed.

">Temporal dynamics analysis reveals that concurrent working memory load eliminates the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping</a></h4>

              
                Concurrent verbal working memory task can eliminate the color-word Stroop effect. Previous research, based on specific and limited resources, suggested that the disappearance of the conflict effect was due to the memory information preempting the resources for distractors. However, it remains unclear which particular stage of Stroop conflict processing is influenced by working memory loads. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with event-related potential (ERP) analyses, time-frequency analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA), and representational similarity analyses (RSA) were applied to provide an in-depth investigation of the aforementioned issue. Subjects were required to complete the single task (the classical manual color-word Stroop task) and the dual task (the Sternberg working memory task combined with the Stroop task), respectively. Behaviorally, the results indicated that the Stroop effect was eliminated in the dual-task condition. The EEG results showed that the concurrent working memory task did not modulate the P1 and alpha bands. However, it modulated the sustained potential (SP), late theta (740-820 ms), and beta (920-1040 ms) power, showing no difference between congruent and incongruent trials in the dual-task condition but a significant difference in the single-task condition. Importantly, the RSA results revealed that the neural activation pattern of the late theta was similar to the response interaction pattern. Together, these findings implied that concurrent working memory task eliminated the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping.

">Characterizing the Spatial Distribution of Dendritic RNA at Single Molecule Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Neurons possess highly polarized morphology that require intricate molecular organization, partly facilitated by RNA localization. By localizing specific mRNA, neurons can modulate synaptic features through local translation and subsequent modification of protein concentrations in response to stimuli. The resulting activity-dependent modifications are essential for synaptic plasticity, and consequently, fundamental for learning and memory. Consequently, high-resolution characterization of the spatial distribution of dendritic transcripts and the spatial relationship across transcripts is critical for understanding the pathways and mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. In this study, we characterize the spatial distribution of six previously uncharacterized genes (Adap2, Colec12, Dtx3L, Kif5c, Nsmf, Pde2a) within the dendrites at a sub-micrometer scale, using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). We found that spatial distributions of dendritically localized mRNA depended on both dendrite morphology and gene identity that cannot be recreated by diffusion alone, suggesting involvement of active mechanisms. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that dendritically localized mRNAs are likely co-transported and organized into clusters at larger spatial scales, indicating a more complex organization of mRNA within dendrites.

">A ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complex represents a core-module of neuronal synapse organization</a></h4>

              
                Complexes of synaptic adhesion molecules instruct the formation, functional specification and plasticity of neuronal synapses. Proteomic and candidate gene studies have identified an array of synaptic adhesion molecules that may cooperate or provide independent columns connecting synaptic compartments, thereby, promoting the nucleation of presynaptic active zones and recruitment of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. Here, we used a systematic large-scale multi-epitope affinity-purification approach (total of >120 purifications with 30 target proteins), combined with quantitative mass spectrometry to comprehensively map trans-synaptic protein networks in the mouse brain. We discover a universal presynaptic core-module consisting of the neurexin proteins and LAR-type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRD,S,F), linked by the tetraspanin proteins T178A, B. These ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes form through their trans-membrane domains and assemble during biogenesis in the ER. Loss of T178B results in module dissociation and loss of LAR-PTPRs. At synapses, the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module recruits stable trans-synaptic protein networks with specific pre- and post-synaptic partners and secreted extracellular linkers. These networks encompass stable associations with unique postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor complexes, identifying the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module as a central, universal integrator of trans-synaptic signaling in the central nervous system.

	<p>Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in many organs, resulting in clinical symptoms, mostly hepatic and neuropsychiatric. As copper accumulates in the brain during WD, and almost 50% of WD patients at diagnosis present with neurological symptoms, neuroimaging studies (especially brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) are part of WD diagnosis. The classical sequences (T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) were used to describe brain MRI; however, with the development of neuroradiology, several papers proposed the use of new MRI sequences and techniques like susceptibility-weighted images, T2*, diffusion MRI, tractography, volumetric assessment and post-processing brain MRI analysis of paramagnetic accumulation&amp;amp;mdash;quantitative susceptibility mapping. Based on these neuroradiological data in WD, currently, brain MRI semiquantitative scale and the pathognomonic neuroradiological brain MRI signs in WD were proposed. Further, the volumetric studies and brain iron accumulation MRI analysis suggested brain atrophy and iron accumulation as biomarkers of neurological WD disease severity. All these results highlight the significance of brain MRI examinations in WD. Due to the extreme progress of these studies, based on the available literature, the authors present the current state of knowledge about the significance, practical aspects, and future directions of brain MRI in WD.</p>

	<p>Recent evidence suggests a connection between hyperacusis and the motor system of the brain. For instance, our recent study reported that hyperacusis in participants with tinnitus and hearing loss is associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Given that hearing loss can affect gray matter changes in tinnitus, this study aimed to determine if the changes reported in our previous findings of smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis persist in the absence of hearing loss. Data for this study were gathered from four prior studies conducted between 2004 and 2019 at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG). A total of 101 participants with tinnitus and either clinically normal hearing (normal hearing with tinnitus or NHT, n = 35) or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (hearing loss with tinnitus or HLT, n = 66) were included across four studies. Hyperacusis was determined by a score of &amp;amp;ge;22 on the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). In the NHT group, 22 (63%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (NHT with hyperacusis: mean age 44.1 years, 12 females), while in the HLT group, 25 (38%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (HLT with hyperacusis: mean age 59.5 years, 10 females). The 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 between-group ANOVAs revealed that hyperacusis is associated with smaller SMA gray matter volumes, regardless of hearing levels. Notably, the smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis were primarily influenced by the attentional subscales of the HQ. The association between hyperacusis and the motor system may indicate a constant alertness to sounds and a readiness for motor action.</p>

	<p>Background. The majority of deaths in patients with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are caused by natural causes, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The increased risk of CVD and other somatic diseases in SMIs cannot be fully explained by the contribution of traditional risk factors, behavioral risk factors, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; lifestyle peculiarities, and the influence of antipsychotics. The present review has the following main objectives: (1) to aggregate evidence that neurodevelopmental disorders are the basis of SMIs; (2) to provide a review of studies that have addressed the shared genetic architecture of SMI and cardiovascular disease; and (3) to propose and substantiate the consideration of somatic diseases as independent endophenotypes of SMIs, which will make it possible to place the research of somatic diseases in SMIs within the framework of the concepts of the &amp;amp;ldquo;neurodevelopmental continuum and gradient&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;endophenotype&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods. A comprehensive literature search was performed on 1 July 2024. The search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases up to June 2024. Results. The current literature reveals considerable overlap between the genetic susceptibility loci for SMIs and CVDs. We propose that somatic diseases observed in SMIs that have a shared genetic architecture with SMIs can be considered distinct physical health-related endophenotypes. Conclusions.

                <p>In human adults, multiple cortical regions respond robustly to faces, including the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), implicated in face perception, and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), implicated in higher-level social functions. When in development, does face selectivity arise in each of these regions? Here, we combined two awake infant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to create a sample size twice the size of previous reports (<I>n</I> = 65 infants; 2.6&ndash;9.6&nbsp;months). Infants watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes, while fMRI data were collected. Despite variable amounts of data from each infant, individual subject whole-brain activation maps revealed responses to faces compared to nonface visual categories in the approximate location of OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC. To determine the strength and nature of face selectivity in these regions, we used cross-validated functional region of interest analyses. Across this larger sample size, face responses in OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC were significantly greater than responses to bodies, objects, and scenes. Even the youngest infants (2&ndash;5&nbsp;months) showed significantly face-selective responses in FFA, STS, and MPFC, but not OFA. These results demonstrate that face selectivity is present in multiple cortical regions within months of birth, providing powerful constraints on theories of cortical development.</p>

                <p>Quantifying and analyzing licking behavior can offer valuable insights into fundamental neurobiological mechanisms controlling animal consummatory behaviors. Lickometers are typically based on electrical properties, a strategy that comes with limitations, including susceptibility to electrical interference and generation of electrical disturbances in electrophysiological measurements. While optical lickometers offer an alternative method to measure licks and quantify fluid intake in animals, they are prone to false readings and susceptibility to outside light sources. To overcome this problem, we propose a low-cost open-source lickometer that combines a restricted infrared beam defined by optical fibers, with a poke design that allows easy access to the tongue while limiting access of other body parts and external light sources. This device also includes features for detecting nose pokes and presenting visual cues during behavioral tasks. We provide validation experiments that demonstrate the optical lickometer's reliability, high-sensitivity and precision, and its application in a behavioral task, showcasing the potential of this tool to study lick microstructure in combination with other techniques, such as imaging of neural activity, in freely moving mice.</p>

                Objective: To evaluate the scientific production on university social responsibility (USR) from institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted on documents published in indexed journals in the Scopus database from its inception until April 2023. Eligible documents included those on USR describing experiences carried out by universities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of articles per author, average authors per article, average citations per article, and the number of documents with one or more author were described. Bibliometric indicators regarding authors per article, co-authors per article, and institutional collaboration were presented. Bibliometric networks were constructed based on bibliographic coupling analysis of documents by countries and term co-occurrence in titles and abstracts. Results: Of a total of 4075 documents retrieved from Scopus, 150 were included. Documents published between 1997 and 2023 were identified, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. A total of 439 authors were identified, 18 articles had a single author, and an average of 0.3 articles per author and a co-authorship index of 3.13 were found. The percentage of international collaborations was 30.7%. Brazil had the highest proportion of publications (26.4%), followed by Chile (17%) and Colombia (13.2%). Opción and Revista de Ciencias Sociales were the journals with the highest number of articles published (13 each). In the analysis of term co-occurrence, recent years showed an increase in the use of terms related to e-learning, information and communication technologies, virtual education, COVID-19, sustainable development goals, and URSULA (initiative on USR in institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean). Conclusions: A growth in scientific production on USR in Latin America and the Caribbean was identified. The interest in USR documents in recent years has been focused on COVID-19 and the challenges of virtual education and sustainable development.

                Background Digital servitization is a strategic transformation where companies adopt a service-focused approach in response to the prevailing trend of digitalization. Utilizing digital technology, businesses manage product and service operations and develop new value propositions. Further research into digital servitization is essential for maintaining competitiveness and meeting evolving market demands globally. This study aims to comprehend the evolution of digital services from theoretical and practical viewpoints and examines how these challenges are tackled. Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by David A. Brewster, Martin A. Nowak, Josef Tkadlec</p>

Computing the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations is difficult. A key quantity is the fixation time of a single mutant with relative reproduction rate <i>r</i> which invades a population of residents. We say that the fixation time is “fast” if it is at most a polynomial function in terms of the population size <i>N</i>. Here we study fixation times of advantageous mutants (<i>r</i> > 1) and neutral mutants (<i>r</i> = 1) on <i>directed</i> graphs, which are those graphs that have at least some one-way connections. We obtain three main results. First, we prove that for any directed graph the fixation time is fast, provided that <i>r</i> is sufficiently large. Second, we construct an efficient algorithm that gives an upper bound for the fixation time for any graph and any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. Third, we identify a broad class of directed graphs with fast fixation times for any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. This class includes previously studied amplifiers of selection, such as Superstars and Metafunnels. We also show that on some graphs the fixation time is not a monotonically declining function of <i>r</i>; in particular, neutral fixation can occur faster than fixation for small selective advantages.

                <p>by Botond B. Antal, Anthony G. Chesebro, Helmut H. Strey, Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, Corey Weistuch</p>

All fields of science depend on mathematical models. <i>Occam’s razor</i> refers to the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully leveraged to apply Occam’s razor to model parameters. Our method, FixFit, uses a feedforward deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model’s degree of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that add value versus those that do not. In three use cases, we demonstrate the broad applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for the Kepler orbit model and a dynamic model of blood glucose regulation. In the latter, we demonstrate the ability to fit the latent parameters to real data. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale brain model and reduce the search space for viable candidate mechanisms.

                <p>by Nathan J. Doyle, Fergus Cumming, Robin N. Thompson, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

During an infectious disease outbreak, public health policy makers are tasked with strategically implementing interventions whilst balancing competing objectives. To provide a quantitative framework that can be used to guide these decisions, it is helpful to devise a clear and specific objective function that can be evaluated to determine the optimal outbreak response. In this study, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework representing outbreaks of a novel emerging pathogen for which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are imposed or removed based on thresholds for hospital occupancy. These thresholds are set at different levels to define four unique strategies for disease control. We illustrate that the optimal intervention strategy is contingent on the choice of objective function. Specifically, the optimal strategy depends on the extent to which policy makers prioritise reducing health costs due to infection over the costs associated with maintaining interventions. Motivated by the scenario early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporate the development of a vaccine into our modelling framework and demonstrate that a policy maker’s belief about when a vaccine will become available in future, and its eventual coverage (and/or effectiveness), affects the optimal strategy to adopt early in the outbreak. Furthermore, we show how uncertainty in these quantities can be accounted for when deciding which interventions to introduce. This research highlights the benefits of policy makers being explicit about the precise objectives of introducing interventions.

                <p>by Michal Staum, Ayelet-Chen Abraham, Reema Arbid, Varun Sanjay Birari, Matanel Dominitz, Ithai Rabinowitch</p>

Sensory neurons specialize in detecting and signaling the presence of diverse environmental stimuli. Neuronal injury or disease may undermine such signaling, diminishing the availability of crucial information. Can animals distinguish between a stimulus not being present and the inability to sense that stimulus in the first place? To address this question, we studied <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematode worms that lack gentle body touch sensation due to genetic mechanoreceptor dysfunction. We previously showed that worms can compensate for the loss of touch by enhancing their sense of smell, via an FLP-20 neuropeptide pathway. Here, we find that touch-deficient worms exhibit, in addition to sensory compensation, also cautious-like behavior, as if preemptively avoiding potential undetectable hazards. Intriguingly, these behavioral adjustments are abolished when the touch neurons are removed, suggesting that touch neurons are required for signaling the unavailability of touch information, in addition to their conventional role of signaling touch stimulation. Furthermore, we found that the ASE taste neurons, which similarly to the touch neurons, express the FLP-20 neuropeptide, exhibit altered FLP-20 expression levels in a touch-dependent manner, thus cooperating with the touch circuit. These results imply a novel form of neuronal signaling that enables <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> to distinguish between lack of touch stimulation and loss of touch sensation, producing adaptive behavioral adjustments that could overcome the inability to detect potential threats.

Long-read sequencing is driving rapid progress in genome assembly across all major groups of life, including species of the family Drosophilidae, a longtime model system for genetics, genomics, and evolution. We previously developed a cost-effective hybrid Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing approach and used it to assemble 101 drosophilid genomes from laboratory cultures, greatly increasing the number of genome assemblies for this taxonomic group. The next major challenge is to address the laboratory culture bias in taxon sampling by sequencing genomes of species that cannot easily be reared in the lab. Here, we build upon our previous methods to perform amplification-free ONT sequencing of single wild flies obtained either directly from the field or from ethanol-preserved specimens in museum collections, greatly improving the representation of lesser studied drosophilid taxa in whole-genome data. Using Illumina Novaseq X Plus and ONT P2 sequencers with R10.4.1 chemistry, we set a new benchmark for inexpensive hybrid genome assembly at US $150 per genome while assembling genomes from as little as 35 ng of genomic DNA from a single fly. We present 183 new genome assemblies for 179 species as a resource for drosophilid systematics, phylogenetics, and comparative genomics. Of these genomes, 62 are from pooled lab strains and 121 from single adult flies. Despite the sample limitations of working with small insects, most single-fly diploid assemblies are comparable in contiguity (>1 Mb contig N50), completeness (>98% complete dipteran BUSCOs), and accuracy (>QV40 genome-wide with ONT R10.4.1) to assemblies from inbred lines. We present a well-resolved multi-locus phylogeny for 360 drosophilid and 4 outgroup species encompassing all publicly available (as of August 2023) genomes for this group. Finally, we present a Progressive Cactus whole-genome, reference-free alignment built from a subset of 298 suitably high-quality drosophilid genomes. The new assemblies and alignment, along with updated laboratory protocols and computational pipelines, are released as an open resource and as a tool for studying evolution at the scale of an entire insect family.

                Background: Insomnia is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for at least three nights a week or more and lasting for at least 3 months. One of the molecules that play a role in the circadian rhythm of arousal system is hypocretin/orexin. Orexin activates the p38-MAPK signaling pathway and increases phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Centella asiatica (CA) has a role in the signal work of the MAPK/ERK, Akt, and p38 path in many various diseases. Methods: The research method used is true laboratory experimental. The research approach used was randomized control group post-test only. Zebrafish embryos aged 0-7 dpf were used in this study. The treatment group consisted of 5 groups: normal, insomnia, insomnia + 2.5 μg/mL CA, insomnia + 5 μg/mL CA, and insomnia + 10 μg/mL CA. The locomotor motion of zebrafish larvae was observed using Basler cameras on days five-, six- and seven-day post fertilization (dpf), then analyzed by using Western Blot method. Results: The results proved that exposure to CA extract was able to reduce the expression of orexin (91963 ± 9129) and p38 (117425 ± 6398) as an arousal trigger in the sleep-wake cycle, with the most optimal concentration of CA 5 μg/mL. Exposure to CA extract was also able to reduce the expression of ERK (94795 ± 30830) and Akt (60113.5 ± 27833.5) with an optimum concentration of CA 2.5 μg/mL. Conclusion: Exposure to CA extract was able to improve the sleep activity of zebrafish larvae insomnia model by extending the total inactivity time (cumulative duration) and shortening the duration of first sleep (latency to first) in light and dark phases through inhibition of orexin, ERK, p38, and Akt.

                Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has unpredictable severity. Its management is based on initial assessment of disease severity. It ranges from mild interstitial to severe necrotic form; the latter is associated with poor prognosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the gold standard in early detection of pancreatic necrosis and in assessing the severity of AP. Two CT grading systems exist to assess the severity of AP: CT severity Index (CSI) and modified CSI (MCSI). This study compares the usefulness of these two systems in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in AP in comparison with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based screening study of 80 patients aged >12 years with clinical diagnosis of AP who underwent contrast-enhanced CT study of the abdomen. Comparative analysis between MCSI and CSI with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters was assessed by Chi-Squared test. Results: The accuracy of CSI and MCSI in predicting the requirement of critical care, superadded infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requirement of intervention were 73.0%, 64.5%, 69.8% 60.9% and 77.2%, 76.0%, 74.4% & 56.6% respectively. Area under the curve for MCSI score was significantly higher (AUC: 0.861; 95% CI: 0.736-0.986) than CSI score (AUC:0.815;95% CI:0.749-0.941). MCSI and CSI showed significant correlation with Ranson’s criteria; however, MCSI correlation was better (r:0.53; p<0.01) than CSI (r:0.35;p:0.04). Conclusion: CSI and MCSI are better predictors of severity, clinical outcome and mortality compared with Ranson’s criteria, with MCSI being more accurate and better predictor than CSI. The accuracy of MCSI is better than CSI for prediction of requirement of critical care, development of superadded infection and development of MODS in AP. However, CSI and MCSI have low accuracy in predicting intervention in AP.

                <p>Medical school research faculty is increasingly required to complete more comprehensive and time consuming compliance steps for regulatory oversight. These relate to animal studies, information technology, biosafety, and human resources. For physician-scientists, the additional role in clinical care adds to these research areas with regulatory compliance in patient care and ever-growing web trainings. The sum of all these compliance regimes is a considerable time and cost burden, diminished research performance, and disengagement of faculty from colleagues, collaborations, and institutions. Many research and clinical compliance processes were put in place, often using legacy systems, in well-meaning attempts to address straightforward regulations in humane animal care, safe use of biological agents, and medical care delivery. However, their accumulation and negative impact on faculty performance demand time, energy, and resources that impact academic productivity. There are solutions to a relentlessly increasing regulatory load for research faculty, which involve vertical integration, convergence, and performance assessment in medical school and health system compliance regimes.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.

                We reliably judge locations of static objects when we walk despite the retinal images of these objects moving with every step we take. Here, we showed our brains solve this optical illusion by adopting an allocentric spatial reference frame. We measured perceived target location after the observer walked a short distance from the home base. Supporting the allocentric coding scheme, we found the intrinsic bias , which acts as a spatial reference frame for perceiving location of a dimly lit target in the dark, remained grounded at the home base rather than traveled along with the observer. The path-integration mechanism responsible for this can utilize both active and passive (vestibular) translational motion signals, but only along the horizontal direction. This asymmetric path-integration finding in human visual space perception is reminiscent of the asymmetric spatial memory finding in desert ants, pointing to nature’s wondrous and logically simple design for terrestrial creatures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91766">Netrin signaling mediates survival of dormant epithelial ovarian cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Dormancy in cancer is a clinical state in which residual disease remains undetectable for a prolonged duration. At a cellular level, rare cancer cells cease proliferation and survive chemotherapy and disseminate disease. We created a suspension culture model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) dormancy and devised a novel CRISPR screening approach to identify survival genes in this context. In combination with RNA-seq, we discovered the Netrin signaling pathway as critical to dormant HGSOC cell survival. We demonstrate that Netrin-1, –3, and its receptors are essential for low level ERK activation to promote survival, and that Netrin activation of ERK is unable to induce proliferation. Deletion of all UNC5 family receptors blocks Netrin signaling in HGSOC cells and compromises viability during the dormancy step of dissemination in xenograft assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and –3 overexpression in HGSOC correlates with poor outcome. Specifically, our experiments reveal that Netrin overexpression elevates cell survival in dormant culture conditions and contributes to greater spread of disease in a xenograft model of abdominal dissemination. This study highlights Netrin signaling as a key mediator HGSOC cancer cell dormancy and metastasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89611">Cortical plasticity is associated with blood–brain barrier modulation</a></h4>

              
                Brain microvessels possess the unique properties of a blood–brain barrier (BBB), tightly regulating the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain neuropil and vice versa. In models of brain injury, BBB dysfunction and the associated leakage of serum albumin to the neuropil have been shown to induce pathological plasticity, neuronal hyper-excitability, and seizures. The effect of neuronal activity on BBB function and whether it plays a role in plasticity in the healthy brain remain unclear. Here we show that neuronal activity induces modulation of microvascular permeability in the healthy brain and that it has a role in local network reorganization. Combining simultaneous electrophysiological recording and vascular imaging with transcriptomic analysis in rats, and functional and BBB-mapping MRI in human subjects, we show that prolonged stimulation of the limb induces a focal increase in BBB permeability in the corresponding somatosensory cortex that is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. We further show that the increased microvascular permeability depends on neuronal activity and involves caveolae-mediated transcytosis and transforming growth factor β signaling. Our results reveal a role of BBB modulation in cortical plasticity in the healthy brain, highlighting the importance of neurovascular interactions for sensory experience and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91421">Non-Hebbian plasticity transforms transient experiences into lasting memories</a></h4>

              
                The dominant models of learning and memory, such as Hebbian plasticity, propose that experiences are transformed into memories through input-specific synaptic plasticity at the time of learning. However, synaptic plasticity is neither strictly input-specific nor restricted to the time of its induction. The impact of such forms of non-Hebbian plasticity on memory has been difficult to test, and hence poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that synaptic manipulations can deviate from the Hebbian model of learning, yet produce a lasting memory. First, we established a weak associative conditioning protocol in mice, where optogenetic stimulation of sensory thalamic input to the amygdala was paired with a footshock, but no detectable memory was formed. However, when the same input was potentiated minutes before or after, or even 24 hr later, the associative experience was converted into a lasting memory. Importantly, potentiating an independent input to the amygdala minutes but not 24 hr after the pairing produced a lasting memory. Thus, our findings suggest that the process of transformation of a transient experience into a memory is neither restricted to the time of the experience nor to the synapses triggered by it; instead, it can be influenced by past and future events.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90793">Selective consolidation of learning and memory via recall-gated plasticity</a></h4>

              
                In a variety of species and behavioral contexts, learning and memory formation recruits two neural systems, with initial plasticity in one system being consolidated into the other over time. Moreover, consolidation is known to be selective; that is, some experiences are more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory than others. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve synaptic plasticity rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments. We show that recall-gated consolidation gives rise to a number of phenomena that are present in behavioral learning paradigms, including spaced learning effects, task-dependent rates of consolidation, and differing neural representations in short- and long-term pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88173">A synergistic workspace for human consciousness revealed by Integrated Information Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                How is the information-processing architecture of the human brain organised, and how does its organisation support consciousness? Here, we combine network science and a rigorous information-theoretic notion of synergy to delineate a ‘synergistic global workspace’, comprising gateway regions that gather synergistic information from specialised modules across the human brain. This information is then integrated within the workspace and widely distributed via broadcaster regions. Through functional MRI analysis, we show that gateway regions of the synergistic workspace correspond to the human brain’s default mode network, whereas broadcasters coincide with the executive control network. We find that loss of consciousness due to general anaesthesia or disorders of consciousness corresponds to diminished ability of the synergistic workspace to integrate information, which is restored upon recovery. Thus, loss of consciousness coincides with a breakdown of information integration within the synergistic workspace of the human brain. This work contributes to conceptual and empirical reconciliation between two prominent scientific theories of consciousness, the Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while also advancing our understanding of how the human brain supports consciousness through the synergistic integration of information.

">Pathogenic LRRK2 causes age-dependent and region-specific deficits in ciliation, innervation and viability of cholinergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic activating point mutations in the LRRK2 kinase cause autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). In cultured cells, mutant LRRK2 causes a deficit in de novo cilia formation and also impairs ciliary stability. In brain, previous studies have shown that in PD patients due to the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation as well as in middle-aged G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice, striatal cholinergic interneurons show a deficit in primary cilia. Here, we show that cilia loss in G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice is not limited to cholinergic striatal interneurons but common to cholinergic neurons across distinct brain nuclei. The lack of cilia in cholinergic forebrain neurons is accompanied by the accumulation of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab12 GTPase and correlates with the presence of dystrophic cholinergic axons. Those deficits are already evident in young adult mutant LRRK2 mice. In contrast, the age-dependent loss of cilia in brainstem cholinergic neurons correlates with an age-dependent loss of cholinergic innervation derived from this brain area. Strikingly, we find cholinergic cell loss in mutant LRRK2 mice that is age-dependent, cell type-specific and disease-relevant. The age-dependent loss of a subset of cholinergic neurons mimics that observed in sporadic PD patients, highlighting the possibility that these particular neurons may require functional cilia for long-term cell survival.

">Inter-individual variability in motor learning due to differences in effective learning rates between generalist and specialist memory stores</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit large interindividual differences in motor learning ability. However, most previous studies have examined properties common across populations, with less emphasis on interindividual differences. We hypothesized here, based on our previous experimental and computational motor adaptation studies, that individual differences in effective learning rates between a generalist memory module that assumes environmental continuity and specialist modules that are responsive to trial-by-trial environmental changes could explain both large population-wise and individual-wise differences in dual tasks adaptation under block and random schedules. Participants adapted to two opposing force fields, either sequentially with alternating training blocks or simultaneously with random sequences. As previously reported, in the block training schedule, all participants adapted to the force field presented in a block but showed large interference in the subsequent opposing force field blocks, such that adapting to the two force fields was impossible. In contrast, in the random training schedule, participants could adapt to the two conflicting tasks simultaneously as a group; however, large interindividual variability was observed. A modified MOSAIC computational model of motor learning equipped with one generalist module and two specialist modules explained the observed behavior and variability for wide parameter ranges: when the predictions errors were large and consistent as in block schedules, the generalist module was selected to adapt quickly. In contrast, the specialist modules were selected when they more accurately predicted the changing environment than the generalist, as during random schedules; this resulted in consolidated memory specialized to each environment, but only when the ratio of learning rates of the generalist to specialists was relatively small. This dynamic selection process plays a crucial role in explaining the individual differences observed in motor learning abilities.

	<p>Background: The role of exercise programs during substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is considered particularly supportive in fostering positive psychological and behavioral changes. The treatment of SUD is a challenging and demanding process. Therefore, it is crucial to discover innovative methods to enhance and facilitate it. Integrating exercise into a virtual environment is an innovative approach for drug rehabilitation, offering multiple benefits to individuals undergoing treatment. The aim of this feasibility study was to explore the acute effects of cycling exercise in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment on attentional control and self-efficacy expectations of individuals undergoing SUD treatment. Methods: A total of 20 individuals (mean age of 37.75 years) enrolled in a SUD treatment program participated in the study. They were instructed to complete a single session of cycling with a self-selected duration within the VR system. Results: Following the cycling session, pre-post measures indicated a statistically significant improvement in self-efficacy expectations and attentional control measured with the Stroop test. The results revealed that participants expressed high levels of intention for future use, interest/enjoyment, and positive attitudes toward the VR exercise system. Qualitative data indicated that participants found the VR exercise system enjoyable, expressed a strong intention to use it, and did not encounter technical difficulties or negative emotions. Conclusions: In conclusion, it seems that engaging in a brief period of self-selected exercise within a virtual environment can result in temporary activation of cognitive changes, heightened self-efficacy expectations, and a motivating approach to increasing physical activity participation among individuals with SUD, thus suggesting the feasibility of this approach.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent with a high subjective and socio-economic burden. Despite the effectiveness of classical treatment methods, 20&amp;amp;ndash;30% of patients stay treatment-resistant. Deep Brain Stimulation of the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle is emerging as a clinical treatment. The stimulation region (ventral tegmental area, VTA), supported by experimental data, points to the role of dopaminergic (DA) transmission in disease pathology. This work sets out to develop a workflow that will allow the performance of analyses on midbrain DA-ergic neurons and projections in subjects who have committed suicide. Human midbrains were retrieved during autopsy, formalin-fixed, and scanned in a Bruker MRI scanner (7T). Sections were sliced, stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), digitized, and integrated into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain space together with a high-resolution fiber tract atlas. Subnuclei of the VTA region were identified. TH-positive neurons and fibers were semi-quantitatively evaluated. The study established a rigorous protocol allowing for parallel histological assessments and fiber tractographic analysis in a common space. Semi-quantitative readings are feasible and allow the detection of cell loss in VTA subnuclei. This work describes the intricate workflow and first results of an investigation of DA anatomy in VTA subnuclei in a growing naturalistic database.</p>

	<p>Neurodegenerative disease is a major global health problem with 150 million people predicted to have dementia by 2050. Genetic factors, environmental factors, demographics, and some diseases have been associated with dementia. In addition to associations between diseases such as hypertension and cerebrovascular disease and dementia, emerging findings associate some psychiatric disorders with incident dementia. Because of the high and increasing global prevalence of dementia and the high worldwide prevalence of psychiatric disorders, the primary objective of this narrative review was to evaluate published findings that evaluate the association between bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and other psychosis syndromes, and personality disorders and personality traits and incident dementia. Here, we highlight findings indicating possible associations between these psychiatric disorders and subsequent dementia and suggest that some psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for incident dementia. Further research, including more large longitudinal studies and additional meta-analyses, however, is needed to better characterize the associations between psychiatric disorders and incident dementia, to identify possible mechanisms for these putative associations, and to identify risk factors within psychiatric disorders that predispose some people with a psychiatric disorder but not others to subsequent dementia. Additional important questions concern how the treatment of psychiatric disorders might affect the risk of incident dementia.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum is a conserved structure of the vertebrate brain involved in the timing and calibration of movements. Its function is supported by the convergence of fibers from granule cells (GCs) and inferior olive neurons (IONs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs). Theories of cerebellar function postulate that IONs convey error signals to PCs that, paired with the contextual information provided by GCs, can instruct motor learning. Here, we use the larval zebrafish to investigate (1) how sensory representations of the same stimulus vary across GCs and IONs and (2) how PC activity reflects these two different input streams. We use population calcium imaging to measure ION and GC responses to flashes of diverse luminance and duration. First, we observe that GCs show tonic and graded responses, as opposed to IONs, whose activity peaks mostly at luminance transitions, consistently with the notion that GCs and IONs encode context and error information, respectively. Second, we show that GC activity is patterned over time: some neurons exhibit sustained responses for the entire duration of the stimulus, while in others activity ramps up with slow time constants. This activity could provide a substrate for time representation in the cerebellum. Together, our observations give support to the notion of an error signal coming from IONs and provide the first experimental evidence for a temporal patterning of GC activity over many seconds.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0043-24.2024?rss=1">Neural Filtering of Physiological Tremor Oscillations to Spinal Motor Neurons Mediates Short-Term Acquisition of a Skill Learning Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The acquisition of a motor skill involves adaptations of spinal and supraspinal pathways to alpha motoneurons. In this study, we estimated the shared synaptic contributions of these pathways to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the short-term acquisition of a new force-matching task. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was acquired from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI; 7 males and 6 females) and tibialis anterior (TA; 7 males and 4 females) during 15 trials of an isometric force-matching task. For two selected trials (pre- and post-skill acquisition), we decomposed the HDsEMG into motor unit spike trains, tracked motor units between trials, and calculated the mean discharge rate and the coefficient of variation of interspike interval (COV<SUB>ISI</SUB>). We also quantified the post/pre ratio of motor units&rsquo; coherence within delta, alpha, and beta bands. Force-matching improvements were accompanied by increased mean discharge rate and decreased COV<SUB>ISI</SUB> for both muscles. Moreover, the area under the curve within alpha band decreased by ~22% (TA) and ~13% (FDI), with no delta or beta bands changes. These reductions correlated significantly with increased coupling between force/neural drive and target oscillations. These results suggest that short-term force-matching skill acquisition is mediated by attenuation of physiological tremor oscillations in the shared synaptic inputs. Supported by simulations, a plausible mechanism for alpha band reductions may involve spinal interneuron phase-cancelling descending oscillations. Therefore, during skill learning, the central nervous system acts as a matched filter, adjusting synaptic weights of shared inputs to suppress neural components unrelated to the specific task.</p>

                <p>Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons, classified by their expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, play crucial roles in the function and plasticity of the lateral habenular nucleus (LHb). This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the LHb by collecting information about the heterogeneity of LHb PV neurons in mice. To achieve this, we investigated the proportions of the transmitter machinery in LHb PV neurons, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter markers, using transcriptome analysis, mRNA in situ hybridization chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. LHb PV neurons comprise three subsets: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and double-positive for glutamatergic and GABAergic machinery. By comparing the percentages of the subsets, we found that the LHb was topographically organized anteroposteriorly; the GABAergic and glutamatergic PV neurons were preferentially distributed in the anterior and posterior LHb, respectively, uncovering the anteroposterior topography of the LHb. In addition, we confirmed the mediolateral topography of lateral GABAergic PV neurons. These findings suggest that PV neurons play distinct roles in different parts of the LHb along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes, facilitating the topographic function of the LHb. It would be interesting to determine whether their topography is differentially involved in various cognitive and motivational processes associated with the LHb, particularly the involvement of posterior glutamatergic PV neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e0020242024?rss=1">Distinct Action Signals by Subregions in the Nucleus Accumbens during STOP-Change Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to contribute to motivated behavior by signaling the value of reward-predicting cues and the delivery of anticipated reward. The NAc is subdivided into core and shell, with each region containing different populations of neurons that increase or decrease firing to rewarding events. While there are numerous theories of functions pertaining to these subregions and cell types, most are in the context of reward processing, with fewer considering that the NAc might serve functions related to action selection more generally. We recorded from single neurons in the NAc as rats of both sexes performed a STOP&ndash;change task that is commonly used to study motor control and impulsivity. In this task, rats respond quickly to a spatial cue on 80% of trials (GO) and must stop and redirect planned movement on 20% of trials (STOP). We found that the activity of reward-excited neurons signaled accurate response direction on GO, but not STOP, trials and that these neurons exhibited higher precue firing after correct trials. In contrast, reward-inhibited neurons significantly represented response direction on STOP trials at the time of the instrumental response. Finally, the proportion of reward-excited to reward-inhibited neurons and the strength of precue firing decreased as the electrode traversed the NAc. We conclude that reward-excited cells (more common in core) promote proactive action selection, while reward-inhibited cells (more common in shell) contribute to accurate responding on STOP trials that require reactive suppression and redirection of behavior.</p>

                <p>Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK506), are commonly used immunosuppressants for preserving transplanted organs and tissues. However, these drugs can cause severe and persistent pain. GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) are implicated in various neurological disorders, including neuropathic pain. It is unclear whether and how constitutive calcineurin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protein phosphatase, controls synaptic CP-AMPARs. In this study, we found that blocking CP-AMPARs with IEM-1460 markedly reduced the amplitude of AMPAR-EPSCs in excitatory neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2), but not in inhibitory neurons expressing vesicular GABA transporter, in the spinal cord of FK506-treated male and female mice. FK506 treatment also caused an inward rectification in the current&ndash;voltage relationship of AMPAR-EPSCs specifically in VGluT2 neurons. Intrathecal injection of IEM-1460 rapidly alleviated pain hypersensitivity in FK506-treated mice. Furthermore, FK506 treatment substantially increased physical interaction of &alpha;2-1 with GluA1 and GluA2 in the spinal cord and reduced GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions of spinal cords. Correspondingly, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with pregabalin, <I>Cacna2d1</I> genetic knock-out, or disrupting &alpha;2-1&ndash;AMPAR interactions with an &alpha;2-1 C terminus peptide reversed inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons caused by FK506 treatment. In addition, CK2 inhibition reversed FK506 treatment&ndash;induced pain hypersensitivity, &alpha;2-1 interactions with GluA1 and GluA2, and inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons. Thus, the increased prevalence of synaptic CP-AMPARs in spinal excitatory neurons plays a major role in calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain hypersensitivity. Calcineurin and CK2 antagonistically regulate postsynaptic CP-AMPARs through &alpha;2-1&mdash;mediated GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly in the spinal dorsal horn.</p>

                <p>Sleep disorders affect millions of people around the world and have a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. While current hypnotics mostly increase non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), drugs acting selectively on enhancing rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) are lacking. This polysomnographic study in male rats showed that the first-in-class selective melatonin MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor partial agonist UCM871 increases the duration of REMS without affecting that of NREMS. The REMS-promoting effects of UCM871 occurred by inhibiting, in a dose&ndash;response manner, the firing activity of the locus ceruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons, which express MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. The increase of REMS duration and the inhibition of LC-NE neuronal activity by UCM871 were abolished by MT<SUB>1</SUB> pharmacological antagonism and by an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, which selectively knocked down MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the LC-NE neurons. In conclusion, MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor agonism inhibits LC-NE neurons and triggers REMS, thus representing a novel mechanism and target for REMS disorders and/or psychiatric disorders associated with REMS impairments.</p>

                <p>We investigated sex differences in dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) using a chronic 16-channel carbon fiber electrode and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Electrical stimulation-induced (ES; 60&nbsp;Hz) DA release was recorded in the NAc of single- or pair-housed male and female rats. When core (NAcC) and shell (NAcS) were recorded simultaneously, there was greater ES DA release in NAcC of pair-housed females compared with single females and males. Housing did not affect ES NAc DA release in males. In contrast, there was significantly more ES DA release from the DLS of female rats than male rats. This was true prior to and after treatment with methamphetamine. Furthermore, in castrated (CAST) males and ovariectomized (OVX) females, there were no sex differences in ES DA release from the DLS, demonstrating the hormone dependence of this sex difference. However, in the DLS of both intact and gonadectomized rats, DA reuptake was slower in females than that in males. Finally, DA release following ES of the medial forebrain bundle at 60&nbsp;Hz was studied over 4&nbsp;weeks. ES DA release increased over time for both CAST males and OVX females, demonstrating sensitization. Using this novel 16-channel chronic FSCV electrode, we found sex differences in the effects of social housing in the NAcS, sex differences in DA release from intact rats in DLS, and sex differences in DA reuptake in DLS of intake and gonadectomized rats, and we report sensitization of ES-induced DA release in DLS in vivo.</p>

                <p>During the second-to-third trimester, the neuronal pathways of the fetal brain experience rapid development, resulting in the complex architecture of the interwired network at birth. While diffusion MRI-based tractography has been employed to study the prenatal development of structural connectivity network (SCN) in preterm neonatal and postmortem fetal brains, the in utero development of SCN in the normal fetal brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we utilized in utero dMRI data from human fetuses of both sexes between 26 and 38 gestational weeks to investigate the developmental trajectories of the fetal brain SCN, focusing on intrahemispheric connections. Our analysis revealed significant increases in global efficiency, mean local efficiency, and clustering coefficient, along with significant decrease in shortest path length, while small-worldness persisted during the studied period, revealing balanced network integration and segregation. Widespread short-ranged connectivity strengthened significantly. The nodal strength developed in a posterior-to-anterior and medial-to-lateral order, reflecting a spatiotemporal gradient in cortical network connectivity development. Moreover, we observed distinct lateralization patterns in the fetal brain SCN. Globally, there was a leftward lateralization in network efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-worldness. The regional lateralization patterns in most language, motor, and visual-related areas were consistent with prior knowledge, except for Wernicke's area, indicating lateralized brain wiring is an innate property of the human brain starting from the fetal period. Our findings provided a comprehensive view of the development of the fetal brain SCN and its lateralization, as a normative template that may be used to characterize atypical development.</p>

                <p>The small G-protein Ras&ndash;related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) promotes the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin). Actin is a major component of dendritic spines, and we previously found that alcohol alters actin composition and dendritic spine structure in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). To examine if Rac1 contributes to these alcohol-mediated adaptations, we measured the level of GTP-bound active Rac1 in the striatum of mice following 7&nbsp;weeks of intermittent access to 20% alcohol. We found that chronic alcohol intake activates Rac1 in the DMS of male mice. In contrast, Rac1 is not activated by alcohol in the NAc and DLS of male mice or in the DMS of female mice. Similarly, closely related small G-proteins are not activated by alcohol in the DMS, and Rac1 activity is not increased in the DMS by moderate alcohol or natural reward. To determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent Rac1 activation in the DMS of male mice, we inhibited endogenous Rac1 by infecting the DMS of mice with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a dominant negative form of the small G-protein (Rac1-DN). We found that overexpression of AAV-Rac1-DN in the DMS inhibits alcohol-mediated Rac1 signaling and attenuates alcohol-mediated F-actin polymerization, which corresponded with a decrease in dendritic arborization and spine maturation. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays a role in alcohol-associated goal&ndash;directed learning. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays an important role in alcohol-dependent structural plasticity and aberrant learning.</p>

                <p>The intention to act influences the computations of various task-relevant features. However, little is known about the time course of these computations. Furthermore, it is commonly held that these computations are governed by conjunctive neural representations of the features. But, support for this view comes from paradigms arbitrarily combining task features and affordances, thus requiring representations in working memory. Therefore, the present study used electroencephalography and a well-rehearsed task with features that afford minimal working memory representations to investigate the temporal evolution of feature representations and their potential integration in the brain. Female and male human participants grasped objects or touched them with a knuckle. Objects had different shapes and were made of heavy or light materials with shape and weight being relevant for grasping, not for "knuckling." Using multivariate analysis showed that representations of object shape were similar for grasping and knuckling. However, only for grasping did early shape representations reactivate at later phases of grasp planning, suggesting that sensorimotor control signals feed back to the early visual cortex. Grasp-specific representations of material/weight only arose during grasp execution after object contact during the load phase. A trend for integrated representations of shape and material also became grasp-specific but only briefly during the movement onset. These results suggest that the brain generates action-specific representations of relevant features as required for the different subcomponents of its action computations. Our results argue against the view that goal-directed actions inevitably join all features of a task into a sustained and unified neural representation.</p>

                <p>Anxiety-related disorders respond to cognitive behavioral therapies, which involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Previous studies have suggested that subregions of the mPFC have different and even opposite roles in regulating innate anxiety. However, the specific causal targets of their descending projections in modulating innate anxiety and stress-induced anxiety have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that among the various downstream pathways of the prelimbic cortex (PL), a subregion of the mPFC, PL-mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) projection, and PL-ventral tegmental area (VTA) projection exhibited antagonistic effects on anxiety-like behavior, while the PL-MD projection but not PL-VTA projection was necessary for the animal to guide anxiety-related behavior. In addition, MD-projecting PL neurons bidirectionally regulated remote but not recent fear memory retrieval. Notably, restraint stress induced high-anxiety state accompanied by strengthening the excitatory inputs onto MD-projecting PL neurons, and inhibiting PL-MD pathway rescued the stress-induced anxiety. Our findings reveal that the activity of PL-MD pathway may be an essential factor to maintain certain level of anxiety, and stress increased the excitability of this pathway, leading to inappropriate emotional expression, and suggests that targeting specific PL circuits may aid the development of therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders.</p>

                <p>Preclinical assessments of pain have often relied upon behavioral measurements and anesthetized neurophysiological recordings. Current technologies enabling large-scale neural recordings, however, have the potential to unveil quantifiable pain signals in conscious animals for preclinical studies. Although pain processing is distributed across many brain regions, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is of particular interest in isolating these signals given its suggested role in the affective ("unpleasant") component of pain. Here, we explored the utility of the ACC toward preclinical pain research using head-mounted miniaturized microscopes to record calcium transients in freely moving male mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator 6f (GCaMP6f) under the Thy1 promoter. We verified the expression of GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons and found no intrinsic behavioral differences in this model. Using a multimodal stimulation paradigm across naive, pain, and analgesic conditions, we found that while ACC population activity roughly scaled with stimulus intensity, single-cell representations were highly flexible. We found only low-magnitude increases in population activity after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and insufficient evidence for the existence of a robust nociceptive ensemble in the ACC. However, we found a temporal sharpening of response durations and generalized increases in pairwise neural correlations in the presence of the mechanistically distinct analgesics gabapentin or ibuprofen after (but not before) CFA-induced inflammatory pain. This increase was not explainable by changes in locomotion alone. Taken together, these results highlight challenges in isolating distinct pain signals among flexible representations in the ACC but suggest a neurophysiological hallmark of analgesia after pain that generalizes to at least two analgesics.</p>

                <p>Human genetics and preclinical studies have identified key contributions of TREM2 to several neurodegenerative conditions, inspiring efforts to modulate TREM2 therapeutically. Here, we characterize the activities of three TREM2 agonist antibodies in multiple mixed-sex mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and remyelination. Receptor activation and downstream signaling are explored in vitro, and active dose ranges are determined in vivo based on pharmacodynamic responses from microglia. For mice bearing amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) pathology (PS2APP) or combined A&beta; and tau pathology (TauPS2APP), chronic TREM2 agonist antibody treatment had limited impact on microglia engagement with pathology, overall pathology burden, or downstream neuronal damage. For mice with demyelinating injuries triggered acutely with lysolecithin, TREM2 agonist antibodies unexpectedly disrupted injury resolution. Likewise, TREM2 agonist antibodies limited myelin recovery for mice experiencing chronic demyelination from cuprizone. We highlight the contributions of dose timing and frequency across models. These results introduce important considerations for future TREM2-targeting approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e2396232024?rss=1">A Reinterpretation of the Relationship between Persistent and Resurgent Sodium Currents</a></h4>

              
                <p>The resurgent sodium current (I<SUB>NaR</SUB>) activates on membrane repolarization, such as during the downstroke of neuronal action potentials. Due to its unique activation properties, I<SUB>NaR</SUB> is thought to drive high rates of repetitive neuronal firing. However, I<SUB>NaR</SUB> is often studied in combination with the persistent or noninactivating portion of sodium currents (I<SUB>NaP</SUB>). We used dynamic clamp to test how I<SUB>NaR</SUB> and I<SUB>NaP</SUB> individually affect repetitive firing in adult cerebellar Purkinje neurons from male and female mice. We learned I<SUB>NaR</SUB> does not scale repetitive firing rates due to its rapid decay at subthreshold voltages and that subthreshold I<SUB>NaP</SUB> is critical in regulating neuronal firing rate. Adjustments to the voltage-gated sodium conductance model used in these studies revealed I<SUB>NaP</SUB> and I<SUB>NaR</SUB> can be inversely scaled by adjusting occupancy in the slow-inactivated kinetic state. Together with additional dynamic clamp experiments, these data suggest the regulation of sodium channel slow inactivation can fine-tune I<SUB>NaP</SUB> and Purkinje neuron repetitive firing rates.</p>

                Background Natural forest resources in northwestern Ethiopia are currently under threat, requiring immediate conservation measures and a management strategy. Thus, an understanding of the present floristic diversity status is required. There is lack of such type of studies specific to fragmented forest patches and across environmental factors. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the existing state of these resources to apply sustainable forest management practices. Methods To achieve this, transects with 200 square plots measuring 400 m2 were set up at nine forest patches with 200m spacing between plots and transects. Vegetation and environmental data were collected and analyzed using R version 4.1. Results Significant variations (p 0.008) were found in vegetation features along the slope, forest patches, and agroclimatic zone. When compared to other forest patches, highland, and mid-altitude forest patches had the highest species diversity (2.48) and stocking (2578 trees/ha). The gentle slope has the most species diversity (2.83). The species similarity between highland and mid-altitude forest habitats was found significant (69%). The vegetation cover in the mid-altitude forest patches was also high (abundance: 5-12%). In all the forest patches examined, tree life forms exceeded shrubs, climbers, and herbs. Conclusions According to the study’s findings, the state of forest resources varies considerably across different environmental variations. Despite the impression of entire forest patches from the outside, the interiors are open, with only huge and mature trees covering the canopy. This state has been triggered by deforestation, degradation, and inappropriate human and grazing operations.

                Aims To study the association between AIM2 gene polymorphisms and the tendency for periodontal infection and coronary heart disease, and to determine whether males or females are more susceptible to these diseases. Additionally, we examined its association with the features of periodontal disease. Methods 140 patients were enrolled in this study, and those who took part were divided into four groups as follows: healthy (c), periodontal disease (P), coronary heart disease with intact periodontium (AS-C), and coronary heart disease with periodontal disease (AS-P). Information on entrants, including age, sex, body mass index, and indicators of periodontal disease severity, was documented. Blood samples were collected, and AIM2 gene polymorphisms were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction test, gel phase, and sequences. Results Genetic analysis of AIM2 G/T (rs2793845) revealed a high frequency of the (T) allele and (GT and TT) genotypes that were detected in the periodontal disease and coronary heart disease groups in males. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of alleles and genotypes did not differ significantly between the study groups. Gene polymorphisms were also significantly correlated with indicators of periodontal disease severity. Conclusion High frequenting of (T) alleles and (GT, TT) genotypes in AIM2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were associated with an increased tendency to develop periodontal disease and coronary heart disease. It can be supposed that it has a causative function in the pathophysiology of both disorders, and the validity of SNP as a potential genomic factor for the risk of both disorders in Iraqi males.

                <p>by Harry Saxton, Xu Xu, Torsten Schenkel, Richard H. Clayton, Ian Halliday</p>

Dynamical system models typically involve numerous input parameters whose “effects” and orthogonality need to be quantified through sensitivity analysis, to identify inputs contributing the greatest uncertainty. Whilst prior art has compared total-order estimators’ role in recovering “true” effects, assessing their ability to recover robust parameter orthogonality for use in identifiability metrics has not been investigated. In this paper, we perform: (i) an assessment using a different class of numerical models representing the cardiovascular system, (ii) a wider evaluation of sampling methodologies and their interactions with estimators, (iii) an investigation of the consequences of permuting estimators and sampling methodologies on input parameter orthogonality, (iv) a study of sample convergence through resampling, and (v) an assessment of whether positive outcomes are sustained when model input dimensionality increases. Our results indicate that Jansen or Janon estimators display efficient convergence with minimum uncertainty when coupled with Sobol and the lattice rule sampling methods, making them prime choices for calculating parameter orthogonality and influence. This study reveals that global sensitivity analysis is convergence driven. Unconverged indices are subject to error and therefore the true influence or orthogonality of the input parameters are not recovered. This investigation importantly clarifies the interactions of the estimator and the sampling methodology by reducing the associated ambiguities, defining novel practices for modelling in the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1030/v3?src=rss">Uptake of core outcome sets by clinical trialists in China: a protocol [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The concept of core outcome sets (COS) has been introduced in China for about 10 years. In recent years, some Chinese researchers also committed to developing COS, though the majority of COS are ongoing. However, there were more than 500 published COS for research in the COMET database by 2020. The extent of availability of COS for the top 25 diseases with the highest burden in China is unknown. In addition, the uptake of COS in clinical trials for these diseases is unknown, along with the knowledge, perceptions, and views of the clinical trialist community in China on the use of COS in relation to choosing outcomes for their research. Methods The main burden of disease in China will be identified. Then we will search the COMET database to identify if there are ongoing or completed relevant COS research A COS published since 2012 would be preferred to one published before 2012 for the analysis of COS uptake if one meets the eligibility criteria. We will extract scopes of published eligible COS, including condition, population, interventions, and core outcomes. Then we will search the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry using disease names for each disease that has a published COS. We will assess the overlap in scope between clinical trials and COS. Then we will conduct an online survey and semi-structured interviews to identify the knowledge and perceptions of COS among primary investigators of included clinical trials. Discussion This research will fill in gaps between COS and the burden of disease in China. Understanding clinical trialists’knowledge and perceptions of COS may help dissemination and application of COS in the future. Trial registration This research is registered in Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/2563.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of memory is thought to ultimately depend on the synthesis of new proteins, since translational inhibitors such as anisomycin and cycloheximide adversely affect the permanence of long-term memory. However, when applied directly in brain, these agents also profoundly suppress neural activity to an extent that is directly correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition caused. Given that neural activity itself is likely to help mediate consolidation, this finding is a serious criticism of the strict de novo protein hypothesis of memory. Here, we test the neurophysiological effects of another translational inhibitor, emetine. Unilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of emetine suppressed ongoing local field and multiunit activity at ipsilateral sites as compared to the contralateral hippocampus in a fashion that was positively correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition as confirmed by autoradiography. This suppression of activity was also specific to the circumscribed brain region in which protein synthesis inhibition took place. These experiments provide further evidence that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary and fundamental for neural function and suggest that the disruption of memory observed in behavioral experiments using translational inhibitors may be due, in large part, to neural suppression.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptic excitation and inhibition are essential for neuronal communication. However, the variables that regulate synaptic excitation and inhibition in the intact brain remain largely unknown. Here, we examined how spike transmission and suppression between principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INTs) are modulated by activity history, brain state, cell type, and somatic distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons by applying cross-correlogram analyses to datasets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 11 male behaving and sleeping Long Evans rats. The strength, temporal delay, and brain-state dependency of the spike transmission and suppression depended on the subregions/layers. The spike transmission probability of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression versus short-term facilitation was higher in CA1 and lower in CA3. Likewise, the intersomatic distance affected the proportion of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression and facilitation in the opposite manner in CA1 compared with CA3. The time constant of depression was longer, while that of facilitation was shorter in MEC than in CA1 and CA3. During sharp-wave ripples, spike transmission showed a larger gain in the MEC than in CA1 and CA3. The intersomatic distance affected the spike transmission gain during sharp-wave ripples differently in CA1 versus CA3. A subgroup of MEC layer 3 (EC3) INTs preferentially received excitatory inputs from and inhibited MEC layer 2 (EC2) PCs. The EC2 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs, most of which showed short-term depression, exhibited higher spike transmission probabilities than the EC2 PC–EC2 INT and EC3 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs. EC2 putative stellate cells exhibited stronger spike transmission to and received weaker spike suppression from EC3 INTs than EC2 putative pyramidal cells. This study provides detailed comparisons of monosynaptic interaction dynamics in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, which may help to elucidate circuit operations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Remembering what just happened is a crucial prerequisite to form long-term memories but also for establishing and maintaining working memory. So far there is no general agreement about cortical mechanisms that support short-term memory. Using a classifier-based decoding approach, we report that hippocampal activity during few sparsely distributed brief time intervals contains information about the previous sensory motor experience of rodents. These intervals are characterized by only a small increase of firing rate of only a few neurons. These low-rate predictive patterns are present in both working memory and non-working memory tasks, in two rodent species, rats and Mongolian gerbils, are strongly reduced for rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions, and depend on the familiarity of the sensory-motor context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23620?af=R">Temporal organization of narrative recall is present but attenuated in adults with hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies of the impact of brain injury on memory processes often focus on the quantity and episodic richness of those recollections. Here, we argue that the organization of one's recollections offers critical insights into the impact of brain injury on functional memory. It is well-established in studies of word list memory that free recall of unrelated words exhibits a clear temporal organization. This <i>temporal contiguity effect</i> refers to the fact that the order in which word lists are recalled reflects the original presentation order. Little is known, however, about the organization of recall for semantically rich materials, nor how recall organization is impacted by hippocampal damage and memory impairment. The present research is the first study, to our knowledge, of temporal organization in semantically rich narratives in three groups: (1) Adults with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, (2) adults with bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage and no memory impairment, and (3) demographically matched non-brain-injured comparison participants. We find that although the narrative recall of adults with bilateral hippocampal damage reflected the temporal order in which those narratives were experienced above chance levels, their temporal contiguity effect was significantly attenuated relative to comparison groups. In contrast, individuals with vmPFC damage did not differ from non-brain-injured comparison participants in temporal contiguity. This pattern of group differences yields insights into the cognitive and neural systems that support the use of temporal organization in recall. These data provide evidence that the retrieval of temporal context in narrative recall is hippocampal-dependent, whereas damage to the vmPFC does not impair the temporal organization of narrative recall. This evidence of limited but demonstrable organization of memory in participants with hippocampal damage and amnesia speaks to the power of narrative structures in supporting meaningfully organized recall despite memory impairment.</p>

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                The U.S. government has invested in distressed communities in the 21st century but with minimal effect. Regarding income, poverty, joblessness, and vacancy rates, the average distressed zip code in 2018 showed no improvement compared to its standing relative to the average prosperous zip code in 2000. We have discovered the formation of unique business clusters funded by public-private partnerships have the potential to make a difference in lifting distressed communities. Our research of literature and artifacts (photographs, videos, documents, digital media - websites or social media posts) suggests the discovery of a Clean Innovation Ecosystem (CIE). CIE refers to the network of social entrepreneurs, organizations, institutions, and individuals that work together to promote sustainable technologies and practices. As of the 4th quarter of 2023, manufacturing annual run rate construction spending has skyrocketed to over $200 billion. There are another $600 billion of Voltage Valley projects announced that have not yet been built. Over the past two decades, private investment has been between $20 billion and $100 billion annually in U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. Governments are making unprecedented investments in clean energy - which include approximately $400 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), $8 billion to establish 6–10 regional Hydrogen Hubs in the U.S., investments in carbon capture, renewable energy technologies, and other investments in clean energy sectors and technologies. All these investments come with the condition that the investment lifts distressed communities. This article explains why investing in Appalachia and geographic regions with similar characteristics will maximize the social benefit of public investment in a Clean Innovation Ecosystem. Our case study covers the Greater Central Appalachian Voltage Valley (GCAVV) – the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Upstate New York, and Michigan, as well as the Central Appalachian region as defined by 56 of the 85 distressed communities of Appalachia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-807/v1?src=rss">A study of association between early menarche and anxiety in undergraduate  students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Anxiety has been reported to be one of the most common epidemics in recent years. The present study focused on understanding the association between early menarche and the prevalence of anxiety and anxiety symptoms among adult undergraduate students. Methods This was an observational, case-control study. The sample included 146 young female adults aged more than or equal to 18 years pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) and Bachelor of Dental Sciences (BDS). Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to recall and enter the age at which they attained menarche. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Questionnaire (GAD-7) to measure the severity of their present anxiety symptoms. Results The results showed a significant increase in anxiety symptoms in participants who had early menarche compared to those who did not have early menarche. The mean score on the GAD-7 Questionnaire for the cases was 9.93 and the control group was 6.89. The GAD-7 scores among the cases group were significantly higher in the GAD-7 scores than in the control group. Conclusions This study concluded that early menarche is associated with higher anxiety levels in young adults.

                <p>Despite the use of ‘high efficacy’ disease-modifying therapies, disease activity and clinical progression of different immune-mediated neurological diseases continue for some patients, resulting in accumulating disability, deteriorating social and mental health, and high economic cost to patients and society. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment modality, it is an intensive chemotherapy-based therapy with a range of short- and long-term side-effects. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell and other hematological malignancies, conferring long-term remission for otherwise refractory diseases. However, the toxicity of this treatment, particularly cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and the complexity of production necessitate the need for a high level of specialization at treating centers. Early-phase trials of CAR-T therapies in immune-mediated B cell driven conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis, have shown dramatic clinical response with few adverse events. Based on the common physiopathology, CAR-T therapy in other immune-mediated neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, autoimmune encephalitis, and stiff person syndrome, might be an effective option for patients, avoiding the need for long-term immunosuppressant medications. It may prove to be a more selective immunoablative approach than autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with potentially increased efficacy and lower adverse events. In this review, we present the state of the art and future directions of the use of CAR-T in such conditions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>
