              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16004">Time-Varying Directed Interactions in Functional Brain Networks: Modeling and Validation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of brain connectivity is critical for elucidating neural processing, behavior, and brain disorders. Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16584">The Representational Alignment Hypothesis: Evidence for and Consequences of Invariant Semantic Structure Across Embedding Modalities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that independently trained AI systems come to represent the world in the same way. In other words, independently trained embeddings from text, vision, audio, and neural signals share an underlying geometry. We call this the Representational Alignment Hypothesis (RAH) and investigate evidence for and consequences of this claim. The evidence is of two kinds: (i) internal structure comparison techniques, such as representational similarity analysis and topological data analysis, reveal matching relational patterns across modalities without explicit mapping; and (ii) methods based on cross-modal embedding alignment, which learn mappings between representation spaces, show that simple linear transformations can bring different embedding spaces into close correspondence, suggesting near-isomorphism. Taken together, the evidence suggests that, even after controlling for trivial commonalities inherent in standard data preprocessing and embedding procedures, a robust structural correspondence persists, hinting at an underlying organizational principle. Some have argued that this result shows that the shared structure is getting at a fundamental, Platonic level of reality. We argue that this conclusion is unjustified. Moreover, we aim to give the idea an alternative philosophical home, rooted in contemporary metasemantics (i.e., theories of what makes a representation and what makes something meaningful) and responses to the symbol grounding problem. We conclude by considering the scope of the RAH and proposing new ways of distinguishing semantic structures that are genuinely invariant from those that inevitably arise due to the fact that all our data is generated under human-specific conditions on Earth.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16072">Omni-iEEG: A Large-Scale, Comprehensive iEEG Dataset and Benchmark for Epilepsy Research</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research. The project page with dataset and code links is available at omni-ieeg.github.io/omni-ieeg.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16626">A Systematic Evaluation of Sample-Level Tokenization Strategies for MEG Foundation Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2026_Tokenizer.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15828">GENESIS: A Generative Model of Episodic-Semantic Interaction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.15828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to explain how semantic and episodic memory, two major forms of declarative memory, typically associated with cortical and hippocampal processing, interact to support learning, recall, and imagination. Despite significant advances, we still lack a unified computational framework that jointly accounts for core empirical phenomena across both semantic and episodic processing domains. Here, we introduce the Generative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational model that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity generative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and generalization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS reproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic memory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their dynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can recombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled account of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process. GENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and episodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21677">Lesion-Independent Associations Between Thalamic Nuclei Volumes and Information Processing Speed in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.21677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both focal inflammation and compartmentalized neurodegeneration, yet the relative effect of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on information processing speed (IPS) remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Results: Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These processing-associated ROIs exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogeneous contributions from focal lesion-driven and chronic neurodegenerative pathology, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16689">Agonist-Antagonist Neural Coordination without Mechanical Coupling after Targeted Muscle Reinnervation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.16689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following limb amputation and targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), nerves that originally innervated agonist and antagonist muscles are rerouted into one or more residual target muscles. This rerouting profoundly alters the natural mechanical coupling and afferent signalling that normally link muscle groups in intact limbs. Despite this disruption, in this study we demonstrate, using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays implanted in reinnervated muscles of three TMR participants, that motor units (MUs) associated with agonist and antagonist tasks remain functionally coupled. Specifically, over 40% of motor units active during agonist tasks were also recruited during the corresponding antagonist tasks, even though no visual feedback on antagonist neural activity was provided. These motor units exhibited significantly different firing rates depending on their functional role. These results provide the first motor-unit-level evidence that the central nervous system preserves coordinated agonist-antagonist control after TMR and inform restorative surgical strategies and prosthetic systems capable of regulating both limb kinematics and dynamics based on agonist-antagonist commands interplay.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02642">Weight transport through spike timing for robust local gradients</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.02642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In both machine learning and in computational neuroscience, plasticity in functional neural networks is frequently expressed as gradient descent on a cost. Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile with local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic hardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by Boltzmann distributions assumes symmetric connectivity. Similarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the weight transport problem between the representation and the error stream. Existing solutions such as feedback alignment circumvent the problem by deferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However, they scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce spike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking neural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the asymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being spike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise. Based on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can thereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies that arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of physical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using different spiking network models. First, SAL can significantly improve convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking networks versus Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal hierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, SAL effectively aligns feedback weights to the forward pathway, thus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors. Third, our approach enables competitive performance in deep networks using only local plasticity for weight transport.

                arXiv:2602.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) in combinatorial optimization (CO) in the past few years. However, existing discovery pipelines often require extensive manual trial-and-error or reliance on domain expertise to adapt to new or complex problems. This stems from tightly coupled internal mechanisms that limit systematic improvement of the LLM-driven design process. To address this challenge, we propose a structured framework for LLM-driven AHD that explicitly decomposes the heuristic discovery process into modular stages: a forward pass for evaluation, a backward pass for analytical feedback, and an update step for program refinement. This separation provides a clear abstraction for iterative refinement and enables principled improvements of individual components. We validate our framework across four diverse real-world CO domains, where it consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to $0.17$ improvement in QYI on unseen test sets. Finally, we show that several popular AHD methods are restricted instantiations of our framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16113">Evolutionary Context Search for Automated Skill Acquisition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models cannot reliably acquire new knowledge post-deployment -- even when relevant text resources exist, models fail to transform them into actionable knowledge without retraining. Retrieval-Augmented Generation attempts to bridge this gap by surfacing relevant documents at inference time, yet similarity-based retrieval often fails to identify context that actually improves task performance. We introduce Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), an evolutionary method that searches context combinations using accuracy on a small development set, requiring only inference calls without weight updates. ECS moves beyond semantic similarity to discover non-obvious context pairings that significantly boost performance. Our empirical results show that ECS improves BackendBench by 27\% and $\tau$-bench airline by 7\%. The evolved contexts are model-agnostic, as those evolved with Gemini-3-Flash transfer effectively to Claude Sonnet and DeepSeek. This suggests that ECS opens a path toward automated context discovery for skill acquisition -- an efficient alternative to manual prompt engineering or costly fine-tuning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16321">End-user validation of BRIGHT with custom-developed graphical user interface applied to cervical cancer brachytherapy</a></h4>

Abstract: Multi-objective optimisation using BRIGHT has proven insightful and effective in prostate cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. BRachytherapy via artificially Intelligent GOMEA-Heuristic based Treatment planning (BRIGHT) generates multiple treatment plans, each with a different trade-off between tumour coverage and organs-at-risk sparing. BRIGHT was recently extended to cervical cancer brachytherapy. In this study, we present a novel, custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI) that enables plan navigation, pairwise comparisons, dose distribution visualisation, and possibility for adjustments - essential for efficient clinical use of BRIGHT. End-user validation of BRIGHT with the dedicated GUI was conducted for cervical cancer brachytherapy by emulating clinical practice in ten previously treated patients. A multidisciplinary brachytherapy team used BRIGHT to create new treatment plans. GUI usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). BRIGHT plan quality was compared to clinical practice via blinded one-on-one comparisons. The GUI offered helpful features for plan navigation and evaluation, giving users quick insight into whether planning aims are achievable and what treatment options are available. The overall SUS score was 83.3, indicating an 'excellent' system. BRIGHT outperformed clinical practice in five out of ten patients regarding the coverage-sparing trade-off and performed equally well in the remaining five. The BRIGHT plan was preferred over the clinical plan in eight out of ten patients, four of which showed clinically relevant differences. The clinical plan was preferred in two patients, neither with clinically relevant differences. In conclusion, BRIGHT, with its dedicated GUI, is a clinically viable and user-friendly tool for treatment planning in cervical cancer brachytherapy.

                arXiv:2602.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

                arXiv:2602.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex change is often described as "evolutionary" in economics, policy, and technology, yet most system dynamics models remain constrained to fixed state spaces and equilibrium-seeking behavior. This paper argues that evolutionary dynamics should be treated as a core system-thinking problem rather than as a biological metaphor. We introduce Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA) as a minimal, non-equilibrium framework in which stochastic interactions combined with differential persistence generate endogenous selection without genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. In SDA, longer-lived patterns accumulate in the population, biasing future interactions and creating feedback between population composition and system dynamics. This feedback yields fitness-proportional sampling as an emergent property, realizing a natural genetic algorithm driven solely by stability. Using SDA, we demonstrate why equilibrium-constrained models, even when simulated numerically, cannot exhibit open-ended evolution: evolutionary systems require population-dependent, non-stationary dynamics in which structure and dynamics co-evolve. We conclude by discussing implications for system dynamics, economics, and policy modeling, and outline how agent-based and AI-enabled approaches may support evolutionary models capable of sustained novelty and structural emergence.

                arXiv:2602.15971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00213">Understanding Transformer Optimization via Gradient Heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.00213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are difficult to optimize with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and largely rely on adaptive optimizers such as Adam. Despite their empirical success, the reasons behind Adam's superior performance over SGD remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the optimization of Transformer models through the lens of \emph{gradient heterogeneity}, defined as the variation in gradient norms across parameter blocks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that gradient heterogeneity, together with Hessian heterogeneity, degrades the convergence of gradient-based methods such as SGD, while sign-based methods are substantially less sensitive to this effect. Adam's coordinate-wise normalization makes its update directions depend mainly on gradient signs, so Adam can be interpreted as a soft variant of SignSGD. Our analysis uses the fact that SGD and SignSGD follow steepest descent directions under different norms, and derives upper bounds on the iteration complexity with implications for learning rate scaling in SignSGD. We further investigate the origin of gradient heterogeneity in Transformer architectures and show that it is strongly influenced by the placement of layer normalization, with Post-LN architectures exhibiting particularly pronounced heterogeneity. Experimental results from fine-tuning Transformers in both NLP and vision domains validate our theoretical analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/tom4649/gradient-heterogeneity.

                <p>Auditory-evoked EEG signals contain rich temporal and cognitive features that reflect both the identity of individuals and their neural response to external stimuli. Traditional unimodal approaches often fail to fully leverage this multidimensional information fully, limiting their effectiveness in real-world biometric and neurocognitive applications. This study aims to develop a unified deep learning model capable of jointly performing biometric identification, auditory stimulus language classification, and device modality recognition, thereby exploiting both physiological and cognitive dimensions of auditory-evoked EEG. We introduce TriNet-MTL (Triple-Task Neural Transformer for Multitask Learning), a multi-branch deep learning framework composed of a shared temporal encoder and a transformer-based sequence modeling unit, trained and validated on auditory-evoked EEG data from 20 human participants (16 males and 4 females). The architecture is designed to simultaneously learn task-specific features via three dedicated output heads, each addressing one of the following: user identity (biometric), stimulus language (native vs non-native), and stimulus delivery mode (in-ear vs bone conduction). The model is trained using a sliding window approach and optimized through joint cross-entropy loss across tasks. TriNet-MTL demonstrates robust performance across all three classification tasks, achieving high accuracy in biometric identification (&gt;93%) and strong generalization in cognitive state inference. Multi-task training further improves representation learning, reducing inter-task interference while enhancing task synergy. The proposed TriNet-MTL framework effectively captures both user-specific and cognitively informative patterns from auditory-evoked EEG, establishing a promising direction for integrated EEG-based biometric authentication and cognitive state monitoring in real-world systems.</p>

                <p>Neurite outgrowth is essential for neural circuit formation and is tightly regulated by secreted factors and their receptors. The secreted extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPP&alpha;) has been shown to modulate neurite outgrowth. Recently, the gamma amino butyric acid receptor type-B subunit 1a (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a) was identified as an sAPP&alpha; binding partner that mediates its effects on synaptic transmission. Here, we investigated whether this interaction also regulates neurite outgrowth. In mouse primary hippocampal neurons of either sex, the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R agonist baclofen reduced axon length; whereas its antagonist CGP54626 increased axon length in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a knock-out increased axon length and abolished the effect of baclofen. Application of sAPP&alpha; reduced axon length, an effect that required the presence of both GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a and the extension domain of sAPP&alpha;, which mediates its binding to GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a. Similarly, the APP 17mer peptide, which is sufficient to bind GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a and mimic the effects of sAPP on synaptic transmission, reduced axon outgrowth in wild-type but not in GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a-deficient neurons. Together, these findings indicate that the 1a isoform contributes to GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-dependent suppression of neurite outgrowth and mediates the inhibitory effect of sAPP&alpha; on neurite outgrowth.</p>

<p>The parcellation of cortical types along the gradient of laminar complexity of the human cerebral cortex provides the basis for a Modern Neurodevelopmental Synthesis. This synthesis integrates ontogeny, phylogeny, gene expression, receptor architecture, cellular features, and synaptic connectivity and aims to guide experimental design for human cortical studies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The human cerebral cortex can be parceled into cortical areas according to particular physiological, clinico-pathological, and anatomical features. Alternatively, it can be parceled into cortical types based on laminar complexity. Cortical types are related to synaptic connectivity and are rooted in ontogeny and phylogeny. In this review, first, we summarize the history of human cortical type schemes and provide a Rosetta Stone to help identify the equivalences between them. Second, we review the developmental specification, phylogenesis, and embryogenesis of mammalian cortical types within the frame of the Prosomeric Model and the Hypothesis of the Dual Origin of the Neocortex and propose a causal model for human pallial patterning. Finally, we relate human cortical types to molecular features and synaptic connectivity according to the principles of the Structural Model. A Modern Neurodevelopmental Synthesis of the human cortex emerges, aiming to be a helpful framework for experimental design in basic and clinical neuroscience.</p>

                <p>by Gabriel Athènes, Adam Woolfe, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M. Walczak</p>

The specific region of an antibody responsible for binding to an antigen, known as the paratope, is essential for immune recognition. Accurate identification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development of therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on modeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and difficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a sequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from protein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current methods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions yields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks such as binder classification and epitope binning. Applied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific somatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a potential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based paratope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent approaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution.

                <p>by Sharia M. Ahmed, Cormac R. LaPrete, Iza Ciglenecki, Andrew Azman, Daniel T. Leung, Lindsay T. Keegan</p>

Since 2021, there has been a resurgence in the number of cholera cases, countries affected, and the case fatality rate. Because most cholera patients recover without antibiotic treatment, current cholera treatment guidelines only consider the tradeoffs between patient recovery and antibiotic stewardship. However, antibiotics also greatly reduce bacteria shedding, creating a potential role for antibiotics in cholera outbreak response through reduced transmission. We developed a compartmental model of cholera transmission in a non-endemic setting to quantify the potential impact of expanded antibiotic treatment on disease burden and antibiotic use. Through simulations, we evaluated different outbreak scenarios, by varying the reproductive number, care-seeking behavior, and proportion of non-severe cases receiving antibiotics. We found that expanding antibiotic treatment could significantly reduce the final outbreak size under certain outbreak characteristics. In these scenarios, treating non-severely symptomatic infections with antibiotics decreased cholera transmission and, in some cases, the total number of antibiotic doses used. We show that the effectiveness of expanded antibiotic treatment is highly dependent on achieving high care-seeking rates among non-severely symptomatic infections and tailoring the approach to specific outbreak conditions. While expanding antibiotic eligibility could enhance outbreak control in some settings, careful consideration of antibiotic resistance risks is necessary in high-transmission contexts.

                <p>by Alex Best, Nik Cunniffe</p>

Understanding, predicting and managing the spread of plant pathogens is crucial given the economic, societal and climatic benefits of plants, including crops and trees. Mathematical models have long been used to investigate disease dynamics in plants. An important component of such models is to account for spatial structure, since plant hosts are immobile and a majority of disease spread will often be localised. Here we apply a lattice-based mathematical modelling approach, a pair approximation, to model disease spread. While this method has previously been used to develop epidemiological theory, it has not been used to predict spread in a specific pathosystem. We fit our lattice-based epidemiological model to experimental data relating to Bahia bark scaling of citrus, an economically-important disease in north-eastern Brazil, and compare its performance to a more commonly used dispersal-kernel modelling approach. We show that the lattice-based model fits the data well, predicting a significant degree of near-neighbour infections, with similar estimated values of epidemiologically-meaningful parameters to the dispersal model. We highlight the pros and cons of the lattice-based approach and discuss how it may be used to predict disease spread and optimise control of plant diseases.

                <p>by Pankaj Dhakad, Bernard Y. Kim, Dmitri A. Petrov, Darren J. Obbard</p>

High-quality genome annotations are essential if we are to address central questions in comparative genomics, such as the origin of new genes, the drivers of genome size variation, and the evolutionary forces shaping gene content and structure. Here, we present protein-coding gene annotations for 301 species of the family Drosophilidae, generated using the Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT) and BRAKER3, and incorporating available RNA-seq and protein evidence. We take a comparative phylogenetic approach to annotation, with the aim of improving consistency and accuracy, and to generate a robust set of gene annotations and orthology assignments. We analyze our annotations using a phylogenetic mixed-model approach and find that gene number and CDS length exhibit moderate phylogenetic heritability (40% and 9.7%, respectively). For comparison, we also present analyses using a subset of the 215 highest quality genomes, although the findings were not markedly different. Our work suggests that while evolutionary history contributes to variation in these traits, species-specific factors—including assembly error—play a substantial role in shaping observed differences. To illustrate the utility of our annotations for comparative analyses, we investigate codon usage bias and amino acid composition across Drosophilidae. We find that codon usage is correlated with overall GC content and evolves slowly, but that it is also strongly shaped by selection—such that, in general, species with the strongest selection on synonymous codon usage show the lowest GC bias in third codon positions. This comparative annotation dataset forms part of an ongoing collaborative project to sequence and annotate all species of Drosophilidae, with data and annotations being made rapidly and freely available on an ongoing basis. We hope that this effort will serve as a foundation for studies in evolutionary and functional genomics and comparative biology across Drosophilidae.

                <p>by Jingjin Xu, Zihan Chang, Wei Deng, Luwei Qian, Honggang Su, Xun Huang, Yunsi Kang, Haibo Xie, Chengtian Zhao</p>

Regulation of neural cell morphology remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Photoreceptor cells, a specialized class of neurons capable of initiating the phototransduction cascade, exhibit distinct structural and morphological characteristics. While the structural and morphological differences between rod and cone photoreceptors have been extensively studied, the variability in the morphology of cone outer segments (OS) remains largely unexplored. Zebrafish possess four distinct cone types, each displaying unique OS morphologies. By modulating opsin expression across cone types, we reveal that the morphology of the cone OS correlates directly with the wavelength sensitivity of the expressed opsins, with cones expressing longer wavelength-sensitive opsins exhibiting elongated OS. This regulatory mechanism is conserved across various vertebrates. Furthermore, we show that alterations in light intensity—induced by ectopic lipid droplet formation in the light path or by changing the environment light intensity—can also modulate OS morphology. Notably, this morphological plasticity is not transient, but rather dependent on long-term neural activity. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the regulation of cone OS length. Our data suggest that both opsin sensitivity and light intensity shape cone OS morphology through long-term neural activity, providing critical insights into neural plasticity in these light-sensitive neurons.

                Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a common cause of orofacial pain, and research on therapeutic approaches has grown substantially in recent years. This bibliometric study aimed to assess the scientific output of Scopus-indexed articles on temporomandibular disorder (TMD) treatment, highlighting research trends, key authors, keywords and influential patterns. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in the Scopus database from January 2014 to Au-gust 2024. Results The search retrieved 621 articles; after excluding those not related to TMD treatment, 220 were analyzed. The main topics were treatment types and classifications of TMD. The journal contributing the most scientific content was the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The leading institutions in this field were three universities from Brazil. Conclusions The analysis reveals a steady increase in research related to TMD treatment. Although significant advances have been made, ongoing research is still necessary in order to establish appropriate treatment protocols that contribute to safeguarding global health.

                Background Recent attention has shifted towards alternative herbal mouthwashes due to the long-term unwanted side effects associated with Chlorhexidine, a common oral hygiene agent. These herbal options aim to serve as preventive therapies against dental caries, which are primarily caused by Streptococcus mutans. Methods This study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extracts from Salvia officinalis and Rosmarinus officinalis L. against Streptococcus mutans using the disk agar diffusion method to measure the zone of inhibition. The study assessed both the individual and synergistic effects of the extracts and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results The findings indicated that the 50% ethanolic extracts of both S. officinalis and R. officinalis L., as well as their combined application, exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans. The MIC values were 200 μg/mL for S. officinalis and 400 μg/mL for R. officinalis L. Additionally, higher concentrations of 1600 μg/mL for S. officinalis and 3200 μg/mL for R. officinalis L. resulted in a 10 mm inhibition of bacterial growth. Conclusion These findings suggest that these extracts are promising candidates as natural preventive agents for managing dental caries and promoting oral health.

<p>The fundamental neuromeric modular plan is remarkably conserved across bats and rodents. However, there are significant regional differences in the size and organization of specific derivatives (A). In addition, both <i>Tadarida brasiliensis</i> and <i>Myotis myotis</i> share similar general patterns of TH-positive processes and tracts in the basal plate of the diencephalo-midbrain-rostral hindbrain. Interestingly, a notable molecular variation was observed in the medial habenula (MHb) as revealed by TH-positive processes (B).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>Myotis myotis</i> and <i>Tadarida brasiliensis</i> are both microbat species belonging to the Vespertilionidae and Molossidae families, respectively. Our goal is to determine if the 85-million-year evolutionary divergence between microbats and the Muridae family (mice and rats) has led to significant regional variations in the brain. However, the 34-million-year split between <i>M. myotis</i> and <i>T. brasiliensis</i> serves as in-group control to contextualize the larger divergence with rodents. Using the prosomeric framework, main brain derivatives from each neuromeric partition were compared between these two microbats and with rodents. We found that although the fundamental neuromeric organization is conserved across microbats (<i>M. myotis</i> and <i>T. brasiliensis</i>) and rodents (rats, mice, and gerbils), there are significant regional differences within distinct derivatives such that microbats exhibit smaller corpus callosum, isocortex, optic chiasm, and cerebellum when compared to rodents. On the other hand, the overall pattern of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive processes and tracts in the basal plate of the diencephalon-midbrain-rostral hindbrain in both bats is similar to that found in rodents and primates. However, a key difference was found in the medial habenula (MHb). Although <i>M. myotis</i> showed selective TH expression in the MHb, this was absent in <i>T. brasiliensis</i>. Collectively, these findings suggest that the 85-million-year evolutionary divergence between bats and rodents has led to notable regional variations in brain anatomy, even though their basic modular plan remained the same.</p>

     alt="The Regenerative Stage-Defined Neurogenic Properties in the Spinal Cord of Xenopus laevis: Correlation Between Neurogenic Potential and Functional Repair of the Spinal Cord"/>
<p><i>Xenopus laevis</i> exhibits developmental stage-dependent regeneration capacity in various organs, including the spinal cord. This study demonstrates a strong association between the regeneration capacity and neurogenic activity in the spinal cord. In tadpoles, the spinal cord exhibits active neurogenesis and regenerates after injury, whereas in froglets, neurogenesis is significantly reduced, and the regeneration capacity is lost. These findings suggest that neurogenesis contributes to the functional repair of the spinal cord in <i>Xenopus</i> and may also play a role in mammals. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Many treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI) have been developed; however, none of these treatments enable complete functional repair. In this study, we utilized a model amphibian, <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, which has regeneration capacity of the spinal cord in the tadpole stages but loses it during metamorphosis, to identify differences in spinal cord properties between the regenerative and non-regenerative stages. We compared the spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors important for neural tube development as well as cell proliferation markers between tadpoles and metamorphosed young adults (froglets) in <i>Xenopus</i> as well as between <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse embryos. We found that <i>Xenopus</i> drastically changed properties in ependymal cells of the spinal cord during the transition from regenerative to non-regenerative stages, and that similar change occurred in the mouse neural tube between 12.5 and 14.5 dpc, during which neurogenesis is known to cease. We then investigated neurogenic activity during <i>Xenopus</i> metamorphosis by labeling newly generated neurons and found that it was correlated with regeneration capacity. We also found that neurogenesis actively occurred after SCI at the regenerative stages but was scarcely reactivated at the non-regenerative stages, suggesting that neurogenesis may play an important role in the process of spontaneous regeneration in <i>Xenopus</i>. We propose that supplying neurons as a treatment for SCI is a valid strategy based on principles of regeneration, which are naturally possessed by regenerative animals.</p>

                Background Smart home-enabled smart cities require low-latency data processing, precise energy forecasting, and strong risk prediction to guarantee efficient energy use and secure system functionality. Traditional cloud-centric IoT architectures face issues such as high latency, excessive energy consumption, and limited real-time threat detection. To tackle these problems, this research presents a fog-cloud-IoT-based framework aimed at improving energy efficiency, security, and operational reliability within smart home settings. Methods This study introduces a Cost-Effective Risk Prediction and Energy Management in Fog-Cloud-IoT (CREFCI) model. The architecture employs a Raspberry Pi 4 fog node for local data processing and communication, tracks user preferences and device statuses locally, ensures network security through Suricata IDS/IPS, and keeps a synchronized duplicate database in the IoT cloud for analytics and user interaction via Android and Web APIs. Interoperability among Zig bee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi protocols is facilitated through JSON/XML data transformation, energy demand is predicted using ANN-based learning, and risk scores are calculated through likelihood-impact analysis. Results Experimental assessments reveal that the CREFCI model achieves 75% accuracy in energy prediction, surpassing existing models by 13% for the highest predictions and doubling accuracy for the third-highest probability estimates. The model decreases mean absolute error (MAE) by 50% and enhances accuracy in lower-ranked predictions by 40–44%. Energy consumption is significantly lowered by 50–80%, using only 0.3–0.5 kWh compared to 1.0–1.7 kWh in competing methods. Furthermore, average latency is reduced by 40–60%, underscoring the effectiveness of fog-based processing. Conclusions The CREFCI model successfully integrates fog computing, cloud analytics, ensemble learning, and risk assessment to improve energy efficiency, prediction accuracy, and security in smart home IoT systems. By reducing latency reducing energy consumption, and providing real-time risk prediction, CREFCI offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for next-generation fog–cloud–IoT smart city infrastructures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-292/v1?src=rss">EffiRadNet: Lightweight and User-Friendly Open-Source EfficientNet-Based Model for Radiology Image Binary Classification Tasks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives To develop and evaluate EffiRadNet, a lightweight, user-friendly, open-source image classification model based on EfficientNet-B0, tailored for simple binary classification tasks in radiology, involving visually distinct image. The model aims to provide high accuracy and usability while remaining computationally efficient and accessible to non-engineering users. Methods EffiRadNet was trained and validated on three task-specific, class-balanced datasets (200 training and 200 validation images per dataset) sourced from the Open Access Biomedical Image Search Engine. The three classification tasks included a “Medical” task distinguishing radiological from non-radiological medical images, a “Modality” task classifying X-rays versus other radological modalities, and a “X-rays” task differentiating chest X-rays from other anatomical X-rays. The model used transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned with a modified two-class output layer. Performance was assessed across different hyperparameter settings using AUC, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Results EffiRadNet achieved strong classification performance across all tasks, with AUC values up to 1.0 under optimal hyperparameters (≥≤30 epochs, batch size = 16, learning rate = 0.0001). The “Medical” and “X-rays” models showed balanced sensitivity and specificity, while the “Modality” model displayed high sensitivity but variable specificity depending on hyperparameters. Training times ranged from 11 to 12 minutes, inference took less than 30 seconds per dataset. Conclusion EffiRadNet is a fast, accurate, and accessible AI tool for binary classification of radiological images. Its open-source availability and minimal hardware requirements make it well-suited for tasks such as image modality classification, dataset preprocessing, and quality control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-291/v1?src=rss">Diagnostic Accuracy of PET Imaging for Lymph Node Detection in Breast cancer patients undergoing Upfront Surgery: A Single-Institution Analysis of Breast Cancer Patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The role of PET imaging in lymph node staging for breast cancer patients proceeding to upfront surgery remains incompletely characterized. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PET imaging in immediate surgical patients. Methods A retrospective cohort of 70 breast cancer patients undergoing upfront surgery was analyzed. PET imaging findings were compared with histopathological examination (HPE) results. Diagnostic accuracy metrics including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results Among 70 surgical patients (mean age 53.9 ± 11.5 years), 26 (37.14%) had pathologically confirmed lymph node involvement. PET imaging demonstrated sensitivity of 69.23% (95% CI: 48.27-85.67), specificity of 81.82% (95% CI: 67.27-91.60), PPV of 69.23%, and NPV of 81.82%. The test correctly identified 18 of 26 patients with nodal disease while avoiding false positives in 36 of 44 node-negative patients. Positive likelihood ratio was 3.81, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.38. The F1-score was 0.6923, indicating good balance between precision and sensitivity for surgical planning. Conclusions PET imaging demonstrates clinically meaningful sensitivity (69.23%) and high negative predictive value (81.82%) in upfront surgical patients, supporting its utility for identifying patients with nodal involvement and confidently excluding nodal disease when negative. These performance characteristics suggest that PET can inform surgical extent and staging accuracy in immediate surgical patients, though positive findings warrant confirmatory assessment when staging determines operative planning.

                The propagation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare, while remote monitoring has enabled and patient care has improved, significant vulnerabilities have introduced that threaten the security of sensitive medical data. To address this crucial challenge, the study proposes a novel framework to enhance the privacy of data and trustworthiness in healthcare IoT ecosystems using advanced anomaly detection. We introduced a Customized Sand Cat Swarm driven Updated Random Forest (CSCS-URF) model, as a first step, data is preprocessed using min-max normalization and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The Second step is analyzing data by an ensemble classifier optimized via a customized swarm intelligence algorithm to effectively identify security anomalies. Then, evaluate the system on the CICIoT20232 dataset, the proposed CSCS-URF method shows superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, achieving an accuracy of 97%, precision of 94%, recall of 96%, and an F1-score of 95%. These results indicate that the CSCS-URF framework is a robust solution for proactive security, enabling the early detection of potential breaches to strengthen system integrity and safeguard patient data against evolving cyber threats in the healthcare sector.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection. As an institutional case study, this report is intended to illustrate operational strategy within a defined governance and infrastructure environment rather than to function as a universally prescriptive implementation model.

                Background The global aging population worldwide has led to increased attention toward ensuring a good quality of life (QoL) among older adults, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities. This study aimed to identify the determinants of quality of life among older adults living in a social care center in West Jakarta. Method This quantitative study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design involving 288 participants from a social care center. Data were collected using structured questionnaires measuring sleep behavior, medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, physical activity, and quality of life. Results The results indicated that sleep behavior was significantly associated with QoL (p = 0.002), whereas no statistically significant associations were found between QoL and other variables, including medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, and physical activity. Conclusion Sleep behaviour was identified as a significant association of QoL among institutionalized individuals. These findings suggest that sleep-focused approach should be prioritized in care strategies to improve the quality of life of older adults in long-term care.

                Background Goal setting is a foundational element of pediatric rehabilitation, guiding therapeutic planning, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhancing clinical outcomes. For children with neuromotor disabilities, goals must be both technically sound and personally meaningful—reflecting family priorities and child-centered values. The SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) is widely adopted to improve goal clarity and therapeutic effectiveness, while the F-words for Child Development framework (Function, Family, Fitness, Fun, Friends, Future) emphasizes contexts meaningful for the children and their families. Studies on goal analysis of children with neuromotor disabilities from Qatar is very limited. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the quality and meaningfulness of physical therapy goals set for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar, using both the SMART elements and the F-words for Child Development framework. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at the largest pediatric outpatient physical therapy department in Qatar. Electronic medical records from January to December 2019 were reviewed. A purposive sample of 100 children (between 12 months and 14 years) with neuromotor conditions—including cerebral palsy, developmental delay, Down syndrome, and genetic/metabolic disorders—was selected. A total of 183 goals from 92 children were finally analyzed. Each goal was mapped to identify its alignment with both the S.M.A.R.T and F-words framework. Results Overall adherence to SMART elements was high, particularly for goals that were specific, measurable, achievable, and time-bound. Goals mapped to the Relevant element were inconsistent, possibly reflecting limited family engagement in the goal-setting process. All goals aligned with at least one F-words domain, with Function being the most frequently represented. Domains such as Family, Fun, Fitness, Friends, and Future were notably underutilized. Conclusion While physical therapy goals for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar demonstrate strong technical structure, their meaningfulness from a family-centered perspective remains suboptimal. Strengthening family engagement and broadening the application of F-words during the goal-setting process are essential to enhancing family-centered care for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar.

                Context The human endonuclease Artemis, required for immunoglobulin rearrangements of V(D)J segments in B cells and thereby contributing to the adaptive immune response, belongs to the metallo-β-lactamase enzyme superfamily. β-lactam antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, are widely used in clinical practice and display strong affinity for β-lactamase catalytic sites. In vitro, ceftriaxone has been shown to block the activity of Artemis. Based on these structural similarities, the hypothesis according to which certain β-lactams could inhibit Artemis and therefore the immune response was previously proposed by our teams. This study aimed to determine in vivo whether ceftriaxone exposure alters vaccine-induced humoral immunity. Methods To explore the hypothesis put forward above, we developed an animal model to evaluate the antibody immune response to tetanus toxin induced by a diphtheria–tetanus–poliomyelelitis (DTP) vaccine in the presence or absence of ceftriaxone. Male BALB/c mice were vaccinated either before or after a five-day intraperitoneal ceftriaxone treatment; control groups received isotonic saline. The mice immune response to vaccine was quantified by measuring interactions with specific antigens using immunochromatographic tests, enabling longitudinal assessment of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies. Results We report the first experimental evidence of a specific weakening of vaccine-induced immune response in animals receiving ceftriaxone, with significantly reduced anti-tetanus antibody levels when vaccination followed antibiotic exposure. The response remained efficient in animals receiving isotonic saline treatment as control, and in mice vaccinated prior to ceftriaxone administration. Conclusions These results confirm our hypothesis that the immune response to tetanus toxin is impaired and that a refractory period for humoral immunity may be caused by the inhibition of Artemis by ceftriaxone. This work highlights a clinically relevant interaction between β-lactam antibiotics and adaptive immune responses.

                Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant comorbidity in cardiovascular treatments, increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Choosing between drug-eluting balloons (DEB) and drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with CKD requires careful consideration of efficacy and safety. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of DEB and DES in CKD patients, focusing on mortality, MACE, TLR, and stent thrombosis. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort study comparing DEB and DES in CKD patients were included. Four reviewers independently screened and extracted data on mortality, MACE, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and stent thrombosis, and conflicts were resolved through discussion. Results Five studies (four retrospective cohorts, one RCT) met inclusion criteria after screening 4,093 records, involving CKD/ESRD patients undergoing PCI with DEB (paclitaxel-coated) versus contemporary DES. MACE rates were equivalent: 17% in both arms (Funayama et al., ESRD dialysis cohort) and 10% in both arms (Jeger et al., RCT; HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.38-2.57). Target lesion revascularization (TLR) and target vessel failure (TVF) showed heterogeneity: DES favored in some (e.g., Waha et al., aHR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.69), DEB numerically in others (e.g., Joh et al., 2-year TVF 14.3% DEB vs. 27.8% DES), with no meta-analysis due to clinical/methodological differences; thrombosis was low and sparse (0% DEB vs. 2.2% DES in Funayama). Conclusion In CKD/ESRD patients, DEB and DES yield equivalent MACE, though TLR/TVF results vary by study design, CKD severity, and procedural factors. No clear superiority emerged, supporting individualized strategy selection based on lesion characteristics, bleeding risk, and expertise. Prospective RCTs with standardized CKD subgroups and DEB optimization are needed for definitive guidance. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD420251039001 (05/15/2025)

                Abstract* The forecast of time series in financial applications is difficult to perform as time series forecasting is nonlinear in nature, seasonal, and has structural variability. Stock price series tend to follow a lot of nonlinear dynamics, which undermines the power of single-model approaches. Hybrid decomposition-based models have attracted increasing interest in order to gain accuracy by separating heterogeneous features from one another. In this work, we present a hybrid forecasting methodology that incorporates STD decomposition with RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network). The time series is decomposed, where trend, seasonal, and dispersion components are separately modeled using RBFNN with Gaussian basis functions. The predicted feature sets are then recombined to construct a forecast, to be evaluated with weekly Tesla stock price data and standard accuracy performance metrics. The STD–RBFNN model gives very low forecasting errors under different variables and a high coefficient of determination. It shows superiority compared with an alternative hybrid neural network model, especially in modeling nonlinear variation under similar experimental conditions. This results in substantially greater forecasting accuracy because trend, seasonal, and dispersion components separate before neural modeling. The proposed STD and RBFNN pipeline is a good and highly flexible method to forecast complex nonlinear and seasonal financial time series.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Iraq. Methods The study included 881 participants with T2DM and different types of foot ulcers, who attended a specialized diabetes center. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, biochemical investigations, comorbidities, and treatment regimens were collected and analyzed. Results The majority of the cases (96.8%) were due to T2DM, with an average age of 58 years and a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2. Participants had elevated serum creatinine, blood urea, and glucose levels, with uncontrolled HbA1c levels. Comorbidities included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetic neuropathy, and retinopathy. Most participants were on insulin and statins. Diabetic foot ulcers were mainly on the right foot (48%) and classified as Grade 2 in Wagner’s system. Some participants had Charcot deformity or stages of amputation. Conclusions Random plasma glucose levels and diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with the classification of foot ulcers. Further research is needed to explore additional variables related to T2DM and foot ulcers, emphasizing the importance of glucose control and retinopathy in ulcer classification.

                Background Infertility has become a significant issue that requires attention as its prevalence has increased globally and nationally in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades. This study aimed to explore patients’ perceptions towards infertility and in vitro fertilization-related services. Additionally, this study examined the barriers that prevent couples from seeking infertility treatment and IVF in Khobar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Methods This study employed a qualitative, hybrid thematic analysis approach. Fifteen participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into three categories: infertility patients, infertility caregivers, and administrative staff working in infertility clinics. Results This study identified four main themes: patients’ experiences, infertility services in Eastern Province, and perceived barriers to receiving treatment. Participants reported that they believed infertility was on the rise, especially male infertility. The reported obstacles included financial burdens, lack of awareness, societal influences, and lengthy, complex treatment processes. Conclusions This study highlights the significant barriers that couples encounter in accessing infertility treatment. These findings emphasize the urgent need for improved public health policies, such as utilizing case management to support patients and incorporating insurance coverage for infertility treatments, along with enhanced support services.

                The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is a pivotal tool for organizing mechanistic knowledge and linking it to adverse outcomes of regulatory significance. However, the integration of test method information, particularly New Approach Methods (NAMs), within the central repository for AOP knowledge, (the AOP-Wiki), has been suboptimal, limiting the framework’s utility for regulatory decision-making. The Methods2AOP collaboration, comprised of various international stakeholders, was established to address this gap and enhance the role of test methods within the AOP framework. This paper reviews their work emphasizing the importance of linking detailed test method information and conceptually proposes how it may be included in the AOP knowledgebase in alignment with existing assay documentation standards and governance frameworks. The Methods2AOP collaboration proposes using ontologies to standardize and structure information, thereby facilitating interoperability, enabling reusability, and establishing clear connections between test methods and Key Events (KEs). A conceptual model is presented to demonstrate qualitative similarities between concepts in key event components and structured methods information. The implementation of Methods2AOP recommendations would increase the clarity and transparency of method descriptions, which could support regulatory acceptance and a wider adoption of NAMs. The broad community of stakeholders impacted by this work stands to benefit from the Methods2AOP recommendations through enhanced regulatory decisions, increased visibility and scientific impact, new market opportunities, and the accelerated adoption of NAMs in regulatory affairs. In summary, the Methods2AOP collaboration presents a comprehensive effort to formally standardize the integration of test methods into the AOP framework, thereby fostering a more robust, and transparent system that aligns with the goals of the scientific and regulatory communities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107943">The basolateral amygdala complex and perirhinal cortex represent focal and peripheral states of information processing in rats</a></h4>

              
                We previously identified the roles of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) and perirhinal cortex (PRh) in sensory preconditioning in male and female rats (Wong et al., 2025). Here, we used variations of a sensory preconditioning protocol to test a general theory that the BLA and PRh represent focal and peripheral states of attention, respectively. We specifically tested predictions derived from the theory regarding when learning about a stimulus that signals danger will be disrupted by BLA or PRh infusions of the <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, DAP5. Consistent with the theory, the effects of these infusions depended on the novelty/familiarity of the conditioned stimulus, as well as the manner in which it was paired with foot shock. When a stimulus was novel, its conditioning required NMDAR-activation in the BLA and not the PRh, regardless of whether the stimulus and shock were presented contiguously or separated in time. When a pre-exposed and, thereby, familiar stimulus was presented contiguously with shock, its conditioning again required NMDAR-activation in the BLA and not the PRh. However, when a pre-exposed stimulus was indirectly paired with shock – because it was associatively activated at the time of shock or separated from the shock by another stimulus – its conditioning required NMDAR-activation in the PRh and not the BLA. These findings are discussed in relation to theories of information processing that distinguish between focal and peripheral states of attention/memory, and past studies that have examined the substrates of learning and memory in the PRh and BLA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108048">Male-biased Cyp17a2 orchestrates antiviral sexual dimorphism in fish via STING stabilization and viral protein degradation</a></h4>

              
                Differences in immunity between males and females in living organisms are generally thought to be due to sex hormones and sex chromosomes, and it is often assumed that males have a weaker immune response. Here, we report that in fish, males exhibit stronger antiviral immune responses, the male-biased gene <i>cyp17a2</i> as a critical mediator of this enhanced response. First, we observed that male zebrafish exhibit enhanced antiviral resistance compared to females, and notably, zebrafish lack sex chromosomes. Through transcriptomic screening, we found that <i>cyp17a2</i> was specifically highly expressed in male fish. <i>Cyp17a2</i> knockout males were equivalent to wild-type males in terms of sex organs and androgen secretion, but the ability to upregulate IFN as well as antiviral resistance was greatly reduced. Then, Cyp17a2 is identified as a positive IFN regulator which is located at the endoplasmic reticulum and specifically interacts with and enhances STING-mediated antiviral responses. Mechanistically, Cyp17a2 stabilizes STING expression by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase bloodthirsty-related gene family member 32 (btr32), which facilitates K33-linked polyubiquitination. The capacity of IFN induction of Cyp17a2 was abolished when STING was knocked down. Meanwhile, Cyp17a2 also attenuates viral infection directly to strengthen the antiviral capacity. As an antiviral protein, Cyp17a2 degrades the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) P protein by utilizing USP8 to reduce its K33-linked polyubiquitination. These findings reveal a sex-based regulatory mechanism in teleost antiviral immunity, broadening our understanding of sexual dimorphism in immune responses beyond the conventional roles of sex chromosomes and hormones.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99322">Ribosome demand links transcriptional bursts to protein expression noise</a></h4>

              
                Stochastic variation in protein expression generates phenotypic heterogeneity in a cell population and has an important role in antibiotic persistence, mutation penetrance, tumor growth, and therapy resistance. Studies investigating molecular origins of noise have predominantly focused on the transcription process. However, the noise generated in the transcription process is further modulated by translation. This influences the expression noise at the protein level which eventually determines the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity in a cell population. Studies across different organisms have revealed a positive association between translational efficiency and protein noise. However, the molecular basis of this association has remained unknown. In this work, through stochastic modeling of translation in single mRNA molecules and empirical measurements of protein noise, we show that ribosome demand associated with high translational efficiency in a gene drives the correlation between translational efficiency and protein noise. We also show that this correlation is present only in genes with bursty transcription. Thus, our work reveals the molecular basis of how coding sequence of genes, along with their promoters, can regulate noise. These findings have important implications for investigating protein noise and phenotypic heterogeneity across biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108259">Cell cycle-dependent cues regulate temporal patterning of the Drosophila central brain neural stem cells</a></h4>

              
                During nervous system development, diverse types of neurons and glia are sequentially generated by self-renewing neural stem cells (NSCs). Temporal changes in gene expression within NSCs are thought to regulate neural diversity; however, the mechanisms regulating the timing of these temporal gene transitions remain poorly understood. <i>Drosophila</i> type 2 NSCs, like human outer radial glia, divide to self-renew and generate intermediate neural progenitors, amplifying and diversifying the population of neurons innervating the central complex, a brain region crucial for sensorimotor coordination. Type 2 NSCs express over a dozen genes temporally, broadly classified as early- and late-expressed genes. A conserved gene, <i>seven-up</i>, mediates early-to-late gene expression by activating ecdysone receptor (EcR) expression. However, the timing of EcR expression and, consequently, the transition from early-to-late gene expression remain unknown. This study investigates whether intrinsic mechanisms of cell cycle progression and cytokinesis are required to induce the NSC early-late transition. By generating mutant clones that arrest the NSC cell cycle or block cytokinesis, we show that both processes are necessary for the early-to-late transition. When NSCs are cell cycle or cytokinesis arrested, the early gene Imp fails to be downregulated and persists in the old NSCs, while the late factors EcR and Syncrip fail to be expressed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the early factor Seven-up is insufficient to drive the transition, despite its normal expression in cell cycle- or cytokinesis-inhibited NSCs. These results suggest that both cell-intrinsic (cell cycle/cytokinesis) and -extrinsic (hormone) cues are required for the early-late NSC gene expression transition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103784">Impaired excitability of fast-spiking neurons in a novel mouse model of KCNC1 epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                The recurrent pathogenic variant <i>KCNC1-</i>p.Ala421Val (A421V) is a cause of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by moderate-to-severe developmental delay/intellectual disability, and infantile-onset treatment-resistant epilepsy with multiple seizure types, including myoclonic seizures. Yet, the mechanistic basis of this disease, and of the <i>KCNC1</i> disease spectrum, remains unclear. <i>KCNC1</i> encodes Kv3.1, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that is strongly and selectively expressed in neurons capable of generating action potentials at high frequency, including parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex (PV-INs) that are known to be important for cognitive function and plasticity as well as control of network excitation to prevent seizures. In this study, we generate a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional expression of the A421V pathogenic missense variant (<i>Kcnc1</i>-A421V/+ mice) to explore the specific physiological mechanisms of <i>KCNC1</i> developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Our results indicate that global heterozygous expression of the A421V variant leads to cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and premature lethality. We observe decreased PV-IN cell surface expression of Kv3.1 via immunohistochemistry, decreased voltage-gated potassium current density in PV-INs using outside-out nucleated macropatch recordings in brain slice, and profound impairments in the intrinsic excitability of cerebral cortex PV-INs (but not excitatory neurons) via current-clamp electrophysiology. <i>In vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging revealed altered activity in <i>Kcnc1</i>-A421V/+ PV-INs and excitatory cells, as well as hypersynchronous discharges correlated with brief paroxysmal movements that were subsequently shown to be myoclonic seizures on electroencephalography. We found alterations in PV-IN-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in young adult but not juvenile <i>Kcnc1</i>-A421V/+ mice relative to wild-type controls. Together, these results establish the specific impact of the recurrent Kv3.1-A421V variant on neuronal excitability and synaptic physiology across development to drive network dysfunction underlying <i>KCNC1</i> epileptic encephalopathy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101518">Unravelling the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying counterconditioning in humans</a></h4>

              
                Counterconditioning (CC) aims to enhance extinction of threat memories by establishing new associations of opposite valence. While its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain largely unexplored, previous studies suggest qualitatively different mechanisms from regular extinction. In this functional MRI study, participants underwent categorical threat conditioning (CS+/CS-: images of animals/tools), followed by either CC (CS + images reinforced with monetary rewards, n=24) or regular extinction (n=24). The following day, we assessed spontaneous recovery of threat responses and episodic memory for CS + and CS- category exemplars. While the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was activated during regular extinction, participants undergoing CC showed persistent CS+-specific deactivation of the vmPFC and hippocampus, and CS+-specific activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The following day, physiological threat responses returned in the regular extinction group, but not in the CC group. Counterconditioning furthermore strengthened episodic memory for CS + exemplars presented during CC, and retroactively also for CS + exemplars presented during the threat conditioning phase. Our findings confirm that CC leads to more persistent extinction of threat memories, as well as altered consolidation of the threat conditioning episode. Crucially, we show a qualitatively different activation pattern during CC versus regular extinction, with a shift away from the vmPFC and towards the NAcc.

">Pharmacological recruitment of a VTA glutamatergic arousal circuit by the natural product BN3 drives broad-spectrum emergence from general anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacological control of emergence from general anesthesia remains strikingly limited. Clinically available antagonists are largely drug-class specific, leaving recovery dependent on anesthetic clearance rather than to an actively programmable switch in brain state. Through phenotypic screening of a structurally diverse natural-product library, we identified BN3 (L-(--)-camphor) as a broad-spectrum emergence agent. BN3 robustly shortened recovery from propofol anesthesia across species-from mice and rats to rabbits, dogs, and rhesus monkeys-and remained effective after continuous infusion. In rodents, BN3 also accelerated emergence from mechanistically distinct anesthetics, including etomidate, remimazolam, sodium {gamma}-hydroxybutyrate, midazolam, ketamine, sodium pentobarbital, and isoflurane. EEG recordings revealed a rapid cortical shift from slow-wave dominance to a wake-like high-frequency spectrum. Mechanistically, BN3 preferentially recruited ventral tegmental area (VTA) glutamatergic neurons: chemogenetic silencing abolished the BN3-evoked EEG spectral shift and strongly attenuated behavioral acceleration of emergence, whereas optogenetic activation of these neurons was sufficient to promote recovery. BN3 increased glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, and projection-specific inhibition of VTA[-&gt;]NAc or VTA[-&gt;]mPFC outputs blunted BN3-induced emergence. These findings define a VTA-centered glutamatergic arousal circuit that can be pharmacologically recruited as a common gateway for anesthetic-independent emergence.

                We present the most comprehensive sampling of the macaque and human brain with diffusion MRI to date. As part of the BRAIN CONNECTS center for Large-scale Imaging of Neural Circuits, we leverage ultra-high-gradient MRI systems, including the first-of-its-kind Connectome 2.0, for post-mortem acquisitions. Each sample is imaged for ~250 hours at multiple spatial resolutions down to 0.25 mm isotropic for whole macaque brains and 0.4 mm isotropic for human hemispheres. Our optimized protocols allow us to sample both species across ~50 diffusion shells varying in b-value, diffusion time, and echo time, reaching ultra-high b-values up to 64000 s/mm^2 with high signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate that these multi-dimensional data resolve not only white matter connectional architecture but also cortical and subcortical cytoarchitectonic boundaries, at a level of detail previously inaccessible in whole-brain noninvasive imaging. As such, these data are an important resource for both technical development and basic and clinical neuroscience.

">The dentate gyrus grows throughout life despite turnover of developmentally-born neurons</a></h4>

              
                Adult-born hippocampal neurons are highly plastic but there remains uncertainty about the magnitude of neurogenesis and its long-term functional consequences. Theoretical predictions indicate that adult neurogenesis should lead to substantial growth of the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell population. However, in practice, most studies find no changes in total cell number across adulthood. This discrepancy may partly be a sensitivity issue, where small sample sizes and the examination of older age windows (when neurogenesis is reduced) have prevented detection. However, neurogenic growth could also be masked by the turnover of developmentally-born DG neurons, which are known to die off in normal aging. To address the question of how neuronal birth and loss impacts DG population dynamics, here we quantified numbers of developmentally-born neurons, proliferating Ki67+ cells (as a proxy for adult-born neurons), and total DG neurons from 2-18 months of age in the rat. We estimate that over this timeframe 670,000 adult-born neurons are added (30% of the total population). Consistent with neurogenic growth, the total number of DG neurons increased across adulthood. However, net growth was only 385,000 cells, which is less than predicted by adult neurogenesis alone. Indeed, 20% of developmentally-born neurons were lost over the same interval, and so we propose that the difference is explained by neuronal turnover. Neuronal persistence and turnover may be relevant for theories of hippocampal long-term memory, as well as for understanding psychiatric conditions that are characterized by hippocampal plasticity and atrophy.

">Deciphering epileptogenic and activity-dependent gene programs in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity is fundamental to brain function, yet chronically elevated activity underlies neurological disorders such as drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). In animal models, activity induces defined transcriptional programs within activated neurons; however, the nature, cellular specificity, and pathological relevance of such programs in the human brain remain poorly understood. Here, we apply single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to epileptogenic, non-epileptogenic, and intraoperatively stimulated non-epileptogenic cortical tissue obtained from individuals with DRE. Across 26 cell types profiled, glutamatergic neurons projecting from cortical layers 2/3, 5, and 6 to intratelencephalic targets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the epileptogenic microenvironment, inducing shared immediate-early genes alongside cell-type-specific programs linked to synaptic remodeling and cellular stress. Approximately one-third of transcripts enriched in the epileptogenic microenvironment were also induced by acute stimulation, suggesting that a fraction of epilepsy-associated gene expression reflects conserved responses to heightened activity rather than disease-specific programs. While transcripts induced by both epileptogenic and acute activity converged upon immediate-early genes and heat-shock proteins, only acute stimulation triggered a rapid, multicellular induction of transcripts involved in mitochondrial ATP synthesis. This divergence suggests that neurons within epileptogenic cortex may be unable to mount appropriate metabolic adaptations to sustained energetic demands. In parallel, both microglia and circulating CD14+ monocytes exhibit signs of immune activation in epilepsy, suggesting myeloid-driven inflammatory rewiring that extends beyond the brain. Together, these findings illuminate human activity-dependent gene programs and reveal signatures of neuronal vulnerability and inflammation in DRE.

">Anatolution, an online platform for consensus morphology</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Supervised statistical learning for cell-level segmentation and morphometry in optical microscopy is limited less by algorithmic capacity than by the scarcity of reliable, expert-validated ground truth. In comparative neuroscience and quantitative histology, where classical stains such as Nissl's method remain the primary means to study cellular morphology, this bottleneck is acute: manual annotation is expensive, subject to individual bias, and rarely performed at the scale or consistency that computational approaches demand. No existing platform integrates a stain-specific bioimage segmentation protocol, a structured multi-annotator workflow, and consensus-based quality control into a single pipeline from image ingestion to machine-readable training data. Methods: We present Anatolution, an open-source, web-based platform designed to address the gap of quality annotations at https://anatolution.herokuapp.com/public-tool/. Anatolution organizes microscopy images, including 2D arrays or 3D volumes, into project workspaces where multiple annotators independently label cellular structures against a shared computer vision catalogue. This design enables systematic inter-rater and intra-rater reliability assessment, with consensus derived from agreement across annotators rather than from any single expert's judgment. The platform enables the export of aggregated labels or annotation datasets for downstream statistical learning methods. We describe the system's architecture, its Nissl-specific segmentation pipeline, the consensus annotation workflow, and validation of inter-rater reliability. Conclusion: Across 20+ histological annotation containers annotated by up to 15 independent raters, consensus boundary agreement increased monotonically with annotator count, reaching a median Dice of 0.79 against the full-rater reference at seven annotators, with top-tier containers achieving leave-one-out ceiling values of 0.621 to 0.769 for cell-body segmentation. The segmentation pipeline provided effective spatial anchoring, with 88% of consensus-annotated polygons containing at least one algorithmically detected seed. Anatolution provides open-source infrastructure for producing consensus-validated training data from classical histological preparations, addressing the primary bottleneck limiting supervised learning for cell-level morphometry.

">Exploring the sensitivity limits of neuronal current imaging with MRI and MEG in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Conventional BOLD-fMRI relies on hemodynamic responses that are temporally and spatially indirect markers of neural activity. Developing alternative contrasts, sensitive to neuroelectrical phenomena, is a critical challenge in brain imaging. Spin-lock (SL) fMRI has shown promise in phantom studies for detecting magnetic field changes associated with neuronal activity, but its in-vivo sensitivity and practicality remain unclear. This study evaluated whether SL contrast can effectively detect and localize human neuronal activation, benchmarked against complementary functional modalities, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and 3T BOLD-fMRI, to assess the sensitivity of MR-based neuronal current imaging. Methods: Thirteen healthy young volunteers underwent SL-based imaging during 8 Hz visual stimulation, along with BOLD and MEG acquisitions. Subjects viewed quadrant-checkerboard stimuli to elicit localized cortical responses. Two balanced SL contrast mechanisms, rotary excitation (REX) and stimulus-induced rotary saturation (SIRS), were employed. Postprocessing targeted stimulus-locked signal fluctuations using a regression-filtering-rectification strategy. Phantom experiments tested sensitivity and analysis pipeline performance. Results: MEG revealed robust stimulus-locked responses in occipital cortex, with estimated local magnetic field amplitudes of ~0.07 nT. Conventional BOLD-fMRI confirmed reliable hemodynamic activation. In contrast, neither balanced REX nor balanced SIRS produced consistent stimulus-related activation in vivo. Phantom experiments subsequently yielded detection thresholds of 0.2 nT for REX and 0.6 nT for SIRS, exceeding the MEG-estimated physiological field amplitudes. Conclusions: Under the present experimental conditions, the tested spin-lock fMRI implementations did not achieve sufficient sensitivity for reliable in-vivo detection of neuronal magnetic fields at 3T. Phantom and MEG-based estimates indicate that physiological field amplitudes in the visual cortex lie below current detection limits. These findings establish quantitative constraints on direct neuronal current imaging with MRI and provide a benchmark for future methodological developments aimed at bridging electrophysiology and functional MRI.

">A VTA-pontine GABA pathway biases backward locomotion via local and distal inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor direction in mammals is implemented by descending circuits, yet how midbrain selection systems bias directional motor output remains unclear. Here, we functionally define a projection-defined inhibitory pathway from the ventral tegmental area to the oral pontine reticular nucleus (VTAPnO), whose activation is sufficient to drive backward locomotion. Using single-neuron juxtacellular labeling, circuit-targeted optogenetics, ex vivo electrophysiology, and in vivo recordings, we show that a subpopulation of TH- (non-dopaminergic) VTA neurons projects to PnO while retaining local intra-VTA collaterals that form monosynaptic GABAA synapses. Somatic activation reliably induced backward locomotion, and selective stimulation of VTAPnO terminals reproduced the effect, supporting convergent local and projection-mediated engagement. Pathway recruitment produced a rapid, transient increase in dopaminergic single-unit activity in acute recordings and elicited frequency-dependent increases in dopaminergic population calcium signals measured by fiber photometry in awake mice. During forced locomotion, chronically recorded VTAPnO neurons were preferentially engaged during reverse compared to forward rotations and displayed direction-tuned temporal profiles. Together, these findings reveal a dual local-projection inhibitory architecture through which a projection-defined midbrain pathway can bias locomotor direction through a defined premotor node.

">TMS timed to interictal epileptiform discharges</a></h4>

              
                Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are pathological hypersynchronous bursts of electrical brain activity that occur between seizures in patients with epilepsy. IEDs are caused by transient brain states that are difficult to predict, making them a challenging neurophysiological and technological case for brain-state-dependent stimulation. Administering stimulation at IED onset may provide insight into the epileptic network and optimize neurostimulation therapies. Here, we assessed the feasibility of IED-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in two children with self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS), a common pediatric epilepsy in which IEDs emerge from the motor cortex. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on the participants' pre-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data with IEDs annotated by an epileptologist. The CNN was integrated into an EEG-processing pipeline that classified EEG segments as "IED" or "non-IED" in real time. With this pipeline, TMS pulses were administered during IED or non-IED periods in an interleaved, randomized design. We stimulated both the motor cortex generating the IEDs and the contralateral motor cortex and tested the impact of IEDs on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). Our study demonstrated that TMS can be timed to IEDs and that there is a site-specific increase in TEP amplitude when stimulating during IEDs. Out of the TMS pulses aimed at an IED, 39% and 19% were successfully delivered during an IED for the two participants, respectively. For future research, we propose ways to address the methodological challenges of IED-timed TMS, enabling brain-state-dependent TMS for epilepsy research and treatment.

">The impact of seizures on REM sleep and the cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disruption is a common and burdensome feature in epilepsy, with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep particularly affected. While sleep disturbances in epilepsy patients are multifactorial, clinical evidence suggests that recent seizures acutely impair REM sleep architecture. To investigate this relationship, we used a haploinsufficient mouse model of Dravet Syndrome, which allows experimental control of seizure timing and burden. We found that hyperthermia-induced seizures profoundly decreased subsequent sleep, specifically impairing REM entry. In vivo fiber photometry revealed acute, seizure-induced activation of cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), a brainstem structure critical for REM entry. We additionally found that repeated seizures triggered anatomical changes in the PPN, including reduced cholinergic neuron number and significant hypertrophy of remaining cholinergic neurons. These results suggest seizures are a driver of both acute and chronic disruption of PPN cholinergic networks, which in turn impair REM sleep in epilepsy. Our findings identify the PPN as a potential therapeutic target for interventions to address sleep-related sequelae of seizures.

">Glycolytic Specialization Shapes Neuronal Physiology and Function in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Neurons perform diverse functions that impose distinct energetic demands, but how energy-metabolic pathways are matched to these functions in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that two functionally divergent sister chemosensory neurons in C. elegans, ASEL and ASER, exhibit asymmetric glycolytic flux, with ASER having high and ASEL having low levels of glycolysis. Metabolic imaging, metabolic network modeling, and electrophysiology measurements reveal that ASER's elevated glycolysis supports a hyperpolarized resting potential, low input resistance, and rapid repolarization that enable a distinct functional role compared to ASEL. Impairing glycolysis collapses these electrophysiological specializations without abolishing neuronal excitability, and selectively disrupts ASER's calcium responses while leaving ASEL largely unaffected. These findings demonstrate that neuron-specific glycolytic programs shape core biophysical properties and are required for functional identity in vivo, establishing metabolism as an active determinant of neuronal physiology.

">Brain Kappa Opioid Receptor Availability Across Stress and Social Buffering Conditions: A Positron Emission Tomography Study in Coppery Titi Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Social connectedness strongly influences health and longevity, and adult pair bonds provide psychological benefits distinct from other social relationships. Oxytocin (OT), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and opioids, play an important role in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds. Evidence suggests that OT modulates the stress response via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, while the kappa opioid system interacts with and may modulate OT signaling in contexts of stress and separation. In this study 20 coppery titi monkeys were exposed to a physical stressor under three social conditions: baseline (no stressor, partner present), stress (stressor, no partner present) and buffering (stressor, partner present). We predicted stress-induced dynorphin release would reduce kappa opioid receptor availability measured via [11C]GR103545 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) OT, whereas partner presence would mitigate dynorphin release and increase CSF OT, with reduced dynorphin inferred from higher kappa opioid receptor radioligand binding. Our results show condition-dependent differences in [11C]GR103545 binding in several brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, with altered binding in both the stress and social buffering conditions. Cortisol levels were elevated in the stress condition compared to baseline. Females exhibited lower CSF OT levels during stress than at baseline, whereas plasma OT levels did not differ across conditions or between sexes. Spearman correlations revealed no significant associations between plasma and CSF OT. Together, these findings highlight the complex interaction between kappa opioid signaling, OT, and HPA axis activity in the context of social relationships and highlight neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying stress regulation in pair-bonded species.

                Communication depends on precise coordination between movement and cognition. Here we reveal that the cerebellum exerts real-time control over social vocalizations in adult mice. Optogenetic stimulation of excitatory cerebellar output in the superior cerebellar peduncle silenced ultrasonic vocalizations with frequency-dependent potency while inducing distinct motor phenotypes. Functional mapping across cerebellar subregions localized vocal behavior to cerebellar interposed nucleus circuits and identified the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a conserved vocal control hub, as a downstream target. Deep brain stimulation of the PAG rescued vocal deficits but not motor incoordination in a mouse model of cerebellar dysfunction. These results identify a cerebellar-midbrain pathway that gates communication independently of movement, and demonstrate that targeted therapeutic neuromodulation rescues social behaviors even in the context of persistent cerebellar-driven motor impairment.

">Event2Flow: Scalable imaging of peripheral and cerebral hemodynamics with event-based vision sensors</a></h4>

              
                Accurate blood flow mapping over mesoscale fields of view is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes, yet conventional optical methods often rely on bulky high-speed cameras that generate massive datasets with excessive computation burden. Here, we introduce Event2Flow, a compact and data-efficient framework leveraging event-based vision sensors, which asynchronously capture brightness changes with sub-millisecond latency and minimal data redundancy. Event2Flow supports multiple contrast mechanisms for flow measurement, including speckle fluctuation and particle tracking. By correlating the event count with flow velocity through simulations and experiments, we first demonstrate its application in laser speckle imaging for noninvasive mapping of mouse ear vasculature and ethanol-induced hemodynamic changes. When integrated with widefield fluorescence localization microscopy and point spread function engineering, Event2Flow further enables kilohertz-rate particle tracking for rapid 3D velocity quantification in transcranial brain imaging and snapshot flow direction estimations using event polarity. Overall, Event2Flow offers a scalable alternative to conventional high-speed imaging systems for vascular and neuroimaging applications.

">Neurometabolic correlates of accelerated aging and neurocognitive late effects in long-term survivors of pediatric hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Adult survivors of pediatric cancers are at elevated risk for neurocognitive late effects, but how these effects relate to metabolic perturbations in the brain remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, the present study explored associations between neurometabolite levels and neurocognitive function in adult survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Data were collected from a single-center observational study conducted at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) between October 2022 and November 2024. Adult survivors of HL (N=11 [5 females]; >=5 years post-diagnosis; mean [SD] current age 34 [9.5] years) and ALL (N=24 [16 females]; >=5 years post-diagnosis; current age 40 [12.6] years) and community controls (N=35 [17 females]; current age 40 [11] years) completed standardized neurocognitive tests of memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed. Participants also underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to quantify neurometabolite levels in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left hippocampus, and left cerebellum. Analyses used regression models to examine differences in the slope of the relationship between neurometabolite and neurocognitive function or between neurometabolite and age. When comparing HL survivors vs controls, significant interactions were identified for group x age on the ratio of myo-inositol to N-Acetyl aspartic acid (mI/NAA; p=0.007) and group x Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) on processing speed (p=0.04) in the left dlPFC. When comparing ALL survivors vs controls, significant interactions were identified for group x myo-inositol on verbal fluency in the left hippocampus (p=0.01) and group x GABA on cognitive flexibility in the left cerebellum (p=0.01). These preliminary findings suggest that neuroinflammation may be a mechanistic underpinning of age-associated neurocognitive impairment in pediatric cancer survivors.

">Selective Auditory Attention Decoding with a Two-Node Wireless EEG Sensor Network</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Selective auditory attention decoding (sAAD) enables neuro-steered hearing devices through identification of the attended speaker in a multi-speaker environment, using neural activity recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Despite substantial progress in decoding algorithms, practical deployment remains constrained by a lack of wearable, unobtrusive, and fully wireless EEG acquisition solutions. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate whether reliable sAAD can be achieved under realistic hardware constraints imposed by miniaturized, galvanically isolated EEG sensor nodes. Approach: We investigate sAAD using a wireless EEG sensor network (WESN) setup consisting of two synchronized, compact around-ear EEG sensor nodes worn bilaterally. The nodes are fully galvanically isolated (i.e., there is no wire between them), each providing four local EEG channels derived from five pre-gelled electrodes, including a local reference. Sample-wise wireless synchronization of data from both nodes enables joint processing as an eight-channel EEG. Using a newly recorded dataset acquired with this setup, we evaluate correlation-based stimulus decoding and assess the effects of miniaturization and galvanic isolation between WESN nodes. Main results: Using a standard correlation-based stimulus decoding approach, an average sAAD accuracy of 69.24% is achieved on 60s decision windows, comparable to wired around-ear EEG systems that measure long-distance scalp potentials. Hidden Markov model-based post-processing further improves performance to a steady-state accuracy of 77.17% with an average attention switch detection time of 32.79s. Combining sensor nodes at both ears outperforms single-ear configurations, primarily through increased robustness via redundancy rather than by exploiting complementary spatial information. Finally, we show that a fixed bipolar configuration using four electrodes per ear, yielding three channels, suffices to maintain performance. Significance: These results demonstrate the practical feasibility of sAAD using a fully wireless, galvanically isolated around-ear WESN. By establishing a realistic performance benchmark under practical hardware constrains, this work represents a considerate step towards deployable neuro-steered hearing devices.

">Control of Male Mouse Copulatory Behavior by Midbrain Dopamine Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Ejaculation in male mice and humans requires intravaginal thrusting movements following penile intromission, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we used fiber photometry to record real-time activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of male mice during copulation across six sexual interactions, in order to investigate how these dynamics change with experience and to examine their functional significance. Contrary to expectations, phasic VTA DA activity remained stable across sessions, showing time-locked responses to mounts, penile intromission, individual thrusts, and ejaculation, indicating experience-independent neural representations of all copulatory events. Notably, thrusting-related activity sharply declined just before ejaculation. Optogenetic inhibition of DA neurons disrupted thrusting behavior, but did not block ejaculation, suggesting DA signaling is critical for sustaining copulatory actions rather than triggering ejaculation itself. While prevailing theories frame VTA DA activity as primarily experience-dependent or centered on reward prediction, we here highlight its role in behavioral persistence during copulation. More broadly, our findings extend understanding of DA function beyond classical reward paradigms to the regulation of innate complex, goal-directed behaviors.

">In transected nerves, distal repair Schwann cells are required at the injury site to direct and accelerate axonal regrowth</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrate peripheral nerves, damaged axons can regrow after injury, but the outcomes of regeneration are variable and often incomplete. Schwann cells in injured nerves are important for repair, but their actions at different positions and stages of nerve repair are not well understood. We have investigated the roles of Schwann cells in a larval zebrafish nerve injury model, in which nerves are visible in living animals during development, the initial injury response, and regrowth of the transected axons. After mechanical injury, distal Schwann cells adopt a repair phenotype characterized by changes in marker expression, elongation, and ability to guide axons across the injury site. In contrast, proximal Schwann cells are not sufficient to guide axons across the injury site, and they associate with axons that regrow along aberrant paths. In erbb2 mutants lacking Schwann cells, developmental axon growth is normal, but after transection, axonal regrowth is greatly slowed and often misdirected. By examining animals with nerves partially populated by Schwann cells, we find that axons can regrow through regions devoid of Schwann cells, provided that at least one distal Schwann cell is at the injury site. Timelapse imaging reveals that distal Schwann cells extend processes toward the injury site, which contact and guide axons regrowing from the proximal nerve stump. In irf8 mutants lacking macrophages, debris from transected axons is cleared on schedule, and axonal regrowth is normal. Our studies demonstrate that Schwann cells immediately distal to the injury site have a unique and essential role in axonal regrowth.

">Giant spider neurons uncover a myelin-derived waste-internalizing canal system that fails in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The underlying causes for Alzheimer disease are presumed to lie in failed waste removal from the brain. However, the mechanisms by which waste is cleared from neurons, and how this system fails in neurodegeneration are poorly understood. A novel 'glial-canal-hypothesis' postulates that myelin-forming macroglia give rise to waste internalizing canals that project into neuronal somata and remove cellular debris in an aquaporin4-dependent manner. We postulate that abnormal swelling of the aquaporin4-expressing glial cells leads to spongiform abnormalities, gradual depletion, and death of associated neurons. Due to the novelty of this postulation little is known about the cellular architecture of this canal system that was first discovered in giant neurons of the wandering spider Cupiennius salei. Here we have utilized histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical methods to describe the structural foundation of this glial canal system in giant spider neurons in which waste-internalizing canals and associated structures are clearly visible. Sequencing the spider genome, we show compelling homologies of key proteins that are implicated in neurodegeneration between phylogenetically distant species. Based on this work, we provide a testable functional hypothesis regarding waste removal from neuronal somata and how this system fails in neurodegeneration. We highlight structural similarities of this system in rodent and human brain. Supported by the findings presented here we postulate that (i) neurodegeneration in C. salei may be caused by hypertrophic swelling of myelin-forming waste-internalizing macroglia, and (ii) that a similar canal system, although structurally modified, is likely highly conserved in the mammalian brain.

">Opposing Network Patterns of Integration-Segregation in Psychedelic and Sedated States of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the relationship of conscious states to large-scale brain dynamics remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Here, diverse pharmacological and physiological perturbations, including psychedelic states, sleep, and propofol sedation, were used to examine integration-segregation organization of brain networks across altered states of consciousness in humans using functional MRI. Across analyses, psychedelic and sedative states exhibited a robust "mirror-image" pattern of integration and segregation. Psychedelics were characterized by increased large-scale integration and reduced segregation of brain network interactions, whereas sleep and propofol sedation showed the opposite configuration. These opposing integration-segregation patterns were consistently indexed by complementary measures of functional connectivity, network topology, and interaction complexity, capturing non-redundant dimensions of large-scale brain organization. Importantly, this mirror-image organization generalized across multiple spatial levels and reliably differentiated conscious states in an unbiased, data-driven manner. Together, these findings demonstrate that psychedelic and sedated states are characterized by systematic and opposing shifts in large-scale integration and segregation, with implications for mechanisms of consciousness.

">A Large-Scale Computer-Vision Mapping of the Geometric Structures of Stroboscopically-Induced Visual Hallucinations</a></h4>

              
                Visual hallucinations (VHs) occur across psychedelic states and diverse psychiatric and neurological conditions, yet their phenomenology remains difficult to characterise. Empirical research on VHs is hindered by the lack of large-scale phenomenological datasets, which limits both mechanistic accounts and the systematic characterisation of when and how they arise. Stroboscopic light stimulation (SLS) viewed with closed eyes provides a reliable, non-pharmacological method of inducing VHs in healthy populations. These hallucinations typically consist of vivid colours and dynamic geometric patterns that resemble simple VHs described in both psychedelic and clinical contexts, suggesting partially overlapping neural mechanisms. We developed and applied an unsupervised computer-vision pipeline to analyse a large dataset of 10,598 drawings made following exposure to hallucination-inducing SLS. These drawings were produced by attendees of Dreamachine, a large-scale public installation designed to elicit stroboscopically induced visual hallucinations (SIVHs). We extracted feature embeddings with a self-supervised deep vision transformer, then applied dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to identify recurrent visual motifs in a data-driven manner. The majority of drawings contained geometric forms, consistent with prior observations of simple VHs under SLS. However, we also identified novel and underreported geometric formations, such as concentric squares, crosses, hyperbolic patterns, and other geometries. Our results show how an unsupervised computer-vision pipeline can organise large, openly shared phenomenological datasets into interpretable classes. By mapping the diversity of simple geometric VHs at scale, this work places new constraints on existing theoretical accounts and motivates targeted experimental work linking SLS parameters, neural dynamics, and geometric visual hallucinations.
