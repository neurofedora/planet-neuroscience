<p>by Marie Levakova, Lubomir Kostal, Christelle Monsemp√®s, Vincent Jacob, Philippe Lucas</p>

The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that sensory neurons adjust their coding resources to optimally represent the stimulus statistics of their environment. To test this prediction in the moth olfactory system, we have developed a stimulation protocol that mimics the natural temporal structure within a turbulent pheromone plume. We report that responses of antennal olfactory receptor neurons to pheromone encounters follow the temporal fluctuations in such a way that the most frequent stimulus timescales are encoded with maximum accuracy. We also observe that the average coding precision of the neurons adjusted to the stimulus-timescale statistics at a given distance from the pheromone source is higher than if the same encoding model is applied at a shorter, non-matching, distance. Finally, the coding accuracy profile and the stimulus-timescale distribution are related in the manner predicted by the information theory for the many-to-one convergence scenario of the moth peripheral sensory system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3ETnhHC120" width="1" />

<p>by William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma</p>

Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite of Bayesian inference. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in a non-Bayesian way. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1ezyXe_qUo" width="1" />

<p>by Erik M. Volz, Igor Siveroni</p>

Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package <i>PhyDyn</i> for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwoD24QGeY" width="1" />

<p>by Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Functional protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sTP41XDQ1ZA" width="1" />

A wide range of mutations in the kinesin motor Kif5A have been linked to a neuronal disorder called hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The position of these mutations can vary, and a range of different motile behaviors have been observed, indicating that the HSP mutants can alter distinct aspects of kinesin...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/UQA5xtPVVJ4" width="1" />

<p>The wiring diagram of the mouse brain has recently been mapped at a
mesoscopic scale in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. Axonal
projections from brain regions were traced using green fluoresent proteins. The
resulting data were registered to a common three-dimensional reference space.
They yielded a matrix of connection strengths between 213 brain regions. Global
features such as closed loops formed by connections of similar intensity can be
inferred using tools from persistent homology. We map the wiring diagram of the
mouse brain to a simplicial complex (filtered by connection strengths). We work
out generators of the first homology group. Some regions, including nucleus
accumbens, are connected to the entire brain by loops, whereas no region has
non-zero connection strength to all brain regions. Thousands of loops go
through the isocortex, the striatum and the thalamus. On the other hand,
medulla is the only major brain compartment that contains more than 100 loops.

<p>Evidence suggests Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) is
an early predictor of Parkinson's disease. This study proposes a
fully-automated framework for RBD detection consisting of automated sleep
staging followed by RBD identification. Analysis was assessed using a limited
polysomnography montage from 53 participants with RBD and 53 age-matched
healthy controls. Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest
(RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels. For RBD detection, a
RF classifier was trained combining established techniques to quantify muscle
atonia with additional features that incorporate sleep architecture and the EMG
fractal exponent. Automated multi-state sleep staging achieved a 0.62 Cohen's
Kappa score. RBD detection accuracy improved by 10% to 96% (compared to
individual established metrics) when using manually annotated sleep staging.
Accuracy remained high (92%) when using automated sleep staging. This study
outperforms established metrics and demonstrates that incorporating sleep
architecture and sleep stage transitions can benefit RBD detection. This study
also achieved automated sleep staging with a level of accuracy comparable to
manual annotation. This study validates a tractable, fully-automated, and
sensitive pipeline for RBD identification that could be translated to wearable
take-home technology.

<p>The ubiquity of topographic maps in the brain has long been known, and
molecular mechanisms for the formation of topographic organization of neural
systems have been revealed. Less attention has been given to the question of
why are the maps topographical and why so ubiquitous. In this study, I explore
the implications of the topographic maps for brain function, by employing the
mathematical framework of the Zeeman topology. I propose the notion about the
meaning of topographic order as generic mechanisms for the representation and
analysis of causal structure, implemented by the neural systems. This leads to
a much improved understanding of the division of labour between chemical
systems and neural systems in the formation of maps to deal with causality.

<p>Identifying community structure of a complex network provides insight to the
interdependence between the network topology and emergent collective behaviors
of networks, while detecting such invariant communities in a time-varying
network is more challenging. In this paper, we define the temporal stable
community and newly propose the concept of dynamic modularity to evaluate the
stable community structures in time-varying networks, which is robust against
small changes as verified by several empirical time-varying network datasets.
Besides, using the volatility features of temporal stable communities in
functional brain networks, we successfully differentiate the ADHD (Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) patients and healthy controls efficiently.

<p>Convergent thought is defined and measured in terms of the ability to perform
on tasks where there is a single correct solution, and divergent thought is
defined and measured in terms of the ability to generate multiple different
solutions. However, this characterization of them presents inconsistencies, and
despite that they are promoted as key constructs of creativity, they do not
capture the capacity to reiteratively modify an idea in light of new
perspectives arising out of an overarching conceptual framework. Research on
formal models of concepts and their interactions suggests that different
creative outputs may be projections of the same underlying idea at different
phases of this kind of 'honing' process. This leads us to redefine convergent
thought as thought in which the relevant concepts are considered from
conventional contexts, and divergent thought as thought in which they are
considered from unconventional contexts. Implications for the assessment of
creativity are discussed.

<p>Biomarkers of Major Depressive Disorder(MDD), its phases and forms have long
been sought. Research indicates that the complexity measures of the cortical
electrical activity (EEG) might be candidates for this role. To examine whether
the complexity of EEG activity, measured by Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and
sample entropy (SampEn), differs between healthy subjects, patients in
remission and episode phase of the recurrent depression and whether the changes
are differentially distributed between hemispheres and cortical regions.
Resting state EEG with eyes closed was recorded from 26 patients suffering from
recurrent depression and 20 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects.
Artefact-free EEG epochs were analyzed by in-house developed programs running
HFD and SampEn algorithms. Depressed patients had higher HFD and SampEn
complexity compared to healthy subjects. Surprisingly, the complexity was even
higher in patients who were in remission than in those in the episode. Altered
complexity was present in the frontal and centro-parietal regions when compared
to the control group. The complexity in frontal and parietal regions differed
between the two phases of depressive disorder. SampEn manifested higher
sensitivity than HFD in some cortical areas. Complexity measures of EEG
distinguish between the three groups. Further studies are needed to establish
whether these measures carry the potential to aid clinically relevant decisions
about depression.

<p>A novel non-stationarity visualization tool known as StationPlot is developed
for deciphering the chaotic behavior of a dynamical time series. A family of
analytic measures enumerating geometrical aspects of the non-stationarity &amp;
degree of variability is formulated by convex hull geometry (CHG) on
StationPlot. In the Euclidean space, both trend-stationary (TS) &amp;
difference-stationary (DS) perturbations are comprehended by the asymmetric
structure of StationPlot's region of interest (ROI). The proposed method is
experimentally validated using EEG signals, where it comprehend the relative
temporal evolution of neural dynamics &amp; its non-stationary morphology, thereby
exemplifying its diagnostic competence for seizure activity (SA) detection.
Experimental results &amp; analysis-of-Variance (ANOVA) on the extracted CHG
features demonstrates better classification performances as compared to the
existing shallow feature based state-of-the-art &amp; validates its efficacy as
geometry-rich discriminative descriptors for signal processing applications.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41426">Translesion polymerase kappa-dependent DNA synthesis underlies replication fork recovery</a></h4>

DNA replication stress is often defined by the slowing or stalling of replication fork progression leading to local or global DNA synthesis inhibition. Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute towards cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40385">Molecular mechanisms that stabilize short term synaptic plasticity during presynaptic homeostatic plasticity</a></h4>

Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) compensates for impaired postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function through a rapid, persistent adjustment of neurotransmitter release, an effect that can exceed 200%. An unexplained property of PHP is the preservation of short-term plasticity (STP), thereby stabilizing activity-dependent synaptic information transfer. We demonstrate that the dramatic potentiation of presynaptic release during PHP is achieved while simultaneously maintaining a constant ratio of primed to super-primed synaptic vesicles, thereby preserving STP. Mechanistically, genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological evidence argue that a constant ratio of primed to super-primed synaptic vesicles is achieved by the concerted action of three proteins: Unc18, Syntaxin1A and RIM. Our data support a model based on the regulated availability of Unc18 at the presynaptic active zone, a process that is restrained by Syntaxin1A and facilitated by RIM. As such, regulated vesicle priming/super-priming enables PHP to stabilize both synaptic gain and the activity-dependent transfer of information at a synapse.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40262">Oxytocin-mediated social enrichment promotes longer telomeres and novelty seeking</a></h4>

The quality of social relationships is a powerful determinant of lifetime health. Here, we explored the impact of social experiences on circulating oxytocin (OT) concentration, telomere length (TL) and novelty-seeking behaviour in male and female rats. Prolonged social housing raised circulating OT levels in both sexes while elongating TL only in females. Novelty-seeking behaviour in females was more responsive to social housing and increased OT levels than males. The OT antagonist (OT ANT) L-366,509 blocked the benefits of social housing in all conditions along with female-specific TL erosion and novelty-seeking deficit. Thus, females seem more susceptible than males to genetic and behavioural changes when the secretion of endogenous OT in response to social life is interrupted. Social enrichment may therefore provide a therapeutic avenue to promote stress resiliency and chances of healthy aging across generations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39030">Targeting MYC dependency in ovarian cancer through inhibition of CDK7 and CDK12/13</a></h4>

High-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by extensive copy number alterations, among which the amplification of <i>MYC</i> oncogene occurs in nearly half of tumors. We demonstrate that ovarian cancer cells highly depend on MYC for maintaining their oncogenic growth, indicating MYC as a therapeutic target for this difficult-to-treat malignancy. However, targeting MYC directly has proven difficult. We screen small molecules targeting transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, and find that THZ1 - a chemical inhibiting CDK7, CDK12, and CDK13 - markedly downregulates MYC. Notably, abolishing MYC expression cannot be achieved by targeting CDK7 alone, but require the combined inhibition of CDK7, CDK12, and CDK13. In 11 patient derived xenografts models derived from heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients, administration of THZ1 induces significant tumor growth inhibition with concurrent abrogation of MYC expression. Our study indicates that targeting these transcriptional CDKs with agents such as THZ1 may be an effective approach for MYC-dependent ovarian malignancies.

XMAP215/Stu2/Alp14 proteins accelerate microtubule plus-end polymerization by recruiting tubulins via arrays of Tumor Overexpressed Gene (TOG) domains, yet their mechanism remains unknown. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural basis for TOG arrays in recruiting and polymerizing tubulins. Alp14 binds four tubulins via dimeric TOG1-TOG2 subunits, in which each domain exhibits a distinct exchange rate for tubulin. X-ray structures revealed square-shaped assemblies composed of pseudo-dimeric TOG1-TOG2 subunits assembled head-to-tail, positioning four unpolymerized tubulins in a polarized wheel-like configuration. Crosslinking and electron microscopy show Alp14-tubulin forms square assemblies in solution, and inactivating their interfaces destabilize this organization without influencing tubulin binding. An X-ray structure determined using approach to modulate tubulin polymerization revealed an unfurled assembly, in which TOG1-TOG2 uniquely bind to two polymerized tubulins. Our findings suggest a new microtubule polymerase model in which TOG arrays recruit tubulins by forming square assemblies that then unfurl, facilitating their concerted polymerization into protofilaments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38865">Rescue of cognitive function following fractionated brain irradiation in a novel preclinical glioma model</a></h4>

More than half of long-term brain tumor survivors develop irreversible cognitive decline that severely affect their quality of life. However, there is no pre-clinical model that allows long-term assessment of cognition, and there is no treatment which ameliorates cognitive deficits in patients. Here, we report a novel glioma mouse model that offers manageable tumor growth and reliable assessment of cognitive functions in a post-treatment manner. Using this model, we found that fractionated whole-brain irradiation (fWBI), but not tumor growth, results in memory deficits. Transient inhibition of CSF-1R during fWBI prolongs survival of glioma-bearing mice and fully prevents fWBI-induced memory deficits. This result suggests that CSF-1R inhibition during radiotherapy can be explored as an approach to improve both survival and cognitive outcomes in patients who will receive fWBI. Taken together, the current study provides a proof of concept of a powerful tool to study radiation-induced cognitive deficits in glioma-bearing animals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38818">Dopamine neurons drive fear extinction learning by signaling the omission of expected aversive outcomes</a></h4>

Extinction of fear responses is critical for adaptive behavior and deficits in this form of safety learning are hallmark of anxiety disorders. However, the neuronal mechanisms that initiate extinction learning are largely unknown. Here we show, using single-unit electrophysiology and cell-type specific fiber photometry, that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are activated by the omission of the aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear extinction. This dopamine signal occurred specifically during the beginning of extinction when the US omission is unexpected, and correlated strongly with extinction learning. Furthermore, temporally-specific optogenetic inhibition or excitation of dopamine neurons at the time of the US omission revealed that this dopamine signal is both necessary for, and sufficient to accelerate, normal fear extinction learning. These results identify a prediction error-like neuronal signal that is necessary to initiate fear extinction and reveal a crucial role of DA neurons in this form of safety learning.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38493">Comment on 'Orthogonal lipid sensors identify transbilayer asymmetry of plasma membrane cholesterol'</a></h4>

The plasma membrane in mammalian cells is rich in cholesterol. How cholesterol partitions between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane remains a matter of debate. Recently, Liu et al used domain 4 (D4) of perfringolysin O as a cholesterol sensor to argue that cholesterol is mostly in the exofacial leaflet (<i>Liu et al.</i>, 2017). This conclusion was made by interpreting D4 binding in live cells using <i>in vitro</i> calibrations with liposomes. However, liposomes may be unfaithful in mimicking the plasma membrane, as we demonstrate here. Also, D4 binding is highly sensitive to the presence of cytosolic proteins. In addition, we find that a D4 variant, that requires &gt;35 mol% cholesterol to bind to liposomes <i>in vitro,</i> does in fact bind to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Thus, we believe, based on the current evidence, that it is unlikely that there is a significantly higher proportion of cholesterol in the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane compared to the cytosolic leaflet.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37385">Meta-analysis challenges a textbook example of status signalling and demonstrates publication bias</a></h4>

The status signalling hypothesis aims to explain within-species variation in ornamentation by suggesting that some ornaments signal dominance status. Here, we use multilevel meta-analytic models to challenge the textbook example of this hypothesis, the black bib of male house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>). We conducted a systematic review, and obtained primary data from published and unpublished studies to test whether dominance rank is positively associated with bib size across studies. Contrary to previous studies, the overall effect size (i.e. meta-analytic mean) was small and uncertain. Furthermore, we found several biases in the literature that further question the support available for the status signalling hypothesis. We discuss several explanations including pleiotropic, population- and context-dependent effects. Our findings call for reconsidering this established textbook example in evolutionary and behavioural ecology, and should stimulate renewed interest in understanding within-species variation in ornamental traits.

All synapses require fusion-competent vesicles and coordinated Ca2+-secretion coupling for neurotransmission, yet functional and anatomical properties show a high diversity across different synapse types. We show here that the presynaptic protein RIM-BP2 has diversified functions in neurotransmitter release at different central mammalian synapses and thus contributes to synaptic diversity. At hippocampal pyramidal CA3-CA1 synapses, RIM-BP2 loss has a mild effect on neurotransmitter release, by only regulating Ca2+-secretion coupling. However, at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses RIM-BP2 has a strong impact on neurotransmitter release by promoting vesicle docking/priming via recruitment of Munc13-1. In wild type mossy fiber synapses, the distance between RIM-BP2 clusters and Munc13-1 clusters is larger than in hippocampal pyramidal CA3-CA1 synapses, suggesting that spatial organization may dictate the role a protein plays in synaptic transmission and that differences in active zone architecture is a major determinant factor in the functional diversity of synapses.

Autistic people exhibit enhanced abilities to find and extract visual or auditory figures out of a meaningful whole (disembedding). Studies have shown heightened autistic traits in professional musicians with absolute pitch (AP). This study investigates whether such musicians show an advantage in an interleaved melody recognition task (IMRT). A total of N=59 professional musicians (AP=27) participated in the study. In each trial a probe melody was followed by an interleaved sequence. Subjects had to indicate as to whether the probe melody was present in the interleaved sequence. Sensitivity index d' and response bias c were calculated according to signal detection theory. Additionally, a pitch adjustment test measuring fine-graded differences in absolute pitch proficiency, the Autism-Spectrum-Quotient and a visual embedded figures test were conducted. AP performance was enhanced overall compared to RP. Absolute pitch proficiency, visual disembedding ability and musicality predicted approximately 39.2 % of variance in the interleaved melody recognition test. No correlations were found between IMRT and autistic traits. The stable pitch-label associations of AP might serve as additional sensory cues during pre-attentive processing in recognizing interleaved melodies. Results are in line with a detailed-oriented cognitive style and enhanced perceptional functioning of AP musicians similar to that observed in autism.

<p>by Laura Anton-Sanchez, Felix Effenberger, Concha Bielza, Pedro Larra√±aga, Hermann Cuntz</p>

Neurons collect their inputs from other neurons by sending out arborized dendritic structures. However, the relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs in the neural tissue remains unclear. Inputs could be distributed in tight clusters, entirely randomly or else in a regular grid-like manner. Here, we analyze dendritic branching structures using a regularity index <i>R</i>, based on average nearest neighbor distances between branch and termination points, characterizing their spatial distribution. We find that the distributions of these points depend strongly on cell types, indicating possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization. Moreover, <i>R</i> is independent of cell size and we find that it is only weakly correlated with other branching statistics, suggesting that it might reflect features of dendritic morphology that are not captured by commonly studied branching statistics. We then use morphological models based on optimal wiring principles to study the relation between input distributions and dendritic branching structures. Using our models, we find that branch point distributions correlate more closely with the input distributions while termination points in dendrites are generally spread out more randomly with a close to uniform distribution. We validate these model predictions with connectome data. Finally, we find that in spatial input distributions with increasing regularity, characteristic scaling relationships between branching features are altered significantly. In summary, we conclude that local statistics of input distributions and dendrite morphology depend on each other leading to potentially cell type specific branching features.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ori6Lo6m244" width="1" />

<p>by James A. Henderson, Pulin Gong</p>

Diverse plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying brain functions. However, why these plasticity rules emerge and how their dynamics interact with neural activity to give rise to complex neural circuit dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we show that both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity rules emerge from a functional perspective of neuronal dynamics whereby each neuron learns to encode its own activity in the population activity, so that the activity of the presynaptic neuron can be decoded from the activity of its postsynaptic neurons. We explain how a range of experimentally observed plasticity phenomena with widely separated time scales emerge from learning this encoding function, including STDP and its frequency dependence, and metaplasticity. We show that when implemented in neural circuits, these plasticity rules naturally give rise to essential neural response properties, including variable neural dynamics with balanced excitation and inhibition, and approximately log-normal distributions of synaptic strengths, while simultaneously encoding a complex real-world visual stimulus. These findings establish a novel function-based account of diverse plasticity mechanisms, providing a unifying framework relating plasticity, dynamics and neural computation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4hnBgLInEwc" width="1" />

<p>by Stefano Giaimo, Jordi Arranz, Arne Traulsen</p>

Population structure can strongly affect evolutionary dynamics. The most general way to describe population structures are graphs. An important observable on evolutionary graphs is the probability that a novel mutation spreads through the entire population. But what drives this spread of a mutation towards fixation? Here, we propose a novel way to understand the forces driving fixation by borrowing techniques from evolutionary demography to quantify the invasion fitness and the effective population size for different graphs. Our method is very general and even applies to weighted graphs with node dependent fitness. However, we focus on analytical results for undirected graphs with node independent fitness. The method will allow to conceptually integrate evolutionary graph theory with theoretical genetics of structured populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uezjpMD9TOY" width="1" />

Despite advances in experimental techniques and accumulation of large datasets concerning the composition and properties of the cortex, quantitative modeling of cortical circuits under in-vivo-like conditions remains challenging. Here we report and publicly release a biophysically detailed circuit model of layer 4 in the mouse primary visual cortex, receiving thalamo-cortical visual inputs. The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hU_7d7E5u8Y" width="1" />

<p>by Jason E. Pina, Mark Bodner, Bard Ermentrout</p>

Neural oscillations have been recorded and implicated in many different basic brain and cognitive processes. For example, oscillatory neural activity has been suggested to play a role in binding and in the maintenance of information in working memory. With respect to the latter, the majority of work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a ‚Äúcode‚Äù in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role by enabling or facilitating essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory and the processes it supports, such as combining items in memory into bound objects or separating bound objects into distinct items. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics that arise may play critical roles in providing mechanisms for working memory and the cognitive functions that it supports. Specifically, these roles include (1) enabling a range of different types of binding, (2) both enabling and limiting capacities of bound and distinct items held active in working memory, and (3) facilitating transitions between active working memory states as required in cognitive function. Several key results arise within the examinations, such as the occurrence of different network capacities for working memory and binding, differences in processing times for transitions in working memory states, and the emergence of a combinatorially rich and complex range of oscillatory states that are sufficient to map onto a wide range of cognitive operations supported by working memory, such as variable binding, reasoning, and language. In particular, we show that these oscillatory states and their transitions can provide a specific instantiation of current established connectionist models in representing these functions. Finally, we further characterize the dependence of the relevant oscillatory solutions on certain critical parameters, including mutual inhibition and synaptic timescales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n2vXpNJbJkw" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Neural stem cells hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration, however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells. Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large neural stem cell pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four week post-grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to neural stem cells or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neural stem cells hold great promise for neural repair, but conventional cell-based transplant methods face the hurdles of poor graft survival and inadequate neural differentiation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eligible patients who were randomized to the Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‚Äê2) trial (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‚ÄêmmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&lt;120 mmHg, 120‚Äê130, 130‚Äê140, 140‚Äê150 and ‚â•150) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‚Äêday modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4‚Äê6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ‚â•6 mL from baseline to 24‚Äêhour computed tomography; and cardio‚Äêrenal adverse events within 7 days.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‚Äê2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4‚Äê6 was 37.5%, 36.0%, 42.8%, 38.6%, and 38.0%, respectively. For the ‚Äò140‚Äê150‚Äô group relative to the ‚Äò120‚Äê130‚Äô, the odds ratio, adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‚Äêto‚Äêrandomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.02‚Äê2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9%, 13.7%, 21.4%, 18.5%, and 26.4%, respectively. The ‚Äò140‚Äê150‚Äô (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.05‚Äê3.09) and ‚Äò‚â•150‚Äô (1.98, 1.12‚Äê3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than ‚Äò120‚Äê130‚Äô group. Cardio‚Äêrenal events occurred in 13.6%, 16.6%, 11.5%, 8.1%, and 8.2%, respectively. The ‚Äò140‚Äê150‚Äô (0.43, 0.19‚Äê0.88) and ‚Äò‚â•150‚Äô (0.44, 0.18‚Äê0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the ‚Äò120‚Äê130‚Äô.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120‚Äê130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardio‚Äêrenal complications.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The degree to which Alzheimer's versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and eight other neuropathologies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n=1,161) came from two clinical‚Äêpathologic studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of eight neuropathologic indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Further, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re‚Äêestimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathologic indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. 210 (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathologic AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to TDP‚Äê43, 8.1% to CAA, 6.0% to atherosclerosis and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all eight indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all eight neuropathologic indices combined.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pathologic AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age‚Äêrelated neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lay outside the thalamus.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41412">Subunit exchange enhances information retention by CaMKII in dendritic spines</a></h4>

Molecular bistables are strong candidates for long-term information storage, for example, in synaptic plasticity. Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) is a highly expressed synaptic protein which has been proposed to form a molecular bistable switch capable of maintaining its state for years despite protein turnover and stochastic noise. It has recently been shown that CaMKII holoenzymes exchange subunits among themselves. Here we used computational methods to analyze the effect of subunit exchange on the CaMKII pathway in the presence of diffusion in two different micro-environments, the post synaptic density (PSD) and spine cytosol. We show that CaMKII exhibits multiple timescales of activity due to subunit exchange. Further, subunit exchange enhances information retention by CaMKII both by improving the stability of its switching in the PSD, and by slowing the decay of its activity in the spine cytosol. The existence of diverse timescales in the synapse has important theoretical implications for memory storage in networks.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40214">Global warming reduces leaf-out and flowering synchrony among individuals</a></h4>

The temporal overlap of phenological stages, phenological synchrony, crucially influences ecosystem functioning. For flowering, among-individual synchrony influences gene flow. For leaf-out, it affects interactions with herbivores and competing plants. If individuals differ in their reaction to the ongoing change in global climate, this should affect population-level synchrony. Here, we use climate-manipulation experiments, Pan-European long-term (&gt;15 years) observations, and common garden monitoring data on up to 72 woody and herbaceous species to study the effects of increasing temperatures on the extent of leaf-out and flowering synchrony within populations. Warmer temperatures reduce in situ leaf-out and flowering synchrony by up to 55%, and experiments on European beech provide a mechanism for how individual differences in day-length and/or chilling sensitivity may explain this finding. The rapid loss of reproductive and vegetative synchrony in European plants predicts changes in their gene flow and trophic interactions, but community-wide consequences remain largely unknown.

Amyloid-Œ≤ peptide (AŒ≤) forms plaques in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and is responsible for early cognitive deficits in AD patients. Advancing cognitive decline is accompanied by progressive impairment of cognition-relevant EEG patterns such as gamma oscillations. The endocannabinoid anandamide, a TrpV1-receptor agonist, reverses hippocampal damage and memory impairment in rodents and protects neurons from AŒ≤-induced cytotoxic effects. Here we investigate a restorative role of TrpV1-receptor activation against AŒ≤-induced degradation of hippocampal neuron function and gamma oscillations. We found that the TrpV1-receptor agonist capsaicin rescues AŒ≤-induced degradation of hippocampal gamma oscillations by reversing both the desynchronization of AP firing in CA3 pyramidal cells and the shift in excitatory/inhibitory current balance. This rescue effect is TrpV1-receptor-dependent since it was absent in TrpV1 knockout mice or in the presence of the TrpV1-receptor antagonist capsazepine. Our findings provide novel insight into the network mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in AD and suggest TrpV1 activation as a novel therapeutic target.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/31599">Cerebellar learning using perturbations</a></h4>

The cerebellum aids the learning of fast, coordinated movements. According to current consensus, erroneously active parallel fibre synapses are depressed by complex spikes signalling movement errors. However, this theory cannot solve the <i>credit assignment problem</i> of processing a global movement evaluation into multiple cell-specific error signals. We identify a possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create eligibility traces and signal error changes guiding plasticity. Error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, <i>stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors</i> (SGDEGE), predicts synaptic plasticity rules that apparently contradict the current consensus but were supported by plasticity experiments in slices from mice under conditions designed to be physiological, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to experimental conditions. We analyse the algorithm‚Äôs convergence and capacity. Finally, we suggest SGDEGE may also operate in the basal ganglia.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused ‚Äúvisual‚Äù cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Akinesia, a cardinal symptom of Parkinson‚Äôs disease, has been linked to abnormal activation in putamen and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). However, little is known whether clinical severity of akinesia is linked to dysfunctional connectivity of these regions. Using a seed-based approach, we here investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of putamen, pMFC and primary motor cortex (M1) in 60 patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease on regular medication and 72 healthy controls. We found that in patients putamen featured decreases of connectivity for a number of cortical and subcortical areas engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In contrast, the pMFC showed reduced connectivity with a more focal cortical network involved in higher-level motor-cognition. Finally, M1 featured a selective disruption of connectivity in a network specifically connected with M1. Correlating clinical impairment with connectivity changes revealed a relationship between akinesia and reduced RSFC between pMFC and left intraparietal lobule (IPL). Together, the present study demonstrated RSFC decreases in networks for motor initiation and execution in Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Moreover, results suggest a relationship between pMFC-IPL decoupling and the manifestation of akinetic symptoms.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The first voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed in 282 patients with major depressive disorder compared with 254 controls, some higher, and some lower FCs. However, in 125 unmedicated patients, primarily increases of FC were found: of the subcallosal anterior cingulate with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, of the pregenual/supracallosal anterior cingulate with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and of parts of the anterior cingulate with the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and with early cortical visual areas. In the 157 medicated patients, these and other FCs were lower than in the unmedicated group. Parcellation was performed based on the FC of individual ACC voxels in healthy controls. A pregenual subdivision had high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and a supracallosal subdivision had high FC with lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The high FC in depression between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal parts of the ACC provides a mechanism for more non-reward information transmission to the ACC, contributing to depression. The high FC between the medial orbitofrontal cortex and supracallosal ACC in depression may also contribute to depressive symptoms.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/469221v1?rss=1">Activation of rod input in a in a model of retinal degeneration reverses retinal remodeling and induces formation of normal synapses, circuitry and visual signaling in the adult retina</a></h4>

A major cause of human blindness is the death of rod photoreceptors. As rods degenerate, synaptic structures between rod and rod bipolar cells dissolve and the rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites and occasionally make aberrant contacts. Such changes are broadly observed in blinding disorders caused by photoreceptor cell death and is thought to occur in response to deafferentation. How the remodeled retinal circuit affect visual processing following rod rescue is not known. To address this question, we generated transgenic mice wherein a disrupted cGMP-gated channel (CNG) gene can be repaired at the endogenous locus and at different stages of degeneration by tamoxifen-inducible cre-mediated recombination. In normal rods, light-induced closure of CNG channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell, reducing neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Similarly, rods lacking CNG channel exhibit a resting membrane potential that was ~10mV hyperpolarized compared to WT rods, indicating diminished glutamate release. Retinas from these mice undergo stereotypic retinal remodeling as a consequence of rod malfunction and degeneration. Upon tamoxifen-induced expression of CNG channels, rods recovered their structure and exhibited normal light responses. Moreover, we show that the adult mouse retina displays a surprising degree of plasticity upon activation of rod input. Wayward bipolar cell dendrites establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity extending beyond the developmental period and support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod degeneration.

The modulation of cortex by acetylcholine (ACh) is typically thought to originate from long-range projections arising in the basal forebrain. However, a subset of VIP interneurons express ChAT, the synthetic enzyme for ACh, and are a potential local source of cortical ACh. Which neurotransmitters these VIP/ChAT interneurons (VCINs) release is unclear, and which post-synaptic cell types these transmitters target is not known. Using quantitative molecular analysis of VCIN pre-synaptic terminals, we show expression of the molecular machinery to release both ACh and GABA, with ACh release restricted to a subset of boutons. A systematic survey of potential post-synaptic cell types shows that VCINs release GABA primarily onto other inhibitory interneuron subtypes, while ACh neurotransmission is notably sparse, with most ACh release onto layer 1 interneurons and other VCINs. Therefore, VCINs are an alternative source of cortical ACh signaling that supplement GABA-mediated disinhibition with highly targeted excitation through ACh.

To determine the effects of reducing CHD8 protein function below haploinsufficient levels on brain development, we established a Chd8 allelic series in the mouse. Chd8 heterozygous mice exhibited relatively subtle brain overgrowth and little gene expression changes in the embryonic neocortex. In comparison, mild Chd8 hypomorphs displayed significant postnatal lethality, with surviving animals exhibiting more pronounced brain hyperplasia, and significantly altered expression of over 2000 genes. Autism-associated genes were downregulated and neural progenitor proliferation genes upregulated. Severe Chd8 hypomorphs displayed even greater transcriptional dysregulation, affecting genes and pathways that largely overlapped with those dysregulated in the mild hypomorphs. By contrast, homozygous, conditional deletion of Chd8 in early neuronal progenitors resulted in the induction of p53 target genes, cell cycle exit, apoptosis and pronounced brain hypoplasia. Intriguingly, increased progenitor proliferation in hypomorphs was primarily restricted to TBR2+ intermediate progenitors, suggesting critical roles for CHD8 in regulating the expansion of this population. Given the importance of these progenitors in human cortical growth, this observation suggests that human brain development might be more sensitive to CHD8 deficiency than the mouse. We conclude that brain development is acutely sensitive to CHD8 dosage and that the varying sensitivities of different progenitor populations and cellular processes to CHD8 dosage can result in non-linear effects on gene transcription and brain growth.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/468751v1?rss=1">Short-term fasting selectively influences impulsivity in healthy individuals</a></h4>

Previous research has shown that short-term fasting in healthy individuals (HIs) is associated with changes in risky decision-making. The current experiment was designed to examine the influence of short-term fasting in HIs on four types of impulsivity: reflection impulsivity, risky decision-making, delay aversion, and action inhibition. HIs were tested twice, once when fasted for 20 hours, and once when satiated. Participants demonstrated impaired action inhibition when fasted; committing significantly more errors of commission during a food-related Affective Shifting Task. Participants also displayed decreased reflection impulsivity when fasted, opening significantly more boxes during the Information Sampling Task (IST). There were no significant differences in performance between fasted and satiated sessions for risky decision-making or delay aversion. These findings may have implications for understanding eating disorders such as Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Although BN has been characterised as a disorder of poor impulse control, inconsistent findings when comparing individuals with BN and HIs on behavioural measures of impulsivity question this characterisation. Since individuals with BN undergo periods of short-term fasting, the inconsistent findings could be due to differences in the levels of satiation of participants. The current results indicate that fasting can selectively influence performance on the IST, a measure of impulsivity previously studied in BN. However, the results from the IST were contrary to the original hypothesis and should be replicated before specific conclusions can be made.

Activation of the muscarinic M1 receptor is a promising approach to improve cognitive deficits associated with cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimers disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and schizophrenia. TAK-071 is an M1-selective positive allosteric modulator that improves cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, with reduced side effects on gastrointestinal function in rats. In this study, we explored changes in quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) power bands, with or without scopolamine challenge, as a non-invasive translational biomarker for the effect of TAK-071 in cynomolgus monkeys. Scopolamine has been reported to increase theta and delta power bands and decrease alpha power band in healthy volunteers. In line with the clinical observations, scopolamine (25?100 g/kg, subcutaneous administration [s.c.]) increased theta and delta power bands in cynomolgus monkeys in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had the opposite effect on alpha power band. The effects of TAK-071 on scopolamine (25 g/kg, s.c.)-induced qEEG spectral changes were examined using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and a muscarinic M1/M4 receptor agonist xanomeline as comparative cholinomimetics. TAK-071 (0.3?3 mg/kg, oral administration [p.o.]), donepezil (3 mg/kg, p.o.), and xanomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) suppressed the scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands. These results suggest that changes in specific qEEG power bands, in particular theta and delta power bands in the context of scopolamine challenge, could be used as translational biomarkers for the evaluation of TAK-071 in clinical studies.

Objective: In a three-wave 6 yrs longitudinal study we investigated if expansion of lateral ventricle (LV) volumes (regarded as a proxy for brain parenchyma loss) predicts performance on a test of response inhibition. Participants and Methods: Anatomical trajectories of left (LH) and right (RH) lateral ventricle volumes across the three study-waves were quantified using the Longitudinal Stream in Freesurfer 5.3 and modelled using a linear mixed-effects (LME) algorithm. All participants (N = 74, mean age 60.7 yrs at inclusion, 48 females) performed the Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT). Response time on the third condition was used as a measure of response inhibition (RI) and divided into three classes (fast, medium and slow). The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used for calculating the relative importance of selected LV volume features from the LME model in predicting RI class. Finally, the two most important extracted features were fed into a 10-fold cross-validation framework, estimating the accuracy, precision and recall of the RI class prediction. Results: Four LME based features were selected to characterize LV volume trajectories: steepness of LV volume change and the LV volume at the time of inclusion, each from the right and left hemisphere. The XGBoost procedure selected the steepness measure from the right and the volume at inclusion from the left hemisphere as the two most important features to predict RI performance. The 10-fold cross validation procedure showed a recall, precision and accuracy score (.40 - .50) that were clearly above chance level. Conclusion: Measures of the LV volume trajectories gave a fairly good prediction of response inhibition performance, confirming the role of LV volume as a biomarker of cognitive function in older adults. Future studies should investigate the value of the lateral ventricle volume trajectories as predictors of cognitive preservation or decline into older age.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/468579v1?rss=1">Healthy ageing reduces the precision of episodic memory retrieval</a></h4>

Episodic memory declines with older age, but it is unresolved whether this decline reflects reduced probability of successfully retrieving information from memory, or decreased precision of the retrieved information. Here, we used continuous measures of episodic memory retrieval in combination with computational modelling of participants' retrieval errors to distinguish between these two potential accounts of age-related memory deficits. In three experiments, young and older participants encoded stimuli displays consisting of everyday objects varying along different perceptual features (e.g., location, colour and orientation) in a circular space. At test, participants recreated the features of studied objects using a continuous response dial. Across all three experiments, we observed age-related declines in the precision of episodic memory retrieval, whereas age differences in retrieval success were limited to the most challenging task condition. Reductions in mnemonic precision were evident for retrieval of both item-based and contextual information, and persisted after controlling for age-related decreases in the fidelity of perception and working memory. The findings highlight impoverished precision of memory representations as one factor contributing to age-related episodic memory loss, and suggest that the cognitive and neural changes associated with older age can differentially affect distinct aspects of episodic retrieval.

Genome-wide significant variants associated with combined risk for major psychiatric disorders on chromosome 10q24 affect the expression of the cytosolic nucleotidase II (NT5C2, cN-II) in population controls, implicating it as a psychiatric susceptibility gene. Risk alleles are associated with reduced expression of this gene in the developing and adult brain, but the resulting neurobiological risk mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we provide further evidence for the association of NT5C2 with psychiatric disorders, and use a functional genetics approach to gain a deeper understanding of the function of this risk gene in the nervous system. NT5C2 expression was significantly reduced in the post-mortem brain of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, and its protein predominately expressed in neurons within the adult brain. Using human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), we found that NT5C2 expression peaked at the neural progenitor state, where the encoded protein was ubiquitously distributed through the cell. NT5C2 knockdown in hNPCs elicited transcriptomic changes associated with protein translation, that were accompanied by regulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) activity. To identify the effect of reduced neuronal NT5C2 expression at a systems level, we knockdown its homologue, CG32549, in Drosophila melanogaster CNS. This elicited impaired climbing behaviour in the model organism. Collectively, our data implicate NT5C2 expression in risk for psychiatric disorders and in Drosophila melanogaster motility, and further suggest that risk is mediated via regulation of AMPK signalling and protein translation during early neurodevelopment.

Does the body play an active role in emotions? Since the original James/Cannon controversy this debate has mainly been fueled by introspective accounts of human experience. Here, we use the animal model to demonstrate a physiological mechanism for bodily feedback and its causal role in the stabilization of emotional states. We report that during fear-related freezing mice breathe at 4Hz and show, using probabilistic modelling, that optogenetic perturbation of this feedback specifically reduces freezing maintenance without impacting its initiation. This rhythm is transmitted by the olfactory bulb to the prefrontal cortex where it organizes neural firing and optogenetic probing of the circuit demonstrates frequency-specific tuning that maximizes prefrontal cortex responsivity at 4Hz, the breathing frequency during freezing. These results point to a brain-body-brain loop in which the initiation of emotional behavior engenders somatic changes which then feedback to the cortex to directly participate in sustaining emotional states.

Positive effects of variable practice conditions on subsequent motor memory consolidation and generalization are widely accepted and described as the contextual interference effect (CIE). However, the general benefits of CIE are low and these benefits might even depend on decreased retest performances in the blocked-practicing control group, caused by retroactive inhibition. The aim of this study was to investigate if CIE represents a true learning phenomenon or possibly reflects confounding effects of retroactive inhibition. We tested 48 healthy human participants adapting their reaching movements to three different force field magnitudes. Subjects practiced the force fields in either a Blocked (B), Random (R), or Constant (C) schedule. In addition, subjects of the Blocked group performed either a retest schedule that did (Blocked-Matched; BM) or did not (Blocked-Unmatched; BU) control for retroactive inhibition. Results showed that retroactive inhibition did not affect the results of the BU group much and that the Random group showed a better consolidation performance compared to both Blocked groups. However, compared to the Constant group, the Random group showed only slight benefits in its memory consolidation of the mean performance across all force field magnitudes. This indicates that CIE reflects a true motor learning phenomenon, which is independent of retroactive inhibition. However, random practice is not always beneficial over constant practice.

Path integration is a vital function in navigation: it enables the continuous tracking of one's position in space by integrating self-motion cues. Path integration abilities vary across individuals but tend to deteriorate in old age. The specific causes of path integration errors, however, remain poorly characterized. Here, we combined tests of path integration performance with a novel analysis based on the Langevin diffusion equation, which allowed us to decompose errors into distinct causes that can corrupt path integration computations. Across age groups, the dominant errors were due to noise and a bias in speed estimation. Noise-driven errors accumulated with travel distance not elapsed time, suggesting that the dominant noise originates in the velocity input rather than within the integrator. Age-related declines were traced primarily to a growth in this unbiased noise. Together, these findings shed light on the contributors to path integration error and the mechanisms underlying age-related navigational deficits.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired motor function and several non-motor symptoms, with no available disease modifying treatment. Intracellular accumulation of pathological -synuclein inclusions is a hallmark of idiopathic PD, whereas, dominant mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with familial PD that is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that an increase in LRRK2 kinase activity is associated with the development of not only familial LRRK2 PD, but also idiopathic PD. Previous reports have shown preclinical effects of LRRK2 modulation on -synuclein-induced neuropathology. Increased subthalamic nucleus (STN) burst firing in preclinical neurotoxin models and PD patients is hypothesized to be causally involved in the development of the motor deficit in PD. To study a potential pathophysiological relationship between -synuclein pathology and LRRK2 kinase activity in PD, we investigated the effect of chronic LRRK2 inhibition in an AAV--synuclein overexpression rat model. In this study, we report that chronic LRRK2 inhibition using PFE-360 partially restores motor function. However, this effect is independent of the aberrant STN burst firing and associated neurodegenerative processes. Nonetheless, our finding recapitulates a potential beneficial effect of LRRK2 inhibition for treatment of PD, possibly driven by mechanisms bypassing the importance of STN firing activity.

Spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity propagates across spatial scales in the mammalian cortex but technical challenges have generally precluded establishing conceptual links between the function of local circuits of neurons and brain-wide network dynamics. To solve this problem, we developed a method for simultaneous cellular-resolution two-photon calcium imaging of a local microcircuit and mesoscopic widefield calcium imaging of the entire cortical mantle in awake, behaving mice. Our method employs an orthogonal axis design whereby the mesoscopic objective is oriented downward directly above the brain and the two-photon objective is oriented horizontally, with imaging performed through a glass right angle microprism implanted in the skull. In support of this method, we introduce a suite of analysis tools for relating the activity of individual cells to distal cortical areas, as well as a viral method for robust and widespread gene delivery in the juvenile mouse brain. We use these methods to characterize the diversity of associations of individual, genetically-defined neurons with cortex-wide network motifs.

Decreased levels of brain dopamine are one of the early characteristics of Parkinson's Disease, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting both cognitive and motor features. To date, the majority of animal models of Parkinson's Disease are based on a selective perturbation of mitochondria, with resulting death of dopaminergic neurons due to oxidative stress. Here we use DAT:Th KO mouse model that causes a selective depletion of striatal dopamine, by inactivation of the tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene in dopamine transporter expressing neurons. We analyzed transcriptome responses in the pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic brain regions of dopamine deficient animals. We find a number of dopaminergic genes differentially expressed in SNc and VTA as function of dopamine. Furthermore, we detected a diversity in responses between SNc and VTA that could reflect a difference in a variability of DA neurons in pathogenesis of PD. Neither Dorsal Striatum, nor Ventral Striatum and Prefrontal Cortex of DAT:Th KO animals shows an overall change in transcriptome. Surprisingly, half of DAT:Th KO animals that show near-normal levels of Th transcripts display an overall expression pattern more similar to wild type animals than to the remaining DAT:Th KO mice. Those animals could represent recruitment of a pathway attempting to compensate for dopamine loss.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/468199v1?rss=1">Transformation of event representations along middle temporal gyrus</a></h4>

When learning about events through visual experience, one must not only identify which events are visually similar, but also retrieve those events' associates - which may be visually dissimilar - and recognize when different events have similar predictive relations. How are these demands balanced? To address this question, we taught participants the predictive structures among four events, which appeared in four different sequences, each cued by a distinct object. In each, one event ('cause') was predictably followed by another ('effect'). Sequences in the same relational category had similar predictive structure, while across categories, the effect and cause events were reversed. Using fMRI data, we measured associative coding, indicated by correlated responses between effect and cause events; perceptual coding, indicated by correlated responses to visually similar events; and relational category coding, indicated by correlated responses to objects in the same relational category. All three models characterized responses within right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), but in different ways: perceptual and associative coding diverged along the posterior to anterior axis, while relational categories emerged anteriorly in tandem with associative coding. Thus, along the posterior-anterior axis of MTG, the representation of the visual attributes of events is transformed to a representation of both specific and generalizable relational attributes.

Cortical connectivity conforms to a series of organizing principles that are common across species. Spatial proximity, similar cortical type, and similar connectional profile all constitute factors for determining the connectivity between cortical regions. We previously demonstrated another principle of connectivity that is closely related to the spatial layout of the cerebral cortex. Using functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI in the human cortex, we found that the further a region is located from primary cortex, the more distant are its functional connections with other areas of the cortex. However, it remains unknown whether this relationship between cortical layout and connectivity extends to other primate species. Here, we investigated this relationship using both resting-state functional connectivity as well as gold-standard tract-tracing connectivity in the macaque monkey cortex. For both measures of connectivity, we found a gradient of connectivity distance extending between primary and frontoparietal regions. As in the human cortex, the further a region is located from primary areas, the stronger its connections to distant portions of the cortex, with connectivity distance highest in frontal and parietal regions. The similarity between the human and macaque findings provide evidence for a phylogenetically conserved relationship between the spatial layout of cortical areas and connectivity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/467738v1?rss=1">Boundary effects of expectation in human pain perception</a></h4>

Perception is the result of both expectation and sensory stimulation. This is reflected in placebo analgesia, where expecting low pain leads a painful stimulus to feel less painful. Yet it is maladaptive for a highly erroneous expectation to result in an unrealistically low pain experience. We hypothesised that in estimating the intensity of a painful stimulus which is preceded by a very discrepant expectation, the perception is influenced less by the expectation. We modelled the reported pain intensity as a function of the prediction error. We used linear mixed modelling on two independently collected pain cueing datasets, the second of which was preregistered (osf.io/5r6z7). Reported pain intensities were best explained by a quartic polynomial model of the prediction error, indicating the influence of expectations on perceived pain decreased when pain was highly discrepant to expectation, suggesting that the size of prediction error has a functional role in pain perception.

Eating disorders (EDs) are a serious public health concern, affecting about 5.2% of American women. The effects of negative affect on problem-solving and its psychophysiological correlates are poorly understood in this population. This study examined respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance responses of 102 women with EDs (Binge eating disorder [BED]: n = 57, Anorexia nervosa: n = 13, Bulimia nervosa [BN]: n = 32) and 24 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline, and then during: a negative mood induction task, an adapted Means Ends Problem-Solving (MEPS) task and recovery. The MEPS Task included four interpersonal scenarios: 1) binge-eating when sad, 2) job dissatisfaction, 3) feeling rejected by friends, and 4) jealousy in a relationship. ED groups reported more negative and less positive emotions than HCs. After a negative mood induction, women with BED provided significantly less effective problem-solving strategies compared to HCs and women with BN for the binge-eating MEPS scenario. Relative to baseline and the negative mood induction, all participants exhibited significantly higher skin conductance response and skin conductance levels throughout the MEPS scenarios and recovery. BED showed significantly lower RSA levels than individuals with BN and HCs throughout the protocol. The multimethod findings suggest individuals with BED are likely to solve problems by binge-eating when in a negative affective state.

<p>by Hongyang Li, Xin-Qiu Yao, Barry J. Grant</p>

GTPases regulate a multitude of essential cellular processes ranging from movement and division to differentiation and neuronal activity. These ubiquitous enzymes operate by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP with associated conformational changes that modulate affinity for family-specific binding partners. There are three major GTPase superfamilies: Ras-like GTPases, heterotrimeric G proteins and protein-synthesizing GTPases. Although they contain similar nucleotide-binding sites, the detailed mechanisms by which these structurally and functionally diverse superfamilies operate remain unclear. Here we compare and contrast the structural dynamic mechanisms of each superfamily using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and subsequent network analysis approaches. In particular, dissection of the cross-correlations of atomic displacements in both the GTP and GDP-bound states of Ras, transducin and elongation factor EF-Tu reveals analogous dynamic features. This includes similar dynamic communities and subdomain structures (termed lobes). For all three proteins the GTP-bound state has stronger couplings between equivalent lobes. Network analysis further identifies common and family-specific residues mediating the state-specific coupling of distal functional sites. Mutational simulations demonstrate how disrupting these couplings leads to distal dynamic effects at the nucleotide-binding site of each family. Collectively our studies extend current understanding of GTPase allosteric mechanisms and highlight previously unappreciated similarities across functionally diverse families.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L2Q7vnwDhzE" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Oscillations in the brain facilitate neural processing and cognitive functions. This study investigated the dependence of long-term potentiation (LTP), a neural correlate of memory, on the phase of the hippocampal theta rhythm, a prominent brain oscillation. Multichannel field potentials and current source-sinks were analyzed in hippocampal CA1 of adult male rats under urethane anesthesia. A single burst (5 pulses at 200 Hz) stimulation of stratum oriens induced LTP of the basal dendritic excitatory sink, which was maximal when the burst was delivered at ~340<sup>¬∞</sup> and ~160<sup>¬∞</sup> of the distal dendritic theta rhythm. Apical dendritic sink evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation also showed biphasic maxima at ~30<sup>¬∞</sup> and ~210<sup>¬∞</sup> of the distal dendritic theta rhythm, about 50<sup>¬∞</sup> phase delay to basal dendritic LTP. By contrast, maximal population spike excitability, following single-pulse excitation of the basal or mid-apical dendrites, occurred at a theta phase of ~140<sup>¬∞</sup>, and maximal basal dendritic excitatory sink occurred at ~20<sup>¬∞</sup>. Gamma (30-57 Hz) activity recorded in CA1 stratum radiatum had maximal power at ~300<sup>¬∞</sup> of the distal dendritic theta rhythm, different from the phases of maximal LTP. LTP induced during the rising theta phase was N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor sensitive. It is suggested that the theta-phase modulation of CA1 population spike excitability is mainly provided by theta-rhythmic proximal inhibition, while dendritic LTP is also modulated by dendritic inhibition and excitation, specific to basal and apical dendrites. In summary, basal and apical dendritic synaptic plasticity and spike excitability are facilitated at different theta phases in a compartmental fashion.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> How the hippocampal theta rhythm modulates synaptic plasticity and transmission is not completely known. Here, we showed, for the first time, phase modulation of synaptic plasticity and spike excitability across a complete theta cycle. Using a single burst stimulation to probe long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, we observed two LTP peaks and a single spike excitability peak in a single theta cycle (360<sup>¬∞</sup>). Basal dendritic LTP led apical dendritic LTP by ~50<sup>¬∞</sup>, and LTP peaks occurred during both low and high spike excitability. This suggests a brain oscillation can optimally process output (spikes) and synaptic plasticity of different dendritic compartments at different phases, possibly resulting from rhythmic somatic and dendritic inhibition and excitation in the network.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‚Äêrelated disorders. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> encode type IV collagen Œ±1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> variants is around 20%‚Äì30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‚Äêrelated disorders.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in two families with suspected <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‚Äêrelated disorders. We validated the role of <i>COLGALT1</i> variants by constructing a 3D structural model, evaluating ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity by western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing <i>in vitro</i> RNA interference and rescue experiments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in <i>COLGALT1</i> encoding collagen Œ≤ (1‚ÄêO) galactosyltransferase 1, which was involved in the post‚Äêtranslational modification of type IV collagen in two unrelated patients: c.452T&gt;G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G&gt;C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G&gt;C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. 3D model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant <i>COLGALT1</i> insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild‚Äêtype.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>COLGALT1</i> variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‚Äêrelated disorders.</p>

<p>Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the sensitive plant), employ
electrochemical signals known as action potentials (APs) for rapid
intercellular communication. In this paper, we consider a reaction diffusion
model of individual AP signals to analyze APs from a communication and
information theoretic perspective. We use concepts from molecular communication
to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a plant for a
single AP pulse that is shared with one or more receiver cells. We also use the
chemical Langevin equation to accommodate the deterministic as well as
stochastic component of the system. Finally we present an information theoretic
analysis of single action potentials, obtaining achievable information rates
for these signals. We show that, in general, the presence of an AP signal can
increase the mutual information and information propagation speed among
neighboring cells with receivers in different settings.

<p>We propose a biologically-inspired research agenda with parallel tracks aimed
at AI and AI safety. The bottom-up component consists of building a sequence of
biophysically realistic simulations of simple organisms such as the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the
zebrafish Danio rerio to serve as platforms for research into AI algorithms and
system architectures. The top-down component consists of an approach to value
alignment that grounds AI goal structures in neuropsychology. Our belief is
that parallel pursuit of these tracks will inform the development of
value-aligned AI systems that have been inspired by embodied organisms with
sensorimotor integration. An important set of side benefits is that the
research trajectories we describe here are grounded in long-standing
intellectual traditions within existing research communities and funding
structures. In addition, these research programs overlap with significant
contemporary themes in the biological and psychological sciences such as
data/model integration and reproducibility.

<p>We show that in model neuronal cultures, where the probability of
interneuronal connection formation decreases exponentially with increasing
distance between the neurons, there exists a small number of spatial nucleation
centers of a network spike, from where the synchronous spiking activity starts
propagating in the network typically in the form of circular traveling waves.
The number of nucleation centers and their spatial locations are unique and
unchanged for a given realization of neuronal network but are different for
different networks. In contrast, if the probability of interneuronal connection
formation is independent of the distance between neurons, then the nucleation
centers do not arise and the synchronization of spiking activity during a
network spike occurs spatially uniform throughout the network. Therefore one
can conclude that spatial proximity of connections between neurons is important
for the formation of nucleation centers. It is also shown that fluctuations of
the spatial density of neurons at their random homogeneous distribution typical
for the experiments $\textit{in vitro}$ do not determine the locations of the
nucleation centers. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with
the experimental observations.

<p>In cat visual cortex, the response of a neural population to the linear
combination of two sinusoidal gratings (a plaid) can be well approximated by a
weighted sum of the population responses to the individual gratings --- a
property we refer to as {\em subspace invariance}. We tested subspace
invariance in mouse primary visual cortex by measuring the angle between the
population response to a plaid and the plane spanned by the population
responses to its individual components. We found robust violations of subspace
invariance arising from a strong, negative correlation between the responses of
neurons to individual gratings and their responses to the plaid. Contrast
invariance, a special case of subspace invariance, also failed. The responses
of some neurons decreased with increasing contrast, while others increased.
Altogether the data show that subspace and contrast invariance do not hold in
mouse primary visual cortex. These findings rule out some models of population
coding, including vector averaging, some versions of normalization and temporal
multiplexing.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42166">New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3</a></h4>

Here, we describe the third major release of RELION. CPU-based vector acceleration has been added in addition to GPU support, which provides flexibility in use of resources and avoids memory limitations. Reference-free autopicking with Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering and execution of jobs from python allows non-interactive processing during acquisition, including 2D-classification, <i>de novo</i> model generation and 3D-classification. Per-particle refinement of CTF parameters and correction of estimated beam tilt provides higher-resolution reconstructions when particles are at different heights in the ice, and/or coma-free alignment has not been optimal. Ewald sphere curvature correction improves resolution for large particles. We illustrate these developments with publicly available data sets: together with a Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction it leads to resolution improvements of 0.2-0.7 √Ö compared to previous RELION versions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38519">Insulin mutations impair beta-cell development in a patient-derived iPSC model of neonatal diabetes</a></h4>

Insulin gene mutations are a leading cause of neonatal diabetes. They can lead to proinsulin misfolding and its retention in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This results in increased ER-stress suggested to trigger beta-cell apoptosis. In humans, the mechanisms underlying beta-cell failure remain unclear. Here we show that misfolded proinsulin impairs developing beta-cell proliferation without increasing apoptosis. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from people carrying insulin (<i>INS</i>) mutations, engineered isogenic CRISPR-Cas9 mutation-corrected lines and differentiated them to beta-like cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis showed increased ER-stress and reduced proliferation in INS-mutant beta-like cells compared with corrected controls. Upon transplantation into mice, INS-mutant grafts presented reduced insulin secretion and aggravated ER-stress. Cell size, mTORC1 signaling, and respiratory chain subunits expression were all reduced in <i>INS</i>-mutant beta-like cells, yet apoptosis was not increased at any stage. Our results demonstrate that neonatal diabetes-associated INS-mutations lead to defective beta-cell mass expansion, contributing to diabetes development.

Unresolved ER stress followed by cell death is recognized as the main cause of a multitude of pathologies including neonatal diabetes. A systematic analysis of the mechanisms of Œ≤-cell loss and dysfunction in <i>Akita</i> mice, in which a mutation in the proinsulin gene causes a severe form of permanent neonatal diabetes, showed no increase in Œ≤-cell apoptosis throughout life. Surprisingly, we found that the main mechanism leading to Œ≤-cell dysfunction is marked impairment of Œ≤-cell growth during the early postnatal life due to transient inhibition of mTORC1, which governs postnatal Œ≤-cell growth and differentiation. Importantly, restoration of mTORC1 activity in neonate Œ≤-cells was sufficient to rescue postnatal Œ≤-cell growth, and to improve diabetes. We propose a scenario for the development of permanent neonatal diabetes, possibly also common forms of diabetes, where early-life events inducing ER stress affect Œ≤-cell mass expansion due to mTOR inhibition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38314">T-ALL leukemia stem cell 'stemness' is epigenetically controlled by the master regulator SPI1</a></h4>

Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are regarded as the origins and key therapeutic targets of leukemia, but limited knowledge is available on the key determinants of LSC 'stemness'. Using single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we identify a master regulator, SPI1, the LSC-specific expression of which determines the molecular signature and activity of LSCs in the murine <i>Pten</i>-null T-ALL model. Although initiated by PTEN-controlled b-catenin activation, <i>Spi1</i> expression and LSC 'stemness' are maintained by a b-catenin-SPI1-HAVCR2 regulatory circuit independent of the leukemogenic driver mutation. Perturbing any component of this circuit either genetically or pharmacologically can prevent LSC formation or eliminate existing LSCs. LSCs lose their 'stemness' when <i>Spi1</i> expression is silenced by DNA methylation, but <i>Spi1</i> expression can be reactivated by 5-AZ treatment. Importantly, similar regulatory mechanisms may be also present in human T-ALLs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37545">Tuned polymerization of the transcription factor Yan limits off-DNA sequestration to confer context-specific repression</a></h4>

During development, transcriptional complexes at enhancers regulate gene expression in complex spatiotemporal patterns. To achieve robust expression without spurious activation, the affinity and specificity of transcription factor<b>‚Äì</b>DNA interactions must be precisely balanced. Protein<b>‚Äì</b>protein interactions among transcription factors are also critical, yet how their affinities impact enhancer output is not understood. The <i>Drosophila</i> transcription factor Yan provides a well-suited model to address this, as its function depends on the coordinated activities of two independent and essential domains: the DNA-binding ETS domain and the self-associating SAM domain. To explore how protein<b>‚Äì</b>protein affinity influences Yan function, we engineered mutants that increase SAM affinity over four orders of magnitude. This produced a dramatic subcellular redistribution of Yan into punctate structures, reduced repressive output and compromised survival. Cell-type specification and genetic interaction defects suggest distinct requirements for polymerization in different regulatory decisions. We conclude that tuned protein<b>‚Äì</b>protein interactions enable the dynamic spectrum of complexes that are required for proper regulation.

<p>by Michael Muthukrishna, Michael Doebeli, Maciej Chudek, Joseph Henrich</p>

In the last few million years, the hominin brain more than tripled in size. Comparisons across evolutionary lineages suggest that this expansion may be part of a broader trend toward larger, more complex brains in many taxa. Efforts to understand the evolutionary forces driving brain expansion have focused on climatic, ecological, and social factors. Here, building on existing research on learning, we analytically and computationally model the predictions of two closely related hypotheses: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis and the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis. The Cultural Brain Hypothesis posits that brains have been selected for their ability to store and manage information, acquired through asocial or social learning. The model of the Cultural Brain Hypothesis reveals relationships between brain size, group size, innovation, social learning, mating structures, and the length of the juvenile period that are supported by the existing empirical literature. From this model, we derive a set of predictions‚Äîthe Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis‚Äîfor the conditions that favor an autocatalytic take-off characteristic of human evolution. This narrow evolutionary pathway, created by cumulative cultural evolution, may help explain the rapid expansion of human brains and other aspects of our species‚Äô life history and psychology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D8JG9Z49BUk" width="1" />

<p>by Bjoern Peters, Steven E. Brenner, Edwin Wang, Donna Slonim, Maricel G. Kann</p>

Research in computational biology has given rise to a vast number of methods developed to solve scientific problems. For areas in which many approaches exist, researchers have a hard time deciding which tool to select to address a scientific challenge, as essentially all publications introducing a new method will claim better performance than all others. Not all of these claims can be correct. Equally, for this same reason, developers struggle to demonstrate convincingly that they created a new and superior algorithm or implementation. Moreover, the developer community often has difficulty discerning which new approaches constitute true scientific advances for the field. The obvious answer to this conundrum is to develop benchmarks‚Äîmeaning standard points of reference that facilitate evaluating the performance of different tools‚Äîallowing both users and developers to compare multiple tools in an unbiased fashion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qGkTd6d2wRY" width="1" />

<p>by Christiane Ehrt, Tobias Brinkjost, Oliver Koch</p>

The automated comparison of protein-ligand binding sites provides useful insights into yet unexplored site similarities. Various stages of computational and chemical biology research can benefit from this knowledge. The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios. Specific evaluation data sets were developed to shed light on multiple aspects of binding site comparison. An assembly of all applied benchmark sets (ProSPECCTs‚ÄìProtein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) is made available for the evaluation and optimization of further and still emerging methods. The results indicate the importance of such analyses to facilitate the choice of a methodology that complies with the requirements of a specific scientific challenge.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q6hPgve3kwY" width="1" />

<p>by Weilong Zhao, Xinwei Sher</p>

A number of machine learning-based predictors have been developed for identifying immunogenic T-cell epitopes based on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II binding affinities. Rationally selecting the most appropriate tool has been complicated by the evolving training data and machine learning methods. Despite the recent advances made in generating high-quality MHC-eluted, naturally processed ligandome, the reliability of new predictors on these epitopes has yet to be evaluated. This study reports the latest benchmarking on an extensive set of MHC-binding predictors by using newly available, untested data of both synthetic and naturally processed epitopes. 32 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and 24 HLA class II alleles are included in the blind test set. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based approaches demonstrated better performance than regression-based machine learning and structural modeling. Among the 18 predictors benchmarked, ANN-based mhcflurry and nn_align perform the best for MHC class I 9-mer and class II 15-mer predictions, respectively, on binding/non-binding classification (Area Under Curves = 0.911). NetMHCpan4 also demonstrated comparable predictive power. Our customization of mhcflurry to a pan-HLA predictor has achieved similar accuracy to NetMHCpan. The overall accuracy of these methods are comparable between 9-mer and 10-mer testing data. However, the top methods deliver low correlations between the predicted versus the experimental affinities for strong MHC binders. When used on naturally processed MHC-ligands, tools that have been trained on elution data (NetMHCpan4 and MixMHCpred) shows better accuracy than pure binding affinity predictor. The variability of false prediction rate is considerable among HLA types and datasets. Finally, structure-based predictor of Rosetta FlexPepDock is less optimal compared to the machine learning approaches. With our benchmarking of MHC-binding and MHC-elution predictors using a comprehensive metrics, a unbiased view for establishing best practice of T-cell epitope predictions is presented, facilitating future development of methods in immunogenomics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OrtxuwayHs" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Several small case series identified <i>KCTD7</i> mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Novel <i>KCTD7</i> variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‚Äêbased functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>KCTD7</i> mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published <i>KCTD7</i> patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient <i>KCTD7</i> variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of <i>KCTD7</i> and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‚Äêderived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>KCTD7</i> mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. <i>KCTD7</i> deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‚Äêlysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Newer MRI techniques have shown promise in capturing early Parkinson's disease (PD)‚Äêrelated changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both voxel‚Äêbased and region‚Äêof‚Äêinterest approaches in normalized space. The sensitivity and specificity of the SN T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ‚â§2 years (PDE). A second independent cohort of 73 PD and 49 controls was used for validation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both the right (cluster size=164 mm<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.0001) and left (cluster size=213 mm<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and corresponded to the SNc. The region‚Äêof‚Äêinterest approach confirmed the group difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (p&lt;0.0001). The SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to separate PD and controls (AUC=0.926), even for PDE patients (AUC=0.901, sensitivity=0.857, specificity=0.857). These results were validated in the second cohort.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD‚Äêrelated changes in the SN and may be used as a novel, parsimonious <i>in vivo</i> biomarker for the disease, particularly early stage patients, with high translational value for clinical practice and research.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite bioequivalence, the exchangeability of antiepileptic drugs in clinical settings is disputed. Therefore, we investigated the risk for recurrent seizures after switching the manufacturer of the same drug in a large German cohort.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Anonymous patient data from practice neurologists throughout Germany between 2011 and 2016 were collected using the IMS Disease Analyzer database (QuintilesIMS, Frankfurt, Germany). People with epilepsy were included if at least 2 prescriptions within 360 days and 1 within 180 days prior to the index date were available. The cohort was separated into a seizure group and seizure‚Äêfree controls. Both groups were matched 1:1 according to age, gender, insurance status, and treating physician. The risk for breakthrough seizures after a manufacturer switch of the same antiepileptic drug was analyzed using multivariate regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 3,530 people with epilepsy were included (each group, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1,765; age‚Äâ=‚Äâ53.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ19.8 years). Patients with seizures had switched the drug manufacturer more often than controls (26.8% vs 14.2%; odds ratio [OR]‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.08‚Äì1.69, <i>p</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009), both from branded to generic (5.5% vs 2.4%; OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.85, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.30‚Äì2.64, <i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001) and between generic drugs (14.7% vs 7.1%; OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.45, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.13‚Äì1.87, <i>p</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In previously seizure‚Äêfree patients, switching the manufacturer of antiepileptic medications was associated with a higher risk for seizure recurrence. Our retrospective approach does not allow us to determine whether other changes in medical care at the same time could contribute to the recurrence. However, it would be prudent to avoid switching the manufacturer of anticonvulsants in seizure‚Äêfree patients. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‚Äê6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new‚Äêonset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n=5) or without rituximab (n=2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1‚Äê2 doses of tocilizumab in six patients with a median interval of three days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, two patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain‚Äêstate dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning, that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‚Äêfour hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to two intervention groups; 1. The associative group received thirty pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; 2. In the control group the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl‚ÄêMeyer assessment (LE‚ÄêFM; primary outcome measure)) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials (MEPs)) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median (interquartile range) LE‚ÄêFM improvement: 6.5 (3.5‚Äê8.25) and 3 (0.75‚Äê3), respectively; <i>p</i>=0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (<i>p</i>‚Äôs‚â§0.006).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically‚Äêviable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02923">Universal Spike Classifier. (arXiv:1811.02923v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>In electrophysiology, microelectrodes are the primary source for recording
neural data of single neurons (single unit activity). These microelectrodes can
be implanted individually, or in the form of microelectrodes arrays, consisting
of hundreds of electrodes. During recordings, some channels capture the
activity of neurons, which is usually contaminated with external artifacts and
noise. Another considerable fraction of channels does not record any neural
data, but external artifacts and noise. Therefore, an automatic identification
and tracking of channels containing neural data is of great significance and
can accelerate the process of analysis, e.g. automatic selection of meaningful
channels during offline and online spike sorting. Another important aspect is
the selection of meaningful channels during online decoding in brain-computer
interface applications, where threshold crossing events are usually for feature
extraction, even though they do not necessarily correspond to neural events.
Here, we propose a novel algorithm based on the newly introduced way of feature
vector extraction and a supervised deep learning method: a universal spike
classifier (USC). The USC enables us to address both above-raised issues. The
USC uses the standard architecture of convolutional neural networks (Conv net).
It takes the batch of the waveforms, instead of a single waveform as an input,
propagates it through the multilayered structure, and finally classifies it as
a channel containing neural spike data or artifacts. We have trained the model
of USC on data recorded from single tetraplegic patient with Utah arrays
implanted in different brain areas. This trained model was then evaluated
without retraining on the data collected from six epileptic patients implanted
with depth electrodes and two tetraplegic patients implanted with two Utah
arrays, individually.

<p>We relate the concepts used in decentralized ledger technology to studies of
episodic memory in the mammalian brain. Specifically, we introduce the standard
concepts of linked list, hash functions, and sharding, from computer science.
We argue that these concepts may be more relevant to studies of the neural
mechanisms of memory than has been previously appreciated. In turn, we also
highlight that certain phenomena studied in the brain, namely metacognition,
reality monitoring, and how perceptual conscious experiences come about, may
inspire development in blockchain technology too, specifically regarding
probabilistic consensus protocols.

<p>Experiments in various neural systems found avalanches: bursts of activity
with characteristics typical for critical dynamics. A possible explanation for
their occurrence is an underlying network that self-organizes into a critical
state. We propose a simple spiking model for developing neural networks,
showing how these may "grow into" criticality. Avalanches generated by our
model correspond to clusters of widely applied Hawkes processes. We
analytically derive the cluster size and duration distributions and find that
they agree with those of experimentally observed neuronal avalanches.

<p>In this study, we developed a method to estimate the relationship between
stimulation current and volatility during isometric contraction. In functional
electrical stimulation (FES), joints are driven by applying voltage to muscles.
This technology has been used for a long time in the field of rehabilitation,
and recently application oriented research has been reported. However,
estimation of the relationship between stimulus value and exercise capacity has
not been discussed to a great extent. Therefore, in this study, a human muscle
model was estimated using the transfer function estimation method with fast
Fourier transform. It was found that the relationship between stimulation
current and force exerted could be expressed by a first-order lag system. In
verification of the force estimate, the ability of the proposed model to
estimate the exerted force under steady state response was found to be good.

<p>The superior temporal gyrus (STG) region of cortex critically contributes to
speech recognition. In this work, we show that a proposed WaveNet, with limited
available data, is able to reconstruct speech stimuli from STG intracranial
recordings. We further investigate the impulse response of the fitted model for
each recording electrode and observe phoneme level temporospectral tuning
properties for the recorded area of cortex. This discovery is consistent with
previous studies implicating the posterior STG (pSTG) in a phonetic
representation of speech and provides detailed acoustic features that certain
electrode sites possibly extract during speech recognition.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02650">Visual Attention is Beyond One Single Saliency Map. (arXiv:1811.02650v1 [cs.CV])</a></h4>

<p>Of later years, numerous bottom-up attention models have been proposed on
different assumptions. However, the produced saliency maps may be different
from each other even from the same input image. We also observe that human
fixation map varies across time greatly. When people freely view an image, they
tend to allocate attention at salient regions of large scale at first, and then
search more and more detailed regions. In this paper, we argue that, for one
input image visual attention cannot be described by only one single saliency
map, and this mechanism should be modeled as a dynamic process. Under the
frequency domain paradigm, we proposed a global inhibition model to mimic this
process by suppressing the {\it non-saliency} in the input image; we also show
that the dynamic process is influenced by one parameter in the frequency
domain. Experiments illustrate that the proposed model is capable of predicting
human dynamic fixation distribution.

Disruption of nigrostriatal dopamine signaling impaired this inhibition behavior, as seen in neurological/psychiatric disorders with dopaminergic dysfunctions.

<p>There has been a growing interest toward mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) since the recent discovery of a neurodegenerative human disorder termed MEPAN (mitochondrial enoyl reductase protein associated neurodegeneration), which is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial enoyl-CoA/ACP (acyl carrier protein) reductase (MECR) carrying out the last step of mtFAS. We show here that MECR protein is highly expressed in mouse Purkinje cells (PCs). To elucidate mtFAS function in neural tissue, here, we generated a mouse line with a PC-specific knock-out (KO) of <i>Mecr</i>, leading to inactivation of mtFAS confined to this cell type. Both sexes were studied. The mitochondria in KO PCs displayed abnormal morphology, loss of protein lipoylation, and reduced respiratory chain enzymatic activities by the time these mice were 6 months of age, followed by nearly complete loss of PCs by 9 months of age. These animals exhibited balancing difficulties ~7 months of age and ataxic symptoms were evident from 8‚Äì9 months of age on. Our data show that impairment of mtFAS results in functional and ultrastructural changes in mitochondria followed by death of PCs, mimicking aspects of the clinical phenotype. This KO mouse represents a new model for impaired mitochondrial lipid metabolism and cerebellar ataxia with a distinct and well trackable cellular phenotype. This mouse model will allow the future investigation of the feasibility of metabolite supplementation approaches toward the prevention of neurodegeneration due to dysfunctional mtFAS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We have recently reported a novel neurodegenerative disorder in humans termed MEPAN (mitochondrial enoyl reductase protein associated neurodegeneration) (Heimer et al., 2016). The cause of neuron degeneration in MEPAN patients is the dysfunction of the highly conserved mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway due to mutations in MECR, encoding mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA/ACP reductase. The report presented here describes the analysis of the first mouse model suffering from mtFAS-defect-induced neurodegenerative changes due to specific disruption of the <i>Mecr</i> gene in Purkinje cells. Our work sheds a light on the mechanisms of neurodegeneration caused by mtFAS deficiency and provides a test bed for future treatment approaches.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/45/9768?rss=1">Regulation of the Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 2 (Npr2) by Phosphorylation of Juxtamembrane Serine and Threonine Residues Is Essential for Bifurcation of Sensory Axons</a></h4>

<p>cGMP signaling elicited by activation of the transmembrane receptor guanylyl cyclase Npr2 (also known as guanylyl cyclase B) by the ligand CNP controls sensory axon bifurcation of DRG and cranial sensory ganglion (CSG) neurons entering the spinal cord or hindbrain, respectively. Previous studies have shown that Npr2 is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in its kinase homology domain (KHD). However, it is unknown whether phosphorylation of Npr2 is essential for axon bifurcation. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse line in which the seven regulatory serine and threonine residues in the KHD of Npr2 were substituted by alanine (Npr2-7A), resulting in a nonphosphorylatable enzyme. Real-time imaging of cGMP in DRG neurons with a genetically encoded fluorescent cGMP sensor or biochemical analysis of guanylyl cyclase activity in brain or lung tissue revealed the absence of CNP-induced cGMP generation in the <i>Npr2<sup>7A/7A</sup></i> mutant. Consequently, bifurcation of axons, but not collateral formation, from DRG or CSG in this mouse mutant was perturbed at embryonic and mature stages. In contrast, axon branching was normal in a mouse mutant in which constitutive phosphorylation of Npr2 is mimicked by a replacement of all of the seven serine and threonine sites by glutamic acid (Npr2‚Äì7E). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the <i>Npr2<sup>7A/7A</sup></i> mutation causes dwarfism as described for global Npr2 mutants. In conclusion, our <i>in vivo</i> studies provide strong evidence that phosphorylation of the seven serine and threonine residues in the KHD of Npr2 is an important regulatory element of Npr2-mediated cGMP signaling which affects physiological processes, such as axon bifurcation and bone growth.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The branching of axons is a morphological hallmark of virtually all neurons. It allows an individual neuron to innervate different targets and to communicate with neurons located in different regions of the nervous system. The natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (Npr2), a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase, is essential for the initiation of bifurcation of sensory axons when entering the spinal cord or the hindbrain. By using two genetically engineered mouse lines, we show that phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues in juxtamembrane regions of Npr2 are required for its enzymatic activity and for axon bifurcation. These investigations might help to understand the regulation of Npr2 and its integration in intracellular signaling systems.</p>

<p>Abnormalities in Œ±-synuclein are implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Because Œ±-synuclein is highly concentrated within presynaptic terminals, presynaptic dysfunction has been proposed as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Here, we report novel, tau-dependent, postsynaptic deficits caused by A53T mutant Œ±-synuclein, which is linked to familial PD. We analyzed synaptic activity in hippocampal slices and cultured hippocampal neurons from transgenic mice of either sex expressing human WT, A53T, and A30P Œ±-synuclein. Increased Œ±-synuclein expression leads to decreased spontaneous synaptic vesicle release regardless of genotype. However, only those neurons expressing A53T Œ±-synuclein exhibit postsynaptic dysfunction, including decreased miniature postsynaptic current amplitude and decreased AMPA to NMDA receptor current ratio. We also found that long-term potentiation and spatial learning were impaired by A53T Œ±-synuclein expression. Mechanistically, postsynaptic dysfunction requires glycogen synthase kinase 3Œ≤-mediated tau phosphorylation, tau mislocalization to dendritic spines, and calcineurin-dependent AMPA receptor internalization. Previous studies reveal that human A53T Œ±-synuclein has a high aggregation potential, which may explain the mutation's unique capacity to induce postsynaptic deficits. However, patients with sporadic PD with severe tau pathology are also more likely to have early onset cognitive decline. Our results here show a novel, functional role for tau: mediating the effects of Œ±-synuclein on postsynaptic signaling. Therefore, the unraveled tau-mediated signaling cascade may contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia in A53T Œ±-synuclein-linked familial PD cases, as well as some subgroups of PD cases with extensive tau pathology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we report mutation-specific postsynaptic deficits that are caused by A53T mutant Œ±-synuclein, which is linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The overexpression of WT, A53T, or A30P human Œ±-synuclein leads to decreased spontaneous synaptic vesicle release. However, only those neurons expressing A53T Œ±-synuclein exhibit tau phosphorylation-dependent postsynaptic dysfunction, which is characterized by decreased miniature postsynaptic current amplitude and decreased AMPA to NMDA receptor current ratio. The mutation-specific postsynaptic effects caused by human A53T Œ±-synuclein will help us better understand the neurobiological basis of this specific form of familial PD. The differential effects of exogenous human WT, A53T, A30P, and E46K Œ±-synuclein on glutamatergic synaptic responses will help to explain the clinical heterogeneity of sporadic and familial PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/45/9741?rss=1">The Subprimary Range of Firing Is Present in Both Cat and Mouse Spinal Motoneurons and Its Relationship to Force Development Is Similar for the Two Species</a></h4>

<p>In the motor system, force gradation is achieved by recruitment of motoneurons and rate modulation of their firing frequency. Classical experiments investigating the relationship between injected current to the soma during intracellular recording and the firing frequency (the <i>I‚Äìf</i> relation) in cat spinal motoneurons identified two clear ranges: a primary range and a secondary range. Recent work in mice, however, has identified an additional range proposed to be exclusive to rodents, the subprimary range (SPR), due to the presence of mixed mode oscillations of the membrane potential. Surprisingly, fully summated tetanic contractions occurred in mice during SPR frequencies. With the mouse now one of the most popular models to investigate motor control, it is crucial that such discrepancies between observations in mice and basic principles that have been widely accepted in larger animals are resolved. To do this, we have reinvestigated the <i>I‚Äìf</i> relation using ramp current injections in spinal motoneurons in both barbiturate-anesthetized and decerebrate (nonanesthetized) cats and mice. We demonstrate the presence of the SPR and mixed mode oscillations in both species and show that the SPR is enhanced by barbiturate anesthetics. Our measurements of the <i>I‚Äìf</i> relation in both cats and mice support the classical opinion that firing frequencies in the higher end of the primary range are necessary to obtain a full summation. By systematically varying the leg oil pool temperature (from 37¬∞C to room temperature), we found that only at lower temperatures can maximal summation occur at SPR frequencies due to prolongation of individual muscle twitches.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work investigates recent revelations that mouse motoneurons behave in a fundamentally different way from motoneurons of larger animals with respect to the importance of rate modulation of motoneuron firing for force gradation. The current study systematically addresses the proposed discrepancies between mice and larger species (cats) and demonstrates that mouse motoneurons, in fact, use rate modulation as a mechanism of force modulation in a similar manner to the classical descriptions in larger animals.</p>

<p>Visual processing is largely organized into ON and OFF pathways that signal stimulus increments and decrements, respectively. These pathways exhibit natural pairings based on morphological and physiological similarities, such as ON and OFF Œ±-ganglion cells in the mammalian retina. Several studies have noted asymmetries in the properties of ON and OFF pathways. For example, the spatial receptive fields (RFs) of OFF Œ±-cells are systematically smaller than ON Œ±-cells. Analysis of natural scenes suggests that these asymmetries are optimal for visual encoding. To test the generality of ON/OFF asymmetries, we measured the spatiotemporal RF properties of multiple RGC types in rat retina. Through a quantitative and serial classification, we identified three functional pairs of ON and OFF RGCs. We analyzed the structure of their RFs and compared spatial integration, temporal integration, and gain across ON and OFF pairs. Similar to previous results from the cat and primate, RGC types with larger spatial RFs exhibited briefer temporal integration and higher gain. However, each pair of ON and OFF RGC types exhibited distinct asymmetric relationships between RF properties, some of which were opposite to the findings of previous reports. These results reveal the functional organization of six RGC types in the rodent retina and indicate that ON/OFF asymmetries are pathway specific.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circuits that process sensory input frequently process increments separately from decrements, so-called ON and OFF responses. Theoretical studies indicate that this separation, and associated asymmetries in ON and OFF pathways, may be beneficial for encoding natural stimuli. However, the generality of ON and OFF pathway asymmetries has not been tested. Here we compare the functional properties of three distinct pairs of ON and OFF pathways in the rodent retina and show that their asymmetries are pathway specific. These results provide a new view on the partitioning of vision across diverse ON and OFF signaling pathways.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/45/9712?rss=1">Inhibitory Connectivity Dominates the Fan Cell Network in Layer II of Lateral Entorhinal Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Fan cells in layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) form a main component of the projection to the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA2 of the hippocampal formation. This projection has a counterpart originating from stellate cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Available evidence suggests that the two pathways carry different information, exemplified by a difference in spatial tuning of cells in LEC and MEC. The grid cell, a prominent position-modulated cell type present in MEC, has been postulated to derive its characteristic hexagonal firing pattern from dominant disynaptic inhibitory connections between hippocampal-projecting stellate cells. Given that grid cells have not been described in LEC, we aim to describe the local synaptic connectivity of fan cells, to explore whether the network architecture is similar to that of the MEC stellate cell. Using a combination of <i>in vitro</i> multicell electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches in acute slices from rodents of either sex, we show that excitatory connectivity between fan cells is very sparse. Fan cells connect preferentially with two distinct types of inhibitory interneurons, suggesting disynaptic inhibitory coupling as the main form of communication among fan cells. These principles are similar to those reported for stellate cells in MEC, indicating an overall comparable local circuit architecture of the main hippocampal-projecting cell types in the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our data provide the first description of the synaptic microcircuit of hippocampal-projecting layer II cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex. We show that these cells make infrequent monosynaptic connections with each other, and that they preferentially communicate through a disynaptic inhibitory network. This is similar to the microcircuit of hippocampal-projecting stellate cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex, but dissimilar to the connectivity observed in layer 2 of neocortex. In medial entorhinal cortex, the observed network structure has been proposed to underlie the firing pattern of grid cells. This opens the possibility that layer II cells in lateral entorhinal cortex exhibit regular firing patterns in an unexplored domain.</p>

<p>The G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) is a prevalent cause of late-onset Parkinson's disease, producing psychiatric and motor symptoms, including depression, that are indistinguishable from sporadic cases. Here we tested how this mutation impacts depression-related behaviors and associated synaptic responses and plasticity in mice expressing a <i>Lrrk2</i>-G2019S knock-in mutation. Young adult male G2019S knock-in and wild-type mice were subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), a validated depression model, and other tests of anhedonia, anxiety, and motor learning. We found that G2019S mice were highly resilient to CSDS, failing to exhibit social avoidance compared to wild-type mice, many of which exhibited prominent social avoidance and were thus susceptible to CSDS. In the absence of CSDS, no behavioral differences between genotypes were found. Whole-cell recordings of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the nucleus accumbens revealed that glutamatergic synapses in G2019S mice lacked functional calcium-permeable AMPARs, and following CSDS, failed to accumulate inwardly rectifying AMPAR responses characteristic of susceptible mice. Based on this abnormal AMPAR response profile, we asked whether long-term potentiation (LTP) of corticostriatal synaptic strength was affected. We found that both D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R)- and D<sub>2</sub>R-SPNs in G2019S mutants were unable to express LTP, with D<sub>2</sub>R-SPNs abnormally expressing long-term depression following an LTP-induction protocol. Thus, G2019S promotes resilience to chronic social stress in young adulthood, likely reflecting synapses constrained in their ability to undergo experience-dependent plasticity. These unexpected findings may indicate early adaptive coping mechanisms imparted by the G2019S mutation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The G2019S mutation in <i>LRRK2</i> causes late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). <i>LRRK2</i> is highly expressed in striatal neurons throughout life, but it is unclear how mutant <i>LRRK2</i> affects striatal neuron function and behaviors in young adulthood. We addressed this question using <i>Lrrk2</i>-G2019S knock-in mice. The data show that young adult G2019S mice were unusually resilient to a depression-like syndrome resulting from chronic social stress. Further, mutant striatal synapses were incapable of forms of synaptic plasticity normally accompanying depression-like behavior and important for supporting the full range of cognitive function. These data suggest that in humans, <i>LRRK2</i> mutation may affect striatal circuit function in ways that alter normal responses to stress and could be relevant for treatment strategies for non-motor PD symptoms.</p>

<p>Understanding movies and stories requires maintaining a high-level situation model that abstracts away from perceptual details to describe the location, characters, actions, and causal relationships of the currently unfolding event. These models are built not only from information present in the current narrative, but also from prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime. We analyzed fMRI data from 44 human subjects (male and female) presented with 16 three-minute stories, consisting of four schematic events drawn from two different scripts (eating at a restaurant or going through the airport). Aside from this shared script structure, the stories varied widely in terms of their characters and storylines, and were presented in two highly dissimilar formats (audiovisual clips or spoken narration). One group was presented with the stories in an intact temporal sequence, while a separate control group was presented with the same events in scrambled order. Regions including the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and superior frontal gyrus exhibited schematic event patterns that generalized across stories, subjects, and modalities. Patterns in mPFC were also sensitive to overall script structure, with temporally scrambled events evoking weaker schematic representations. Using a Hidden Markov Model, patterns in these regions predicted the script (restaurant vs airport) of unlabeled data with high accuracy and were used to temporally align multiple stories with a shared script. These results extend work on the perception of controlled, artificial schemas in human and animal experiments to naturalistic perception of complex narratives.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In almost all situations we encounter in our daily lives, we are able to draw on our schematic knowledge about what typically happens in the world to better perceive and mentally represent our ongoing experiences. In contrast to previous studies that investigated schematic cognition using simple, artificial associations, we measured brain activity from subjects watching movies and listening to stories depicting restaurant or airport experiences. Our results reveal a network of brain regions that is sensitive to the shared temporal structure of these naturalistic situations. These regions abstract away from the particular details of each story, activating a representation of the general type of situation being perceived.</p>

<p>Observing mouth movements has strikingly effects on the perception of speech. Any mismatch between sound and mouth movements will result in listeners perceiving illusory consonants (McGurk effect), whereas matching mouth movements assist with the correct recognition of speech sounds. Recent neuroimaging studies have yielded evidence that the motor areas are involved in speech processing, yet their contributions to multisensory illusion remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in an event-related design, we aimed to identify the functional roles of the motor network in the occurrence of multisensory illusion in female and male brains. fMRI showed bilateral activation of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in audiovisually incongruent trials. Activity in the left IFG was negatively correlated with occurrence of the McGurk effect. The effective connectivity between the left IFG and the bilateral precentral gyri was stronger in incongruent than in congruent trials. The McGurk effect was reduced in incongruent trials by applying single-pulse TMS to motor cortex (M1) lip areas, indicating that TMS facilitates the left IFG-precentral motor network to reduce the McGurk effect. TMS of the M1 lip areas was effective in reducing the McGurk effect within the specific temporal range from 100 ms before to 200 ms after the auditory onset, and TMS of the M1 foot area did not influence the McGurk effect, suggesting topographical specificity. These results provide direct evidence that the motor network makes specific temporal and topographical contributions to the processing of multisensory integration of speech to avoid illusion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human motor network, including the inferior frontal gyrus and primary motor cortex lip area, appears to be involved in speech perception, but the functional contribution to the McGurk effect is unknown. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that activity in these areas of the motor network increased when the audiovisual stimuli were incongruent, and that the increased activity was negatively correlated with perception of the McGurk effect. Furthermore, applying transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motor areas reduced the McGurk effect. These two observations provide evidence that the motor network contributes to the avoidance of multisensory illusory perception.</p>

<p>Visual cognition in humans has traditionally been studied with cognitive behavioral methods and brain imaging, but much less with genetic methods. Perceptual rivalry, an important phenomenon in visual cognition, is the spontaneous perceptual alternation that occurs between two distinct interpretations of a physically constant visual stimulus (e.g., binocular rivalry stimuli) or a perceptually ambiguous stimulus (e.g., the Necker cube). The switching rate varies dramatically across individuals and can be voluntarily modulated by observers. Here, we adopted a genomic approach to systematically investigate the genetics underlying binocular rivalry, Necker cube rivalry and voluntary modulation of Necker cube rivalry in young Chinese adults (<i>Homo sapiens</i>, 81% female, 20 ¬± 1 years old) at multiple levels, including common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimation, SNP-based genome-wide association study (GWAS), gene-based analysis, and pathway analysis. We performed a pilot GWAS in 2441 individuals and replicated it in an independent cohort of 943 individuals. Common SNP-based heritability was estimated to be 25% for spontaneous perceptual rivalry. SNPs rs184765639 and rs75595941 were associated with voluntary modulation, and imaging data suggested genotypic difference of rs184765639 in the surface area of the left caudal-middle frontal cortex. Additionally, converging evidence from multilevel analyses associated genes such as <i>PRMT1</i> with perceptual switching rate, and <i>MIR1178</i> with voluntary modulation strength. In summary, this study discovered specific genetic contributions to perceptual rivalry and its voluntary modulation in human beings. These findings may promote our understanding of psychiatric disorders, as perceptual rivalry is a potential psychiatric biomarker.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual rivalry is an important visual phenomenon in which our perception of a physically constant visual input spontaneously switches between two different states. There are individual variations in perceptual switching rate and voluntary modulation strength. Our genomic analyses reveal several loci associated with these two kinds of variation. Because perceptual rivalry is thought to be relevant to and potentially an endophenotype for psychiatric disorders, these results may help understand not only visual cognition, but also psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>The unique mapping of structural brain connectivity (SC) and functional brain connectivity (FC) on cognition is currently not well understood. It is not clear whether cognition is mapped via a global connectome pattern or instead is underpinned by several sets of distributed connectivity patterns. Moreover, we also do not know whether the spatial distributions of SC and FC that underlie cognition are overlapping or distinct. Here, we study the relationship between SC and FC and an array of psychological tasks in 609 subjects (males, 269; females, 340) from the Human Connectome Project. We identified several sets of connections that each uniquely map onto cognitive function. We found a small number of distributed SCs and a larger set of corticocortical and corticosubcortical FCs that express this association. Importantly, the SC and FC each show unique and distinct patterns of variance across subjects as they relate to cognition. The results suggest that a complete understanding of connectome underpinnings of cognition calls for a combination of the two modalities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Structural connectivity (SC), the physical white-matter inter-regional pathways in the brain, and functional connectivity (FC), the temporal coactivations between the activity of the brain regions, have each been studied extensively. Little is known, however, about the distribution of variance in connections as they relate to cognition. Here, in a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 609), we showed that two sets of brain‚Äìbehavior patterns capture the correlations between SC and FC with a wide range of cognitive tasks, respectively. These brain‚Äîbehavior patterns reveal distinct sets of connections within the SC and the FC network and provide new evidence that SC and FC each provide unique information for cognition.</p>

<p>Brain activity patterns exhibited during task performance have been shown to spontaneously reemerge in the following restful awake state. Such "awake reactivation" has been observed across higher-order cortex for complex images or associations. However, it is still unclear whether the reactivation extends to primary sensory areas that encode simple stimulus features. To address this question, we trained human subjects from both sexes on a particular visual feature (Gabor orientation) and tested whether this feature will be reactivated immediately after training. We found robust reactivation in human V1 that lasted for at least 8 min after training offset. This effect was not present in higher retinotopic areas, such as V2, V3, V3A, or V4v. Further analyses suggested that the amount of awake reactivation was related to the amount of performance improvement on the visual task. These results demonstrate that awake reactivation extends beyond higher-order areas and also occurs in early sensory cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we acquire new memories and skills? New information is known to be consolidated during offline periods of rest. Recent studies suggest that a critical process during this period of consolidation is the spontaneous reactivation of previously experienced patterns of neural activity. However, research in humans has mostly examined such reactivation processes in higher-order cortex. Here we show that awake reactivation occurs even in the primary visual cortex V1 and that this reactivation is related to the amount of behavioral learning. These results pinpoint awake reactivation as a process that likely occurs across the entire human brain and could play an integral role in memory consolidation.</p>

<p>The basal ganglia (BG) participate in aspects of reinforcement learning that require evaluation and selection of motor programs associated with improved performance. However, whether the BG additionally contribute to behavioral variation ("motor exploration") that forms the substrate for such learning remains unclear. In songbirds, a tractable system for studying BG-dependent skill learning, a role for the BG in generating exploratory variability, has been challenged by the finding that lesions of Area X, the song-specific component of the BG, have no lasting effects on several forms of vocal variability that have been studied. Here we demonstrate that lesions of Area X in adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia gutatta</i>) permanently eliminate rapid within-syllable variation in fundamental frequency (FF), which can act as motor exploration to enable reinforcement-driven song learning. In addition, we found that this within-syllable variation is elevated in juveniles and in adults singing alone, conditions that have been linked to enhanced song plasticity and elevated neural variability in Area X. Consistent with a model that variability is relayed from Area X, via its cortical target, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), to influence song motor circuitry, we found that lesions of LMAN also eliminate within-syllable variability. Moreover, we found that electrical perturbation of LMAN can drive fluctuations in FF that mimic naturally occurring within-syllable variability. Together, these results demonstrate that the BG are a central source of rapid behavioral variation that can serve as motor exploration for vocal learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many complex motor skills, such as speech, are not innately programmed but are learned gradually through trial and error. Learning involves generating exploratory variability in action ("motor exploration") and evaluating subsequent performance to acquire motor programs that lead to improved performance. Although it is well established that the basal ganglia (BG) process signals relating to action evaluation and selection, whether and how the BG promote exploratory motor variability remain unclear. We investigated this question in songbirds, which learn to produce complex vocalizations through trial and error. In contrast with previous studies that did not find effects of BG lesions on vocal motor variability, we demonstrate that the BG are an essential source of rapid behavioral variation linked to vocal learning.</p>

<p>Although age-at-injury influences chronic recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI), the differential effects of age on early outcome remain understudied. Using a male murine model of moderate contusion injury, we investigated the underlying mechanism(s) regulating the distinct response between juvenile and adult TBI. We demonstrate similar biomechanical and physical properties of naive juvenile and adult brains. However, following controlled cortical impact (CCI), juvenile mice displayed reduced cortical lesion formation, cell death, and behavioral deficits at 4 and 14 d. Analysis of high-resolution laser Doppler imaging showed a similar loss of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ipsilateral cortex at 3 and 24 h post-CCI, whereas juvenile mice showed enhanced subsequent restoration at 2‚Äì4 d compared with adults. These findings correlated with reduced blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) disruption and increased perilesional vessel density. To address whether an age-dependent endothelial cell (EC) response affects vessel stability and tissue outcome, we magnetically isolated CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs from sham and injured cortices and evaluated mRNA expression. Interestingly, we found increased transcripts for BBB stability-related genes and reduced expression of BBB-disrupting genes in juveniles compared with adults. These differences were concomitant with significant changes in miRNA-21-5p and miR-148a levels. Accompanying these findings was robust GFAP immunoreactivity, which was not resolved by day 35. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EC-specific Tie2 signaling abolished the juvenile protective effects. These findings shed new mechanistic light on the divergent effects that age plays on acute TBI outcome that are both spatial and temporal dependent.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although a clear "window of susceptibility" exists in the developing brain that could deter typical developmental trajectories if exposed to trauma, a number of preclinical models have demonstrated evidence of early recovery in younger patients. Our findings further demonstrate acute neuroprotection and improved restoration of cerebral blood flow in juvenile mice subjected to cortical contusion injury compared with adults. We also demonstrate a novel role for endothelial cell-specific Tie2 signaling in this age-related response, which is known to promote barrier stability, is heightened in the injured juvenile vasculature, and may be exploited for therapeutic interventions across the age spectrum following traumatic brain injury.</p>

<p>A pervasive belief with regard to the differences between human language and
animal vocal sequences (song) is that they belong to different classes of
computational complexity, with animal song belonging to regular languages,
whereas human language is superregular. This argument, however, lacks empirical
evidence since superregular analyses of animal song are understudied. The goal
of this paper is to perform a superregular analysis of animal song, using data
from gibbons as a case study, and demonstrate that a superregular analysis can
be effectively used with non-human data. A key finding is that a superregular
analysis does not increase explanatory power but rather provides for compact
analysis. For instance, fewer grammatical rules are necessary once
superregularity is allowed. This pattern is analogous to a previous
computational analysis of human language, and accordingly, the null hypothesis,
that human language and animal song are governed by the same type of
grammatical systems, cannot be rejected.

<p>Latent variable models have been widely applied for the analysis and
visualization of large datasets. In the case of sequential data, closed-form
inference is possible when the transition and observation functions are linear.
However, approximate inference techniques are usually necessary when dealing
with nonlinear dynamics and observation functions. Here, we propose a novel
variational inference framework for the explicit modeling of time series,
Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (VIND), that is able to uncover
nonlinear observation and transition functions from sequential data. The
framework includes a structured approximate posterior, and an algorithm that
relies on the fixed-point iteration method to find the best estimate for latent
trajectories. We apply the method to several datasets and show that it is able
to accurately infer the underlying dynamics of these systems, in some cases
substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on many visual tasks. Recently, they became useful models for the
visual system in neuroscience. However, it is still not clear what are learned
by CNNs in terms of neuronal circuits. When a deep CNN with many layers is used
for the visual system, it is not easy to compare the structure components of
CNN with possible neuroscience underpinnings due to highly complex circuits
from the retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing
on single retinal ganglion cells with biophysical models and recording data
from animals. By training CNNs with white noise images to predict neuronal
responses, we found that fine structures of the retinal receptive field can be
revealed. Specifically, convolutional filters learned are resembling biological
components of the retinal circuit. This suggests that a CNN learning from one
single retinal cell reveals a minimal neural network carried out in this cell.
Furthermore, when CNNs learned from different cells are transferred between
cells, there is a diversity of transfer learning performance, which indicates
that CNNs are cell-specific. Moreover, when CNNs are transferred between
different types of input images, here white noise v.s. natural images, transfer
learning shows a good performance, which implies that CNN indeed captures the
full computational ability of a single retinal cell for different inputs. Taken
together, these results suggest that CNN could be used to reveal structure
components of neuronal circuits, and provide a powerful model for neural system
identification.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39866">Light-dependent pathways for dopaminergic amacrine cell development and function</a></h4>

Retinal dopamine is a critical modulator of high acuity, light-adapted vision and photoreceptor coupling in the retina. Dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs) serve as the sole source of retinal dopamine, and dopamine release in the retina follows a circadian rhythm and is modulated by light exposure. However, the retinal circuits through which light influences the development and function of DACs are still unknown. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) have emerged as a prime target for influencing retinal dopamine levels because they costratify with DACs in the inner plexiform layer and signal to them in a retrograde manner. Surprisingly, using genetic mouse models lacking specific phototransduction pathways, we find that while light influences the total number of DACs and retinal dopamine levels, this effect does not require ipRGCs. Instead, we find that the rod pathway is a critical modulator of both DAC number and retinal dopamine levels.

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for control of social behavior and is commonly studied in disorders of social dysfunction. Here, Liang et¬†al. perform calcium imaging in the mPFC of freely behaving mice, elucidating the complex dynamics of mPFC neurons during social behavior and changes in activity after pharmacological disruption.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces an acute inflammatory response across multiple organs, primarily via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We sought to define novel aspects of the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of LPS-induced inflammation using computational modeling, with a special focus on the timing of pathological systemic spillover. An analysis of principal drivers of LPS-induced inflammation in the heart, gut, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney to assess organ-specific dynamics, as well as in the plasma (as an assessment of systemic spillover), was carried out using data on 20 protein-level inflammatory mediators measured over 0-48h in both C57BL/6 and TLR4-null mice. Using a suite of computational techniques, including a time-interval variant of Principal Component Analysis, we confirm key roles for cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and interleukin-17A, define a temporal hierarchy of organ-localized inflammation, and infer the point at which organ-localized inflammation spills over systemically. Thus, by employing a systems biology approach, we obtain a novel perspective on the time- and organ-specific components in the propagation of acute systemic inflammation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b_z81C4ecvc" width="1" />

<p>by Francisco J. H. Heras, Mikko V√§h√§s√∂yrinki, Jeremy E. Niven</p>

Modulation is essential for adjusting neurons to prevailing conditions and differing demands. Yet understanding how modulators adjust neuronal properties to alter information processing remains unclear, as is the impact of neuromodulation on energy consumption. Here we combine two computational models, one Hodgkin-Huxley type and the other analytic, to investigate the effects of neuromodulation upon <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> photoreceptors. Voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductances: (i) activate upon depolarisation to reduce membrane resistance and adjust bandwidth to functional requirements; (ii) produce negative feedback to increase bandwidth in an energy efficient way; (iii) produce shunt-peaking thereby increasing the membrane gain bandwidth product; and (iv) inactivate to amplify low frequencies. Through their effects on the voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductances, three modulators, serotonin, calmodulin and PIP2, trade-off contrast gain against membrane bandwidth. Serotonin shifts the photoreceptor performance towards higher contrast gains and lower membrane bandwidths, whereas PIP2 and calmodulin shift performance towards lower contrast gains and higher membrane bandwidths. These neuromodulators have little effect upon the overall energy consumed by photoreceptors, instead they redistribute the energy invested in gain versus bandwidth. This demonstrates how modulators can shift neuronal information processing within the limitations of biophysics and energy consumption.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ULOv6ShVnUE" width="1" />

<p>Striatal dopamine (DA) is a major player in action selection and reinforcement. DA release is under strong local control by striatal ACh acting at axonal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on DA axons. Striatal nAChRs have been shown to control how DA is released in response to ascending activity from DA neurons, and they also directly drive DA release following synchronized activity in a small local cholinergic network. The source of striatal ACh has been thought to arise solely from intrinsic cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), but recent findings have identified a source of cholinergic inputs to striatum from brainstem nuclei, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). Here, we used targeted optogenetic activation alongside DA detection with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to test whether ChIs alone and/or brainstem afferents to the striatum can account for how ACh drives and modulates DA release in rat striatum. We demonstrate that targeted transient light activation of rat striatal ChIs drives striatal DA release, corroborating and extending previous observations in mouse to rat. However, the same light stimulation targeted to cholinergic brainstem afferents did not drive DA release, and nor did it modulate DA release activated subsequently by electrical stimulation, whereas targeted activation of ChIs did so. We were unable to obtain any evidence for DA modulation by PPN/LDT stimulation. By contrast, we could readily identify that striatal ChIs alone are sufficient to provide a source of ACh that powerfully regulates DA via nAChRs.</p>

<p>Alterations in the corticostriatal system have been implicated in numerous substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Adaptations in this neural system are associated with enhanced drug-seeking behaviors following exposure to cues predicting drug availability. Therefore, understanding how potential treatments alter neural activity in this system could lead to more refined and effective approaches for AUD. Local field potentials (LFPs) were acquired simultaneously in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NA) of both alcohol preferring (P) and Wistar rats engaged in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a light cue signaled the availability of ethanol (EtOH). On test days, the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone was administered prior to conditioning. Stimulus-evoked voltage changes were observed following the presentation of the EtOH cue in both strains and were most pronounced in the PFC of P rats. Phase analyses of LFPs in the  band (5‚Äì11 Hz) revealed that PFC-NA synchrony was reduced in P rats relative to Wistars but was robustly increased during drinking. Presentation of the cue resulted in a larger phase reset in the PFC of P rats but not Wistars, an effect that was attenuated by tolcapone. Additionally, tolcapone reduced cued EtOH intake in P rat but not Wistars. These results suggest a link between corticostriatal synchrony and genetic risk for excessive drinking. Moreover, inhibition of COMT within these systems may result in reduced attribution of salience to reward paired stimuli via modulation of stimulus-evoked changes to cortical oscillations in genetically susceptible populations.</p>

Abstract
<p>Sensory prostheses can restore aspects of natural sensation by delivering electrical current directly into sensory circuits. An effective sensory prosthetic should be capable of generating reliable real-time perceptual signals for hours each day over many years. However, we still know little regarding the stability of percepts produced by electrical microstimulation of cerebral sensory cortex when stimulation is delivered repeatedly over long periods. Developing methods that yield highly sensitive and reliable assessments of a subject‚Äôs sensitivity to stimulation is important for developing prosthetic devices that can mimic the constant stream of information inherent in daily experience. Here, we trained rhesus monkeys to report electrical microstimulation of their primary visual cortex (V1) and measured how repeated stimulation affected the minimal electrical current needed to generate a percept (behavioral detection threshold). Using adaptive staircase procedures with a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) detection task, we obtained highly reliable detection threshold measures with as few as 100 trials. Using either chronically implanted or acutely inserted microelectrodes, we found that repeated electrical microstimulation elevated detection thresholds, with effects persisting between daily testing sessions. Our results demonstrate task designs that can support rapid and reliable measurements of detection thresholds, and point to the need for validation that detection thresholds in targeted structures will be sufficiently stable in the face of the amount of chronic stimulation that will be required for effective sensory prosthetics.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0272-18.2018?rss=1">Inhibition of Pyramidal Neurons in the Basal Amygdala Promotes Fear Learning</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>The basolateral amygdala complex, which contains the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) subnuclei, is a critical substrate of associative learning related to reward and aversive stimuli. Auditory fear conditioning studies in rodents have shown that the excitation of LA pyramidal neurons, driven by the inhibition of local GABAergic interneurons, is critical to fear memory formation. Studies examining the role of the BA in auditory fear conditioning, however, have yielded divergent outcomes. Here, we used a neuron-specific chemogenetic approach to manipulate the excitability of mouse BA neurons during auditory fear conditioning. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of BA GABA neurons, but not BA pyramidal neurons, impaired fear learning. Further, either chemogenetic stimulation of BA GABA neurons or chemogenetic inhibition of BA pyramidal neurons was sufficient to generate the formation of an association between a behavior and a neutral auditory cue. This chemogenetic memory required presentation of a discrete cue, and was not attributable to an effect of BA pyramidal neuron inhibition on general freezing behavior, locomotor activity, or anxiety. Collectively, these data suggest that BA GABA neuron activation and the subsequent inhibition of BA pyramidal neurons play important role in fear learning. Moreover, the roles of inhibitory signaling differ between the LA and BA, with excitation of pyramidal neurons promoting memory formation in the former, and inhibition of pyramidal neurons playing this role in the latter.</p>

<p>by Keisuke Fujii, Takeshi Kawasaki, Yuki Inaba, Yoshinobu Kawahara</p>

Modeling the complex collective behavior is a challenging issue in several material and life sciences. The collective motion has been usually modeled by simple interaction rules and explained by global statistics. However, it remains difficult to bridge the gap between the dynamic properties of the complex interaction and the emerging group-level functions. Here we introduce decomposition methods to directly extract and classify the latent global dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner, even including complex interaction in few data dimensions. We first verified that the basic decomposition method can extract and discriminate the dynamics of a well-known rule-based fish-schooling (or bird-flocking) model. The method extracted different temporal frequency modes with spatial interaction coherence among three distinct emergent motions, whereas these wave properties in multiple spatiotemporal scales showed similar dispersion relations. Second, we extended the basic method to map high-dimensional feature space for application to actual small-dimensional systems complexly changing the interaction rules. Using group sports human data, we classified the dynamics and predicted the group objective achievement. Our methods have a potential for classifying collective motions in various domains which obey in non-trivial dominance law known as active matters.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NsjShI_rpFk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5FzLM7-LUk4/article">Synthetic protein alignments by CCMgen quantify noise in residue-residue contact prediction</a></h4>

<p>by Susann Vorberg, Stefan Seemayer, Johannes S√∂ding</p>

Compensatory mutations between protein residues in physical contact can manifest themselves as statistical couplings between the corresponding columns in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the protein family. Conversely, large coupling coefficients predict residues contacts. Methods for de-novo protein structure prediction based on this approach are becoming increasingly reliable. Their main limitation is the strong systematic and statistical noise in the estimation of coupling coefficients, which has so far limited their application to very large protein families. While most research has focused on improving predictions by adding external information, little progress has been made to improve the statistical procedure at the core, because our lack of understanding of the sources of noise poses a major obstacle. First, we show theoretically that the expectation value of the coupling score assuming no coupling is proportional to the product of the square roots of the column entropies, and we propose a simple entropy bias correction (EntC) that subtracts out this expectation value. Second, we show that the average product correction (APC) includes the correction of the entropy bias, partly explaining its success. Third, we have developed CCMgen, the first method for simulating protein evolution and generating realistic synthetic MSAs with pairwise statistical residue couplings. Fourth, to learn exact statistical models that reliably reproduce observed alignment statistics, we developed CCMpredPy, an implementation of the persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) method for exact inference. Fifth, we demonstrate how CCMgen and CCMpredPy can facilitate the development of contact prediction methods by analysing the systematic noise contributions from phylogeny and entropy. Using the entropy bias correction, we can disentangle both sources of noise and find that entropy contributes roughly twice as much noise as phylogeny.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5FzLM7-LUk4" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HpvJUPawGl8/article">Chromatin remodelers couple inchworm motion with twist-defect formation to slide nucleosomal DNA</a></h4>

<p>by Giovanni B. Brandani, Shoji Takada</p>

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are molecular machines that control genome organization by repositioning, ejecting, or editing nucleosomes, activities that confer them essential regulatory roles on gene expression and DNA replication. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of active nucleosome sliding by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the Snf2 remodeler translocase in complex with a nucleosome. During its inchworm motion driven by ATP consumption, the translocase overwrites the original nucleosome energy landscape via steric and electrostatic interactions to induce sliding of nucleosomal DNA unidirectionally. The sliding is initiated at the remodeler binding location via the generation of a pair of twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate to complete sliding throughout the entire nucleosome. We also reveal how remodeler mutations and DNA sequence control active nucleosome repositioning, explaining several past experimental observations. These results offer a detailed mechanistic picture of remodeling important for the complete understanding of these key biological processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HpvJUPawGl8" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How does attention route information from sensory to high-order areas as a function of task, within the relatively fixed topology of the brain? In this study, participants were simultaneously presented with 2 unrelated stories‚Äîone spoken and one written‚Äîand asked to attend one while ignoring the other. We used fMRI and a novel intersubject correlation analysis to track the spread of information along the processing hierarchy as a function of task. Processing the unattended spoken (written) information was confined to auditory (visual) cortices. In contrast, attending to the spoken (written) story enhanced the stimulus-selective responses in sensory regions and allowed it to spread into higher-order areas. Surprisingly, we found that the story-specific spoken (written) responses for the attended story also reached secondary visual (auditory) regions of the unattended sensory modality. These results demonstrate how attention enhances the processing of attended input and allows it to propagate across brain areas.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) leads to developmental brain disorders, but whether the pathogenic mechanism impacts neurons already at birth is not known. We now report that MIA abolishes in mice the oxytocin-mediated delivery Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this is restored by the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide. Furthermore, MIA hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth have a more exuberant apical arbor organization and increased apical dendritic length than age-matched controls. The frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents is also increased in MIA offspring, as well as the pairwise correlation of the synchronized firing of active cells in CA3. These alterations produced by MIA persist, since at P14‚Äì15 GABA action remains depolarizing, produces excitatory action, and network activity remains elevated with a higher frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. Therefore, the pathogenic actions of MIA lead to important morphophysiological and network alterations in the hippocampus already at birth.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fronto-striatal circuitry involving the orbitofrontal cortex has been identified as mediating successful reversal of stimulus-outcome contingencies. The region of the striatum that most contributes to reversal learning remains unclear, with studies in primates implicating both caudate nucleus and putamen. We trained four marmosets on a touchscreen-based serial reversal task and implanted each with cannulae targeting both putamen and caudate bilaterally. This allowed reversible inactivation of the two areas within the same monkeys, but across separate sessions, to directly investigate their respective contributions to reversal performance. Behavioral sensitivity to the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol varied across subjects and between brain regions, so each marmoset received a range of doses. Intermediate doses of intra-putamen muscimol selectively impaired reversal performance, leaving the baseline discrimination phase unchanged. There was no effect of low doses and high doses were generally disruptive. By contrast, low doses of intra-caudate muscimol improved reversal performance, while high doses impaired both reversal and baseline discrimination performance. These data provide evidence for a specific role of the putamen in serial reversal learning, which may reflect the more habitual nature of repeated reversals using the same stimulus pair.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but how high blood cholesterol levels are linked to neurodegeneration is still unknown. Here, we show that an excess of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier permeable cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) impairs neuronal morphology and reduces hippocampal spine density and the levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Dendritic spines are the main postsynaptic elements of excitatory synapses and are crucial structures for memory and cognition. Furthermore, PSD95 has an essential function for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. PSD95 synthesis is controlled by the REST‚ÄìmiR124a‚ÄìPTBP1 axis. Here, we report that high levels of 27-OH induce REST‚ÄìmiR124a‚ÄìPTBP1 axis dysregulation in a possible RxRŒ≥-dependent manner, suggesting that 27-OH reduces PSD95 levels through this mechanism. Our results reveal a possible molecular link between hypercholesterolemia and neurodegeneration. We discuss the possibility that reduction of 27-OH levels could be a useful strategy for preventing memory and cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding homologies and differences in auditory cortical processing in human and nonhuman primates is an essential step in elucidating the neurobiology of speech and language. Using fMRI responses to natural sounds, we investigated the representation of multiple acoustic features in auditory cortex of awake macaques and humans. Comparative analyses revealed homologous large-scale topographies not only for frequency but also for temporal and spectral modulations. In both species, posterior regions preferably encoded relatively fast temporal and coarse spectral information, whereas anterior regions encoded slow temporal and fine spectral modulations. Conversely, we observed a striking interspecies difference in cortical sensitivity to temporal modulations: While decoding from macaque auditory cortex was most accurate at fast rates (&gt; 30 Hz), humans had highest sensitivity to ~3 Hz, a relevant rate for speech analysis. These findings suggest that characteristic tuning of human auditory cortex to slow temporal modulations is unique and may have emerged as a critical step in the evolution of speech and language.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A major limitation of conventional human brain research has been its basis in highly artificial laboratory experiments. Due to technical constraints, little is known about the nature of cortical activations during ecological real life. We have previously proposed the ‚Äúspontaneous trait reactivation (STR)‚Äù hypothesis arguing that resting-state patterns, which emerge spontaneously in the absence of external stimulus, reflect the statistics of habitual cortical activations during real life. Therefore, these patterns can serve as a window into daily life cortical activity. A straightforward prediction of this hypothesis is that spontaneous patterns should preferentially correlate to patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli compared with artificial ones. Here we targeted high-level category-selective visual areas and tested this prediction by comparing BOLD functional connectivity patterns formed during rest to patterns formed in response to naturalistic stimuli, as well as to more artificial category-selective, dynamic stimuli. Our results revealed a significant correlation between the resting-state patterns and functional connectivity patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli. Furthermore, the correlations to naturalistic stimuli were significantly higher than those found between resting-state patterns and those generated by artificial control stimuli. These findings provide evidence of a stringent link between spontaneous patterns and the activation patterns during natural vision.</span>

ABSTRACT<p>Auditory-nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls, aged between posthatching day 11 and 86, in terminal experiments under two different anaesthetic regimes: ketamine (6-11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (around 2 mg/kg), or isoflurane (1-1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (<i>Tyto alba</i>), aged between 5 and 32 months, under three different anaesthetic protocols: Ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1-1.5%) and sevoflurane (2-3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anaesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve, i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system. The effect was drastic in the young animals which suffered threshold elevations in auditory-nerve single-unit responses of 20 dB or more. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared to ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours which suggested oxygen toxicity.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anaesthesia and analgesia are necessary for most invasive experiments. Their effects are also a concern for studying normal neural and sensory functions. We show a significant deterioration of hearing sensitivity of the auditory nerve under gas anaesthesia (isoflurane or sevoflurane), compared to injection anaesthesia with ketamine/xylazine, in barn owls. This generalises similar findings across birds and mammals and suggests that while inhalants are widely recommended as safe and easy-to-use anaesthetics in veterinary contexts, they should only be used with great caution in auditory neurophysiology, even at the most peripheral level. Future important questions are whether the deterioration of sensitivity at the periphery generalises to other senses and what the precise mechanisms are that determine the species-specific extent of sensitivity loss.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, open‚Äêlabel, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‚Äêhour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‚Äê to 6‚Äêhour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;1‚Äì12</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25373?af=R">Reduced brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CSF orexin‚ÄêA, and cognitive profile.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive and <sup>18</sup>F‚Äêflorbetapir‚Äêpositron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged ‚â•65 years (n=23) and in age‚Äê and sex‚Äêmatched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n=69) and the Multi‚Äêdomain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT‚ÄêAV45; n=23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUV) of the cortical retention index for six regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to three subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ‚â•1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT‚ÄêAV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios: 0.95¬±0.15, 1.11¬±0.18 (p&lt;0.0001), and 1.14 ¬±0.17 (p=0.0005), respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only one patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET‚Äêamyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin‚ÄêA, CSF AD biomarkers or neuropsychological profile.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by <sup>18</sup>F‚Äêflorbetapir‚ÄêPET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R">The neural basis of induced phantom limb pain relief</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‚Äêrelated disease mechanisms. Non‚Äêinvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. While NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‚Äêinduced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalisation to related conditions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a within‚Äêparticipants, double‚Äêblind, and sham‚Äêcontrolled design to alleviate PLP via task‚Äêconcurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least one week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‚Äê and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‚Äê and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‚Äêconcurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A professional violinist reported increasing difficulties playing the violin. He executed the initial half of the musical piece well, but produced an increasing number of mistakes during the second half. Neurological examination was remarkable for bradykinesia and tremor. Formal acoustic analysis of finger taps and pronation‚Äêsupination showed a decrement in sound intensity and number of taps over time. Oscillations in performance correlated with a parkinsonian tremor. We interpret these findings as the audible equivalent of bradykinesia and tremor. Listening to bradykinesia and quantifying its decrement using acoustic analysis may offer a simple, objective and reliable supplement to the neurological examination.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‚Äêmatched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using two‚Äêway ANOVA with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in ms; VS: 152.7¬±7.9 vs. M: 145.3¬±9.8 vs. C: 145.5¬±9.4; F=3.28; p=0.046) and reduced N75‚ÄêP100 amplitudes (in ŒºV; VS: 7.4¬±3.5 vs. M: 12.5¬±4.7 vs. C: 10.8¬±3.4; F=3.16; p=0.051). Dunnett post‚Äêhoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We conducted a European‚Äêonly and trans‚Äêancestral genome‚Äêwide association meta‚Äêanalysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; p=2.2E‚Äê8; OR=1.05[1.04‚Äê1.07]) and variants in an intron of <i>COL4A1</i> (rs9521634, p‚Äêvalue=3.8E‚Äê8, OR=1.04[1.03‚Äê1.06]) and near <i>DYRK1A</i> (rs720470, p=6.1E‚Äê9; OR=1.05[1.03‚Äê1.07]) at genome‚Äêwide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian Randomization we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) ‚Äì nitric oxide (NO) pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.</p>

In 2006, Ma et al. presented an elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.

Large-scale efforts are underway to map the neuronal connectomes of various animal species. In 1986 White et al. reported the first complete reconstruction of the nervous system connectome of an animal. Largely through manual reconstruction of serial electron micrographs, the authors characterized the morphology of each of the 302 neurons of the adult nematode C. elegans, and mapped the chemical and electrical synapses that connect them. This wiring diagram has profoundly influenced behavioral neurobiology and network science, and it continues to offer a guide for the impact of connectomics on neurobiology.

Abstract<p>Pain serves vital protective functions, which crucially depend on appropriate motor responses to noxious stimuli. Such responses not only depend on but can themselves shape the perception of pain. In chronic pain, perception is often decoupled from noxious stimuli and motor responses are no longer protective, which suggests that the relationships between noxious stimuli, pain perception and behavior might be changed. We here performed a simple experiment to quantitatively assess the relationships between noxious stimuli, perception and behavior in 22 chronic pain patients and 22 age-matched healthy human participants. Brief noxious and tactile stimuli were applied to the participants‚Äô hands and participants performed speeded motor responses and provided perceptual ratings of the stimuli. Multi-level moderated mediation analyses assessed the relationships between stimulus intensity, perceptual ratings and reaction times for both stimulus types. The results revealed a significantly stronger involvement of motor responses in the translation of noxious stimuli into perception than in the translation of tactile stimuli into perception. This significant influence of motor responses on pain perception was found for both chronic pain patients and healthy participants. Thus, stimulus-perception-behavior relationships appear to be at least partially preserved in chronic pain patients and motor-related as well as behavioral interventions might harness these functional relationships to modulate pain perception.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Despite its frequent conceptualization as a perceptual phenomenon, the protective function of pain crucially depends on appropriate motor responses to potentially harmful stimuli. However, it is not fully clear how motor responses and pain perception relate to each other. The present study confirms that motor responses to noxious stimuli are significantly involved in shaping pain perception in healthy human participants. Moreover, the results reveal that similar effects can be observed in chronic pain patients. Thus, stimulus-perception-behavior relationships seem to be at least partially preserved in chronic pain patients. This can further the understanding of how behavioral therapies and motor-related stimulation techniques can be used to reshape the perception of pain in chronic pain patients.</p>

Abstract<p>Cholinergic neuromodulation is thought to shape network activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and thus PFC-dependent cognitive functions. Acetylcholine (ACh) may modulate the activity of parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) neurons, which critically regulate cortical network function. However, the mechanisms of cholinergic regulation of PV<sup>+</sup> neuron activity, and particularly of the basket (BC) versus chandelier (ChC) subtypes, are unclear.</p><p>Using patch clamp recordings in acute slices, we examined the effects of the ACh receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol on the excitatory synaptic drive onto BCs or ChCs in layers 2 to 6 of mouse PFC. Carbachol increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) recorded from PV<sup>+</sup> BCs in layers 3-6, but not in BCs from layer 2. Moreover, carbachol did not change the sEPSCs in ChCs, which were located exclusively in layer 2. The potentiation of sEPSCs in layers 3-6 BCs was prevented by the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker tetrodotoxin and was abolished by the M1-selective muscarinic AChR antagonist pirenzepine. Thus, carbachol potentiates the activity-dependent excitatory drive onto PV<sup>+</sup> neurons via M1-muscarinic AChR activation in a cell type- and layer-specific manner. In current clamp recordings with synaptic transmission blocked, carbachol directly evoked firing in deep layer pyramidal neurons (PNs). In contrast, carbachol elicited deep layer BC firing indirectly, via glutamate-mediated synaptic drive.</p><p>Our data suggest that ACh powerfully regulates PFC microcircuit function by facilitating the firing of pyramidal neurons that synaptically recruit deep layer PV<sup>+</sup> BC activity, possibly shaping the patterns of network activity that contribute to cognitive function.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Cholinergic neuromodulation and parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) neurons may be essential for regulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) network activity. To determine whether cholinergic input modulates PFC network function via PV<sup>+</sup> neurons, we examined the effects of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on the excitatory synaptic drive onto PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in mouse PFC. Carbachol, via M1 muscarinic receptor activation, potentiated the excitatory synaptic currents onto PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells in deep cortical layers, but not onto superficial layer basket or chandelier cells.

<p>Fear learning and memory are vital for livings to survive, dysfunctions in which have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Appropriate neuronal activation in amygdala is critical for fear memory. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that Neogenin, a DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) family receptor, which plays important roles in axon navigation and adult neurogenesis, is enriched in excitatory neurons in BLA (Basolateral amygdala). Fear memory is impaired in male <i>Neogenin</i> mutant mice. The number of cFos<sup>+</sup> neurons in response to tone-cued fear training was reduced in mutant mice, indicating aberrant neuronal activation in the absence of Neogenin. Electrophysiological studies show that <i>Neogenin</i> mutation reduced the cortical afferent input to BLA pyramidal neurons and compromised both induction and maintenance of Long-Term Potentiation evoked by stimulating cortical afferent, suggesting a role of Neogenin in synaptic plasticity. Concomitantly, there was a reduction in spine density and in frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, suggesting a role of Neogenin in forming excitatory synapses. Finally, ablating <i>Neogenin</i> in the BLA in adult male mice impaired fear memory likely by reducing mEPSC frequency in BLA excitatory neurons. These results reveal an unrecognized function of Neogenin in amygdala for information processing by promoting and maintaining neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity and provide insight into molecular mechanisms of neuronal activation in amygdala.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Appropriate neuronal activation in amygdala is critical for information processing. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Neogenin is known to regulate axon navigation and adult neurogenesis. Here we show that it is critical for neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and thus fear memory by using a combination of genetic, electrophysiological, behavioral techniques. Our studies identify a novel function of Neogenin and provide insight into molecular mechanisms of neuronal activation in amygdala for fear processing.</p>

<p>We created a neural-specific conditional murine <i>glut3</i> (<i>Slc2A3</i>) deletion (<i>glut3</i><sup>flox/flox/nestin-Cre+</sup>) to examine the effect of a lack of Glut3 on neurodevelopment. Compared with age-matched <i>glut3</i><sup>flox/flox</sup> = WT and heterozygotes (<i>glut3</i><sup>flox/+/nestin-Cre+</sup>), we found that a &gt;90% reduction in male and female brain Glut3 occurred by postnatal day 15 (PN15) in <i>glut3</i><sup>flox/flox/nestin-Cre+</sup>. This genetic manipulation caused a diminution in brain weight and cortical thickness at PN15, a reduced number of dendritic spines, and fewer ultrasonic vocalizations. Patch-clamp recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons revealed increased frequency of bicuculline-induced paroxysmal discharges as well as reduced latency, attesting to a functional synaptic and cortical hyperexcitability. Concomitant stunting with lower glucose concentrations despite increased milk intake shortened the lifespan, failing rescue by a ketogenic diet. This led to creating <i>glut3</i><sup>flox/flox/CaMK2Œ±-Cre+</sup> mice lacking Glut3 in the adult male limbic system. These mice had normal lifespan, displayed reduced IPSCs in cortical pyramidal neurons, less anxiety/fear, and lowered spatial memory and motor abilities but heightened exploratory and social responses. These distinct postnatal and adult phenotypes, based upon whether <i>glut3</i> gene is globally or restrictively absent, have implications for humans who carry copy number variations and present with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lack of the key brain-specific glucose transporter 3 gene found in neurons during early postnatal life results in significant stunting, a reduction in dendritic spines found on neuronal processes and brain size, heightened neuronal excitability, along with a shortened lifespan. When occurring in the adult and limited to the limbic system alone, lack of this gene in neurons reduces the fear of spatial exploration and socialization but does not affect the lifespan. These features are distinct heralding differences between postnatal and adult phenotypes based upon whether the same gene is globally or restrictively lacking. These findings have implications for humans who carry copy number variations pertinent to this gene and have been described to present with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Over the past half-century, we have gained significant insights into the molecular biology of long-term memory storage at the level of the synapse. In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved. However, the molecular biology of consolidation at the level of neuronal systems has been relatively neglected. In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A recent study observed a 2‚Äêfold greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in relation to the Œ≤2‚Äêadrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol and a markedly lower risk of PD for the Œ≤2‚Äêadrenoreceptor agonist salbutamol. We examined whether confounding by clinical indication for these medications, that is, tremor and smoking‚Äêrelated pulmonary conditions, explained these associations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a large, population‚Äêbased case‚Äìcontrol study of United States Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 with diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and prescription data (48,295 incident PD cases, 52,324 controls), we examined the risk of PD in relation to use of selected Œ≤ antagonists (propranolol, carvedilol, metoprolol), the Œ≤2 agonist salbutamol, and other medications used for the same clinical indications (primidone, inhaled corticosteroids). We adjusted for demographics, smoking, and overall use of medical care. We then examined the effect of also adjusting for clinical indication and applying medication exposure lagging.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Propranolol appeared to increase PD risk (odds ratio [OR]‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.31‚Äì3.96). When we adjusted for tremor or abnormal involuntary movement prior to the PD diagnosis/reference date and lagged propranolol exposure, the association was 0.97 (95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.80‚Äì1.18). Primidone, also used for tremor, was similarly sensitive to this adjustment and lagging. Œ≤ Antagonists not indicated for tremor appeared to reduce PD risk (carvedilol: OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.77, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.73‚Äì0.81; metoprolol: OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.94, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.91‚Äì0.97) and were insensitive to adjustment for indications and lagging. Neither salbutamol nor inhaled corticosteroids were consistently associated with PD risk.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Œ≤2‚Äêadrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists do not appear to alter PD risk. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

Abstract<p>GABAergic cells constitute 20-40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus (IC, a midbrain auditory hub) to the medial geniculate body (MG, the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus). Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC-MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC-MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC-MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC-MG pathway which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GABAergic cells constitute a substantial proportion (20-40%) of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus to the auditory thalamus. Previous studies highlight a single subtype of GABAergic colliculothalamic cell characterized by a large soma and dense perisomatic input from glutamatergic boutons. In response to a sound, these cells could provide an inhibitory signal to the thalamus that precedes excitation. Here, we demonstrate that colliculothalamic projections arise from four GABAergic cell subtypes. The predominant subtype has a small soma, suggesting slower inhibition that presumably overlaps the arrival of excitatory inputs to the thalamus. The results suggest extensive opportunity for temporal integration of inhibitory and excitatory inputs, and a wider diversity of functions than previously suggested for inhibitory colliculothalamic projections.</p>

Abstract<p>GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) play key roles in reward and aversion through their local inhibitory control of dopamine neuron activity and through long-range projections to several target regions including the nucleus accumbens. It is not clear if some of these GABA neurons are dedicated local interneurons or if they all collateralize and send projections externally as well as making local synaptic connections. Testing between these possibilities has been challenging in the absence of interneuron-specific molecular markers. We hypothesised that one potential candidate might be neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a common interneuronal marker in other brain regions. To test this, we used a combination of immunolabelling (including antibodies for nNOS that we validated in tissue from nNOS-deficient mice) and cell-type-specific virus-based anterograde tracing in mice. We found that nNOS-expressing neurons, in the parabrachial pigmented (PBP) part of the VTA and the SNc were GABAergic and did not make detectable projections, suggesting they may be interneurons. In contrast, nNOS-expressing neurons in the Rostral Linear Nucleus (RLi) were mostly glutamatergic and projected to a number of regions, including the lateral hypothalamus, the ventral pallidum, and the median raphe nucleus. Taken together, these findings indicate that nNOS is expressed by neurochemically- and anatomically-distinct neuronal sub-groups in a sub-region-specific manner in the VTA and SNc.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) play important roles in reward and aversion through their local control of dopamine neuron activity and long-range projections to regions such as the nucleus accumbens.

Abstract<p>CD137L (4-1BBL) is a co-stimulatory molecule whose signaling can promote monocyte/macrophage functions; however, CD137L-mediated microglial response and its role in neuropathic pain remain unknown. We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knockout (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 ¬µg) was also used to identify CD137L‚Äôs window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- vs. anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via <i>quantitative real-time</i> PCR and immunohistochemistry in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1Œ≤<sup>+</sup> cells compared to WT. At 21 days post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase-1<sup>+</sup> cells and arginase-1<sup>+</sup> microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L‚Äôs modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the role of CD137L in the development of neuropathic pain. Our results indicate a contributory role of CD137L in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced sensory hypersensitivity and its modulatory effects on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses within the spinal cord and microglia. Further investigation of CD137L‚Äôs pro-nociceptive effects may result in novel drug targets for neuropathic pain treatment.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Behavioral change is paramount to adaptive behavior. Two ways to achieve alterations in previously established behavior are extinction and overexpectation. The infralimbic (IL) portion of the medial prefrontal cortex controls the inhibition of previously established aversive behavioral responses in extinction. The role of the IL cortex in behavioral modification in appetitive Pavlovian associations remains poorly understood. Here, we seek to determine if the IL cortex modulates overexpectation and extinction of reward learning. Using overexpectation or extinction to achieve a reduction in behavior, the present findings uncover a dissociable role for the IL cortex in these paradigms. Pharmacologically inactivating the IL cortex left overexpectation intact. In contrast, pre-training manipulations in the IL cortex prior to extinction facilitated the reduction in conditioned responding but led to a disrupted extinction retrieval on test drug-free. Additional studies confirmed that this effect is restricted to the IL and not dependent on the dorsally-located prelimbic cortex. Together, these results show that the IL cortex underlies extinction but not overexpectation-driven reduction in behavior, which may be due to regulating the expression of conditioned responses influenced by stimulus‚Äìresponse associations rather than stimulus‚Äìstimulus associations.</span>

The ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system. These receptors provide a range of temporally diverse signals which stem from subunit composition and also from the inherent ability of each member to occupy multiple functional states, the distribution of which can be altered by small molecule modulators and binding partners. Hence it becomes essential to characterize the conformational landscape of the receptors under this variety of different conditions.

<p>Little is known about how 17Œ≤-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) mediates memory formation in males. In ovariectomized (OVX) mice, bilateral dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusion of E<sub>2</sub> enhances memory consolidation in object recognition (OR) and object placement (OP) tasks in a manner dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling. Here, bilateral DH E<sub>2</sub> infusion enhanced memory consolidation in both tasks among OVX female, gonadally-intact male, and castrated male mice, suggesting comparable facilitation of memory consolidation in both sexes, independent of testicular hormones in males. Contrary to previous reports in OVX mice, E<sub>2</sub> did not increase DH ERK or Akt phosphorylation in males, nor did the ERK inhibitor U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene] prevent E<sub>2</sub> from enhancing memory consolidation among intact and castrated males. These data suggest that ERK activation is not necessary for E<sub>2</sub> to enhance memory consolidation in males, and compared with previous reports in females, reveal novel sex differences in the cell-signaling pathways through which E<sub>2</sub> facilitates memory consolidation. To explore the mechanisms underlying E<sub>2</sub>-induced memory enhancements in males, phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the DH was assessed. E<sub>2</sub> increased phospho-CREB levels in both sexes, yet U0126 did not block these increases in castrated or intact males, indicating that E<sub>2</sub> regulates CREB phosphorylation in males via an ERK-independent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of hippocampal E<sub>2</sub> on memory consolidation in males and females are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, which has important implications for the development of treatments to reduce memory dysfunction in men and women.</p>

Abstract
<p>The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here, we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the <i>identity</i> of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cortical grey matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology in early stages of MS to better predict long‚Äêterm outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n=12, median disease duration 2 years), progressive MS (n=21, disease duration 25 years), non‚Äêdiseased controls (n=11) and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n=6), were quantitatively analysed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and <i>in situ</i> hybridisation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range 1‚Äì 48% of total cortical GM) and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68+) microglia/ macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (p&lt;0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‚Äêlike structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/ macrophage activation (p&lt;0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‚Äêlike structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome.</p>

Abstract<p>Sensory prostheses can restore aspects of natural sensation by delivering electrical current directly into sensory circuits. An effective sensory prosthetic should be capable of generating reliable real-time perceptual signals for hours each day over many years. However, we still know little regarding the stability of percepts produced by electrical microstimulation of cerebral sensory cortex when stimulation is delivered repeatedly over long periods. Developing methods that yield highly sensitive and reliable assessments of a subject‚Äôs sensitivity to stimulation is important for developing prosthetic devices that can mimic the constant stream of information inherent in daily experience. Here, we trained rhesus monkeys to report electrical microstimulation of their primary visual cortex (V1) and measured how repeated stimulation affected the minimal electrical current needed to generate a percept (behavioral detection threshold). Using adaptive staircase procedures with a two-alternative forced-choice detection task, we obtained highly reliable detection threshold measures with as few as 100 trials. Using either chronically implanted or acutely inserted microelectrodes, we found that repeated electrical microstimulation elevated detection thresholds, with effects persisting between daily testing sessions. Our results demonstrate task designs that can support rapid and reliable measurements of detection thresholds, and point to the need for validation that detection thresholds in targeted structures will be sufficiently stable in the face of the amount of chronic stimulation that will be required for effective sensory prosthetics.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Delivering electrical current into sensory brain areas could enable those with compromised sensory systems to partially recover lost senses. Whether repeated stimulation of central sites in the brain changes the ability of the stimulated site to support perception remains unresolved. We present methods for rapid, bias-free and repeatable measures of behavioral thresholds for detecting microstimulation and show that repeated electrical stimulation of visual cortex impairs the ability of monkeys to perceive that stimulation. The results have important implications for the development and use of sensory prosthetics.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0226-18.2018v1?rss=1">Orexinergic modulation of spinal motor activity in the neonatal mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibres were present in the lumbar spinal cord of P0-3 mice. The fibres were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibres were observed in the ventral horn. Both Orexin A (OXA) and Orexin B (OXB) increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly onto MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi (VLF), where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of OXA‚Äôs effects were further investigated in a dorsal horn removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orexinergic cell recordings show that the cell population is highly active during locomotion. In this study, we show that during the first neonatal week, orexin fibres and receptors are present within the spinal cord and that orexins can affect spinal locomotor circuitry. We examine their effects on motoneuron firing and commissural interneurons. Overall, our work establishes that the orexin family contributes to the control of spinal motor function.</p>

<p>Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov‚ÄìHopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0340-18.2018v1?rss=1">Evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vertebrates</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The family of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) consists of five members in mammals, encoded by the <i>CHRM1</i>-5 genes. The mAChRs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which can be divided into two subfamilies: M2 and M4 receptors coupling to G<sub>i/o</sub> and M1, M3 and M5 receptors coupling to G<sub>q/11</sub>. However, despite the fundamental roles played by these receptors their evolution in vertebrates has not yet been fully described. We have combined sequence-based phylogenetic analyses with comparisons of exon-intron organization and conserved synteny in order to deduce the evolution of the mAChR receptors. Our analyses verify the existence of two ancestral genes prior to the two vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R and 2R). After these events, one gene had duplicated resulting in <i>CHRM2</i> and <i>CHRM4</i> and the other had triplicated forming the <i>CHRM1, CHRM3</i> and <i>CHRM5</i> subfamily. All five genes are still present in all vertebrate groups investigated except the <i>CHRM1</i> gene which has not been identified in some of the teleosts or in chicken or any other birds. Interestingly, the third tetraploidization (3R) that took place in the teleost predecessor resulted in duplicates of all five mAChR genes of which all ten are present in zebrafish. One of the copies of the <i>CHRM2</i> and <i>CHRM3</i> genes and both <i>CHRM4</i> copies have gained introns in teleosts. Not a single separate (non-tetraploidization) duplicate has been identified in any vertebrate species. These results clarify the evolution of the vertebrate mAChR family and reveal a doubled repertoire in zebrafish, inviting studies of gene neo- and sub-functionalization.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Despite their pivotal physiological role, the evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has not yet been resolved. By investigating the genomes of a broad selection of vertebrate species and combining three different types of data, namely sequence based phylogeny, conserved synteny and intron organization, we have deduced the evolution of the mAChR genes in relation to the major vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R, 2R and 3R). Our analyses show that all vertebrate mAChR gene duplications resulted from the tetraploidizations. Interestingly, following 3R, zebrafish doubled its gene number, resulting in the ten mAChR genes present. By knowing how and when the mAChR genes arose, studies of receptor subtype specialization and possible neo- or sub-functionalization can follow.</p>
