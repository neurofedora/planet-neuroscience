              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature via central projections of primary afferent sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                TRPV1, a capsaicin- and heat-activated ion channel, is expressed by peripheral nociceptors and has been implicated in various inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. Although pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 has attracted therapeutic interest, many TRPV1 agonists and antagonists produce thermomodulatory side effects in animal models and human clinical trials, limiting their utility. These on-target effects may result from the perturbation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptors, which transduce signals to central thermoregulatory circuits and release proinflammatory factors from their peripheral terminals, most notably the potent vasodilative neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Alternatively, these body temperature effects may originate from the modulation of TRPV1 on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), where channel activation promotes arteriole constriction. Here, we ask which of these pathways is most responsible for the body temperature perturbations elicited by TRPV1 drugs in vivo. We address this question by selectively eliminating TRPV1 expression in sensory neurons or vSMCs and show that only the former abrogates agonist-induced hypothermia and antagonist-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, lesioning the central projections of TRPV1-positive sensory nerve fibers also abrogates drug-mediated thermomodulation, whereas eliminating CGRP has no effect. Thus, TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature by modulating sensory input to the central nervous system, rather than through peripheral actions on the vasculature. These findings suggest how mechanistically distinct TRPV1 antagonists may diminish inflammatory pain without affecting core body temperature.

	<p>The incidence of stroke and the burden on health care and society are expected to increase significantly in the coming years, due to the increasing aging of the population. Various sensory, motor, cognitive and psychological disorders may remain in the patient after survival from a stroke. In hemiplegic patients with movement disorders, the impairment of upper limb function, especially hand function, dramatically limits the ability of patients to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Therefore, one of the essential goals of post-stroke rehabilitation is to restore hand function. The recovery of motor function is achieved chiefly through compensatory strategies, such as hand rehabilitation robots, which have been available since the end of the last century. This paper reviews the current research status of hand function rehabilitation devices based on various types of hand motion recognition technologies and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages, reviews the application of artificial intelligence in hand rehabilitation robots, and summarizes the current research limitations and discusses future research directions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To investigate the altered functional connectivity (FC) of the cerebral hemispheres in patients with morbid obesity (MO) with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) by voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Methods: Patients and matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, and all subjects underwent functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI), and VMHC results were processed statistically to assess the differences in FC in different brain regions between the two groups. We further used ROC curves to evaluate the diagnostic value of these differences. We also used Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis to explore the relationship between changes in VMHC values in specific brain regions, visual acuity, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Conclusions: Patients with morbid obesity and MGD had abnormal FC in the cerebral hemispheres in several specific brain areas, which were mainly concentrated in pathways related to vision and perception and may correlate to some extent with the clinical presentations of the patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes in the retinorecipient superior colliculus display unique cellular and structural properties</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes have long been considered to be a largely homogeneous cell population. Recent studies however suggest that astrocytes are highly adapted to the local neuronal circuitry. Glucose utilization in the retinorecipient superior colliculus (SC) is one of the highest in the brain. Since metabolic support to neurons is a major function of astrocytes, they could be of particular relevance in this region and display specific features. However, little is known about astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in this multisensory brain area. We thus here investigated region-specific cellular and structural properties of astrocytes in the visual layer of the SC. Using morphological reconstructions, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and superresolution imaging, we found that astrocytes from the visual layers of the SC are highly distinct with a higher cellular density, a more complex morphology and a stronger proximity to synapses compared to astrocytes from the primary visual cortex and the hippocampus. These data point to astroglial diversity and specialization within neural circuits integrating sensory information in the adult brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cognitive basis of intracranial self-stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Recently there has been a reckoning in the dopamine field. This has suggested that the dopamine prediction error may function as a teaching signal, without endowing preceding events with value. We studied the cognitive basis of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), a setting where dopamine appears to be valuable. Physiological frequencies seen during reinforcement learning did not support robust ICSS or promote behavior that would indicate the stimulation was represented as a meaningful reward in a specific or general sense. This was despite demonstrating that this same physiologically-relevant signal could function as a teaching signal. However, supraphysiological frequencies supported robust ICSS where the stimulation was represented as a specific sensory event, which acted as a goal to motivate behavior. This demonstrates that dopamine neurons only support ICSS at supraphysiological frequencies, and in a manner that does not reflect our subjective experience with endogenous firing of dopamine neurons during reinforcement learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">3D Direttissima: A V1 Heresy</a></h4>

              
                The heretical conjecture offered here is that a 3-space scene reconstruction of sequences of visual fixations is constructed directly in V1 in a head-centered frame. Direttissima is a climbing term designating the shortest, most direct route to the objective of a climb. The heresy here is the claim that the construction of the first 3D representation of the scene takes place in V1 rather than further up the visual pathways. The inputs to the neural process proposed for such construction are the V1 retinotopic projections from each eye and the vergence angle. Absolute disparities are not encoded as a separate data set in a distinct set of neurons, but rather are emergent properties of the neurons that implement the construction of the 3D representation of one or a sequence of fixations on elements of the scene. In this conjecture, the conscious picture we take as vision is a projection of the 3D construction, not a view of the retinal image. One of the critical psychophysical clues to the nature of such a mechanism is the well known visual size constancy phenomenon. Another property of the proposed mechanism is that it is plausibly fast enough to enable such spatially and temporally demanding tasks as a human batting a fastball or a bobcat swatting the head of a striking rattlesnake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging increased metabolism in the spinal cord in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence indicates crosstalk between the brain and the hematopoietic system follow-ing cerebral ischemia. Here, we investigated metabolism and oxygenation in the spleen and spinal cord in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model that is wide-ly used in focal cerebral ischemia research. Naive, sham and tMCAO mice underwent positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for assessing glucose me-tabolism and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) assisted with quantitative model-based reconstruction and unmixing algorithms for accurate mapping of oxygenation patterns in the peripheral tissues at 24 h after reperfusion. We found increased levels of [18F]FDG uptake and reduced MSOT oxygen saturation, indicating hypoxia in the thoracic spinal cord of tMCAO mice compared with sham-operated mice but not in the spleen. A positive correlation was observed between splenic and ipsilateral striatal [18F]FDG uptake. Reduced spleen size was observed in tMCAO mice compared with sham-operated mice ex vivo. tMCAO led to a significant increase in the numbers of mature T cells (CD4 and CD8) in femoral bone marrow tissues, concomitant with a stark reduction in these cell subsets in the spleen and their decrease in periph-eral blood. The numbers of mature granulocytes (determined as CD11b+Gr1hi cells) decreased in bone marrow tissues and blood but increased in the spleen. The combination of quantitative PET and MSOT thus enabled the observation of hypoxia and increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of tMCAO mice at 24 h after occlusion compared to sham-operated mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in behavioral priority influence the accessibility but not the quality of working memory content.</a></h4>

              
                Efficient behavioral selection requires rapid comparisons of sensory inputs with internal representations of motor affordances and goal states, and many of these comparisons take place in working memory (WM). Selecting an item stored in WM is known to blunt and/or reverse information loss in stimulus-specific representations of that item reconstructed from human brain activity, but extant studies have focused on all-or-none circumstances that allow or prevent an agent from selecting one item stored in WM. Behavioral studies suggest that humans can flexibly assign different levels of priority to different items stored in WM, but how doing so influences neural representations of WM content is unclear. One possibility is that assigning different levels of priority to items in memory influences the quality of those representations, resulting in more robust neural representations of high- vs. low-priority WM content. A second (non-exclusive) possibility is that asymmetries in behavioral priority influence how rapidly neural representations of high- vs. low-priority WM content can be selected and reported. To test these alternatives, we decoded high- and low-priority WM content from EEG recordings obtained while human volunteers performed a retrospectively cued WM task. Probabilistic changes in the behavioral relevance of a remembered item had no effect on asymptotic decoding performance; instead, these changes influenced the latency at which peak decoding performance was reached. Thus, our results indicate that probabilistic changes in the behavioral relevance of WM content influence the ease with which memories can be accessed and retrieved independently of their strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Dual Role for LAR-RPTP in Regulating Long-distance Transport and Synaptic Retention of AMPARs, Essential for Long Term Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                The AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) plays an essential role in excitatory synaptic transmission, learning, and memory. The majority of AMPARs are made in the cell body and are transported by molecular motors to synapses. Maintaining the proper number of synaptic receptors requires coordinated regulation of receptor production, export from the soma and delivery at synapses. This major logistical process is essential for circuit function and behavior. Although recent studies have shown that long-distance synaptic transport is regulated by neuronal activity, little is known about the mechanisms that coordinate somatic export or synaptic delivery and removal. Here we show that loss of the PTP-3A isoform of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP-3 (the C. elegans homologue of vertebrate LAR-RPTP) leads to a ~60% decrease in AMPAR transport; this affects synaptic delivery of AMPARs and synaptic functions necessary for long-term associative olfactory memory in C. elegans. Interestingly, while complete loss of PTP-3A leads to defects in transport and local synaptic trafficking of AMPARs, loss of only PTP-3 phosphatase function affects local synaptic recycling and retention of AMPARs. Finally, we show that the N-terminus of PTP-3A regulates transport, whereas the C-terminal regulates synaptic retention of AMPARs. Altogether, our results suggest a model in which the two domains of PTP-3/LAR-RPTPs have specific, complementary roles in coordinating somatic export and local retention of AMPARs essential for long-term associative memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anandamide reduces excitability by preferentially targeting somatic VGSCs via CB1</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is vital for important brain functions and can be modified pharmacologically to treat pain, epilepsy, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Endocannabinoid mediated changes to excitability are predominantly attributed to 2-arachidonoylglycerol at synapses. Here we identify a pathway in the neocortex by which anandamide, the other major endocannabinoid, powerfully inhibits sodium conductances in the soma resulting in a loss of neuronal excitability. This pathway is mediated by the cannabinoid receptor, and its activation results in a decrease of recurrent action potential generation. The synthetic cannabinoid, Win-55, also inhibits VGSC currents indicating this pathway is positioned to mediate the actions of exogenous cannabinoids.

	<p>Endovascular interventional is an important treatment method for intracranial aneurysms. However, due to the risk of intracranial thrombosis, prophylactic use of antiplatelet drugs is generally required. Clinically, the most commonly used drugs are aspirin and clopidogrel; although the latter can significantly reduce the incidence of thromboembolic complications, there are still some patients with clopidogrel resistance who have ischemic adverse events during antiplatelet therapy. In this study, cohort studies of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library Databases were retrieved to compare the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in endovascular interventional treatment of intracranial aneurysms. A total of 10 cohort studies involving 1377 patients were included in this study. All patients had intracranial aneurysms and underwent endovascular intervention. Platelet function was measured in four of the studies and switched the patients with clopidogrel resistance to ticagrelor, while the remaining six studies did not test platelet function, but were also treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The results of the study showed that ticagrelor, like clopidogrel, can effectively control thrombotic complications in endovascular interventional patients, and also control the occurrence of ischemic complications in clopidogrel-resistant patients. Ticagrelor, as a novel platelet aggregation inhibitor that can reversibly bind to P2Y12 receptor, can effectively control thromboembolic complications without increasing hemorrhagic complications, and is also effective in patients with clopidogrel resistance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau Mediates Synergistic Influence of Vascular Risk and Aβ on Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-Aβ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5 ± 8.0 years). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline Aβ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography (PET). Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6 ± 1.5 years) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0 ± 2.0 years) using the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and Aβ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*Aβ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and Aβ on greater ITC tau accumulation (<i>p</i> = 0.004), even in individuals with Aβ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with Aβ on longitudinal tau (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and Aβ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of Aβ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate Aβ-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Muscarinic and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor blockade reveal differences in hippocampal local field potentials in mice with low cholinergic tone</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We hypothesize that hippocampal local field potentials in acetylcholine (ACh)-deficient mutant mice, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, will show lower sensitivity to muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) but higher sensitivity to NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Recordings were made during walk and awake-immobility (IMM) in WT mice, and in mice with forebrain knockout (KO) of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene, or heterozygous knockdown of VAChT gene (KD). Scopolamine or CPP did not significantly alter walk theta frequency, which was higher in KD than WT/KO mice. Scopolamine decreased theta power peak rise during walk in WT/KD mice but not in KO mice, while CPP suppressed theta peak rise more in WT/KO mice than KD mice. During IMM, scopolamine decreased gamma1 (γ1, 30–58 Hz) power more in KD/WT mice than KO mice, while delta (1–4 Hz) power and delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence (CFC) were increased in all mouse groups during IMM or walk. During walk, scopolamine increased delta and beta (13–30 Hz) power and decreased gamma2 (γ2, 62–100 Hz) power and theta-γ2 CFC more in WT/KD than KO mice. Theta-γ2, but not theta-γ1, CFC increased with theta-peak-frequency in WT/KD mice, and was suppressed by scopolamine at high theta (8–10 Hz) frequency; theta-γ2 CFC in KO mice was not significantly altered by scopolamine. CPP decreased beta and gamma power more in KD/KO mice compared to WT mice, while delta power and delta-gamma CFC were increased in all mouse groups. ACh deficiency exacerbates the attenuation of beta and gamma power by CPP. We conclude that both muscarinic and NMDA transmission contribute toward hippocampal theta, beta, and gamma power, and a decrease in gamma power or theta-gamma CFC may be associated with loss of arousal and cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Low heart rate is associated with cerebral pulsatility after TIA or minor stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Beta-blockers are beneficial in coronary artery disease but less so in stroke prevention and dementia, potentially due to reduced heart rate (HR). Cerebral pulsatility is strongly associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and may be increased by lower diastolic pressures resulting from longer cardiac cycles.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients 4-6 weeks after TIA or non-disabling stroke (Oxford Vascular Study) underwent 5 minutes continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP), ECG and middle cerebral artery flow velocity (transcranial ultrasound). Beat-to-beat relationships between HR, blood pressure and Gosling's pulsatility index (MCA-PI) are reported as beta-coefficients from general linear models for each individual.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Across 759 patients, average MCA-PI during monitoring was associated with lower HR and DBP and greater SBP (∆MCA-PI per 10 bpm/mmHg: -0.02, -0.04, 0.03, all p&lt;0.001), with HR particularly associated with low end-diastolic cerebral velocity (0.86, p=0.014). Beat-to-beat heart rate was strongly associated with concurrent low DBP and high SBP, potentially mediating the association with greater beat-to-beat cerebral pulsatility (average ∆MCA-PI vs HR/DBP/SBP unadjusted: -0.062, -0.052, 0.0092; adjusted for concurrent BP: -0.039, -0.11, 0.041). The beat-to-beat association between HR and MCA-PI increased with age, beta-blockers, arterial stiffness, low HR (age&gt;70+HR&lt;65 versus age&lt;70+HR&gt;65: -0.081 vs -0.024, interaction p&lt;0.001) and severe SVD on MRI (age&gt;70+severe versus age&lt;70+none: -0.087 vs -0.047, interaction p=0.03), with interactions between age, severe SVD and low HR synergistically increasing MCA-PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Low heart rate is associated with greater cerebral pulsatility in patients with SVD, potentially mediated by lower diastolic blood flow and representing a novel potential treatment target.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RatInABox: A toolkit for modelling locomotion and neuronal activity in continuous environments</a></h4>

              
                Generating synthetic locomotory and electrophysiological data is a necessary yet cumbersome step required to study theoretical models of the brain's role in spatial navigation. This process can be time consuming and, without a common framework, makes it difficult to reproduce or compare studies which each generate test data in different ways. In response we present RatInABox, an open-source Python toolkit designed to model realistic rodent locomotion and generate synthetic electrophysiological data from spatially modulated cell types. This software provides users with (i) the ability to construct one- or two-dimensional environments with configurable barriers and rewards, (ii) a realistic motion model for random foraging fitted to experimental data (iii) rapid online calculation of neural data for some of the known self-location or velocity selective cell types in the hippocampal formation (including place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, head direction cells) and (iv) a framework for constructing custom cell types as well as multi-layer network models. Cell activity and the motion model are spatially and temporally continuous and topographically sensitive to boundary conditions and walls. We demonstrate that out-of-the-box parameter settings replicate many aspects of rodent foraging behaviour such as velocity statistics and the tendency of rodents to over-explore walls. Numerous tutorial scripts are provided, including examples in which RatInABox is used for decoding position from neural data, reinforcement learning, or to set up an example circuit capable of learning path integration. We hope this tool significantly streamlines the process of theory-driven research into the brain's role in navigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatio-temporal summation of perimetric stimuli in healthy observers</a></h4>

              
                Spatial summation of perimetric stimuli have been used to derive conclusions about the spatial extent of retinal-cortical convergence, mostly from the size of the critical area of summation (Ricco's area, RA) and critical number of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs). However, spatial summation is known to change dynamically with stimulus duration. Conversely, temporal summation and critical duration also vary with stimulus size. Such an important and often neglected spatio-temporal interaction has important implications for modelling perimetric sensitivity in healthy observers and formulate hypotheses for changes measured in disease. In this work, we performed experiments on visually heathy observers confirming the interaction of stimulus size and duration in determining summation responses in photopic conditions. We then propose a simplified computational model that captures these aspects of perimetric sensitivity by modelling the total retinal input, the combined effect of stimulus size, duration and retinal cones-to-RGC ratio. We additionally show that, in the macula, the enlargement of RA with eccentricity might not correspond to a constant critical number of RGCs, as often reported, but to a constant critical total retinal input. We finally compare our results with previous literature and show possible implications for modelling disease, especially glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A lone spike in blood glucose can enhance the thrombo-inflammatory response in cortical venules</a></h4>

              
                How transient hyperglycemia contributes to cerebro-vascular disease has been a challenge to study under controlled conditions. We present an approach to model luminal vessel thrombo-inflammation using amplified, ultrashort laser-pulses to physically disrupt brain-venule endothelium. Vessel disruption in conjunction with transient hyperglycemia from a single injection of metabolically active D glucose results in real-time responses to venule damage that include rapid serum extravasation, platelet aggregation, and neutrophil recruitment, in normal mice. In contrast, vessel thrombo-inflammation following laser-induced vessel disruption is significantly reduced in mice injected with metabolically inert L-glucose. Thrombo-inflammation is pharmacologically ameliorated by a platelet inhibitor, by a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, or by a nitric oxide donor. For comparison, in diabetic mice injured vessel thrombo-inflammatory responses are also reduced by restoration of normo-glycemia. Our approach provides a controlled method to probe synergies of transient metabolic and physical vascular perturbations and reveals new aspects of brain pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microstimulation of human somatosensory cortex evokes task-dependent, spatially patterned responses in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of somatosensory cortex (S1) can be used to restore tactile feedback to people with spinal cord injury via brain controlled bionic hands. Anatomical and neurophysiological evidence from various animal species points to a communication pathway between motor and somatosensory cortex, but this pathway's normal function, and its relevance to neuroprosthetics, remains to be elucidated. To fill this gap, we delivered - in three human participants whose hands were paralyzed as a result of a spinal cord injury - ICMS to the somatosensory cortex (S1) while recording the responses evoked in the hand and arm representations of primary motor cortex (M1). We found that ICMS activated some M1 neurons at short, fixed latencies, locked to each pulse in a manner consistent with monosynaptic activation. However, most of the changes in M1 firing rates were much more variable in time, suggesting a more indirect effect of the stimulation. The spatial pattern of M1 activation varied systematically depending on the stimulating electrode: S1 electrodes that elicited percepts at a given hand location tended to activate M1 neurons with movement fields at the same location. However, the indirect effects of S1 ICMS on M1 were strongly context dependent, such that the magnitude and even sign relative to baseline varied across tasks. We tested the implications of these effects for brain-control of a virtual hand, in which ICMS was used to convey tactile feedback about object interactions. While ICMS-evoked activation of M1 disrupted decoder performance, this disruption could be minimized with biomimetic stimulation, which emphasizes contact transients at the onset and offset of grasp, reduces sustained stimulation, and has been shown to convey useful contact-related information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation modulates brain-wide functional connectivity to promote anti-correlated activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces action potentials to induce plastic changes in the brain with increasing evidence for the therapeutic importance of brain-wide functional network effects of rTMS; however, the influence of sub-action potential threshold (low-intensity; LI-) rTMS on neuronal activity is largely unknown. Hypothesis: We investigated whether LI-rTMS modulates neuronal activity and functional connectivity. We also specifically assessed modulation of parvalbumin interneuron activity. Methods: We conducted a brain-wide analysis of c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, in mice that received LI-rTMS to visual cortex. Mice received single or multiple sessions of excitatory 10Hz LI-rTMS with custom rodent coils or were sham controls. We assessed changes to c-Fos positive cell densities and c-Fos/parvalbumin co-expression. Peak c-Fos expression corresponded with activity during rTMS. We also assessed functional connectivity changes using brain-wide c-Fos-based network analysis. Results: LI-rTMS modulated c-Fos expression in cortical and subcortical regions. c-Fos density changes were most prevalent with acute stimulation, however chronic stimulation decreased parvalbumin interneuron activity, most prominently in the amygdala and striatum. LI-rTMS also increased anti-correlated functional connectivity, with the most prominent effects also in the amygdala and striatum following chronic stimulation. Conclusion: LI-rTMS induces changes in c-Fos expression that suggest modulation of neuronal activity and functional connectivity throughout the brain. Our results suggest that LI-rTMS promotes anticorrelated functional connectivity, possibly due to decreased parvalbumin interneuron activation induced by chronic stimulation. These changes may underpin therapeutic rTMS effects, therefore modulation of subcortical activity supports rTMS for treatment of disorders involving subcortical dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endocannabinoid-dependent persistent decrease of GABAergic transmission on dopaminergic neurons underlies gene-environment interaction-induced susceptibility to cocaine sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Vulnerability to develop cocaine use disorder depends upon an unpredictable combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Early life adversity and adolescence are critical non-genetic risk factors, and haplotypes of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) genes are among genetic variations increasing the risk of drug-related problems. However, data on the interactions between inheritable risk factors and early life stress (ES) with respect to predisposition to cocaine abuse are limited. Here, we show that a mouse model containing both genetic (low-activity alleles of the MAO A gene; MAOANeo) and environmental (i.e., ES) variables displays a long lasting increased sensitivity to repeated in vivo cocaine psychomotor stimulant actions associated with a reduction of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-dependent form of short-term plasticity, also becomes readily expressed by dopamine neurons from MAOANeoES mice treated repeatedly with cocaine. Activation of either dopamine D2 or CB1 receptors is required for cocaine-induced DSI expression, decreased GABA synaptic efficacy, and hyperlocomotion. Next, in vivo pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG signaling during repeated cocaine exposure occludes its actions both in vivo and ex vivo. This data extends our knowledge of the multifaceted sequelae imposed by this gene by environment interaction in VTA dopamine neurons of male pre-adolescent mice, contributing to our understanding of neural mechanisms of vulnerability for early onset cocaine use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Structural Connectivity Atlas of Limbic Brainstem Nuclei</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the structural connectivity of key brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical regions is essential to the development of therapeutic neuromodulation for depression, chronic pain, addiction, anxiety and movement disorders. Several brainstem nuclei have been identified as the primary central nervous system (CNS) source of important monoaminergic ascending fibers including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. However, due to practical challenges to their study, there is limited data regarding their in vivo anatomic connectivity in humans. To evaluate the structural connectivity of the following brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical areas: locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Additionally, to develop a group average atlas of these limbic brainstem structures to facilitate future analyses. Each nucleus was manually masked from 197 Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural MRI images using FSL software. Probabilistic tractography was performed using FSL's FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Connectivity with limbic cortical regions was calculated and compared between brainstem nuclei. Results were aggregated to produce a freely available MNI structural atlas of limbic brainstem structures. A general trend was observed for a high probability of connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus and DLPFC with relatively lower connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and insula. The locus coeruleus and nucleus tractus solitarius demonstrated significantly greater connectivity to the DLPFC than amygdala while the periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area did not demonstrate a significant difference between these two structures. Monoaminergic and other modulatory nuclei in the brainstem project widely to cortical limbic regions. We describe the structural connectivity across the several key brainstem nuclei theorized to influence emotion, reward, and cognitive functions. An increased understanding of the anatomic basis of the brainstem's role in emotion and other reward-related processing will support targeted neuromodulatary therapies aimed at alleviating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical integration of multi-omics data identifies potential therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are characterized by aggregation of the alpha-synuclein protein in the brain. The causes and consequences of this aggregation are currently unclear, hampering the development of an effective therapy against these synucleinopathies. To gain understanding in the neurobiological events underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation, LUHMES cell lines have been utilized to measure transcriptomics and proteomics data and perform differential regulation analyses. The LUHMES cells have also been used to screen 1600 FDA-approved drugs for their ability to reduce alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity. We implemented a probabilistic data integration method, POPLS-DA, to model alpha-synuclein overexpression in terms of the transcriptomics and proteomics data jointly. Using POPLS-DA, we selected 200 relevant genes and proteins and integrated this gene list with the FDA drugs that were validated to be protective against alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity. Using interactome and functional enrichment analyses, we identified clusters of synaptic and lysosome-related genes and proteins that were targeted by the protective drugs. We found that HSPA5, a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, was one of the most targeted genes by the validated drugs. Our integrative approach results provide new directions for therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG signature of breaks in embodiment in VR</a></h4>

              
                The brain mechanism of embodiment in a virtual body has grown a scientific interest recently, with a particular focus on providing optimal virtual reality (VR) experiences. Disruptions from an embodied state to a less- or non-embodied state, denominated Breaks in Embodiment (BiE), are however rarely studied despite their importance for designing interactions in VR. Here we use electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor the brain's reaction to a BiE, and investigate how this reaction depends on previous embodiment conditions. The experimental protocol consisted of two sequential steps; an induction step where participants were either embodied or non-embodied in an avatar, and a monitoring step where, in some cases, participants saw the avatar's hand move while their hand remained still. Our results show the occurrence of error-related potentials linked to observation of the BiE event in the monitoring step. Importantly, this EEG signature shows amplified potentials following the non-embodied condition, which is indicative of an accumulation of errors across steps. These results provide neurophysiological indications on how progressive disruptions impact the expectation of embodiment for a virtual body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TRPM3 as novel target to alleviate acute oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP) is an adverse effect observed in up to 80% of cancer patients upon treatment with cytostatic drugs including paclitaxel and oxaliplatin. CIPNP can be so severe that it limits dose and choice of chemotherapy, and has a significant negative consequences on the quality of life of survivors. Current treatments for CIPNP are limited and unsatisfactory. TRPM3 is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel functionally expressed in peripheral sensory neurons involved in the detection of thermal stimuli. Here, we focus on the possible involvement of TRPM3 in acute oxaliplatin induced mechanical allodynia and cold hypersensitivity. In vitro calcium microfluorimetry and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that TRPM3 is functionally upregulated in both heterologous and homologous expression systems after acute (24h) oxaliplatin treatment, while direct application of oxaliplatin was without effect. In vivo behavioral studies using an acute oxaliplatin model for CIPNP showed the development of cold and mechano-hypersensitivity in control mice, which was lacking in TRPM3 deficient mice. In addition, the levels of pERK, a marker for neuronal activity, were significantly lower in DRG neurons derived from TRPM3 deficient mice compared to control after oxaliplatin administration. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of a TRPM3 antagonist, isosakuranetin, effectively reduced the oxaliplatin-induced pain behavior in response to cold and mechanical stimulation in mice with an acute form of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. In summary, TRPM3 thus represents a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local brain oscillations and inter-regional connectivity differentially serve sensory and expectation effects on pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain emerges from the integration of sensory information about threats and contextual information such as an individual's expectations. However, how sensory and contextual effects on pain are served by the brain is not fully understood so far. To address this question, we applied brief painful stimuli to 40 healthy human participants and independently varied stimulus intensity and expectations. Concurrently, we recorded electroencephalography. We assessed local oscillatory brain activity and inter-regional functional connectivity in a network of six brain regions playing key roles in the processing of pain. We found that sensory information predominantly influenced local brain oscillations. In contrast, expectations exclusively influenced inter-regional connectivity. Specifically, expectations altered connectivity at alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies from prefrontal to somatosensory cortex. Moreover, discrepancies between sensory information and expectations, i.e., prediction errors, influenced connectivity at gamma (60-100 Hz) frequencies. These findings reveal how fundamentally different brain mechanisms serve sensory and contextual effects on pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical distribution of neurofilaments associates with pathological hallmarks and MRI measures of atrophy and diffusivity in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Increased neurofilament levels in biofluids, commonly used as a proxy for axonal degeneration in the brain, have been found in Parkinson's disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and to correlate with MRI biomarkers. The aim of the current study was to unravel the regional distribution of cortical neurofilaments and their association with pathology load and MRI measures of atrophy and diffusivity in the post-mortem brain. Using a within-subject post-mortem MRI-pathology approach, we included 9 PD, 12 PDD/DLB and 18 age-matched control donors. Cortical thickness and mean diffusivity (MD) metrics were extracted respectively from 3DT1 and DTI at 3T in-situ MRI. After autopsy, pSer129 alpha-synuclein (pSer129-Syn), p-tau, and amyloid-beta, together with neurofilament light-chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament medium- and heavy-chain (p-NfM/H) immunoreactivity were quantified in 7 cortical regions, and studied in detail with confocal-laser scanning microscopy. The correlations between MRI and pathological measures were studied using linear mixed models. Compared to controls, p-NfM/H immunoreactivity was increased in all cortical regions in PD and PDD/DLB, whereas NfL immunoreactivity was mainly increased in the parahippocampal and entorhinal cortex in PDD/DLB. NfL-positive neurons showed degenerative morphological features and axonal fragmentation. Increased p-NfM/H correlated with p-tau load, and NfL correlated with pSer129-Syn but more strongly with p-tau load in PDD/DLB. Lastly, neurofilament immunoreactivity correlated with cortical thinning in PD and with increased cortical MD in PDD/DLB. Taken together, increased neurofilament immunoreactivity suggests underlying axonal injury and neurofilament accumulation in morphologically altered neurons with increasing pathological burden. Importantly, we demonstrate that such neurofilament markers at least partly explain MRI measures that are associated with the neurodegenerative process.

	<p>Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common postoperative complication, particularly in older patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, a non-invasive technique with a high spatial&amp;amp;ndash;temporal resolution, can accurately characterize the dynamic changes in brain function during the perioperative period. Current clinical studies have confirmed that the power density of alpha oscillation during general anesthesia decreased with age, which was considered to be associated with increased susceptibility to PND in the elderly. However, evidence on whether general anesthesia under EEG guidance results in a lower morbidity of PND is still contradictory. This is one of the reasons that common indicators of the depth of anesthesia were limitedly derived from EEG signals in the frontal lobe. The variation of multi-channel EEG features during the perioperative period has the potential to highlight the occult structural and functional abnormalities of the subcortical&amp;amp;ndash;cortical neurocircuit. Therefore, we present a review of the application of multi-channel EEG monitoring to predict the incidence of PND in older patients. The data confirmed that the abnormal variation in EEG power and functional connectivity between distant brain regions was closely related to the incidence and long-term poor outcomes of PND in older adults.</p>

	<p>Flow diverters (FD) have become the mainstay for the endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). Most FD procedures are performed under general anesthesia, and the influence of local anesthesia (LA) on outcomes remains unknown. This study evaluated the results of FD placement under LA. Data of patients treated for FD under LA between August 2016 and January 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0&amp;amp;ndash;2. Major stroke, steno-occlusive events of FD, mortality, and satisfactory aneurysm occlusion were also evaluated. In total, 169 patients undertook 182 treatments (139 [82%) female, mean age 61 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 years). The median maximum aneurysm size was 9.5 mm (interquartile range 6.1-14 mm). A flow re-directed endoluminal device and pipeline embolization device were used in 103 (57%) and 78 (43%) treatments. One patient (0.59%) experienced major stroke, and steno-occlusive events were observed in four patients (2.4%). A good outcome at 90 days was obtained in 164 patients (98%), and one patient died (0.59% mortality). During the median follow-up period of 345 days (interquartile range 176&amp;amp;ndash;366 days), satisfactory aneurysm occlusion was observed in 126 of 160 aneurysms (79%). Our results suggest that FD placement under LA is a safe and effective treatment for UIA.</p>

	<p>The main objective of this study was to examine whether increased levels of inattentive (INA) and hyperactive/impulsive (H/I) behaviours were associated with lower scores on standardized tests of achievement in basic reading, spelling, and math skills, after accounting for certain known background risk factors and cognitive processes. Clinical assessment data from a rigorously diagnosed, stimulant-medication-na&amp;amp;iuml;ve sample of 354 elementary school-aged children experiencing academic difficulties and behavioural symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity were analyzed. Although higher scores of INA were significantly associated with lower scores in reading, spelling, and math, these associations did not persist when cognitive variables were added to the models. H/I was associated with math achievement, along with cognitive and background variables. Overall, cognitive variables accounted for the majority of the variance across basic reading, spelling, and math skills. Additionally, the only background demographic variables associated with academic achievement were age and sex for spelling and math. This finding highlights the importance of looking beyond observable INA and H/I behaviours to determine the underlying factors influencing academic achievement. Accurate identification of deficits in specific academic skills and the underlying factors influencing achievement in these skills are essential components in determining appropriate recommendations and targeted interventions.</p>

	<p>Preterm birth is a neurodevelopmental risk condition often associated with cognitive control (CC) impairment. Recent evidence showed that CC can be implicitly adapted through associative learning. In the present study we investigated the ability to flexibly adjust CC as a function of implicit stimulus-response temporal regularities in preterm (PT; N = 21; mean age 8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years; gestational age 30 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.5 weeks) and full-term (FT; N = 20; mean age 8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years) school-age children. All children underwent an HD-EEG recording while undergoing the Dynamic Temporal Prediction (DTP) task, a simple S1&amp;amp;ndash;S2 detection task purposely designed to generate local-global temporal predictability of imperative stimuli. The Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) was administered to measure explicit CC. The PT group showed more premature and slower (DTP) as well as perseverative (WCST) responses than the FT group. Moreover, pre-terms showed poor adaptive CC as revealed by less efficient global response-speed adjustment. This behavioral pattern was mirrored by a reduced and less sensitive to global manipulation anticipatory Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) and by different cortical source recruitment. These findings suggest that implicit CC may be a reliable endophenotypic marker of atypical cognitive development associated with preterm birth.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mathematical model analysis and numerical simulation of intervention strategies to reduce transmission and re-activation of hepatitis B disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Because of its asymptomatic nature, the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) has become the most lethal and silent killer. In this research, we offer HBV virus transmission characteristics in the form of a mathematical model. We suggested and examined a seven-compartment compartmental nonlinear deterministic mathematical model for transmission dynamics with immigration and HBV reactivation after recovery, as well as control measures for Hepatitis B virus disease transmission. By considering the following facts and cases, this work will provide new knowledge. First, re-infection of HBV after liver transplantation, chemotherapy, and other therapies is one of the most essential aspects in HBV transmission, although reactivation of HBV was not taken into account in some compartmental models of HBV transmission. Furthermore, the exposure rate, immigration rate, and level of infectiousness of the chronic infective class were not given enough weight in the numerical assessment of the force of HBV infection. These facts influenced the development of our model.  Methods: We demonstrated that the solution of the dynamical system under consideration is positive and bounded. The effective reproductive number that represents the epidemic indicator is generated from the biggest eigenvalue of the netgeneration matrix, and the model is examined qualitatively using differential equation stability theory. For disease-free and endemic equilibria, both local and global asymptotic stability criteria are determined.  Results: A full explanation of the parameters and their numerical findings is presented and debated well based on the numerical simulation. Conclusions: According to the findings of this study, vaccination and treatment interventions play a critical role in reducing HBV transmission and reproduction. It has also been demonstrated that HBV reactivation contributes significantly to an increase in theinfective population, which boosts virus transmission, and that a combination of vaccination and treatment will be the most effective strategy for controlling HBV infection and reinfection after recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">CYP2C19 polymorphism and coronary in-stent restenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a major drawback in coronary stenting. The association between the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) gene and the prevalence of ISR after coronary stenting remains controversial. Previous studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by their small population sizes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between the presence of the CYP2C19 LOF gene and the prevalence of ISR. Methods: A systematic online database search was performed until April 2021. The primary outcome was ISR and assessed using OR with 95% CI. Publication bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. I2 was applied to examine heterogeneities among the studies. Results: A total of 284 patients (four non-randomized controlled trial studies) were included in this study. Two hundred and six patients had wild-type genotypes, while 78 patients had the LOF genotype. Among the 78 patients with the LOF gene, 40 patients had an ISR. Meanwhile, of the 206 patients with a wild-type gene, 69 patients had an ISR. The LOF gene was associated with a higher risk of ISR (OR 95% CI = 2.84 [1.54–5.24], p = 0.0008). A major limitation in our study was the small number of previous studies and small sample sizes. Conclusions: Patients with LOF genes, regardless of the allele variation, treated with clopidogrel, had a higher risk of developing ISR after coronary stenting.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After a diet- or surgery induced weight loss almost 1/3 of lost weight consists of fat free mass (FFM) if carried out without additional therapy. Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of stress and its influencing factors among dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kingdom of Bahrain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is well known that all medical professions are linked to work stress, including dentistry, which is seen as facing high risk due to the nature of the job, especially the working conditions. This study aimed to assess the impact of stress and its influencing factors among dentists during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Bahrain. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was designed to assess the impact of stress and its influencing factors among Bahraini dentists. A total of 306 participants were randomly selected from 1489 registered professionals in the NHRA (National Health Regulatory Authority Bahrain). Results: Out of 306 participants invited in the survey, 253 responded. Overall, the participants reported moderate stress. All the variables of the study showed different effects, but the highest stressor with a strong correlation was “fear of social isolation” (FI) at the significance level of 0.01 (β= 0.393, t= 5.090, p < 0.05= (0.000) with f2 = 0.201 above 0.15 and less than 0.35, which was considered as a moderate effect size of approximately (20%), which strongly supported the hypothesis that researchers have proposed. Overall, the total effect for all stressors was 30 % which was considered as a moderate effect size. All hypotheses were supported except Burden of caring for patients → OUTCOME due to insufficient evidence. R² values of independent variables were above 95% for the variance of dentists’ outcomes, which is considered an excellent fit to the data as evidenced by the squared multiple correlations (R2 ) values for the dependent variables. Conclusions: The study is unique based on its findings that reveal the impact of stress among dentists. Moreover, the results of this study may serve as guidance for future monitoring of dental practitioners’ burnout, anxiety, and workload.

                Background: This quasi-experimental study aimed to determine the effects of the ‘Our Love, Our Control’ online program on sexual health literacy and behaviors during the COVID-19 situation in Thailand from February 2020 to September 2021. Methods: Multistage sampling resulted in 37 and 34 participants in the experimental and control groups, respectively. Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Fisher’s exact test/Chi-square test, and independent t-test/Mann-Whitney test were used to determine differences in sociodemographic variables between the experimental and control groups. Repeated measures of ANCOVA were used to compare the mean and 95% confidence intervals of the adjusted variables. Results: From the results, adolescents who had sexual intercourse experience had statistically significant differences at the eighth week of score for behaviors (23.92; 95% CI: 16.56; 31.29), and at the eighth and at the twentieth week of score for sexual health literacy (43.55; 95% CI: 28.10; 59.00; and 19.35; 95% CI: 0.23; 38.48, respectively). However, adolescents who had no sexual intercourse experience had statistically significant differences only at the eighth week of score for sexual health literacy. (11.20; 95% CI: 3.79; 18.61). Conclusions: These findings present a useful practical program to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, especially in sexually active adolescents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in students: A global systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Examining the prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy and understanding what motivates students to accept or reject a newly promoted vaccine has the potential in preventing rapid spread of infection and optimizing country-wide mass vaccination programs. This systematic review aimed to examine global COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among students, and to identify an up-to-date and concise assessment of most common factors influencing vaccine acceptance and hesitancy around the world. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed literatures indexed in reputable databases was performed. After obtaining the results via screening using PRISMA flow diagram, a total of 35 articles met the inclusion criteria and formed the basic structure of the study objectives. Results: The results revealed that, the worldwide pooled COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate was (x̅%)=29.8% (95% CI 23.37–36.23) among students. According to the country count assessment, the pooled vaccine hesitancy has been found to be ups and downs across the countries around the world such as  (x̅%)=32% (95% CI 20.04–43.97) in Asia, (x̅%)=(28.11%, 95% CI 18.83–37.40) in the United States, (x̅%)=15.59% (95% CI 8.23–22.95) in Europe, (x̅%)=55.93% (95% CI 40.31–71.55) in Africa, (x̅%)=20.4% in North America, and (x̅%)=22.5% in multi-ethnic areas in the reported student’s COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In total, 10 key factors were identified. “Side effect” 45.41% (95% CI 29.68–61.14), “safety” 42.27% (95% CI 27.50–57.04), and “trust” 44.95%, (95% CI 26.51–63.39) were the overarching concerns in making students' vaccination decisions. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy varied among the students; however, vaccine acceptance or refusal relies on several socio-psychological, societal, and vaccine related factors. This study helps the vaccine policy-makers and health stakeholders gain a better understanding of COVID-19 vaccination drive and design the vaccine promotion strategies. Health educational interventions could be the most preferred approach to improve student’s adherence and knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccination consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">De novo spatiotemporal modelling of cell-type signatures in the developmental human heart using graph convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

With the emergence of high throughput single cell techniques, the understanding of the molecular and cellular diversity of mammalian organs have rapidly increased. In order to understand the spatial organization of this diversity, single cell data is often integrated with spatial data to create probabilistic cell maps. However, targeted cell typing approaches relying on existing single cell data achieve incomplete and biased maps that could mask the true diversity present in a tissue slide. Here we applied a <i>de novo</i> technique to spatially resolve and characterize cellular diversity of in situ sequencing data during human heart development. We obtained and made accessible well defined spatial cell-type maps of fetal hearts from 4.5 to 9 post conception weeks, not biased by probabilistic cell typing approaches. With our analysis, we could characterize previously unreported molecular diversity within cardiomyocytes and epicardial cells and identified their characteristic expression signatures, comparing them with specific subpopulations found in single cell RNA sequencing datasets. We further characterized the differentiation trajectories of epicardial cells, identifying a clear spatial component on it. All in all, our study provides a novel technique for conducting de novo spatial-temporal analyses in developmental tissue samples and a useful resource for online exploration of cell-type differentiation during heart development at sub-cellular image resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Brain signal predictions from multi-scale networks using a linearized framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Espen Hagen, Steinn H. Magnusson, Torbjørn V. Ness, Geir Halnes, Pooja N. Babu, Charl Linssen, Abigail Morrison, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

Simulations of neural activity at different levels of detail are ubiquitous in modern neurosciences, aiding the interpretation of experimental data and underlying neural mechanisms at the level of cells and circuits. Extracellular measurements of brain signals reflecting transmembrane currents throughout the neural tissue remain commonplace. The lower frequencies (≲ 300Hz) of measured signals generally stem from synaptic activity driven by recurrent interactions among neural populations and computational models should also incorporate accurate predictions of such signals. Due to limited computational resources, large-scale neuronal network models (≳ 10<sup>6</sup> neurons or so) often require reducing the level of biophysical detail and account mainly for times of action potentials (‘spikes’) or spike rates. Corresponding extracellular signal predictions have thus poorly accounted for their biophysical origin.
Here we propose a computational framework for predicting spatiotemporal filter kernels for such extracellular signals stemming from synaptic activity, accounting for the biophysics of neurons, populations, and recurrent connections. Signals are obtained by convolving population spike rates by appropriate kernels for each connection pathway and summing the contributions. Our main results are that kernels derived via linearized synapse and membrane dynamics, distributions of cells, conduction delay, and volume conductor model allow for accurately capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ground truth extracellular signals from conductance-based multicompartment neuron networks. One particular observation is that changes in the effective membrane time constants caused by persistent synapse activation must be accounted for.
The work also constitutes a major advance in computational efficacy of accurate, biophysics-based signal predictions from large-scale spike and rate-based neuron network models drastically reducing signal prediction times compared to biophysically detailed network models. This work also provides insight into how experimentally recorded low-frequency extracellular signals of neuronal activity may be approximately linearly dependent on spiking activity. A new software tool LFPykernels serves as a reference implementation of the framework.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐Duration Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: Clinical Course and Pathological Underpinnings</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To identify the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of benign progressive supranuclear palsy with particularly long disease duration; to define neuropathological determinants underlying variability in disease duration in progressive supranuclear palsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and pathological features were compared among 186 autopsy-confirmed cases with progressive supranuclear palsy with ≥10 years and shorter survival times.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 45 cases (24.2%) had a disease duration of ≥10 years. The absence of ocular motor abnormalities within the first 3 years from disease onset was the only significant independent clinical predictor of longer survival. Histopathologically, the neurodegeneration parameters in each survival group were paralleled anatomically by the distribution of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, whereas the tufted astrocytes displayed anatomically an opposite severity pattern. Most interestingly, we found significantly less coiled bodies in those who survive longer, in contrast to patients with less favorable course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A considerable proportion of patients had a more ”benign” disease course with ≥10 years survival. They had a distinct pattern and evolution of core symptoms compared to patients with short survival. The inverted anatomical patterns of astrocytic tau distribution suggest distinct implications of these cell types in trans-cellular propagation. The tempo of disease progression appeared to be determined mostly by oligodendroglial tau, where the high degree of oligodendroglial tau pathology might affect neuronal integrity and function on top of neuronal tau pathology. The relative contribution of glial tau should be further explored in cellular and animal models. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning to predict target location with turbulent odor plumes</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior and neural recordings show that the brain is able to measure both the intensity and the timing of odor encounters. However, whether intensity or timing of odor detections is more informative for olfactory-driven behavior is not understood. To tackle this question, we consider the problem of locating a target using the odor it releases. We ask whether the position of a target is best predicted by measures of timing <i>vs</i> intensity of its odor, sampled for a short period of time. To answer this question, we feed data from accurate numerical simulations of odor transport to machine learning algorithms that learn how to connect odor to target location. We find that both intensity and timing can separately predict target location even from a distance of several meters; however, their efficacy varies with the dilution of the odor in space. Thus, organisms that use olfaction from different ranges may have to switch among different modalities. This has implications on how the brain should represent odors as the target is approached. We demonstrate simple strategies to improve accuracy and robustness of the prediction by modifying odor sampling and appropriately combining distinct measures together. To test the predictions, animal behavior and odor representation should be monitored as the animal moves relative to the target, or in virtual conditions that mimic concentrated <i>vs</i> dilute environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-step recognition of potential 5' splice sites by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae U1 snRNP</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, splice sites define the introns of pre-mRNAs and must be recognized and excised with nucleotide precision by the spliceosome to make the correct mRNA product. In one of the earliest steps of spliceosome assembly, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognizes the 5' splice site (5' SS) through a combination of base pairing, protein-RNA contacts, and interactions with other splicing factors. Previous studies investigating the mechanisms of 5' SS recognition have largely been done <i>in vivo</i> or in cellular extracts where the U1/5' SS interaction is difficult to deconvolute from the effects of <i>trans</i>-acting factors or RNA structure. In this work we used co-localization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to elucidate the pathway of 5' SS selection by purified yeast U1 snRNP. We determined that U1 reversibly selects 5' SS in a sequence-dependent, two-step mechanism. A kinetic selection scheme enforces pairing at particular positions rather than overall duplex stability to achieve long-lived U1 binding. Our results provide a kinetic basis for how U1 may rapidly surveil nascent transcripts for 5' SS and preferentially accumulate at these sequences rather than on close cognates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation of functional hepatocytes by forward programming with nuclear receptors</a></h4>

              
                Production of large quantities of hepatocytes remains a major challenge for a number of clinical applications in the biomedical field. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) provides an advantageous solution and a number of protocols have been developed for this purpose. However, these methods usually follow different steps of liver development in vitro, which is time consuming and requires complex culture conditions. In addition, HLCs lack the full repertoire of functionalities characterising primary hepatocytes. Here, we explore the interest of forward programming to generate hepatocytes from hPSCs and to bypass these limitations. This approach relies on the overexpression of three hepatocyte nuclear factors (<i>HNF1A</i>, <i>HNF6,</i> and <i>FOXA3</i>) in combination with different nuclear receptors expressed in the adult liver using the OPTi-OX platform. Forward programming allows for the rapid production of hepatocytes (FoP-Heps) with functional characteristics using a simplified process. We also uncovered that the overexpression of nuclear receptors such as RORc can enhance specific functionalities of FoP-Heps thereby validating its role in lipid/glucose metabolism. Together, our results show that forward programming could offer a versatile alternative to direct differentiation for generating hepatocytes in vitro.

                The RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing, but its targeting scope is limited by the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). To expand the target scope, it is crucial to develop a CRISPR toolbox capable of recognizing multiple PAMs. Here, using a GFP-activation assay, we tested the activities of 29 type II-C orthologs closely related to Nme1Cas9, 25 of which are active in human cells. These orthologs recognize diverse PAMs with variable length and nucleotide preference, including purine-rich, pyrimidine-rich, and mixed purine and pyrimidine PAMs. We characterized in depth the activity and specificity of Nsp2Cas9. We also generated a chimeric Cas9 nuclease that recognizes a simple N<sub>4</sub>C PAM, representing the most relaxed PAM preference for compact Cas9s to date. These Cas9 nucleases significantly enhance our ability to perform allele-specific genome editing.

                The maintenance of items in working memory (WM) relies on a widespread network of cortical areas and hippocampus where synchronization between electrophysiological recordings reflects functional coupling. We investigated the direction of information flow between auditory cortex and hippocampus while participants heard and then mentally replayed strings of letters in WM by activating their phonological loop. We recorded local field potentials from the hippocampus, reconstructed beamforming sources of scalp EEG<i>,</i> and – additionally in four participants – recorded from subdural cortical electrodes. When analyzing Granger causality, the information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus with a peak in the [4 8] Hz range while participants heard the letters. This flow was subsequently reversed during maintenance while participants maintained the letters in memory. The functional interaction between hippocampus and the cortex and the reversal of information flow provide a physiological basis for the encoding of memory items and their active replay during maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">STAG2 promotes the myelination transcriptional programin oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin folds chromosomes via DNA loop extrusion. Cohesin-mediated chromosome loops regulate transcription by shaping long-range enhancer-promoter interactions, among other mechanisms. Mutations of cohesin subunits and regulators cause human developmental diseases termed cohesinopathy. Vertebrate cohesin consists of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21, and either STAG1 or STAG2. To probe the physiological functions of cohesin, we created conditional knockout (cKO) mice with <i>Stag2</i> deleted in the nervous system. <i>Stag2</i> cKO mice exhibit growth retardation, neurological defects, and premature death, in part due to insufficient myelination of nerve fibers. <i>Stag2</i> cKO oligodendrocytes exhibit delayed maturation and downregulation of myelination-related genes. <i>Stag2</i> loss reduces promoter-anchored loops at downregulated genes in oligodendrocytes. Thus, STAG2-cohesin generates promoter-anchored loops at myelination-promoting genes to facilitate their transcription. Our study implicates defective myelination as a contributing factor to cohesinopathy and establishes oligodendrocytes as a relevant cell type to explore the mechanisms by which cohesin regulates transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inflammatory stress signaling via NF-kB alters accessible cholesterol to upregulate SREBP2 transcriptional activity in endothelial cells</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing appreciation that a tight relationship exists between cholesterol homeostasis and immunity in leukocytes, however, this relationship has not been deeply explored in the vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells (ECs) rapidly respond to extrinsic signals, such as tissue damage or microbial infection, by upregulating factors to activate and recruit circulating leukocytes to the site of injury and aberrant activation of ECs leads to inflammatory based diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol and a key transcription regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, SREBP2, in the EC responses to inflammatory stress. Treatment of primary human ECs with pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SREBP2 cleavage and cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression within the late phase of the acute inflammatory response. Furthermore, SREBP2 activation was dependent on NF-kB DNA binding and canonical SCAP-SREBP2 processing. Mechanistically, inflammatory activation of SREBP was mediated by a reduction in accessible cholesterol, leading to heightened sterol sensing and downstream SREBP2 cleavage. Detailed analysis of NF-kB inducible genes that may impact sterol sensing resulted in the identification of a novel <i>RELA</i>-inducible target, <i>STARD10</i>, that mediates accessible cholesterol homeostasis in ECs. Thus, this study provides an in-depth characterization of the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and the acute inflammatory response in EC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Npas4-mediated dopaminergic regulation of fear memory states</a></h4>

              
                Amygdala circuitry encodes associations between conditioned stimuli and aversive unconditioned stimuli, and also controls fear expression (Pape and Pare, 2010). However, whether and how irrelevant information for unpaired conditioned stimuli (CS-) is discretely processed, and how it was influenced by stress remain unknown. CS- memory is retrievable immediately after fear conditioning, but then becomes silent after memory consolidation in mice. Synaptic pathway from the lateral to the anterior basal amygdala gates the expression of CS- memory, depending upon Npas4-mediated Drd4 synthesis. The upregulation of Npas4-Drd4 axis, which is precluded by corticosterone, shifts functional states of neural engrams for CS- memory toward silent states and limits its retrievability. In here, we demonstrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the functional states of neural engrams, which can be switched or maintained, supporting discriminative memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolic demands of the posteromedial default mode network are shaped by dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks</a></h4>

              
                Although BOLD signal decreases in the default mode network (DMN) are commonly observed during attention-demanding tasks, their neurobiological underpinnings are not fully understood. Previous work has shown decreases but also increases in glucose metabolism that match with or dissociate from these BOLD signal decreases, respectively. To resolve this discrepancy, we analyzed functional PET/MRI data from 50 healthy subjects during the performance of the visuo-spatial processing game Tetris(R) and combined this with previously published data sets of working memory as well as visual and motor stimulation. Our findings show that the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN is dependent on the metabolic demands of the correspondingly engaged task-positive brain networks. Specifically, the dorsal attention (involved in Tetris(R)) and frontoparietal networks (engaged during working memory) shape the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN in opposing directions. External attention-demanding tasks lead to a downregulation of the posteromedial DMN with consistent decreases in the BOLD signal and glucose metabolism, whereas working memory is subject to metabolically expensive mechanisms of BOLD signal suppression. We suggest that the former finding is mediated by decreased glutamate signaling, while the latter results from active GABAergic inhibition, regulating the competition between self-generated and task-driven internal demands. The results demonstrate that the DMN relates to cognitive processing in a flexible manner and does not always act as a cohesive task-negative network in isolation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Within Cells: Temporal Resolution in Cytoplasm, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and Membrane</a></h4>

              
                Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed treatment for individuals experiencing major depressive disorder (MDD). The therapeutic mechanisms that take place before, during, or after SSRIs bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) are poorly understood, partially because no studies exist of the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of SSRIs in living cells. We studied escitalopram and fluoxetine using new intensity- based drug-sensing fluorescent reporters ("iDrugSnFRs") targeted to the plasma membrane (PM), cytoplasm, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured neurons and mammalian cell lines. We also employed chemical detection of drug within cells and phospholipid membranes. The drugs attain equilibrium in neuronal cytoplasm and ER, at approximately the same concentration as the externally applied solution, with time constants of a few s (escitalopram) or 200-300 s (fluoxetine). Simultaneously, the drugs accumulate within lipid membranes by [&ge;] 18-fold (escitalopram) or 180-fold (fluoxetine), and possibly by much larger factors. Both drugs leave cytoplasm, lumen, and membranes just as quickly during washout. We synthesized membrane-impermeant quaternary amine derivatives of the two SSRIs. The quaternary derivatives are substantially excluded from membrane, cytoplasm, and ER for > 2.4 h. They inhibit SERT transport-associated currents 6- or 11-fold less potently than the SSRIs (escitalopram or fluoxetine derivative, respectively), providing useful probes for distinguishing compartmentalized SSRI effects. Although our measurements are orders of magnitude faster than the "therapeutic lag" of SSRIs, these data suggest that SSRI-SERT interactions within organelles or membranes may play roles during either the therapeutic effects or the "antidepressant discontinuation syndrome".

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors stabilize mood in several disorders. In general, these drugs bind to the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) transporter (SERT), which clears serotonin from CNS and peripheral tissues. SERT ligands are effective and relatively safe; primary care practitioners often prescribe them. However, they have several side effects and require 2 to 6 weeks of continuous administration until they act effectively. How they work remains perplexing, contrasting with earlier assumptions that the therapeutic mechanism involves SERT inhibition followed by increased extracellular serotonin levels. This study establishes that two SERT ligands, fluoxetine and escitalopram, enter neurons within minutes, while simultaneously accumulating in many membranes. Such knowledge will motivate future research, hopefully revealing where and how SERT ligands "engage" their therapeutic target(s).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The language network is selective and distinct from other cognition in both function and connectivity in early childhood</a></h4>

              
                Is language distinct from other cognition? Does the neural machinery for language emerge from general-purpose neural mechanisms early in development, becoming tuned for language only after years of experience and maturation? In adults, language is supported by a frontotemporal network that is functionally and connectionally dissociated from adjacent domain-general cortex supporting other, more general cognitive functions. We scanned young children (2-9 years of age) on an auditory language localizer, spatial working memory localizer (engaging the domain-general multiple demand (MD) network), and a resting state scan. Subject-specific functional regions of interest (fROIs) defined with the language task showed consistent selectivity to auditory sentences in key left hemisphere regions, and were not engaged for spatial working memory, showing similar domain-specificity as reported in adults; and despite known prolonged development of frontal cortices, the left inferior frontal cortex ("Brocas area") showed some of the most robust specificity for linguistic content. Thus, despite immature language skills, young children already have left-lateralized brain regions dedicated to linguistic content. Children also showed higher within-network (language-language) connectivity than between-network connectivity (language-to-MD fROIs defined with the working memory task), in both hemispheres, but with higher within-network connectivity on the left. Language-selectivity increased with age (replicated in a subset of children scanned longitudinally) while specificity of language connectivity did not change with age (again replicated longitudinally), suggesting that connectivity is more static than, and may perhaps earmark, functional specificity. By age 2, the language network is specialized for linguistic processing (domain-specific) function, is distinct from adjacent cortex, and is not engaged in other higher-order cognitive processing.

	<p>Objective: We explored a novel model based on deep learning radiomics (DLR) to differentiate Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and normal control (NC) subjects. This model was validated in an exploratory study using tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) scans. Methods: In this study, we selected tau-PET scans from the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI), which included a total of 211 NC, 197 MCI, and 117 AD subjects. The dataset was divided into one training/validation group and one separate external group for testing. The proposed DLR model contained the following three steps: (1) pre-training of candidate deep learning models; (2) extraction and selection of DLR features; (3) classification based on support vector machine (SVM). In the comparative experiments, we compared the DLR model with three traditional models, including the SUVR model, traditional radiomics model, and a clinical model. Ten-fold cross-validation was carried out 200 times in the experiments. Results: Compared with other models, the DLR model achieved the best classification performance, with an accuracy of 90.76% &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.15% in NC vs. MCI, 88.43% &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.32% in MCI vs. AD, and 99.92% &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.51% in NC vs. AD. Conclusions: Our proposed DLR model had the potential clinical value to discriminate AD, MCI and NC.</p>

	<p>EEG-based human identification has gained a wide range of attention due to the further increase in demand for security. How to improve the accuracy of the human identification system is an issue worthy of attention. Using more features in the human identification system is a potential solution. However, too many features may cause overfitting, resulting in the decline of system accuracy. In this work, the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) was adopted for classification. Multiple features were combined and utilized as the structure matrix of the GCN. Because of the constant signal matrix, the training parameters would not increase as the structure matrix grows. We evaluated the classification accuracy on a classic public dataset. The results showed that utilizing multiple features of functional connectivity (FC) can improve the accuracy of the identity authentication system, the best results of which are at 98.56%. In addition, our methods showed less sensitivity to channel reduction. The method proposed in this paper combines different FCs and reaches high classification accuracy for unpreprocessed data, which inspires reducing the system cost in the actual human identification system.</p>

	<p>Exercise modes can be categorized based on the skills required (open vs. closed skills), which implicates various demands on cognitive skills, especially executive functions (EFs). Thus, their practice may have varying effects on EFs. There is a lack of detailed analysis of cognitive requirements and suitable classification of sports. It is hypothesized that the amount and type of cognitive requirements of sports lead to small effect sizes when comparing open-skill exercising (OSE) and closed-skill exercising (CSE) athletes. The current meta-analysis evaluates the variances in EFs skills caused by particular sport modes. Four research databases (Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO) were searched for cross-sectional studies in which the authors compare the performance in EF tasks of OSE and CSE athletes. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using funnel plots and two reviewer selection process (overall and subgroup analysis; low risk of publication and selection bias). A total of 19 studies were included, revealing an overall effect size of Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.174 (p = 0.157), favoring OSE for the development of EFs. The subgroup analysis revealed the effects for the subdomains of EFs (cognitive flexibility: Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.210 &amp;amp;gt; inhibitory control: Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.191 &amp;amp;gt; working memory: Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.138; p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), which could be characterized as low to moderate. The hypothesis that studies with the smallest effect sizes compare sport modes with similar cognitive demands was rejected. The paper discusses the differentiation of sports into OSE and CSE and presents new approaches for their categorization.</p>

	<p>Background: (1) Sleep disorders are prevalent in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and predict cardiac events and prognosis. While increased oxidative stress (OS) has been associated with sleep disorders, less is known about its relationship with sleep quality. Similarly, little is known of how this relationship might change with exercise, which can improve sleep quality. Factors of sleep quality, such as sleep duration and disturbances, are also important as they predict cardiovascular diseases better than a global score alone. This study investigated whether OS was associated with self-rated sleep quality and its factors before and after completing a 24-week exercise intervention. (2) Methods: CAD patients undergoing an exercise program were recruited. OS was measured at baseline by the concentrations of early- (lipid hydroperoxides, LPH) and late-stage (8-isoprostane, 8-ISO) lipid peroxidation products and their ratio. Sleep quality was measured by the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument at baseline and termination. Three sleep factors - perceived sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and daily disturbances - were derived from the PSQI. (3) Results: Among CAD patients (n = 113, 85.0% male, age = 63.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.4 years, global PSQI = 5.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.0), those with poor sleep (PSQI &amp;amp;ge; 5) had higher baseline 8-ISO levels (F(1,111) = 6.212, p = 0.014, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.053) compared to those with normal sleep. Concentrations of LPH (F(1,105) = 0.569, p = 0.453, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.005) and 8-ISO/LPH ratios (F(1,105) = 2.173, p = 0.143, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.020) did not differ between those with poor sleep and normal sleep. Among factors, perceived sleep quality was associated with 8-ISO and 8-ISO/LPH, and daily disturbances were associated with 8-ISO. (4) Conclusions: A marker of late-stage lipid peroxidation is elevated in CAD patients with poor sleep and associated with daily disturbances, but not with other factors or with sleep quality and its factors after exercise intervention.</p>

	<p>This study analyzes the profile of executive functions (EF) in high-functioning adults with autism (HFA), both in terms of performance on four computer-based tasks, as well as how these functions are perceived by the individuals through self-reporting measures. The study included 64 participants: 32 individuals with HFA, and 32 typically developing controls. Four CANTAB tasks were used (assessing spatial working memory, planning, visual memory, and inhibition), as well as a self-reported measure of executive functions (BDEFS) and a scale for the severity of autism symptoms (RAADS-R). The participants in the ASD group performed significantly lower than the control group on all four computer-based tasks, as measured by the total number of errors made (for the spatial working memory, visual memory, and inhibition tasks) and the number of problems solved at the first choice (for the planning task). No correlation was found in the ASD group between the severity of autism symptoms and the computer-based measures. These findings provide evidence that HFA adults may have various executive functioning impairments, and subsequent daily life problems, but these deficits do not necessarily correlate with the severity of core ASD symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Novel Axon Regeneration Role for Noncanonical Wnt Signaling in the Adult Retina after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways are essential for development and maintenance of the CNS. Whereas the roles of canonical Wnt pathways in neuronal survival and axonal regeneration in adult CNS have been described, the functions of noncanonical Wnt pathways are not well understood. Furthermore, the role of noncanonical Wnt ligands in the adult retina has not been investigated. Noncanonical Wnt signaling shares receptors with canonical Wnt ligands but functions through calcium and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Noncanonical ligands, such as the prototypic ligand Wnt5a, have varying effects in the developing CNS, including inhibiting or promoting axonal growth. To identify a role for noncanonical Wnt signaling in the developed retina after injury, we characterized the effect of Wnt5a on neurite outgrowth in cultured retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and on axonal regeneration in the injured optic nerve in the mouse. Endogenous Wnt5a was upregulated after injury and exogenous Wnt5a significantly enhanced neurite growth of primary RGCs and led to extensive axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury. Wnt5a also significantly increased RGC survival. Furthermore, Wnt5a induced phosphorylation of CamKII and JNK and induced expression of their downstream pathway components. Therefore, these results demonstrate for the first time that Wnt5a promotes axonal growth and protects RGCs in the adult retina.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elevated shock index and modified shock index are associated with mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied extensively to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Shock index (SI) and modified shock index (MSI) are two new emerging parameters that incorporate BP and HR into their calculations, thereby improving the predictive value of each HR and BP alone in AMI patients. Thus, our aim was to determine the prognostic utility of SI and MSI in AMI patients. Methods We searched PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO Host, and Europe PMC from conception to May 2022. Studies were eligible if they evaluated the relationship of SI and MSI with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Results A total of 16 studies involving 80,195 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our study revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality risk for patients with high SI and MSI compared to patients with low indices, regardless of the periods of outcomes, study population, or diverse cut-off values. Moreover, both increased SI and MSI also predicted higher major adverse cardiac events rates. Conclusions According to our findings, both SI and MSI in the emergency department can predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given this growing body of evidence, as well as the fact that SI and MSI are very simple objective indices derived from two readily available vital signs, they should be used in daily clinical practice to risk stratify patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep learning prediction of chemical-induced dose-dependent and context-specific multiplex phenotype responses and its application to personalized alzheimer’s disease drug repurposing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by You Wu, Qiao Liu, Yue Qiu, Lei Xie</p>

Predictive modeling of drug-induced gene expressions is a powerful tool for phenotype-based compound screening and drug repurposing. State-of-the-art machine learning methods use a small number of fixed cell lines as a surrogate for predicting actual expressions in a new cell type or tissue, although it is well known that drug responses depend on a cellular context. Thus, the existing approach has limitations when applied to personalized medicine, especially for many understudied diseases whose molecular profiles are dramatically different from those characterized in the training data. Besides the gene expression, dose-dependent cell viability is another important phenotype readout and is more informative than conventional summary statistics (e.g., IC50) for characterizing clinical drug efficacy and toxicity. However, few computational methods can reliably predict the dose-dependent cell viability. To address the challenges mentioned above, we designed a new deep learning model, MultiDCP, to predict cellular context-dependent gene expressions and cell viability on a specific dosage. The novelties of MultiDCP include a knowledge-driven gene expression profile transformer that enables context-specific phenotypic response predictions of novel cells or tissues, integration of multiple diverse labeled and unlabeled omics data, the joint training of the multiple prediction tasks, and a teacher-student training procedure that allows us to utilize unreliable data effectively. Comprehensive benchmark studies suggest that MultiDCP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with unseen cell lines that are dissimilar from the cell lines in the supervised training in terms of gene expressions. The predicted drug-induced gene expressions demonstrate a stronger predictive power than noisy experimental data for downstream tasks. Thus, MultiDCP is a useful tool for transcriptomics-based drug repurposing and compound screening that currently rely on noisy high-throughput experimental data. We applied MultiDCP to repurpose individualized drugs for Alzheimer’s disease in terms of efficacy and toxicity, suggesting that MultiDCP is a potentially powerful tool for personalized drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nine quick tips for pathway enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Agapito</p>

Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a computational biology method that identifies biological functions that are overrepresented in a group of genes more than would be expected by chance and ranks these functions by relevance. The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results. Our nine tips can help users perform better pathway enrichment analyses and eventually contribute to a better understanding of current biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-driven modelling captures dynamics of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amit Singh, Congxin Li, Axel C. R. Diernfellner, Thomas Höfer, Michael Brunner</p>

Eukaryotic circadian clocks are based on self-sustaining, cell-autonomous oscillatory feedback loops that can synchronize with the environment via recurrent stimuli (zeitgebers) such as light. The components of biological clocks and their network interactions are becoming increasingly known, calling for a quantitative understanding of their role for clock function. However, the development of data-driven mathematical clock models has remained limited by the lack of sufficiently accurate data. Here we present a comprehensive model of the circadian clock of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> that describe free-running oscillations in constant darkness and entrainment in light-dark cycles. To parameterize the model, we measured high-resolution time courses of luciferase reporters of morning and evening specific clock genes in WT and a mutant strain. Fitting the model to such comprehensive data allowed estimating parameters governing circadian phase, period length and amplitude, and the response of genes to light cues. Our model suggests that functional maturation of the core clock protein Frequency causes a delay in negative feedback that is critical for generating circadian rhythms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatiotemporal spread of Plasmodium falciparum mutations for resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine across Africa, 1990–2020</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer A. Flegg, Georgina S. Humphreys, Brenda Montanez, Taryn Strickland, Zaira J. Jacome-Meza, Karen I. Barnes, Jaishree Raman, Philippe J. Guerin, Carol Hopkins Sibley, Sabina Dahlström Otienoburu</p>
Background <p>Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended in Africa in several antimalarial preventive regimens including Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women (IPTp), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi) and Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC). The effectiveness of SP-based preventive treatments are threatened in areas where <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> resistance to SP is high. The prevalence of mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase gene (<i>pfdhps</i>) can be used to monitor SP effectiveness. IPTi-SP is recommended only in areas where the prevalence of the <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation is below 50%. It has also been suggested that IPTp-SP does not have a protective effect in areas where the <i>pfdhps</i>581G mutation, exceeds 10%. However, <i>pfdhps</i> mutation prevalence data in Africa are extremely heterogenous and scattered, with data completely missing from many areas.</p> Methods and findings <p>The WWARN SP Molecular Surveyor database was designed to summarize dihydrofolate reductase (<i>pfdhfr)</i> and <i>pfdhps</i> gene mutation prevalence data. In this paper, <i>pfdhps</i> mutation prevalence data was used to generate continuous spatiotemporal surface maps of the estimated prevalence of the SP resistance markers <i>pfdhps</i>437G, <i>pfdhps</i>540E, and <i>pfdhps</i>581G in Africa from 1990 to 2020 using a geostatistical model, with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate uncertainty. The maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the <i>pfdhps</i>437G mutations across the entire continent over the last three decades. The <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation emerged from limited foci in East Africa to currently exceeding 50% estimated prevalence in most of East and South East Africa. <i>pfdhps</i>540E distribution is expanding at low or moderate prevalence in central Africa and a predicted focus in West Africa. Although the <i>pfdhps</i>581G mutation spread from one focus in East Africa in 2000, to exceeding 10% estimated prevalence in several foci in 2010, the predicted distribution of the marker did not expand in 2020, however our analysis indicated high uncertainty in areas where <i>pfdhps</i>581G is present. Uncertainty was higher in spatial regions where the prevalence of a marker is intermediate or where prevalence is changing over time.</p> Conclusions <p>The WWARN SP Molecular Surveyor database and a set of continuous spatiotemporal surface maps were built to provide users with standardized, current information on resistance marker distribution and prevalence estimates. According to the maps, the high prevalence of <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation was to date restricted to East and South East Africa, which is reassuring for continued use of IPTi and SMC in West Africa, but continuous monitoring is needed as the <i>pfdhps</i>540E distribution is expanding. Several foci where <i>pfdhps</i>581G prevalence exceeded 10% were identified. More data on the <i>pfdhps</i>581G distribution in these areas needs to be collected to guide IPTp-SP recommendations. Prevalence and uncertainty maps can be utilized together to strategically identify sites where increased surveillance can be most informative.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Scelestial: Fast and accurate single-cell lineage tree inference based on a Steiner tree approximation algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad-Hadi Foroughmand-Araabi, Sama Goliaei, Alice C. McHardy</p>

Single-cell genome sequencing provides a highly granular view of biological systems but is affected by high error rates, allelic amplification bias, and uneven genome coverage. This creates a need for data-specific computational methods, for purposes such as for cell lineage tree inference. The objective of cell lineage tree reconstruction is to infer the evolutionary process that generated a set of observed cell genomes. Lineage trees may enable a better understanding of tumor formation and growth, as well as of organ development for healthy body cells. We describe a method, Scelestial, for lineage tree reconstruction from single-cell data, which is based on an approximation algorithm for the Steiner tree problem and is a generalization of the neighbor-joining method. We adapt the algorithm to efficiently select a limited subset of potential sequences as internal nodes, in the presence of missing values, and to minimize cost by lineage tree-based missing value imputation. In a comparison against seven state-of-the-art single-cell lineage tree reconstruction algorithms—BitPhylogeny, OncoNEM, SCITE, SiFit, SASC, SCIPhI, and SiCloneFit—on simulated and real single-cell tumor samples, Scelestial performed best at reconstructing trees in terms of accuracy and run time. Scelestial has been implemented in C++. It is also available as an R package named RScelestial.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Host genotype controls ecological change in the leaf fungal microbiome</a></h4>

Leaf fungal microbiomes can be fundamental drivers of host plant success, as they contain pathogens that devastate crop plants and taxa that enhance nutrient uptake, discourage herbivory, and antagonize pathogens. We measured leaf fungal diversity with amplicon sequencing across an entire growing season in a diversity panel of switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3 additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3 cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Descriptive analysis of clinical and laboratory findings in relation to changes in SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and cyclic threshold: a retrospective, single center observational study in patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin combination ther</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cases of undiagnosed pneumonia have emerged, and sequencing of respiratory samples indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19.  Patients with higher viral load and lower Ct values tend to have progressive disease and severe lung injury. The objective of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation and disease outcomes of COVID-19 patients in relation to their Ct values. Methods: A retrospective, single center observational study was performed, including patients admitted to King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) Riyadh between March 1st-29th, 2020 and have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The Ct value was identified to determine the viral load. All patients were treated according to KFSH&RC guidelines.  Patients were divided into HCQ/AZI and non HCQ/AZI treated groups. Results: There were many days where Ct values were not available. An attempt at imputing information for missing Ct values was made using logic.  The logic leads to an ordinal Ct score 1, 2, 3, or 4. As a result, complete Ct score profiles were available. There was no evidence of statistically significant difference between the two groups in regard to clinical severity, duration to negative test or changes in Ct values.  Conclusion: There is little knowledge known to the time profile of Ct values and their relation to disease course of COVID-19. This study provides insight on how Ct values might be used to determine treatment efficacy. As it might be difficult to obtain Ct values at all times, this study provides an imputation method that may be used with conservative statistical assumptions for analyses of Ct profiles.

                Background: Drinking coffee is known to have both positive and negative aftermath on periodontal health. The current study is aiming to systematically review the impact of coffee consumption on periodontal health status. Methods: An article search was carried out in two electronic databases (PUBMED and Web of Sciences). The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

                Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Electronic signature and attestation in conveyancing practice: A Malaysian legal perspective [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented disruption to global business activities. Physical face-to-face activities must be restricted due to movement control order (MCO). The clients are required to sign the documents physically in the presence of the solicitor who must subsequently attest to the signature of the clients. The issue arises whether electronic signature (e-signature) and attestation are permissible under the laws of Malaysia. The aim of this research was to study the legality of e-signature and attestation in conveyancing practice in Malaysia and subsequently to propose recommendations to overcome these issues.   Methods   This is qualitative study and not an empirical study. The data was collected by library-based research from various primary and secondary data sources, including case law in Malaysia, written statutes, publication of journal and article.   Results  The Digital Signatures Act 1997 (DSA) and the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) have legalised e-signatures. The DSA is the law that governs the digital signatures in Malaysia. ECA has listed a few documents which are not legally accepted if signed electronically, namely Power of Attorney, the Wills and codicils, the Trusts, and negotiable instruments. However, with regards to the issue of attestation of these documents, there are no clear laws which govern the attestation. The legal issue arises when the lawyers who have attested these documents are liable to be called as witness under the Evidence Act 1950 to testify their signature if these documents are tendered as evidence in any court proceedings.   Conclusion  The laws in Malaysia have provided sufficient provisions for e-signatures but not the issue of attestation via online. Thus, it is suggested that there is a need for unique legal framework for attestation via online in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-Clinical Study: Immunohistochemical evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 on rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) socket healing after application of platelet-rich fibrin with and without hydroxyapatite [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wi</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tissue engineering technology has been used globally and proven to accelerate wound healing. This study aimed to analyse the effect of adding hydroxyapatite (HA) as a scaffold to platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as a growth factor in accelerating the wound healing process as seen from the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Methods: This research is an animal experiment conducted on 18 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Rabbits were randomly divided into the following three groups of treatment: (G1) the application of PRF group, (G2) the application of PRF+HA group and (C) the control group without any application. Furthermore, each treatment group was split randomly into three groups of observation time. Periodontal tissue biopsy was performed to analyse the histopathological features that were examined on the basis of the level of MMP-13 immunoexpression. Results: MMP-13 immunoexpression in the PRF+HA group showed better histoscore results, indicating a substantial reduction in MMP-13 values compared with other groups. The healing process was shown to increase with increasing observation time (p<0.05), and the PRF+HA group outperformed the PRF and control groups. On day 3, MMP-13 exhibited a dark brown colour of Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which indicated an increase in the expression value of MMP-13 in the early stages of healing, namely, inflammation. On day 14, light brown IHC was seen, especially in group 2, as a reference that the remodeling process had begun. Conclusions: This study indicates that the administration of PRF and HA was capable of reducing the MMP-13 expression that significantly accelerates the socket healing process. Hydroxyapatite is an alloplastic material that has inherent bioactive properties that support osteoconduction, can bind MMPs, and showed faster healing results based on the observation time as documented by immunohistochemistry.

                Background: Hydroxychloroquine is a long-used medication, most commonly used to treat and prevent malaria, that also has anti-inflammatory and antiviral characteristics. Therefore, specialists have shown interest in the underlying mechanism of its antiviral activity. In vitro experiments have demonstrated its efficiency against SARS coronavirus, and in vitro and in vivo research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being conducted. We aimed to investigate reports on adverse events of hydroxychloroquine submitted to the Iraqi Pharmacovigilance Centre and compare the incidence of these reported adverse events in Iraq to globally reported cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 using information component (IC)025 values. Methods: The reported adverse events of hydroxychloroquine to the national Pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase™ a WHO global database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products, were investigated qualitatively (age, sex, and severity) and quantitatively (using IC025) as a measure of the existence of new/altered safety information associated with hydroxychloroquine. Results: A total of 132 reports were found, with women representing 37.1% and men representing 60.6% of cases, while the rest were unidentified, with the predominant age groups ranging from 18–44 years old accounting for 47.4% of cases. The most reported adverse events were upper (17%) and lower abdomen pain (21%), nausea (14%), diarrhea (13%), and electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolongation (13%). There were 44 different drug-adverse reaction pairings in which the adverse reaction reports included more than one event. The IC025 value for the most widely reported adverse events showed a positive comparable value for upper (2/0.3) and lower abdominal pain (1.8/-0.0), palpitation (1.6/-0.4), and dyspepsia (1.1/0.6). There was a decreased value for IC025 in cases of ECG QT prolongation (3.5/5), diarrhea (0.3/0.8), abdominal discomfort (0.1/2), and oral fungal infection (-0.4/0.6). Conclusions: The IC025 helped determine the higher reporting rate of adverse events compared to the average global rates.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The compounding symptomatology of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and co-occurring mental health disorders gives rise to interactions of maladaptive neurobiological processes, the etiology of which are elusive. Here, we devised an optogenetic strategy aimed at rescuing maladaptive fear processing in male c57BL/6 mice that underwent a chronic ethanol administration and forced abstinence paradigm. In the first experiment, we confirmed that fear acquisition and maladaptive contextual generalization was potentiated in ethanol-exposed mice during fear conditioning and exposure to a novel environment, respectively. In the second experiment, using an activity-dependent tet-tag system, we labeled the neural ensemble selectively activated by contextual fear conditioning in the dorsal hippocampus with an inhibitory opsin to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions resulting from ethanol exposure. We found that acute optogenetic perturbations during exposure to a novel environment suppressed maladaptive generalization in ethanol-exposed mice. These results provide further evidence for a crucial link between ethanol exposure and impaired fear memory processing by providing cellular and behavioral insights into the neural circuitry underlying AUD and maladaptive fear processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Glial control of sphingolipid levels sculpts diurnal remodeling in a circadian circuit</a></h4>

              
                Vaughen et al. find that brain sphingolipids are degraded by glial-derived glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Glial gba1b knockout in Drosophila causes selective sphingolipid and phospholipid alterations, cyclic protein aggregates, and sleep loss. Specific sphingolipids fluctuate diurnally in the brain, and sphingolipid metabolism instructs structural remodeling of a key circadian circuit.

                Loss of blood-CNS barrier (BCNSB) function is a hallmark of neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS. Sun et al. show that ARF6-mediated crosstalk between IL-1β and ALK signaling induces presymptomatic endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), causing BCNSB disruption and disease progression in a mouse MS model. Inhibiting this pathway reverses EndoMT and disease severity, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy to treat MS.

                Duan et al. examine antibody and T-cell responses in Ad5-nCoV-vaccinated SARS-CoV-1 survivors six months after vaccination. They show that vaccination boosts neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-1 survivors but neutralization against VOCs is limited. SARS-CoV-1 survivors elicit a comparable SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response but a stronger SARS-CoV-1-specific T-cell response than naïve healthy individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circadian oscillations in Trichoderma atroviride and the role of core clock components in secondary metabolism, development, and mycoparasitism against the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are important for an individual’s fitness, and recent studies have underlined their role in the outcome of biological interactions. However, the relevance of circadian clocks in fungal-fungal interactions remains largely unexplored. We sought to characterize a functional clock in the biocontrol agent <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> to assess its importance in the mycoparasitic interaction against the phytopathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. By utilizing luciferase reporters to monitor the <i>T. atroviride</i> core-clock, we confirmed the existence of circadian oscillations of ~26h that are temperature-compensated and modulated by environmental cues such as light and temperature. Notably, the presence of such rhythms appears to be highly dependent on the nutritional composition of the media. Heterologous expression of the <i>T. atroviride</i> negative clock component (<i>tafrq</i>) in a clock null (<i>Δfrq</i>) strain of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> restored core clock function in the latter fungus, with the same period observed in <i>T. atroviride</i>, confirming the role of <i>tafrq</i> as a <i>bona fide</i> core-clock component. Confrontation assays between wild-type and clock mutant strains of <i>T. atroviride </i>and <i>B. cinerea</i>, in constant light or darkness, revealed an inhibitory effect of light on <i>T. atroviride's </i>mycoparasitic capabilities. Interestingly, when confrontation assays were performed under light/dark cycles, <i>T. atroviride's </i>overgrowth capacity was enhanced when inoculations were at dawn compared to dusk. Deleting the core-clock negative element FRQ in <i>B. cinerea</i>, but not in <i>T. atroviride</i>, was vital for the daily differential phenotype, suggesting that the <i>B. cinerea</i> clock has a more significant influence on the result of this interaction. Additionally, we observed that <i>T. atroviride</i> clock components modulate development and secondary metabolism in this fungus, affecting the production of several molecules, including volatile compounds, such as 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6-PP). Notably, we detected the rhythmic production of distinct <i>T. atroviride</i> volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which depended on its circadian clock. Thus, this study provides evidence on how clock components impact diverse aspects of <i>T. atroviride</i> lifestyle and how daily changes modulate fungal interactions and dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Th2 single-cell heterogeneity and clonal distribution at distant sites in helminth-infected mice</a></h4>

              
                Th2 cells provide effector functions in type 2 immune responses to helminths and allergens. Despite knowledge about molecular mechanisms of Th2 cell differentiation, there is little information on Th2 cell heterogeneity and clonal distribution between organs. To address this, we performed combined single-cell transcriptome and TCR clonotype analysis on murine Th2 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and lung after infection with <i>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</i> (Nb) as a human hookworm infection model. We find organ-specific expression profiles, but also populations with conserved migration or effector/resident memory signatures that unexpectedly cluster with potentially regulatory <i>Il10<sup>pos</sup>Foxp3<sup>neg</sup></i> cells. A substantial MLN subpopulation with an interferon response signature suggests a role for interferon-signaling in Th2 differentiation or diversification. Further RNA-inferred developmental directions indicate proliferation as a hub for differentiation decisions. Although the TCR repertoire is highly heterogeneous, we identified expanded clones and CDR3 motifs. Clonal relatedness between distant organs confirmed effective exchange of Th2 effector cells, although locally expanded clones dominated the response. We further cloned an Nb-specific TCR from an expanded clone in the lung effector cluster and describe surface markers that distinguish transcriptionally defined clusters. These results provide insights in Th2 cell subset diversity and clonal relatedness in distant organs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel processing, hierarchical transformations, and sensorimotor associations along the 'where' pathway</a></h4>

              
                Visually guided behaviors require the brain to transform ambiguous retinal images into object-level spatial representations and implement sensorimotor transformations. These processes are supported by the dorsal 'where' pathway. However, the specific functional contributions of areas along this pathway remain elusive due in part to methodological differences across studies. We previously showed that macaque caudal intraparietal (CIP) area neurons possess robust three-dimensional (3D) visual representations, carry choice- and saccade-related activity, and exhibit experience-dependent sensorimotor associations (Chang et al., 2020b). Here, we used a common experimental design to reveal parallel processing, hierarchical transformations, and the formation of sensorimotor associations along the 'where' pathway by extending the investigation to V3A, a major feedforward input to CIP. Higher-level 3D representations and choice-related activity were more prevalent in CIP than V3A. Both areas contained saccade-related activity that predicted the direction/timing of eye movements. Intriguingly, the time-course of saccade-related activity in CIP aligned with the temporally integrated V3A output. Sensorimotor associations between 3D orientation and saccade direction preferences were stronger in CIP than V3A, and moderated by choice signals in both areas. Together, the results explicate parallel representations, hierarchical transformations, and functional associations of visual and saccade-related signals at a key juncture in the 'where' pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A systematic, complexity-reduction approach to dissect the kombucha tea microbiome</a></h4>

              
                One defining goal of microbiome research is to uncover mechanistic causation that dictates the emergence of structural and functional traits of microbiomes. However, the extraordinary degree of ecosystem complexity has hampered the realization of the goal. Here, we developed a systematic, complexity-reducing strategy to mechanistically elucidate the compositional and metabolic characteristics of microbiome by using the kombucha tea microbiome as an example. The strategy centered around a two-species core that was abstracted from but recapitulated the native counterpart. The core was convergent in its composition, coordinated on temporal metabolic patterns, and capable for pellicle formation. Controlled fermentations uncovered the drivers of these characteristics, which were also demonstrated translatable to provide insights into the properties of communities with increased complexity and altered conditions. This work unravels the pattern and process underlying the kombucha tea microbiome, providing a potential conceptual framework for mechanistic investigation of microbiome behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of early life stress and subsequent re-exposure to stress on neuronal activity in the lateral habenula</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress can result in depression in humans and depressive-like behaviour in rodents. In various animal models of depression, the lateral habenula (LHb) has been shown to become hyperactive immediately after early life stress. However, whether these pathological changes persist into adulthood is less well understood. Hence, we utilised the maternal separation (MS) model of depression to study how early life stress alters LHb physiology and depressive behaviour in adult mice. We find that only a weak depressive phenotype persists into adulthood which surprisingly is underpinned by LHb hypoactivity in acute slices, accompanied by alterations in both excitatory and inhibitory signalling. However, while we find the LHb to be less active at rest, we report that the neurons reside in a sensitised state where they are more responsive to re-exposure to stress in adulthood in the form of acute restraint, thus priming them to respond to aversive events with an increase in neuronal activity mediated by changes in glutamatergic transmission. These findings thus suggest that in addition to LHb hyperactivity, hypoactivity likely also promotes an adverse phenotype. Re-exposure to stress results in the reappearance of LHb hyperactivity offering a possible mechanism to explain how depression relapses occur following previous depressive episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stratification of responses to tDCS intervention in a healthy paediatric population based on resting-state EEG profiles</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with a wide variety of applications in both the clinical and cognitive psychology domains. As increasingly acknowledged, its effectiveness is subject dependent, which may lead to timely and costly treatments with ineffective results if this variability is not taken into account. We propose the usage of electroencephalography (EEG) for the analysis and prediction of individual responses to tDCS. In this context the application of machine learning can be of enormous help.

We analysed resting-state EEG activity to identify subgroups of participants with an homogeneous electrophysiological profile and their response to different tDCS interventions. The study described herein, which focuses on healthy controls, was conducted within a clinical trial for the development of treatments based on tDCS for age-matched children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

We have studied a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled tDCS intervention in 56 healthy children and adolescents aged 10-17, applied in 2 parallel groups over 2 target regions, namely left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (lDLPFC) and right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (rIFG). Cognitive behavioural tasks were used to both activate particular brain areas during the stimulation and to assess the impact of the intervention afterwards. We have implemented an unsupervised learning approach to stratify participants based on their resting-state EEG spectral features before the tDCS application. We have then applied a correlational analysis to identify EEG profiles associated with tDCS subject response to the specific stimulation sites and the presence or not of concurrent tasks during the intervention.

In the results we found specific digital electrophysiological profiles that can be associated to a positive response, whereas subjects with other profiles respond negatively or do not respond to the intervention. Findings suggest that unsupervised machine learning procedures, when associated with proper visualization features, can be successfully used to interpret and eventually to predict responses of individuals to tDCS treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychological mechanisms of offset analgesia: The effect of expectancy manipulation</a></h4>

              
                A frequently used paradigm to quantify endogenous pain modulation is offset analgesia, which is defined as a disproportionate large reduction in pain following a small decrease in a heat stimulus. The aim of this study was to determine whether suggestion influences the magnitude of offset analgesia in healthy participants. A total of 97 participants were randomized into three groups (hypoalgesic group, hyperalgesic group, control group). All participants received four heat stimuli (two constant trials and two offset trials) to the ventral, non-dominant forearm while they were asked to rate their perceived pain using a computerized visual analogue scale. In addition, electrodermal activity was measured during each heat stimulus. Participants in both intervention groups were given a visual and verbal suggestion about the expected pain response in an hypoalgesic and hyperalgesic manner. The control group received no suggestion. In all groups, significant offset analgesia was provoked, indicated by reduced pain ratings (p < 0.001) and enhanced electrodermal activity level (p < 0.01). A significant group difference in the magnitude of offset analgesia was found between the three groups (F[2,94] = 4.81, p < 0.05). Participants in the hyperalgesic group perceived significantly more pain than the hypoalgesic group (p = 0.031) and the control group (p < 0.05). However, the electrodermal activity data did not replicate this trend (p > 0.05). The results of this study indicate that suggestion can be effective to reduce but not increase endogenous pain modulation quantified by offset analgesia in healthy participants.
