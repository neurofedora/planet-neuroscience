              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normative values of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI signal in older adults obtained using a standard protocol for acquisition and analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: The integrity and function of catecholamine neurotransmitter systems can be assessed using MRI sequences often referred to as neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI). The relevance of this method to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders is becoming increasingly evident, and it has potential as a clinical biomarker. To support such future applications, we report here the normative range of NM-MRI signal and volume metrics in cognitively normal older adults. Methods: 3 Tesla NM-MRI images and demographic and cognitive data were available from 152 cognitively normal older adults aged 53-86 years old at baseline; a subsample of 68 participants also had follow-up NM-MRI data collected around one-year later. NM-MRI images were processed to yield summary measures of volume and signal (contrast-to-noise ratio, CNR) for the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) using a recently developed software employing a fully automated algorithm. The extent of annual change in these metrics was quantified and tested for significance using 1-sample t-tests. Results: Baseline SN signal (CNR) was 10.02% (left SN) and 10.28% (right) and baseline LC signal was 24.71% (left) and 20.42% (right). The only NM-MRI metric to show a significant annual change was a decrease in left SN volume. Conclusion: We report normative values for NM-MRI signal and volume in the SN and LC of cognitively normal older adults and normative values for their change over time. These values may help future efforts to use NM-MRI as a clinical biomarker for adults in this age range by facilitating identification of patients with extreme NM-MRI values.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tactile attention modulates occipital alpha oscillations in early blindness</a></h4>

              
                Alpha oscillatory activity is thought to contribute to the cueing of visual attention through the engagement of task-relevant occipital regions. In early blindness, occipital alpha oscillations are systematically reduced, suggesting that occipital alpha depends on visual experience. However, it is still unknown if alpha activity could serve attentional cueing in non-visual modalities in blind people, especially considering previous research that showed the recruitment of the occipital cortex for non-visual processing. To test this idea, we used electroencephalography to answer whether alpha oscillations reflected a differential recruitment of task-relevant regions between expected and unexpected conditions in two (texture and shape discrimination) haptic tasks. As expected, time frequency analyses showed that alpha suppression in parieto-occipital sites was significantly reduced in early blind individuals. The source reconstruction analysis revealed that group differences originated in the middle occipital cortex. In that region, expected trials evoked higher alpha desynchronization than unexpected trials in the EB group only. Our results support the role of alpha rhythms in the recruitment of occipital areas also in early blind participants, and for the first time we show that even if posterior alpha activity is reduced in blindness, it is however sensitive to task-dependent factors. Our findings therefore suggest that occipital alpha activity may be involved in tactile attention in blind individuals, maintaining the function proposed for visual attention in sighted population but switched to the tactile modality. Altogether, our results indicate that attention-dependent modulation of alpha oscillatory activity does not depend on visual experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute stress impairs sensorimotor gating via the neurosteroid allopregnanolone in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background and purpose: Ample evidence indicates that environmental stress impairs information processing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain partially elusive. We showed that, in several rodent models of psychopathology, the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) reduces the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle, a well-validated index of sensorimotor gating. Since this GABAA receptor activator is synthesized in response to acute stress, we hypothesized its participation in stress-induced PPI deficits. Experimental approach: We studied whether and how AP influences PPI in mice and rats; thereafter, we tested AP's implication in the PPI deficits produced by several complementary regimens of acute and short-term stress (footshock, restraint, predator exposure, and sleep deprivation). Key results: Systemic AP administration reduced PPI in C57BL/6J mice and Long-Evans, but not Sprague-Dawley, rats. These effects were reversed by isoallopregnanolone (isoAP), an endogenous AP antagonist, and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline and mimicked by AP infusions in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). PPI was reduced by acute footshock, sleep deprivation as well as the combination of restraint and predator exposure in a time- and intensity-dependent fashion. Acute stress increased AP concentrations in the mPFC, and its detrimental effects on PPI were countered by systemic and intra-mPFC administration of isoAP. Conclusions and implications: These results collectively indicate that acute stress impairs PPI by increasing AP content in the mPFC. The confirmation of these mechanisms across distinct animal models and several acute stressors strongly supports the translational value of these findings and warrants future research on the role of AP in information processing.

                Human microglia play a pivotal role in neurological diseases, but few targeted therapies that directly modulate microglial state or function exist due to an incomplete understanding of microglial heterogeneity. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile live human microglia from autopsies or surgical resections across diverse neurological diseases and central nervous system regions. We observe a central divide between oxidative and heterocyclic metabolism and identify subsets associated with antigen presentation, motility, and proliferation. Specific subsets are enriched in susceptibility genes for neurodegenerative diseases or the disease-associated microglial signature. We validate subtypes in situ with an RNAscope-immunofluorescence pipeline and leverage our dataset as a classification resource, finding that iPSC model systems recapitulate substantial in vivo heterogeneity. Finally, we identify and validate candidates for chemically inducing subtype-specific states in vitro, showing that Camptothecin downregulates the transcriptional signature of disease-enriched subsets and upregulates a signature previously shown to be depleted in Alzheimer's.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep state-dependent modulations of hippocampal theta oscillations and sharp wave-ripples by pontine waves</a></h4>

              
                Ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) or pontine (P) waves are a prominent electrophysiological marker of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Although P-waves have long been recognized, they have been less studied compared to other sleep-related neural events. Recent studies in mice and macaques uncovered state-dependent functional coupling of P-waves with hippocampal oscillations, including sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) during non-REM (NREM) sleep and theta oscillations during REM sleep. However, the detailed characteristic of this functional coupling remains unclear. In addition, since P-waves in mice have been reported rarely, it is also important to describe their detailed electrophysiological properties, given the importance of the animal model. Here, we address these issues by performing multiple types of electrophysiological recordings in mice. P-waves characterized by diverse brainstem firing appear more frequently during REM sleep, and in both hemispheres at the same time across sleep states. The P-wave frequency can also predict the duration of REM sleep episodes. While P-waves induce modulated hippocampal excitability and phase coupling with theta oscillations during REM sleep, surprisingly P-waves lead to shorter SWRs during NREM sleep. These results suggest that P-waves play a role in systems memory consolidation by functionally coupling with hippocampal ensembles in a state-dependent fashion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sticker-and-Linker Model for Amyloid BetaCondensation and Fibrillation</a></h4>

              
                A major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of neurotoxic plaques composed of amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptides in patients' brains. The pathway of plaque formation remains elusive, though some clues appear to lie in the dominant presence of A{beta}1-42 in these plaques despite A{beta}1-40 making up approximately 90% of the A{beta} pool. We hypothesise that this asymmetry is driven by the hydrophobicity of the two extra amino acids that are incorporated in A{beta}1-42. To investigate this hypothesis at the level of single molecules, we have developed a molecular 'sticker-and-linker lattice model' of unfolded A{beta}. The model protein has a single sticker that may reversibly dimerise and elongate into semi-flexible linear oligomers. The growth is hampered by excluded-volume interactions that are encoded by the hydrophilic linkers but are rendered cooperative by the attractive interactions of hydrophobic linkers. For sufficiently strong hydrophobicity, the chains undergo liquid-liquid phase-separation (LLPS) into condensates that facilitate the nucleation of fibres. We find that a small fraction of A{beta}1-40 in a mixture of A{beta}1-40 and A{beta}1-42 shift the critical concentration for LLPS to lower values. This study provides theoretical support for the hypothesis that LLPS condensates act as a precursor for aggregation and provides an explanation for the A{beta}1-42-enrichment of aggregates in terms of hydrophobic interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fatty acid metabolism changes in association with neurobehavioral deficits in animal models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders</a></h4>

              
                Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) show various behavioral problems due to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Our previous study found significant changes in gene expressions linked to fatty acid metabolism in the brain of the PAE mouse model. Given the importance of fatty acids in normal brain functions and the contributions to neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesized that the fatty acids changed by PAE contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD. This study found an increase of palmitic acid and arachidonic acid in phospholipid compositions in the cerebral cortex of PAE at postnatal day 30. The increase of palmitic acid was consistent with the increase of the producing enzyme, fatty acid synthase (Fasn). The decrease of 26:6 fatty acid was also found in phospholipid. It is consistent with the increase of the Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4) which uses 26:6 as a substrate for making very long chain fatty acids. However, there was no increase in the elongated products. Rather, we found an accumulation of the lipid droplets (LDs) in the PAE brain, suggesting changes in fatty acid metabolism that lead to the accumulation of excessive fatty acids. Although metabolic measurements, including plasma triglyceride level, were not affected by PAE, the abundance of fatty acid-related gut microbiota was altered. Interestingly, multi-omics association analysis revealed a potential contribution of the altered gut microbiota, primarily Ruminococcaceae that produces short chain fatty acid, to LD formation in the PAE brain and the behavioral problems, suggesting that the gut microbiome could serve as a tool to facilitate uncovering the brain pathophysiology of FASD and a potential target to mitigate neurobehavioral problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity fingerprints of the frontal eye fields and inferior frontal junction in the dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the frontal eye field (FEF) and inferior frontal junction (IFJ) govern the encoding of spatial and non-spatial (such as feature- or object-based) representations, respectively, both during visual attention and working memory tasks. However, it is still unclear whether such contrasting functional segregation is also reflected in their underlying functional connectivity patterns. Here, we hypothesized that FEF has predominant functional coupling with spatiotopically organized regions in the dorsal ('where') visual stream, whereas IFJ has predominant functional connectivity with the ventral ('what') visual stream. We applied seed-based functional connectivity analyses to temporally high-resolving resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We parcellated the brain according to the multimodal Glasser atlas and tested, for various frequency bands, whether the spontaneous activity of each parcel in the ventral and dorsal visual pathway has predominant functional connectivity with FEF or IFJ. The results show that FEF has a robust power correlation with the dorsal visual pathway in beta and gamma bands. In contrast, anterior IFJ (IFJa) has a strong power coupling with the ventral visual stream in delta, beta, and gamma oscillations. Moreover, while FEF is directly phase-coupled with the superior parietal lobe in the beta band, IFJa is directly phase-coupled with the middle and inferior temporal cortex in delta and gamma oscillations. We argue that these intrinsic connectivity fingerprints are congruent with each brain region's function. Therefore, we conclude that FEF and IFJ have dissociable connectivity patterns that fit their respective functional roles in spatial vs. non-spatial top-down attention and working memory control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneously cholinergic projection in Ascending and Descending Circuits from Midbrain</a></h4>

              
                The midbrain participates in complex neural information processing in the ascending and descending circuits, but their organization remains unclear due to the lack of comprehensive dissection of the characterization of individual neurons. Combining fluorescent micro-optical sectional tomography with sparse labeling, we acquired the whole-brain dataset with high resolution and reconstructed the detailed morphology of the pontine-tegmental cholinergic neurons (PTCNs). As the main cholinergic system of the midbrain, the individual PTCNs own abundant axons with length up to 60 cm and 5000 terminal branches and innervate multiple brain regions from the spinal cord to cortex in both hemispheres. According to various targeting regions in the ascending and descending circuits, individual PTCNs could be grouped into four types and the axonal fibers of cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus present more divergent while neurons in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus contain richer axonal fibers and dendrites. In the axonal targeting nuclei, such as in the thalamus or cortex, the individual neurons innervate multiple sub-regions with separate pathways. These results provide the detailed organization characterization of the cholinergic neurons to understand the connection logic of the midbrain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal effects of prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation on dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to increase dopaminergic activity in the dorsal striatum, a region strongly implicated in reinforcement learning. However, the behavioural influence of this effect remains largely unknown. Objective: Here, we tested the causal effects of rTMS on behavioral and computational characteristics of reinforcement learning. Methods: 40 healthy individuals were randomized into Active and Sham rTMS groups. Each participant underwent one 10-Hz rTMS session (1500 pulses) in which stimulation was applied over the left DLPFC using a robotic arm. Participants then completed a reinforcement learning task sensitive to striatal dopamine functioning. Participants trial-to-trial training choices were modelled using a reinforcement learning model (Q-learning) that calculates separate learning rates associated with positive and negative reward prediction errors. Results: Subjects receiving Active TMS exhibited an increased reward rate (number of correct responses per second of task activity) compared to the Sham rTMS group. Computationally, the Active rTMS group displayed a higher learning rate for correct trials (G) compared to incorrect trials (L). Finally, when tested with novel pairs of stimuli, the Active group displayed extremely fast reaction times, and a trend towards a higher reward rate. Conclusions: The present study provided specific behavioral and computational accounts of altered striatal-mediated reinforcement learning induced by a proposed increase of dopamine activity by 10-Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC. Together, these findings bolster the use of TMS to target neurocognitive disturbances attributed to the dysregulation of dopaminergic-striatal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated real-time EEG sleep spindle detection for brain state-dependent brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are a hallmark electroencephalographic (EEG) feature of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and believed to be instrumental for sleep-dependent memory reactivation and consolidation. However, direct proof of their causal relevance is hard to obtain, and our understanding of their immediate neurophysiological consequences is limited. To investigate their causal role, spindles need to be targeted in real-time with sensory or non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. While fully automated offline detection algorithms are well established, spindle detection in real time is highly challenging due to their spontaneous and transient nature. Here, we present the real-time spindle detector (RTSD), a robust multi-channel EEG signal processing algorithm that enables the automated triggering of stimulation during sleep spindles in a phase-specific manner. We validated the RTSD method by streaming pre-recorded sleep EEG datasets to a real-time computer system running a Simulink Real-Time implementation of the algorithm. Sleep spindles were detected with high levels of sensitivity (~83%) and precision (~78%) and an F1-score of ~0.81 in reference to state-of-the-art offline algorithms (which reached similar levels when compared to each other), for both naps and full nights, and largely independent of sleep scoring information. Detected spindles were comparable in frequency, duration, amplitude, and symmetry, and showed the typical time-frequency characteristics as well as a centroparietal topography. Spindles were detected close to their center and reliably at the predefined target phase. The RTSD algorithm therefore empowers researchers to target spindles during human sleep and apply the stimulation method and experimental paradigm of their choice.

                A growing number of social interactions are taking place virtually on video conferencing platforms. Here, we explore potential effects of virtual interactions on observed behavior, subjective experience, and neural "single-brain" and "inter-brain" activity via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. We scanned a total of 72 participants (36 dyads) who engaged with their partner in three naturalistic tasks (i.e., problem-solving, creative-innovation, socio-emotional task), in either an in-person or virtual (Zoom) condition. We also coded cooperative behavior from audio recordings. We found increased and sustained prefrontal activation in the virtual condition, potentially providing a neural basis of "Zoom fatigue". We also observed reduced behavioral cooperation (i.e., conversational turn-taking), and altered patterns of averaged and dynamic inter-brain coherence, in virtual interactions. Inter-brain coherence patterns that were characteristic of the virtual condition were associated with reduced behavioral cooperation. These insights can inform the design and engineering of the next generation of video conferencing technology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related hearing loss alters real-time dynamics of auditory cortical-brainstem coding during speech perception</a></h4>

              
                Realtime modulation of brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) by online changes in cortical arousal state via the corticofugal (top-down) pathway has been demonstrated previously in younger humans and is more prominent in the presence of background noise. FFRs during high cortical arousal states also have a stronger relationship with speech behaviors. Aging is associated with overexaggerated auditory responses, which might reflect degraded inhibitory processing within the peripheral and ascending pathways, or changes in attentional control regulation via descending auditory pathways. Here, we tested the hypothesis that online corticofugal interplay is impacted in age-related hearing loss. We measured EEG in older adults with normal-hearing (NH) and hearing-loss (HL) while they actively performed speech identification tasks in different noise backgrounds. We measured  power to index online arousal states during task engagement and separate speech-FFRs according to fluctuations in cortical activity. We found cortical  power was smaller in the HL than NH group. In NH listeners, -FFRs modulation for clear speech also resembled that previously observed in noise among younger adults. Cortical-brainstem modulation was further diminished by noise and with HL in older adults. Lastly, neural decoding showed low- FFRs were more predictive of behavioral measures and carried more stimulus-related information of speech in NH individuals. Our findings provide evidence that age-related hearing loss affects cortical-brainstem interplay in the auditory system. Aberrant modulation of brainstem speech processing exposes a new underlying mechanism for the listening difficulties faced by older adults when engaging in cocktail party-like conversations.

                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that regulates several aspects of brain function. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the expression and function of BDNF in neurons, its expression in microglia remains controversial. Using a combination of genetic tools and fluorescence imaging, we analyzed BDNF expression pattern and interrogated the effect of microglial BDNF deletion on neuronal activity, early-stage spine formation, and microglia-neuron interactions in the motor cortex. Our results suggest that microglia do not express BDNF in sufficient amounts to modulate neuronal function.

                Neuroimaging technology has experienced explosive growth and has transformed the study of neural mechanisms across health and disease. However, given the diversity of sophisticated tools for handling neuroimaging data, the field faces challenges around method integration (1-3). Specifically, researchers often have to rely on siloed approaches which limit reproducibility, with idiosyncratic data organization and limited software interoperability. To address these challenges, we developed Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & Toolbox (QuNex), a platform for consistent end-to-end processing and analytics. QuNex is engineered for reproducible deployment of custom workflows, from onboarding raw data to generating analytic features, in a single "turnkey" command. The platform enables inter-operable integration of multi-modal, community-developed neuroimaging software through an extension framework with a software development kit for seamless integration of community tools. Critically, it supports high-throughput, parallel processing in high-performance compute environments, either locally or in the cloud. Notably, QuNex has successfully processed over 10,000 scans across neuroimaging consortia (4), including multiple clinical datasets. Moreover, QuNex enables integration of non-human primate, rodent, and human workflows via a cohesive translational platform. Collectively, this effort stands to significantly impact neuroimaging method integration across acquisition approaches, pipelines, datasets, computational environments, and species. Building on this platform will enable more rapid, scalable, and reproducible impact of neuroimaging technology across health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bumetanide increases microglia-interneuron contact following traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) inhibitor bumetanide has prominent positive effects on the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders. Here we studied whether bumetanide could influence post-traumatic cognitive decline and inflammatory processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation. Method: Controlled cortical impacted (CCI) animals were treated with bumetanide during the first post-CCI week. Immunochemistry, flow cytometry, immunoassay, and in vivo imaging were used to study astrocytic and microglial morphology and phenotype as well as adult neurogenesis. Telemetric electroencephalograms and cognitive behavioral test were performed at one-month post CCI. Results: Bumetanide prevented CCI-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and parvalbumin positive interneuron loss. Deletion of NKCC1 in astrocytes neither rescued interneurons nor promote neurogenesis. Interestingly, bumetanide had a strong effect on microglial activation by inducing polarization towards the M1-like phenotype 3 days post-CCI and the M2-like phenotype 7 days post-CCI. Bumetanide increased microglial Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and interaction with parvalbumin interneurons. The early treatment with bumetanide resulted in improvements in working and episodic memory, one-month post-CCI, as well as the normalization of theta band oscillations. Interpretation: Here, we disclose a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective action of bumetanide mediated by an acceleration of microglial activation dynamics that leads to an increase of parvalbumin interneuron survival following CCI, possibly resulting from increased microglial BDNF expression and contact with interneurons. Salvage of interneurons may normalize ambient gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulting in the preservation of adult neurogenesis processes as well as contributing to bumetanide-mediated improvement of cognitive performance.

                For animals to navigate an uncertain world, their brains need to estimate uncertainty at the timescales of sensations and actions. Sampling-based algorithms afford a theoretically-grounded framework for probabilistic inference in neural circuits, but it remains unknown how one can implement fast sampling algorithms in biologically-plausible spiking networks. Here, we propose to leverage the population geometry, controlled by the neural code and the neural dynamics, to implement fast samplers in spiking neural networks. We first show that that two classes of spiking samplers--efficient balanced spiking networks that simulate Langevin sampling, and networks with probabilistic spike rules that implement Metropolis-Hastings sampling--can be unified within a common framework. We then show that careful choice of population geometry enables rapid inference of parameters drawn from strongly-correlated high-dimensional distributions in both networks. Our results suggest design principles for algorithms for sampling-based probabilistic inference in spiking neural networks, yielding potential inspiration for neuromorphic computing and testable predictions for neurobiology.

                Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are commonly used models to study neural computation. However, a comprehensive understanding of how dynamics in RNN emerge from the underlying connectivity is largely lacking. Previous work derived such an understanding for RNN fulfilling very specific constraints on their connectivity, but it is unclear whether the resulting insights apply more generally. Here we study how network dynamics are related to network connectivity in RNN trained without any specific constraints on several tasks previously employed in neuroscience. Despite the apparent high-dimensional connectivity of these RNN, we show that a low-dimensional, functionally relevant subspace of the weight matrix can be found through the identification of operative dimensions, which we define as components of the connectivity whose removal has a large influence on local RNN dynamics. We find that a weight matrix built from only a few operative dimensions is sufficient for the RNN to operate with the original performance, implying that much of the high-dimensional structure of the trained connectivity is functionally irrelevant. The existence of a low-dimensional, operative subspace in the weight matrix simplifies the challenge of linking connectivity to network dynamics and suggests that independent network functions may be placed in specific, separate subspaces of the weight matrix to avoid catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.

	<p>Background: Motor inhibition is a complex cognitive function regulated by specific brain regions and influenced by the activity of the Central Autonomic Network. We investigate the two-way Brain&amp;amp;ndash;Heart interaction during a Go/NoGo task. Spectral EEG &amp;amp;thetasym;, &amp;amp;alpha; powerbands, and HRV parameters (Complexity Index (CI), Low Frequency (LF) and High Frequency (HF) powers) were recorded. Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers were enrolled. We used a modified version of the classical Go/NoGo task, based on Rule Shift Cards, characterized by a baseline and two different tasks of different complexity. The participants were divided into subjects with Good (GP) and Poor (PP) performances. Results: In the baseline, CI was negatively correlated with &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. In task 1, the CI was negatively correlated with the errors and &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;, while the errors were positively correlated with &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. In task 2, CI was negatively correlated with the Reaction Time and positively with &amp;amp;alpha;, and the errors were negatively correlated with the Reaction Time and positively correlated with &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. The GP group showed, at baseline, a negative correlation between CI and &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. Conclusions: We provide a new combined Brain&amp;amp;ndash;Heart model underlying inhibitory control abilities. The results are consistent with the complementary role of &amp;amp;alpha; and &amp;amp;thetasym; oscillations in cognitive control.</p>

	<p>The meningeal lymphatic, or glymphatic, system is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community. Recent work includes noninvasive techniques to demonstrate relationships between blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) activity and the glymphatic system in the human central nervous system. One potential technique is the use of music/sound to enhance BBB permeability regarding the movement of small molecules in and out of the brain. However, there is minimal knowledge regarding the methodical investigation(s) of the uses of music/sound on BBB permeability and glymphatic clearance and the outcomes of these investigation(s). This review contains evidence discussing relationships between music/sound, BBB permeability, and meningeal lymphatic clearance. An overview of the anatomy and physiology of the system is presented. We discuss the uses of music/sound to modulate brain and body functions, highlighting music&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on mood and autonomic, cognitive, and neuronal function. We also propose implications for follow-up work. The results showed that music and sound interventions do, in fact, contribute to the opening of the BBB and subsequently increase the function of the meningeal lymphatic system. Evidence also suggests that music/sound has the ability to reduce the collateral effects of brain injuries. Unfortunately, music/sound is rarely used in the clinical setting as a medical intervention. Still, recent research shows the potential positive impacts that music/sound could have on various organ systems.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to capture subjective daily functional cognitive decline among patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Participants (40&amp;amp;ndash;79 y; 78 with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and 41 healthy matched controls) completed the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Cognitive Functional Rating Scale (CFRS), Daily Living Questionnaire (DLQ), and Time Organisation and Participation Scale (TOPS) questionnaires. Patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease were divided into groups with or without suspected mild cognitive decline according to their scores on the Cognitive Functional (CF) feature, which is based on certain items of the MDS-UPDRS. Significant between-group differences were found in the DLQ and TOPS scores. Significant correlations were found among the questionnaire results, with specific DLQ and TOPS items accounting for 35% of the variance in the CF feature, which correlated with daily cognitive functional states. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results are relevant for detecting subtle deficits in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease patients suspected of mild cognitive decline, which can affect health and quality of life and relates to risk for later dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal recruitment of inhibition and excitation in the mammalian cortex during electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation has emerged as a powerful and precise treatment in which to modulate aberrant neural activity patterns common in neural dysfunction and disease; however, the physiological process involved in microstimulation is poorly understood, particularly regarding the contributions of inhibitory neurons to shaping stimulation-evoked activity. To address this issue, we used 2-photon imaging of transgenic mice to measure the widespread responses of inhibitory and excitatory neurons to electrical stimulation through a chronically-implanted cortical microelectrode. We found that increasing stimulation amplitude both raised the fraction of neurons that responded to a stimulus and increased the distance at which inhibitory and excitatory neurons were significantly modulated by stimulation; however, the lateral spread of inhibitory activity preceded that of excitatory activity. By 50 micro-Amps, a significantly larger fraction of inhibitory neurons vs. excitatory neurons were modulated by stimulation. Increasing amplitude also shifted the temporal response properties of the population --- towards longer-latency excitation close to the electrode tip and strong inhibition of more distant neurons. Animal behavior, specifically their locomotion patterns, strongly correlated with trial-to-trial variability in stimulation evoked responses. We conclude that changing electrical stimulation amplitude can shift the balance of excitation to inhibition in the brain in a manner that interact with ongoing animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical closed-loop voltage clamp for precise control of muscles and neurons in live animals</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetics are used to stimulate or inhibit neurons. Because optogenetic stimulation is typically static, neurons and circuits can quickly adapt, allowing perturbation, but not true control. To overcome this, we established an optogenetic voltage-clamp (OVC). The genetically encoded voltage-indicator QuasAr2 provides information for fast, closed-loop optical feedback to the bidirectional optogenetic actuator BiPOLES. Voltage-dependent fluorescence is held within tight margins, thus clamping the cell at a distinct potential. We established the OVC in muscles and neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans, and transferred it to hippocampal neurons in rat brain slices. We calibrated fluorescence signals to electrically measured membrane potentials, showed that the OVC reports on homeostatically altered cellular physiology in mutants affecting neurotransmission, and that it can dynamically clamp spiking. The OVC combines non-invasive imaging with the control capabilities of electrophysiology. Its applicability to individual cells facilitates high-throughput contact-less electrophysiology and paves the way for true optogenetic control in behaving animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in Auditory, Static, and Dynamic Imbalance Behaviors: Implications for Vestibular Migraine</a></h4>

              
                About 42% of people with migraine have a vestibular component causing balance problems and dizziness. In fact, VM is a major cause of vertigo in dizziness clinics and is estimated to affect 1% of the overall population. As migraine increases light, and sound sensitivities, it also increases sensitivities to movement or perceived movement in VM. Patients with migraine, and especially VM, exhibit a heightened sense of sound, or phonophobia. Phonophobia is also related to hyperacusis (extreme sensitivity to sound). Behavioral evidence of hyperacusis and phonophobia in mice can be inferred using the acoustic startle reflex (ASR). The most common symptoms of VM were unsteadiness, balance disturbances, and light headedness. When balance disturbances were quantified, VM patients swayed more than migraine-only or healthy controls, when challenged with competing stimulus. In addition to static imbalance, VM patients also showed dynamic imbalances such as gait disturbances. In this study, we tested wildtype C57B6/J mice to determine if mice exhibited increased sound (measured by acoustic startle), static imbalance (measured by postural sway), and dynamic imbalance (measured by rotarod), when challenged with systemic CGRP (IP) 0.1 mg/kg. We found both sexes of mice were affected by systemic CGRP in sound and dynamic imbalance testing, yet only female mice showed increased postural sway after systemic CGRP, recapitulating the higher incidence of VM in females. These non-invasive assays of VM pave the way to further explore mechanisms of CGRP signaling in VM, and test effectiveness of migraine therapeutics in VM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Receptor Antagonism Reduces Motion Sickness Indicators in Mouse Models of Vestibular Migraine</a></h4>

              
                Migraine and vestibular migraine (VM) are associated with enhanced motion sensitivity, and VM is the most common cause of spontaneous vertigo but remains poorly understood. It is now accepted that migraine involves the neuropeptide Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP); yet it is not clear if CGRP signaling or its antagonism is involved in motion sensitivity of VM symptoms. Recent murine models of migraine used injections of CGRP or other migraine triggers (sodium nitroprusside SNP) to induce migraine sensitivities, yet it is not known if these triggers can induce VM sensitivities. Moreover, it is not known if migraine blockers used in preclinical migraine models, can also block the motion-sensitivity of VM. To better understand CGRP signallingin VM motion sensitivity, we investigated two measures of motion sickness assessment (MSI scoring and motion-induced thermoregulation) after systemic injections of either CGRP or SNP in the wildtype C57B6/J mice, and found that MSI measures were confounded by CGRPs effect on based on gastric distress, yet assessing motion sensitivity using thermoregulation was robust for both migraine triggers, and CGRP receptor antagonism by olcegepant, but not triptan treatments, rescued CGRPs effect on increased motion sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of non-human primate dura in health and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Brain meninges and associated vasculature participate in brain clearance and are implicated in many neurological conditions such as Alzheimers disease, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. However, most of our knowledge concerning brain clearance via meninges is based on rodent data, and relevance to human disease remains unclear. One of the technical barriers in studies of meningeal physiology in health and disease is that existing imaging modalities are suboptimal for large and optically non-transparent meningeal tissue of humans and non-human primate (NHP) animal models. To address this barrier, we performed first characterization of NHP dura by high resolution confocal microscopy of clarified tissue. We investigated vascular structures and resident cells in normal monkeys and primate models of tauopathy and synucleinopathy. We demonstrated the presence of an extensive meningeal vascular network covering the entire tissue surface with resolution to the smallest capillaries. This is also the first work to map lymphatic vessels in the dura of non-human primate (NHP). Overall, the NHP lymphatic meningeal system resembles the anatomy found in rat dura, but it is more complex. Analysis of dura from NPH models of tauopathy and synucleinopathy revealed an association with disease-specific biomarkers (amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein) with both the blood and lymphatic vasculature. This work has broad relevance to many brain diseases where solute accumulation and abnormal macromolecular clearance is a part of the pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the role of Ca2+ fluxes in defining fast and slow components of spontaneous Ca2+ local transients in OPCs using computational modeling</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous Ca2+ local transients (SCaLTs) in isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are largely regulated by the following fluxes: store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX), Ca2+ pumping through Ca2+-ATPases, and Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release through Ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol-triphosphate receptors (IP3R). However, the relative contributions of these fluxes in mediating fast spiking and slow baseline oscillations seen in SCaLTs remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed a stochastic spatiotemporal computational model to simulate SCaLTs in a homogeneous medium with ion flow between the extracellular, cytoplasmic and endoplasmicreticulum compartments. By simulating the model and plotting both the histograms of SCaLTs obtained experimentally and from the model as well as the standard deviation of interspike intervals (ISI) against ISI averages of multiple model and experimental realizations we revealed that: SCaLTs exhibit very similar characteristics between the two datasets, they are mostly random, they encode information in their frequency, and the slow baseline oscillations could be due to the stochastic slow clustering of IP3R (modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process). Bifurcation analysis of a deterministic temporal version of the model shows that the contribution of fluxes to SCaLTs depends on the parameter regime and that the combination of excitability, stochasticity, and mixedmode oscillations are responsible for irregular spiking and doublets in SCaLTs. Additionally, our results demonstrate that blocking each flux reduces SCaLTs frequency and that the reverse (forward) mode of NCX decreases (increases) SCaLTs. Taken together, these results provide a quantitative framework for SCaLT formation in OPCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of a Translational Murine Model of Closed-head Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) from closed-head trauma is a leading cause of disability with limited efficacious treatments. Modeling closed-head TBI remains challenging due to applying forces through the intact skull. We systematically investigated sources of variability in a murine model of closed-head TBI and developed a framework to reduce variability across severity and sex. We manipulated gas pressure, dwell time, and displacement to determine effects on vestibulomotor performance, spatial learning, and neuronal damage in 10-week-old male and female mice. Increasing gas pressure beyond 70psi had a ceiling effect on cellular and behavioral outcomes, while manipulating dwell time only affected behavioral performance. Increasing displacement precisely graded injury severity in both sexes across all outcomes. Physical signs of trauma occurred more frequently at higher displacements. Females performed worse than males when injured at 2.7mm displacement and had greater mortality at higher displacements. Stratifying severity based on day-1 rotarod performance retained cellular injury relationships and separated both sexes into cohorts with distinct behavioral recovery. Within-group rotarod variability over 6 days post-injury was reduced by approximately 50%. These results have important implications for translational research in TBI and provide a framework for using this clinically relevant translational injury model in both male and female mice.

                Lysosomal dysfunction arises early and propels Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Herein, we show that amyloid precursor protein (APP), linked to early-onset AD in Down Syndrome (DS), acts directly via its {beta}-C-terminal fragment ({beta}CTF) to disrupt lysosomal v-ATPase and acidification. In human DS fibroblasts or brains of DS model mice, the phosphorylated 682YENPTY internalization motif of APP-{beta}CTF binds selectively within a pocket of the v-ATPase V0a1 submit cytoplasmic domain and competitively inhibits its association with the V1 subcomplex of v-ATPase. Inhibiting FYN, a mediator of APP Tyr682 phosphorylation which is over-active in AD and DS, restores normal v-ATPase and lysosome function in DS fibroblasts and DS model mice. Notably, lowering APP-{beta}CTF or APP Tyr682 phosphorylation below normal baseline levels boosts v-ATPase assembly and acidification, suggesting that v-ATPase may also be modulated tonically by phospho-APP-{beta}CTF. These findings offer insight into pathogenic mechanisms also relevant to late onset AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An integrated approach to evaluate the functional effects of disease-associated NMDA receptor variants</a></h4>

              
                The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a ubiquitously expressed glutamate-gated ion channel that plays key roles in brain development and function. Not surprisingly, a variety of disease-associated variants have been identified in genes encoding NMDAR subunits. A critical first step to assess whether these variants contribute to their associated disorder is to characterize their effect on receptor function. However, the complexity of NMDAR function makes this challenging, with most variants typically altering multiple functional properties. At synapses, NMDARs encode presynaptic activity to carry a charge transfer that alters membrane excitability and a Ca2+ influx that has both short- and long-term signaling actions. Here, we characterized epilepsy-associated variants in GluN1 and GluN2A subunits with various phenotypic severity. To capture the dynamics of NMDAR encoding, we applied 10 glutamate pulses at 10 Hz to derive a charge integral. This encoding assay is advantageous since it incorporates multiple gating parameters, activation, deactivation, and desensitization, into a single value. We then integrated this encoding with Mg2+ block and Ca2+ influx using fractional Ca2+ currents to generate indices of charge transfer and Ca2+ transfer over wide voltage ranges. This approach yields consolidated parameters that can be used as a reference to normalize allosteric modulation and has the potential to speed up future bench to bedside methods of investigating variants to determine patient treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Over-expression of thyroid hormone receptor β2 in zebrafish changes the distribution of cone spectral signals</a></h4>

              
                Thyroid hormone receptor {beta}2 (tr{beta}2), a splice variant of thyroxin receptor {beta}, is a transcription factor/nuclear receptor selectively expressed in vertebrate long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS/red) retinal cones and essential for LWS cone development. Using two gain-of-function zebrafish transgenics, we examine the physiological and morphological impact of excess tr{beta}2 in zebrafish cone specification. The crx:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2 transgenic expresses tr{beta}2 early, in retinal progenitors, while gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2;mpv17-/- expresses tr{beta}2 later, in differentiated cone cells. Here electroretinographic signals are isolated from cones by synaptic blockade and the cone spectral composition analyzed. In 5-day crx:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2 embryos, UV- and blue-cone signals are attenuated while LWS2 (larval red-cone opsin) amplitudes increase. 5-day gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2;mpv17-/- spectra are indistinguishable from controls but LWS2 signals surpass controls during later embryonic and juvenile stages. By adulthood, both transgenics become entirely, or almost entirely, red cone dichromats, with LWS1 (adult red-cone opsin) amplitudes becoming super-normal, exceeding adult LWS2 signals, which are unchanged. Adult control LWS1 and LWS2 signal amplitudes are about equal. There are mixed opsin cones in both transgenic larvae. In gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2;mpv17-/-, mixed UV- red- opsin immunoreactive cones, a reporter for the UV opsin gene is suppressed, suggesting a UV-to-red cone transformation process. Larval cones with gain-of-function transgenes are morphologically distinct from red, blue or UV cones, with wider inner segments and shorter axons than red cones, suggesting both cone spectral specification and shape are influenced by tr{beta}2.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-invasive auditory brainstem responses to FM sweeps in awake big brown bats</a></h4>

              
                We introduce two EEG techniques, one based on conventional monopolar electrodes and one based on a novel tripolar electrode, to record for the first time auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from the scalp of unanesthetized, unrestrained big brown bats. Stimuli were frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps varying in sweep direction, sweep duration, and harmonic structure. As expected from previous invasive ABR recordings, upward-sweeping FM signals evoked larger amplitude responses (peak-to-trough amplitude in the latency range of 3-5 ms post-stimulus onset) than downward-sweeping FM signals. Scalp-recorded responses displayed amplitude-latency trading effects as expected from invasive recordings. These two findings validate the reliability of our noninvasive recording techniques. The feasibility of recording noninvasively in unanesthetized, unrestrained bats will energize future research uncovering electrophysological signatures of perceptual and cognitive processing of biosonar signals in these animals, and allows for better comparison with ABR data from echolocating cetaceans, where invasive experiments are heavily restricted. Because experiments can be repeated in the same animal over time without confounds of stress or anesthesia, our technique requires fewer captures of wild bats, thus helping to preserve natural populations and addressing the goal of reducing animal numbers used for research purposes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extrinsic control of the early postnatal CA1 hippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                The adult CA1 region of the hippocampus produces coordinated neuronal dynamics with minimal reliance on its extrinsic inputs. In contrast, the neonatal CA1 is tightly linked to externally-generated sensorimotor activity but the circuit mechanisms underlying early synchronous activity in CA1 remain unclear. Here, using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo circuit mapping, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings in mouse pups, we show that early dynamics in the ventro-intermediate CA1 are under the mixed influence of entorhinal (EC) and thalamic (VMT) inputs. Both VMT and EC can drive internally-generated synchronous events ex vivo. However, movement-related population bursts detected in vivo are exclusively driven by the EC. These differential effects on synchrony reflect the different intrahippocampal targets of these inputs. Hence, cortical and subcortical pathways act differently on the neonatal CA1, implying distinct contributions to the development of the hippocampal microcircuit and related cognitive maps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of structural features of selected flavonoids responsible for neuroprotection using a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Nature-derived bioactive compounds have emerged as promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of diverse chronic illnesses, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying their neuroprotective effects remain unclear. Most studies focus solely on the antioxidant activities of natural products which translate to poor outcome in clinical trials. Current therapies against neurodegeneration only provide symptomatic relief thereby underscoring the need for novel strategies to combat disease onset and progression. We have employed an environmental toxin-induced Drosophila Parkinson's disease (PD) model as an inexpensive in vivo screening platform to explore neuroprotective potential of selected dietary flavonoids. We have identified a specific group of flavonoids known as flavones displaying protection against paraquat (PQ)-induced neurodegenerative phenotypes, involving reduced survival, mobility defects and enhanced oxidative stress. Interestingly, the other groups of investigated flavonoids, namely, the flavonones and flavonols failed to provide protection indicating a requirement of specific structural features that confer protection against PQ-mediated neurotoxicity in Drosophila. Based on our screen, the neuroprotective flavones lack a functional group substitution at the C3 and contain ,{beta}-unsaturated carbonyl group. Furthermore, flavones-mediated neuroprotection is not solely dependent on antioxidant properties but also involves regulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Our data identify specific structural features of selected flavonoids that provide neuroprotection against environmental toxin-induced PD pathogenesis that can be explored for novel therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feasibility of 3T layer-dependent fMRI with GE-BOLD using NORDIC and phase regression</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Functional MRI with spatial resolution in the submillimeter domain enables measurements of activation across cortical layers in humans. This is valuable as different types of cortical computations, e.g., feedforward versus feedback related activity, take place in different cortical layers. Layer-dependent fMRI (L-fMRI) studies have almost exclusively employed 7T scanners to overcome the reduced signal stability associated with small voxels. However, such systems are relatively rare and only a subset of those are clinically approved. In the present study, we examined the feasibility of L-fMRI at 3T using NORDIC denoising. Methods: 5 healthy subjects were scanned on a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner. To assess across-session reliability, each subject was scanned in 3-8 sessions on 3-4 consecutive days. A 3D gradient echo EPI (GE-EPI) sequence was used for BOLD acquisitions (voxel size 0.82 mm isotopic, TR = 2.2 s) using a block designed finger tapping paradigm. NORDIC denoising was applied to the magnitude and phase time series to overcome limitations in tSNR and the denoised phase time series were subsequently used to correct for large vein contamination through phase regression. Results and conclusion: NORDIC denoising resulted in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) values comparable to or higher than commonly observed at 7T. Layer-dependent activation profiles could thus be extracted robustly, within and across sessions, from regions of interest located in the hand knob of the primary motor cortex (M1). Phase regression led to substantially reduced superficial bias in obtained layer profiles, although residual macrovascular contribution remained. We believe the present results support the feasibility of L-fMRI at 3T, which might help make L-fMRI available to a much wider community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neuroeconomics of individual differences in saccadic decisions</a></h4>

              
                Active exploration of the visual environment requires choosing the next gaze target, which has been characterized as depending on attentional biases and on oculomotor biases. However, disentangling these two factors has provided contradictory results. Here, we conceptualize active gaze selection as a decision-making process in the context of neuroeconomics, allowing us to employ a new saccadic preference elicitation experiment and to quantify behavioral biases with a random utility model. Subjects showed similar preferences for shorter amplitude saccades in line with previous research and shared a preference for saccades back towards the previous gaze location, contrary to numerous reports on spatial "inhibition of return". Surprisingly, the experiment revealed marked individual differences in the preferences for global gaze directions, which were stable across most participants after one week. Thus, this study provides the first measurement of intrinsic saccadic utilities independently of spatial image properties and quantitatively dissociates stable individual differences in global gaze selection.

	<p>Most research analyzed gut-microbiota alterations in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) through cross-sectional studies, as single snapshots, without considering the time factor to either confirm methods and findings or observe longitudinal variations. In this study, we introduce the time factor by comparing gut-microbiota composition in 18 PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC) at baseline and at least 1 year later, also considering PD clinical features. PD patients and HC underwent a fecal sampling at baseline and at a follow-up appointment. Fecal samples underwent sequencing and 16S rRNA amplicons analysis. Patients&amp;amp;rsquo;clinical features were valued through Hoehn&amp;amp;amp;Yahr (H&amp;amp;amp;Y) staging-scale and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part-III. Results demonstrated stability in microbiota findings in both PD patients and HC over a period of 14 months: both alfa and beta diversity were maintained in PD patients and HC over the observation period. In addition, differences in microbiota composition between PD patients and HC remained stable over the time period. Moreover, during the same period, patients did not experience any worsening of either staging or motor impairment. Our findings, highlighting the stability and reproducibility of the method, correlate clinical and microbiota stability over time and open the scenario to more extensive longitudinal evaluations.</p>

	<p>To further understand how consciousness emerges, certain paradigms inducing distractor-induced perceptual impairments are promising. Neuro-computational models explain the inhibition of conscious perception of targets with suppression of distractor information when the target and distractor share the same features. Because these gating mechanisms are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, transcranial direct current stimulation of this specific region is expected to alter distractor-induced effects depending on the presence and number of distractors. To this end, participants were asked to perform an auditory variant of the distractor-induced blindness paradigm under frontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Results show the expected distractor-induced deafness effects in a reduction of target detection depending on the number of distractors. While tDCS had no significant effects on target detection per se, error rates due to missed cues are increased under stimulation. Thus, while our variant led to successful replication of behavioral deafness effects, the results under tDCS stimulation indicate that the chosen paradigm may have difficulty too low to respond to stimulation. That the error rates nevertheless led to a tDCS effect may be due to the divided attention between the visual cue and the auditory target.</p>

	<p>Objective: In this study, we assessed the correlation between the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to phosphate ratio and the prognosis of microsurgical clippings for ruptured intracranial aneurysm (rIA) to test the hypothesis that the serum LDH to phosphate ratio could be a predictor of the outcome of microsurgical clipping for rIA. Methods: Records of rIA patients between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively collected. Age, sex, Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher grade, medical history, aneurysm location, hydrocephalus, laboratory data including serum LDH, phosphate, and LDH to phosphate ratio, related complications, and the outcomes in 3 months were recorded. Results: A total of 1608 rIA patients in our institution were collected, and 856 patients treated by microsurgical clipping were enrolled. On admission, a significantly higher LDH-phosphate ratio was observed in patients with poor outcomes at 3 months (median &amp;amp;plusmn;SD, 200.175 &amp;amp;plusmn; 107.290 for mRS 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 vs. 323.826 &amp;amp;plusmn; 219.075 for mRS score 3&amp;amp;ndash;6; p =0.000). An LDH to phosphate ratio of 226.25 in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was the optimal cutoff value to discriminate between good and poor outcomes at 3 months. The LDH to phosphate ratio &amp;amp;ge; 226.25 on admission was independently correlated with poor outcomes in rIA patients. In addition, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, pneumonia, and DIND were also independently correlated with poor outcomes. After removing the bias in essential clinical variables between patients with LDH to phosphate, ratio &amp;amp;ge; 226.25 versus &amp;amp;lt;226.25 by PSM, the number of patients with poor outcomes at 3 months increased in patients with an LDH to phosphate ratio of &amp;amp;ge; 226.25 (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The LDH to phosphate ratio was a potential biomarker and could predict the unfavorable outcome of microsurgical clipping for rIA in 3 months, related to neuronal damage, cerebral hypoxia, and early brain injury after aneurysm ruptures.</p>

     alt="From retina to motoneurons: A substrate for visuomotor transformation in salamanders"/>
<p>We provide anatomical and physiological evidence of a retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway in salamanders. This pathway provides a substrate for the transformation of visual information into a motor command and is well positioned to control orienting behaviors when approaching a prey for instance.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing, we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labeled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labeled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Strain design optimization using reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maryam Sabzevari, Sandor Szedmak, Merja Penttilä, Paula Jouhten, Juho Rousu</p>

Engineered microbial cells present a sustainable alternative to fossil-based synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Cellular synthesis routes are readily assembled and introduced into microbial strains using state-of-the-art synthetic biology tools. However, the optimization of the strains required to reach industrially feasible production levels is far less efficient. It typically relies on trial-and-error leading into high uncertainty in total duration and cost. New techniques that can cope with the complexity and limited mechanistic knowledge of the cellular regulation are called for guiding the strain optimization.
In this paper, we put forward a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns from experiments to tune the metabolic enzyme levels so that the production is improved. Our method is model-free and does not assume prior knowledge of the microbe’s metabolic network or its regulation. The multi-agent approach is well-suited to make use of parallel experiments such as multi-well plates commonly used for screening microbial strains.
We demonstrate the method’s capabilities using the genome-scale kinetic model of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, k-ecoli457, as a surrogate for an <i>in vivo</i> cell behaviour in cultivation experiments. We investigate the method’s performance relevant for practical applicability in strain engineering i.e. the speed of convergence towards the optimum response, noise tolerance, and the statistical stability of the solutions found. We further evaluate the proposed MARL approach in improving L-tryptophan production by yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, using publicly available experimental data on the performance of a combinatorial strain library.
Overall, our results show that multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising approach for guiding the strain optimization beyond mechanistic knowledge, with the goal of faster and more reliably obtaining industrially attractive production levels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From affinity selection to kinetic selection in Germinal Centre modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Danial Lashgari, Elena Merino Tejero, Michael Meyer-Hermann, Mathieu A. F. Claireaux, Marit J. van Gils, Huub C. J. Hoefsloot, Antoine H. C. van Kampen</p>

Affinity maturation is an evolutionary process by which the affinity of antibodies (Abs) against specific antigens (Ags) increases through rounds of B-cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and positive selection in germinal centres (GC). The positive selection of B cells depends on affinity, but the underlying mechanisms of affinity discrimination and affinity-based selection are not well understood. It has been suggested that selection in GC depends on both rapid binding of B-cell receptors (BcRs) to Ags which is kinetically favourable and tight binding of BcRs to Ags, which is thermodynamically favourable; however, it has not been shown whether a selection bias for kinetic properties is present in the GC. To investigate the GC selection bias towards rapid and tight binding, we developed an agent-based model of GC and compared the evolution of founder B cells with initially identical low affinities but with different association/dissociation rates for Ag presented by follicular dendritic cells in three Ag collection mechanisms. We compared an Ag collection mechanism based on association/dissociation rates of B-cell interaction with presented Ag, which includes a probabilistic rupture of bonds between the B-cell and Ag (Scenario-1) with a reference scenario based on an affinity-based Ag collection mechanism (Scenario-0). Simulations showed that the mechanism of Ag collection affects the GC dynamics and the GC outputs concerning fast/slow (un)binding of B cells to FDC-presented Ags. In particular, clones with lower dissociation rates outcompete clones with higher association rates in Scenario-1, while remaining B cells from clones with higher association rates reach higher affinities. Accordingly, plasma cell and memory B cell populations were biased towards B-cell clones with lower dissociation rates. Without such probabilistic ruptures during the Ag extraction process (Scenario-2), the selective advantage for clones with very low dissociation rates diminished, and the affinity maturation level of all clones decreased to the reference level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CellDynaMo–stochastic reaction-diffusion-dynamics model: Application to search-and-capture process of mitotic spindle assembly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evgenii Kliuchnikov, Artem Zhmurov, Kenneth A. Marx, Alex Mogilner, Valeri Barsegov</p>

We introduce a Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion-Dynamics Model (SRDDM) for simulations of cellular mechanochemical processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The SRDDM model is mapped into the CellDynaMo package, which couples the spatially inhomogeneous reaction-diffusion master equation to account for biochemical reactions and molecular transport within the Langevin Dynamics (LD) framework to describe dynamic mechanical processes. This computational infrastructure allows the simulation of hours of molecular machine dynamics in reasonable wall-clock time. We apply the model to test performance of the Search-and-Capture model of mitotic spindle assembly by simulating, in three spatial dimensions, dynamic instability of elastic microtubules anchored in two centrosomes, movement and deformations of geometrically realistic centromeres with flexible kinetochores and chromosome arms. Furthermore, the SRDDM model describes the mechanics and kinetics of Ndc80 linkers mediating transient attachments of microtubules to the chromosomal kinetochores. The rates of these attachments and detachments depend upon phosphorylation states of the Ndc80 linkers, which are regulated in the model by explicitly accounting for the reactions of Aurora A and B kinase enzymes, which undergo restricted diffusion. We find that there is an optimal rate of microtubule-kinetochore detachments which maximizes the accuracy of the chromosome connections, that adding chromosome arms to kinetochores improve the accuracy by slowing down chromosome movements, that Aurora A and kinetochore deformations have a small positive effect on the attachment accuracy, and that thermal fluctuations of the microtubules increase the rates of kinetochore capture and also improve the accuracy of spindle assembly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Induced fit with replica exchange improves protein complex structure prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ameya Harmalkar, Sai Pooja Mahajan, Jeffrey J. Gray</p>

Despite the progress in prediction of protein complexes over the last decade, recent blind protein complex structure prediction challenges revealed limited success rates (less than 20% models with DockQ score > 0.4) on targets that exhibit significant conformational change upon binding. To overcome limitations in capturing backbone motions, we developed a new, aggressive sampling method that incorporates temperature replica exchange Monte Carlo (T-REMC) and conformational sampling techniques within docking protocols in Rosetta. Our method, ReplicaDock 2.0, mimics induced-fit mechanism of protein binding to sample backbone motions across putative interface residues on-the-fly, thereby recapitulating binding-partner induced conformational changes. Furthermore, ReplicaDock 2.0 clocks in at 150-500 CPU hours per target (protein-size dependent); a runtime that is significantly faster than Molecular Dynamics based approaches. For a benchmark set of 88 proteins with moderate to high flexibility (unbound-to-bound iRMSD over 1.2 Å), ReplicaDock 2.0 successfully docks 61% of moderately flexible complexes and 35% of highly flexible complexes. Additionally, we demonstrate that by biasing backbone sampling particularly towards residues comprising flexible loops or hinge domains, highly flexible targets can be predicted to under 2 Å accuracy. This indicates that additional gains are possible when mobile protein segments are known.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Addressing delayed case reporting in infectious disease forecast modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lauren J. Beesley, Dave Osthus, Sara Y. Del Valle</p>

Infectious disease forecasting is of great interest to the public health community and policymakers, since forecasts can provide insight into disease dynamics in the near future and inform interventions. Due to delays in case reporting, however, forecasting models may often <i>underestimate</i> the current and future disease burden.
In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing reporting delay in disease forecasting efforts with the goal of improving forecasts. We propose strategies for leveraging either historical data on case reporting or external internet-based data to estimate the amount of reporting error. We then describe several approaches for adapting general forecasting pipelines to account for under- or over-reporting of cases. We apply these methods to address reporting delay in data on dengue fever cases in Puerto Rico from 1990 to 2009 and to reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States between 2010 and 2019. Through a simulation study, we compare method performance and evaluate robustness to assumption violations. Our results show that forecasting accuracy and prediction coverage almost always increase when correction methods are implemented to address reporting delay. Some of these methods required knowledge about the reporting error or high quality external data, which may not always be available. Provided alternatives include excluding recently-reported data and performing sensitivity analysis. This work provides intuition and guidance for handling delay in disease case reporting and may serve as a useful resource to inform practical infectious disease forecasting efforts.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique to decipher tissue composition at the single-cell level and to inform on disease mechanisms, tumor heterogeneity, and the state of the immune microenvironment. Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and pathway alterations, and <i>in silico</i> identification of personalized candidate drug treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A musculoskeletal finite element model of rat knee joint for evaluating cartilage biomechanics during gait</a></h4>

Abnormal loading of the knee due to injuries or obesity is thought to contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Small animal models have been used for studying OA progression mechanisms. However, numerical models to study cartilage responses under dynamic loading in preclinical animal models have not been developed. Here we present a musculoskeletal finite element model of a rat knee joint to evaluate cartilage biomechanical responses during a gait cycle. The rat knee joint geometries were obtained from a 3-D MRI dataset and the boundary conditions regarding loading in the joint were extracted from a musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb. The fibril-reinforced poroelastic (FRPE) properties of the rat cartilage were derived from data of mechanical indentation tests. Our numerical results showed the relevance of simulating anatomical and locomotion characteristics in the rat knee joint for estimating tissue responses such as contact pressures, stresses, strains, and fluid pressures. We found that the contact pressure and maximum principal strain were virtually constant in the medial compartment whereas they showed the highest values at the beginning of the gait cycle in the lateral compartment. Furthermore, we found that the maximum principal stress increased during the stance phase of gait, with the greatest values at midstance. We anticipate that our approach serves as a first step towards investigating the effects of gait abnormalities on the adaptation and degeneration of rat knee joint tissues and could be used to evaluate biomechanically-driven mechanisms of the progression of OA as a consequence of joint injury or obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying the impact of ecological memory on the dynamics of interacting communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moein Khalighi, Guilhem Sommeria-Klein, Didier Gonze, Karoline Faust, Leo Lahti</p>

Ecological memory refers to the influence of past events on the response of an ecosystem to exogenous or endogenous changes. Memory has been widely recognized as a key contributor to the dynamics of ecosystems and other complex systems, yet quantitative community models often ignore memory and its implications.
Recent modeling studies have shown how interactions between community members can lead to the emergence of resilience and multistability under environmental perturbations. We demonstrate how memory can be introduced in such models using the framework of fractional calculus. We study how the outcomes of a well-characterized interaction model are affected by gradual increases in ecological memory under varying initial conditions, perturbations, and stochasticity.
Our results highlight the implications of memory on several key aspects of community dynamics. In general, memory introduces inertia into the dynamics. This favors species coexistence under perturbation, enhances system resistance to state shifts, mitigates hysteresis, and can affect system resilience both ways depending on the time scale considered. Memory also promotes long transient dynamics, such as long-standing oscillations and delayed regime shifts, and contributes to the emergence and persistence of alternative stable states. Our study highlights the fundamental role of memory on ecological communities, and provides quantitative tools to introduce it in ecological models and analyse its impact under varying conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alix is required for activity-dependent bulk endocytosis at brain synapses</a></h4>

Caudal, Na Zhao, Yvonne Schwarz, Marta Rolland, José Martinez-Hernandez, Magalie Martineau, Christine Chatellard, Eric Denarier, Vincent Mercier, Florent Lemaître, Béatrice Blot, Eve Moutaux, Maxime Cazorla, David Perrais, Fabien Lanté, Dieter Bruns, Sandrine Fraboulet, Fiona J. Hemming, Frank Kirchhoff, Rémy Sadoul</p>

In chemical synapses undergoing high frequency stimulation, vesicle components can be retrieved from the plasma membrane via a clathrin-independent process called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X/PDCD6IP) is an adaptor protein binding to ESCRT and endophilin-A proteins which is required for clathrin-independent endocytosis in fibroblasts. Alix is expressed in neurons and concentrates at synapses during epileptic seizures. Here, we used cultured neurons to show that Alix is recruited to presynapses where it interacts with and concentrates endophilin-A during conditions triggering ADBE. Using Alix knockout (ko) neurons, we showed that this recruitment, which requires interaction with the calcium-binding protein ALG-2, is necessary for ADBE. We also found that presynaptic compartments of Alix ko hippocampi display subtle morphological defects compatible with flawed synaptic activity and plasticity detected electrophysiologically. Furthermore, mice lacking Alix in the forebrain undergo less seizures during kainate-induced status epilepticus and reduced propagation of the epileptiform activity. These results thus show that impairment of ADBE due to the lack of neuronal Alix leads to abnormal synaptic recovery during physiological or pathological repeated stimulations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pleiotropic constraints promote the evolution of cooperation in cellular groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael A. Bentley, Christian A. Yates, Jotun Hein, Gail M. Preston, Kevin R. Foster</p>

The evolution of cooperation in cellular groups is threatened by lineages of cheaters that proliferate at the expense of the group. These cell lineages occur within microbial communities, and multicellular organisms in the form of tumours and cancer. In contrast to an earlier study, here we show how the evolution of pleiotropic genetic architectures—which link the expression of cooperative and private traits—can protect against cheater lineages and allow cooperation to evolve. We develop an age-structured model of cellular groups and show that cooperation breaks down more slowly within groups that tie expression to a private trait than in groups that do not. We then show that this results in group selection for pleiotropy, which strongly promotes cooperation by limiting the emergence of cheater lineages. These results predict that pleiotropy will rapidly evolve, so long as groups persist long enough for cheater lineages to threaten cooperation. Our results hold when pleiotropic links can be undermined by mutations, when pleiotropy is itself costly, and in mixed-genotype groups such as those that occur in microbes. Finally, we consider features of multicellular organisms—a germ line and delayed reproductive maturity—and show that pleiotropy is again predicted to be important for maintaining cooperation. The study of cancer in multicellular organisms provides the best evidence for pleiotropic constraints, where abberant cell proliferation is linked to apoptosis, senescence, and terminal differentiation. Alongside development from a single cell, we propose that the evolution of pleiotropic constraints has been critical for cooperation in many cellular groups.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lipids, Apolipoproteins, Statins and ICH: A Mendelian Randomization Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the causal role of lipid or apolipoprotein traits in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and determine the effect of lipid-lowering interventions on the disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations of HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, ApoB and ApoA1 levels with risks for ICH and those of LDL-C- (<i>HMGCR, PCSK9 and NPC1L1</i>) and TG-lowering targets (<i>LPL and APOC3</i>) with ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Increased levels of ApoB was associated with a decreased risk of overall ICH (OR, 0.623; 95% CI, 0.413-0.940; P =0.024) and lobar ICH (OR, 0.579; 95% CI, 0.342-0.979; P =0.042). The inverse relationship remained stable in multivariable MR. In addition, elevated TGs showed a causal effect on lobar ICH in multivariable MR (OR, 1.600; 95% CI, 1.009-2.537; P= 0.046). The LDL-C-reducing genetic variation alleles at or near the <i>HMGCR</i> gene (mimicking the effect of statins) were predicted to increase the overall and deep ICH risk. Additionally, genetic variation at or near the <i>APOC3</i> gene suggested that genetically reducing the activity of <i>APOC3</i> (mimicking antisense anti-apoC3 agents) was predicted to decrease lobar ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted elevated ApoB may have a protective effect on overall ICH and lobar ICH, while elevated TG was associated with higher risk of lobar ICH conditional on LDL-C and ApoB. MR analysis supports the conclusion that statins may increase the risk of overall and deep ICH independent of their lipid-lowering effect. More specific lipid lowering targets may end up being the future.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential vulnerability of neuronal subpopulations of the subiculum in a mouse model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Selective loss of inhibitory interneurons (INs) that promotes a shift toward an excitatory predominance may have a critical impact on the generation of epileptic activity. While research on mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has mostly focused on hippocampal changes, including IN loss, the subiculum as the major output region of the hippocampal formation has received comparatively little attention. Although it has been shown to occupy a key position in the epileptic network, data on cellular changes in the subiculum are controversial. Using the intrahippocampal kainate (KA) mouse model for MTLE, which recapitulates main features of human MTLE such as hippocampal sclerosis and granule cell dispersion following status epilepticus (SE), we identified cell loss in the subiculum and quantified changes in specific IN subpopulations along its dorsoventral axis. We performed intrahippocampal recordings, FluoroJade C-staining for degenerating neurons shortly after SE and immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei (NeuN), parvalbumin (PV), neuropeptide Y (NPY), calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB), and in situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad) 67 mRNA at 21 days after KA. We observed remarkable cell loss in the ipsilateral subiculum shortly after SE which was reflected in lowered density of NeuN+ cells in the chronic stage when epileptic activity could be measured in the subiculum concomitant with the hippocampus. We show a position-dependent reduction of Gad67-expressing INs by ~50% which particularly affected the PV- and to a lesser extent CR-expressing INs, whereas CB-expressing cells were unchanged. Interestingly, the density of NPY-positive neurons was increased, but double-labeling for Gad67 mRNA expression revealed that rather a de novo expression of NPY in non-GABAergic cells instead of IN changes underlay this increase. Our data reveal a position- and cell type-specific vulnerability of subicular INs in MTLE which might contribute to hyperexcitability of the subiculum, as reflected in the occurrence of epileptic activity.

                Persistent cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders are prevalent sequelae of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 in middle-aged adults. To model age-related neurological vulnerability to COVID-19, we induced respiratory SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infections by nasal inoculation in young (2 months) and middle-aged (12 months) mice. We hypothesized that aging and SARS-CoV-2 synergistically damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to worsen disease. Indeed, the combined action of aging and SARS-CoV-2 infection caused more fibrinogen leakage, T cell infiltration, and neuroinflammation in middle-aged SARS-CoV-2-infected mice than in similarly inoculated young adults. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 exacerbated age-related increases in Caveolin-1 BBB transcellular permeability and loss of Wnt/{beta}-catenin ligands, with no apparent changes in tight junction proteins. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced age-dependent neuropsychiatric abnormalities including bradykinesia and repetitive behavior. These observations indicate that cerebrovascular aging, including loss of Wnt suppression of Caveolin-1, heightens vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric sequalae. Our work suggests that modulation of Wnt signaling or its downstream effectors at the BBB could be potential interventional strategies for Long COVID.

                Synaptic Zn2+ has emerged as a key neuromodulator in the brain. However, the lack of research tools for directly tracking synaptic Zn2+ in the brain in live animals hinders our rigorous understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of synaptic Zn2+. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded far-red fluorescent indicator for monitoring synaptic Zn2+ dynamics in the nervous system. Our engineered far-red fluorescent indicator for synaptic Zn2+ (FRISZ) displayed a substantial Zn2+-specific turn-on response and low micromolar affinity. We genetically anchored FRISZ to the mammalian extracellular membrane via a transmembrane -helix. We further successfully used membrane-tethered FRISZ (FRISZ-TM) to image synaptic Zn2+ dynamics in response to sound in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in awake mice. This study thus establishes a new technology for studying the roles of synaptic Zn2+ in the nervous system.

                With the prevalence of age-related cognitive deficits on the rise, it is essential to identify cellular and circuit alterations that contribute to age-related memory impairment. Increased intrinsic neuronal excitability after learning is important for memory consolidation, and changes to this process could underlie memory impairment in old age. Some studies find age-related deficits in hippocampal neuronal excitability that correlate with memory impairment but others do not, possibly due to selective changes only in activated neural ensembles. Thus, we tagged CA1 neurons activated during learning and recorded their intrinsic excitability 5 hours or 7 days post-training. Adult mice exhibited increased neuronal excitability 5 hours after learning, specifically in ensemble (learning-activated) CA1 neurons. As expected, ensemble excitability returned to baseline 7 days post-training. In aged mice, there was no ensemble-specific excitability increase after learning, which was associated with impaired hippocampal memory performance. These results suggest that CA1 may be susceptible to age-related impairments in post-learning ensemble excitability and underscore the need to selectively measure ensemble-specific changes in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Creatine transporter (Slc6a8) knockout mice show an inattentive-like phenotype in the 5-choice serial reaction time test</a></h4>

              
                Disorders of creatine (Cr) synthesis and transport cause moderate to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and a lack of speech development. Mutations of the X-linked Cr transporter (CrT; SLC6A8) gene are the most frequent cause of Cr deficiency and one of the leading causes of X-linked intellectual disability. There are no treatments for CrT deficiency (CTD) and there are many unanswered questions related to this disorder. Rodent models of CTD have deficits in spatial learning and memory, object recognition memory, fear conditioning, and working memory, making them high-fidelity models of CTD. While these cognitive deficits provide important information related to CTD, they lack some translational relevance and do not address important aspects of executive function like attention and impulsivity. To address this gap in knowledge, we tested brain specific Slc6a8 knockout (bKO) mice in the 5-choice serial reaction time test (5CSRTT), a correlate of the continuous performance task in humans. Following 5CSRTT training, mice were then tested for 3 sessions using trials with a variable stimulus duration followed by 3 sessions using a fixed stimulus duration and variable intertrial interval. During both the testing phases the bKO mice had reduced accuracy along with increased omissions and correct latencies compared with controls. There were no increases in premature responses during the vITI, suggesting that these mice do not have an impulsive phenotype. The results of this study expand the known phenotype of Slc6a8 deficient mice and add a translationally relevant behavioral output to test potential therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral Auditory Nerve Impairment in a Mouse Model of Syndromic Autism</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the peripheral auditory nerve (AN) contributes to dynamic changes throughout the central auditory system, resulting in abnormal auditory processing, including hypersensitivity. Altered sound sensitivity is frequently observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that AN deficits and changes in auditory information processing may contribute to ASD-associated symptoms, including social communication deficits and hyperacusis. The MEF2C transcription factor is associated with risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, and mutations or deletions of MEF2C produce a haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by ASD, and language and cognitive deficits. A mouse model of this syndromic ASD (i.e., Mef2c+/- or Mef2c-Het) recapitulates many of the MEF2C Haploinsufficiency syndrome-linked behaviors including communication deficits. We show here that Mef2c-Het mice exhibit functional impairment of the peripheral AN and a modest reduction in hearing sensitivity. We find that MEF2C is expressed during development in multiple AN and cochlear cell types, and in Mef2c-Het mice, we observe multiple cellular and molecular alterations associated with the AN, including abnormal myelination, neuronal degeneration, neuronal mitochondria dysfunction, and increased macrophage activation and cochlear inflammation. These results reveal the importance of MEF2C function in inner ear development and function and the engagement of immune cells and other non-neuronal cells, which suggests that microglia/macrophages and other non-neuronal cells might contribute, directly or indirectly, to AN dysfunction and ASD-related phenotypes. Finally, our study establishes a comprehensive approach for characterizing AN function at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels in mice, which can be applied to animal models with a wide range of human auditory processing impairments.

                Memory-updating is critical in dynamic environments because updating memories with new information promotes versatility. However, little is known about how memories are updated with new information. To study how neuronal ensembles might support memory-updating, we used a hippocampus-dependent spatial reversal task to measure hippocampal ensemble dynamics when mice switched navigational goals. Using Miniscope calcium imaging, we identified neuronal ensembles (co-active neurons) in dorsal CA1 that were spatially tuned and stable across training sessions. When reward locations were moved during a reversal session, a subset of these ensembles decreased their activation strength, correlating with memory-updating. These 'remodeling' ensembles were a result of weakly-connected neurons becoming less co-active with their peers. Middle-aged mice were impaired in reversal learning, and the prevalence of their remodeling ensembles correlated with their memory-updating performance. Therefore, we have identified a mechanism where the hippocampus breaks down ensembles to support memory-updating.

                Accurate anatomical characterizations are necessary to investigate neural circuitry on a fine scale, but for the rodent claustrum complex (CC) this has yet to be fully accomplished. The CC is generally considered to comprise two major subdivisions, the claustrum (CL) and the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEn), but regional boundaries to these areas are highly debated. To address this, we conducted a multifaceted analysis of fiber- and cyto-architecture, genetic marker expression, and connectivity using mice of both sexes, to create a comprehensive guide for identifying and delineating borders to the CC. We identified four distinct subregions within the CC, subdividing both the CL and the DEn into two. Additionally, we conducted brain-wide tracing of inputs to the entire CC using a transgenic mouse line. Immunohistochemical staining against myelin basic protein (MBP), parvalbumin (PV), and calbindin (CB) revealed intricate fiber-architectural patterns enabling precise delineations of the CC and its subregions. Myelinated fibers were abundant in dorsal parts of the CL but absent in ventral parts, while parvalbumin labelled fibers occupied the entire CL. Calbindin staining revealed a central gap within the CL, which was also visible at levels anterior to the striatum. Furthermore, cells in the CL projecting to the retrosplenial-cortex were located within the myelin sparse area. By combining our own experimental data with digitally available datasets of gene expression and input connectivity, we could demonstrate that the proposed delineation scheme allows anchoring of datasets from different origins to a common reference framework.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise and stable edge orientation signaling by human first-order tactile neurons</a></h4>

              
                Fast-adapting type 1 (FA-1) and slow-adapting type 1 (SA-1) first-order neurons in the human tactile system have distal axons that branch in the skin and form many transduction sites, yielding receptive fields with many highly sensitive zones or 'subfields'. We previously demonstrated that this arrangement allows FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to signal the geometric features of touched objects, specifically the orientation of raised edges scanned with the fingertips. Here we show that such signaling operates for fine edge orientation differences (5-20{degrees}) and is stable across a broad range of scanning speeds (15-180 mm/s); that is, under conditions relevant for real-world hand use. We found that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons weakly signal fine edge orientation differences via the intensity of their spiking responses and only when considering a single scanning speed. Both neuron types showed much stronger edge orientation signaling in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains and FA-1 neurons performed better than SA-1 neurons. Represented in the spatial domain, the sequential structure was strikingly invariant across scanning speeds, especially those naturally used in tactile spatial discrimination tasks. This speed invariance suggests that neurons' responses are structured via sequential stimulation of their subfields. Indeed, the spatial precision of elicited action potentials rationally matched spatial acuity of subfield arrangements, which typically corresponds to the dimension of individual fingertip ridges. The present results further the idea that the terminal branching of first-order tactile neurons constitutes a peripheral neural mechanism supporting the identification of tactile geometric features.

                Effective and stimulus-specific learning is essential for animals survival. Two major mechanisms are known to aid stimulus-specificity of associative learning. One is accurate stimulus-specific representations in neurons. The second is limited effective temporal window for the reinforcing signals to induce neuromodulation only after sensory stimuli. However, these mechanisms are often imperfect in preventing unspecific associations; different sensory stimuli can be represented by overlapping populations of neurons, and more importantly the reinforcing signals alone can induce neuromodulation even without coincident sensory-evoked neuronal activity. Here, we report a crucial neuromodulatory mechanism that counteracts both limitations and is thereby essential for stimulus specificity of learning. In Drosophila, olfactory signals are sparsely represented by cholinergic Kenyon cells (KCs), which receive dopaminergic reinforcing input. We find that KCs have numerous axo-axonic connections mediated by the muscarinic type-B receptor (mAChR-B). By using functional imaging and optogenetic approaches, we show that these axo-axonic connections suppress both odor-evoked calcium responses and dopamine-evoked cAMP signals in neighboring KCs. Strikingly, behavior experiments demonstrate that mAChR-B knockdown in KCs impairs olfactory learning by inducing undesired changes to the valence of an odor that was not associated with the reinforcer. Thus, this local neuromodulation acts in concert with sparse sensory representations and global dopaminergic modulation to achieve effective and accurate memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Male mice carrying the BDNF Val68Met polymorphism exhibit alcohol preferences versus social interaction and acute tolerance through malfunction of BDNF in the ventral hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Valine 66 to Methionine human polymorphism results in impaired activity-dependent BDNF release and has been linked to psychiatric disorders including anxiety and alcohol dependence. We previously showed that knock-in mice carrying the mouse Methionine homolog (Met68BDNF) exhibit excessive and compulsive alcohol drinking behaviors as compared to the wild-type Val68BDNF mice. Here, we set out to determine the potential mechanism for the heightened and compulsive alcohol drinking phenotype exhibited by the Met68BDNFmice. We found that male, but not female Met68BDNF mice show social anxiety-like behaviors. We further report that male, but not female, Met68BDNF mice are resistant to the anxiolytic effects and sedative actions of alcohol as compared to Val68BDNF mice. Alcohol-dependent hypolocomotion is also reduced in Met68BDNF. In contrast, alcohol place preference is similar in Met68BDNF compared with Val68BDNF mice. Finally, we show that the anxiolytic action of alcohol is restored in Met68BDNF mice by overexpressing the wild-type Val68BDNF in the ventral hippocampus (vHC). Together, our results suggest that heighted social anxiety and a lack of alcohol-dependent anxiolysis may contribute to excessive alcohol intake by constraining normal BDNF signaling in the vHC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Unified Dynamic and Computational Mechanism for Persistent and Transient Neural Activity Patterns During Delayed-Response Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity during short-term memory can be either persistent or transient. However, there is an ongoing debate about which activity pattern presents a more accurate neural basis underlying short-term memory. Here, we addressed this problem by training artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with delayed-response tasks. We found biological features emerged from the trained RNNs. Reverse-engineering showed that persistent and transient neural activity patterns can be unified by a neural state moving on a low-dimensional heteroclinic manifold, driven by a velocity field which is computationally Bayes-optimal to minimize the memory error. Our results shed new light on the neural mechanism and computational principles of short-term memory by unifying two seemly contradictory experimental phenomena into a single framework and suggest a new way to interpret the experimental data using computationally important transient speed as a continuous measure to characterize the neural activities during the delay.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamin forms liquid-like condensates at synapses to support ultrafast endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Endocytosis at synapses is accelerated by the pre-accumulation of Dynamin 1xA at the endocytic zone by Syndapin 1. However, it is unclear how these proteins support the ultrafast kinetics of endocytosis. Here we report that these proteins phase separate at the presynaptic endocytic zone where ultrafast endocytosis takes place. Specifically, the proline-rich motif of Dynamin 1xA interacts with the Src-Homology 3 domain of Syndapin 1 and forms liquid-like condensates. Single-particle tracking of Dynamin 1xA molecules at synapses shows that their diffusion slows down substantially when they are in the condensates, indicating the presence of molecular crowding and intermolecular interaction. When Dynamin 1xA is mutated to disrupt its interaction with Syndapin 1 the condensates do not form. Thus, the liquid-like assembly of these endocytic proteins provides a catalytic platform for ultrafast endocytosis.

                Recent studies have established that cardiac and respiratory phases can modulate perception and related neural dynamics. While heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia are possibly affecting interoception biomarkers, such as heartbeat-evoked potentials, the relative changes in heart rate and cardiorespiratory dynamics in interoceptive processes have not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated the variation in heart and respiration rates, as well as higher functional dynamics including cardiorespiratory correlation and frontal hemodynamics, during cardiac awareness tasks. To further investigate the functional physiology linked to changes in vagal activity caused by specific respiratory rates, we studied cardiac awareness and controlled respiration rate. The results demonstrate that focusing on heartbeats decreases respiration and heart rates in comparison, which may be part of the physiological mechanisms related to 'listening' to the heart, the focus of attention, and self-awareness. Focusing on heartbeats was also observed to increase frontal connectivity, supporting the role of frontal structures in the neural monitoring of visceral inputs. However, cardiorespiratory correlation is affected by both interoceptive and controlled respiration. Based on these results, we concluded that variations in heart and respiratory rates are confounding factors in the assessment of interoceptive abilities and relative fluctuations in respiration and heart rates should be considered to be a mode of covariate measurement of interoceptive processes.

                Ena/VASP proteins are processive actin polymerases that are required throughout animal phylogeny for many morphogenetic processes, including axon growth and guidance. Here we use live imaging of morphology and actin organization in the TSM1 axon of the Drosophila wing to dissect the mechanism of Ena action. We find that altering Ena activity has a substantial impact on filopodial morphology in this growth cone, but exerts only modest effects on actin organization. This is in contrast to the main regulator of Ena, Abl tyrosine kinase, which has profound effects on actin and only mild effects on TSM1 growth cone morphology. These data suggest that the primary role of Ena in this axon may be to link actin to morphogenetic processes of the plasma membrane, rather than regulating actin organization itself. These data also suggest that a key role of Ena, acting downstream of Abl, may be to maintain a constant filopodial organization of the growth cone, even as Abl activity varies in response to guidance cues in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) basket cells are key controllers of theta-gamma coupled rhythms in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                It has been shown that different inhibitory cell types underlie brain rhythmic and cross-frequency coupling output, but exactly how inhibitory cell types manifest their contributions to these outputs is far from clear. Brain rhythms and their couplings are functionally important in cognition and behaviour, and thus it is essential that we determine and understand these contributions. To do this, one needs simultaneous access to multiple cell types and population brain output in functionally relevant states. This is extremely challenging to do with experiments alone, and here we use mathematical models of different types to gain insight into the contributions of the different inhibitory cell types. We focus on theta and gamma rhythms in the hippocampus and use a previously developed detailed model to develop precise hypotheses of how these rhythms are generated and coupled. We find critical contributions by four different cell types - pyramidal cells, parvalbumin expressing (PV+) basket cells (BCs), cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) BCs and bistratified cells. We develop a reduced population rate model (PRM) based on these hypotheses and do extensive explorations and visualizations of the PRM to obtain testable predictions. We find that CCK+BCs exhibit a much higher degree of control relative to PV+BCs for theta or gamma rhythm dominance and thus their coupling, and that coupling from PV+BCs to CCK+BCs more strongly affects theta frequencies relative to coupling from CCK+BCs to PV+BCs. As it is now possible to target these specific inhibitory cell types in the behaving animal, experimentally testing these hypotheses and predictions would be possible. Moreover, our work shows that a variety of mathematical model types creates new insights that would not be revealed with a single model type.

                Epitranscriptome modifications are crucial in translation regulation and essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. N6 methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant and well-conserved epitranscriptome modifications, which is known to play a pivotal role in diverse aspects of neuronal functions. However, the role of m6A modifications with respect to activity-mediated translation regulation and synaptic plasticity has not been studied. Here, we investigated the role of m6A modification in response to NMDAR stimulation. We have consistently observed that upon 5-minute NMDAR stimulation causes an increase in eEF2 phosphorylation. Correspondingly, NMDAR stimulation caused a significant increase in the m6A signal at 5 minutes time point, correlating with the global translation inhibition. The NMDAR induced increase in the m6A signal is accompanied by the redistribution of the m6A marked RNAs from translating to the non-translating pool of ribosomes. The increased m6A levels are well correlated with the reduced FTO levels observed on NMDAR stimulation. Additionally, we show that inhibition of FTO prevents NMDAR mediated changes in m6A levels. Overall, our results establish RNA-based molecular readout which corelates with the NMDAR-dependent translation regulation which helps in understanding changes in protein synthesis.

                Facilitating axon regeneration in the injured central nervous system remains a challenging task. RAF - MEK signaling plays an important role in axon elongation during nervous system development. Here we show that activation of B-RAF in mature corticospinal neurons elicited the expression of a discrete set of transcription factors previously implicated in the regeneration of zebrafish optic nerve axons. Genetic activation of B-RAF - MEK signaling promoted robust regeneration and sprouting of corticospinal tract axons after injury. Newly sprouting axon collaterals formed synaptic connections with spinal interneurons, correlating with the recovery of skilled motor function. Seeking a non-invasive way to stimulate axon regeneration, we found that suprathreshold high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation activates the B-RAF canonical effectors MEK1/2 and requires MEK1/2 activity to promote corticospinal axon regeneration and sprouting after injury. These data demonstrate a central role of neuron-intrinsic RAF - MEK signaling in enhancing the growth capacity of mature corticospinal neurons and propose HF-rTMS as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-regional delays fluctuate in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological studies suggest that the excitability fluctuations that underlie oscillatory field potentials can regulate the flow of information between regions. However, most studies of these oscillatory processes have focused on local (circuit-level) changes; less is known about how millisecond-scale inter-regional couplings change with global (cortex-wide) oscillatory states. Therefore, we measured ongoing changes in global oscillations and inter-regional coupling by recording intracranially from the human cerebral cortex. In the presence of an ongoing auditory narrative stimulus, we observed that global increases in low-frequency power (4-14Hz) were associated with stronger and more delayed couplings between regions. Conversely, increases in broadband high-frequency (BHA) power (65+ Hz) were associated with weaker inter-regional couplings and more frequent zero-lag coupling between regions. Latency changes were predicted both by local oscillatory power (at each site) and by global oscillatory power (averaged across the lateral cerebral cortex). Fluctuations in coupling latency were weakly locked to the auditory stimulus: when we repeated the same narrative, a small number of temporal lobe sites exhibited reliable latency patterns across repetitions. The empirical findings were recapitulated in an amplitude-and-phase coupled oscillator model, in which the increases in latency arose from increases in the effective influence of nodes upon one another. Altogether, gradual and widespread increases in low-frequency oscillations were associated with delayed cortico-cortical couplings in the human brain. These changes in inter-regional latency indicate a shift in the timing of peak excitability between regions; we interpret them in relation to bottom-up and top-down information flow, regulated by nonspecific ascending projections to the cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A developmental atlas of somatosensory diversification and maturation in the dorsal root ganglia by single-cell mass cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Precisely controlled development of the somatosensory system is essential for detecting pain, itch, temperature, mechanical touch, and body position. To investigate the protein-level changes that occur during somatosensory development, we performed single-cell mass cytometry on dorsal root ganglia from C57/BL6 mice, with litter replicates collected daily from E11.5 to P4. Measuring nearly 3 million cells, we quantified 30 molecularly distinct somatosensory glial and 41 distinct neuronal states across all time points. Analysis of differentiation trajectories revealed rare cells that coexpress two or more Trk receptors and overexpress stem cell markers, suggesting that these neurotrophic factor receptors play a role in cell fate specification. Comparison to previous RNA-based studies identified substantial differences between many protein/mRNA pairs, demonstrating the importance of protein-level measurements to identify functional cell states. Overall, this study demonstrates that mass cytometry is a high-throughput, scalable platform to rapidly phenotype somatosensory tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combined small molecule treatment accelerates timing of maturation in human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                The maturation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons mimics the protracted timing of human brain development, extending over months and years to reach adult-like function. Prolonged in vitro maturation presents a major challenge to stem cell-based applications in modeling and treating neurological disease. We designed a high-content imaging assay based on morphological and functional readouts in hPSC-derived cortical neurons to reveal underlying pathways and to identify chemicals capable of accelerating neuronal maturation. Probing a library of 2688 bioactive drugs, we identified multiple compounds that drive neuronal maturation including inhibitors of LSD1 and DOT1L and activators of calcium-dependent transcription. A cocktail of 4 factors GSK-2879552, EPZ-5676, NMDA and Bay K 8644, which we collectively termed GENtoniK, triggered maturation across all assays tested including measures of synaptic density, electrophysiology and transcriptomics. Remarkably, GENtoniK was similarly effective in enhancing neuronal maturation in 3D cortical organoids and in spinal motoneurons, and improved aspects of cell maturation in non-neural lineages such as melanocytes and pancreatic beta cells. These results demonstrate that the maturation of multiple hPSC-derived cell types can be enhanced by simple pharmacological intervention and suggests that some of the mechanisms controlling the timing of human maturation are shared across lineages.

	<p>Cognitive skills predict academic performance, so schools that try to improve academic performance might also improve cognitive skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of achievements in mathematics on cognitive ability in primary school. Methods: Participants: 100 girls and 102 boys aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;10 years (the fourth grade) were selected from three schools. A diagnostic test of cognitive abilities (DTCA) was created by the authors of the article for the assessment of primary school students&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive abilities. The diagnostic cognitive ability test was based on Reuven Feuerstein&amp;amp;rsquo;s theory of dynamic cognitive modality assessment, the problem-solving model, and followed the mathematics curriculum for grade 4. The tasks of the test were distributed according to the cognitive function: systematic exploration, spatial orientation, sequencing, image recognition, recognizing and understanding relationships, collecting and processing information, algorithm development, data management (classification), and construction of combinations. Achievements in mathematics: they were collected systematically using short- and medium-term mathematics tests, and the levels of achaievement were defined of grade 4 primary school students to assess individual learner performance, anticipate their learning strengths and weaknesses, and shape their subsequent learning process. Results: With regard to the relationships between cognitive functions and achievement level, Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis revealed the relationships between the following cognitive functions: systematic exploration and spatial orientation (Spearman q = 0.276, p = 0.022), systematic exploration and designing an algorithm development (Spearman q = 0.351, p = 0.003), spatial orientation and data management (Spearman q = 0.274, p = 0.023), sequencing and combination construction (Spearman q = 0.275, p = 0.022), and sequencing and recognizing and understanding relationships (Spearman q = 0.243, p = 0.044). Conclusions: (1) The internal validity of the diagnostic test of cognitive abilities was supported by significant correlations between cognitive functions and mathematics achievement. This suggests that this methodology of the diagnostic cognitive ability test can be used to assess the cognitive abilities of primary school students. (2) The diagnostic test of cognitive abilities showed that the majority of primary school students reached higher levels of achievement in a systematic inquiry (systematic, non-impulsive, planned behavior when collecting data or checking information). A difference was observed in the ability of students to navigate in space and follow directions for primary school students at a satisfactory or higher level. Primary school students&amp;amp;rsquo; performance in identifying the rule for the sequencing of elements, finding missing elements, and extending the sequences was at the basic and advanced levels. (3) The results of the study showed the reciprocal correlation between achievements in mathematics and cognitive function of primary school students. The two phases that caused difficulties for students were revealed: understanding the problem and carrying out the plan phase.</p>

	<p>Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a developmental disorder characterized by arithmetic difficulties. Recently, it has been suggested that the neural networks supporting procedure-based calculation (e.g., in subtraction) and left-hemispheric verbal arithmetic fact retrieval (e.g., in multiplication) are partially distinct. Here we compared the neurofunctional correlates of subtraction and multiplication in a 19-year-old student (RM) with DD to 18 age-matched controls. Behaviorally, RM performed significantly worse than controls in multiplication, while subtraction was unaffected. Neurofunctional differences were most pronounced regarding multiplication: RM showed significantly stronger activation than controls not only in left angular gyrus but also in a fronto-parietal network (including left intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus) typically activated during procedure-based calculation. Region-of-interest analyses indicated group differences in multiplication only, which, however, did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Our results are consistent with dissociable and processing-specific, but not operation-specific neurofunctional networks. Procedure-based calculation is not only associated with subtraction but also with (untrained) multiplication facts. Only after rote learning, facts can be retrieved quasi automatically from memory. We suggest that this learning process and the associated shift in activation patterns has not fully occurred in RM, as reflected in her need to resort to procedure-based strategies to solve multiplication facts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Radical pairs may explain reactive oxygen species-mediated effects of hypomagnetic field on neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rishabh Rishabh, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Dennis Salahub, Christoph Simon</p>

Exposures to a hypomagnetic field can affect biological processes. Recently, it has been observed that hypomagnetic field exposure can adversely affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice. In the same study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypomagnetic field effects has been demonstrated. However, the mechanistic reasons behind this effect are not clear. This study proposes a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide concentration and other observed ROS effects. We also predict the effects of applied magnetic fields and oxygen isotopic substitution on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of water-bridged interactions in metal ion coupled protein allostery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xingyue Guan, Cheng Tan, Wenfei Li, Wei Wang, D. Thirumalai</p>

Allosteric communication between distant parts of proteins controls many cellular functions, in which metal ions are widely utilized as effectors to trigger the allosteric cascade. Due to the involvement of strong coordination interactions, the energy landscape dictating the metal ion binding is intrinsically rugged. How metal ions achieve fast binding by overcoming the landscape ruggedness and thereby efficiently mediate protein allostery is elusive. By performing molecular dynamics simulations for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding mediated allostery of the calmodulin (CaM) domains, each containing two Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding helix-loop-helix motifs (EF-hands), we revealed the key role of water-bridged interactions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and protein allostery. The bridging water molecules between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and binding residue reduces the ruggedness of ligand exchange landscape by acting as a lubricant, facilitating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupled protein allostery. Calcium-induced rotation of the helices in the EF-hands, with the hydrophobic core serving as the pivot, leads to exposure of hydrophobic sites for target binding. Intriguingly, despite being structurally similar, the response of the two symmetrically arranged EF-hands upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is asymmetric. Breakage of symmetry is needed for efficient allosteric communication between the EF-hands. The key roles that water molecules play in driving allosteric transitions are likely to be general in other metal ion mediated protein allostery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">sumSTAAR: A flexible framework for gene-based association studies using GWAS summary statistics</a></h4>

Gene-based association analysis is an effective gene-mapping tool. Many gene-based methods have been proposed recently. However, their power depends on the underlying genetic architecture, which is rarely known in complex traits, and so it is likely that a combination of such methods could serve as a universal approach. Several frameworks combining different gene-based methods have been developed. However, they all imply a fixed set of methods, weights and functional annotations. Moreover, most of them use individual phenotypes and genotypes as input data. Here, we introduce sumSTAAR, a framework for gene-based association analysis using summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It is an extended and modified version of STAAR framework proposed by Li and colleagues in 2020. The sumSTAAR framework offers a wider range of gene-based methods to combine. It allows the user to arbitrarily define a set of these methods, weighting functions and probabilities of genetic variants being causal. The methods used in the framework were adapted to analyse genes with large number of SNPs to decrease the running time. The framework includes the polygene pruning procedure to guard against the influence of the strong GWAS signals outside the gene. We also present new improved matrices of correlations between the genotypes of variants within genes. These matrices estimated on a sample of 265,000 individuals are a state-of-the-art replacement of widely used matrices based on the 1000 Genomes Project data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning the statistics and landscape of somatic mutation-induced insertions and deletions in antibodies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cosimo Lupo, Natanael Spisak, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Thierry Mora</p>

Affinity maturation is crucial for improving the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens. This process is mainly driven by point substitutions caused by somatic hypermutations of the immunoglobulin gene. It also includes deletions and insertions of genomic material known as indels. While the landscape of point substitutions has been extensively studied, a detailed statistical description of indels is still lacking. Here we present a probabilistic inference tool to learn the statistics of indels from repertoire sequencing data, which overcomes the pitfalls and biases of standard annotation methods. The model includes antibody-specific maturation ages to account for variable mutational loads in the repertoire. After validation on synthetic data, we applied our tool to a large dataset of human immunoglobulin heavy chains. The inferred model allows us to identify universal statistical features of indels in heavy chains. We report distinct insertion and deletion hotspots, and show that the distribution of lengths of indels follows a geometric distribution, which puts constraints on future mechanistic models of the hypermutation process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulmonary drug delivery and retention: A computational study to identify plausible parameters based on a coupled airway-mucus flow model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aranyak Chakravarty, Mahesh V. Panchagnula, Alladi Mohan, Neelesh A. Patankar</p>

Pulmonary drug delivery systems rely on inhalation of drug-laden aerosols produced from aerosol generators such as inhalers, nebulizers etc. On deposition, the drug molecules diffuse in the mucus layer and are also subjected to mucociliary advection which transports the drugs away from the initial deposition site. The availability of the drug at a particular region of the lung is, thus, determined by a balance between these two phenomena. A mathematical analysis of drug deposition and retention in the lungs is developed through a coupled mathematical model of aerosol transport in air as well as drug molecule transport in the mucus layer. The mathematical model is solved computationally to identify suitable conditions for the transport of drug-laden aerosols to the deep lungs. This study identifies the conditions conducive for delivering drugs to the deep lungs which is crucial for achieving systemic drug delivery. The effect of different parameters on drug retention is also characterized for various regions of the lungs, which is important in determining the availability of the inhaled drugs at a target location. Our analysis confirms that drug delivery efficacy remains highest for aerosols in the size range of 1-5 <i>μ</i>m. Moreover, it is observed that amount of drugs deposited in the deep lung increases by a factor of 2 when the breathing time period is doubled, with respect to normal breathing, suggesting breath control as a means to increase the efficacy of drug delivery to the deep lung. A higher efficacy also reduces the drug load required to be inhaled to produce the same health effects and hence, can help in minimizing the side effects of a drug.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">fingeRNAt—A novel tool for high-throughput analysis of nucleic acid-ligand interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalia A. Szulc, Zuzanna Mackiewicz, Janusz M. Bujnicki, Filip Stefaniak</p>

Computational methods play a pivotal role in drug discovery and are widely applied in virtual screening, structure optimization, and compound activity profiling. Over the last decades, almost all the attention in medicinal chemistry has been directed to protein-ligand binding, and computational tools have been created with this target in mind. With novel discoveries of functional RNAs and their possible applications, RNAs have gained considerable attention as potential drug targets. However, the availability of bioinformatics tools for nucleic acids is limited. Here, we introduce fingeRNAt—a software tool for detecting non-covalent interactions formed in complexes of nucleic acids with ligands. The program detects nine types of interactions: (i) hydrogen and (ii) halogen bonds, (iii) cation-anion, (iv) pi-cation, (v) pi-anion, (vi) pi-stacking, (vii) inorganic ion-mediated, (viii) water-mediated, and (ix) lipophilic interactions. However, the scope of detected interactions can be easily expanded using a simple plugin system. In addition, detected interactions can be visualized using the associated PyMOL plugin, which facilitates the analysis of medium-throughput molecular complexes. Interactions are also encoded and stored as a bioinformatics-friendly Structural Interaction Fingerprint (SIFt)—a binary string where the respective bit in the fingerprint is set to 1 if a particular interaction is present and to 0 otherwise. This output format, in turn, enables high-throughput analysis of interaction data using data analysis techniques. We present applications of fingeRNAt-generated interaction fingerprints for visual and computational analysis of RNA-ligand complexes, including analysis of interactions formed in experimentally determined RNA-small molecule ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank. We propose interaction fingerprint-based similarity as an alternative measure to RMSD to recapitulate complexes with similar interactions but different folding. We present an application of interaction fingerprints for the clustering of molecular complexes. This approach can be used to group ligands that form similar binding networks and thus have similar biological properties. The fingeRNAt software is freely available at https://github.com/n-szulc/fingeRNAt.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Priority-based transformations of stimulus representation in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quan Wan, Jorge A. Menendez, Bradley R. Postle</p>

How does the brain prioritize among the contents of working memory (WM) to appropriately guide behavior? Previous work, employing inverted encoding modeling (IEM) of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, has shown that unprioritized memory items (UMI) are actively represented in the brain, but in a “flipped”, or opposite, format compared to prioritized memory items (PMI). To acquire independent evidence for such a priority-based representational transformation, and to explore underlying mechanisms, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to perform a 2-back WM task. Visualization of LSTM hidden layer activity using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) confirmed that stimulus representations undergo a representational transformation–consistent with a flip—while transitioning from the functional status of UMI to PMI. Demixed (d)PCA of the same data identified two representational trajectories, one each within a UMI subspace and a PMI subspace, both undergoing a reversal of stimulus coding axes. dPCA of data from an EEG dataset also provided evidence for priority-based transformations of the representational code, albeit with some differences. This type of transformation could allow for retention of unprioritized information in WM while preventing it from interfering with concurrent behavior. The results from this initial exploration suggest that the algorithmic details of how this transformation is carried out by RNNs, versus by the human brain, may differ.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A new test suggests hundreds of amino acid polymorphisms in humans are subject to balancing selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vivak Soni, Michiel Vos, Adam Eyre-Walker</p>

The role that balancing selection plays in the maintenance of genetic diversity remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a new test, based on the McDonald–Kreitman test, in which the number of polymorphisms that are shared between populations is contrasted to those that are private at selected and neutral sites. We show that this simple test is robust to a variety of demographic changes, and that it can also give a direct estimate of the number of shared polymorphisms that are directly maintained by balancing selection. We apply our method to population genomic data from humans and provide some evidence that hundreds of nonsynonymous polymorphisms are subject to balancing selection.

<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.</p>

     alt="Inhibition of androgenic pathway impairs encoding of cerebellar-dependent motor learning in male rats"/>
<p>Gaze stabilization reflexes such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) share some neuronal circuitry and interact in oculomotor adaptation phenomena. The presence of androgen receptors (Ars) in the cerebellar–vestibular network that mediates the adaptive modification of the VOR makes the VOR an excellent model to study the impact of androgens on cerebellar-dependent learning. In young male rats, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (FLUT) acutely impairs the capability of VOR to encode gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptation without influencing basal VOR and OKR. Such findings imply that the androgenic neuronal pathway activation participates in the VOR adaptation phenomenon probably via nonclassical mechanisms of regulation. We suggested that androgens, possibly testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by binding Ars may rapidly regulate cerebellar and extracerebellar plastic sites responsible for VOR adaptation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar-dependent learning is essential for the adaptation of motor and no motor behaviors to changing contexts, and neuroactive steroids—mainly referred to as estrogens—may regulate this process. However, the role of androgens in this process has not been established, although they may affect cerebellar physiology. Thus, this study aims to determine whether the activation of androgenic neural pathways may take part in controlling the vestibuloocular (VOR) and optokinetic reflexes (OKR), which depend on a defined cerebellar circuitry. To answer this question, we acutely blocked the activation of androgen receptors (Ars) using systemic administration of the Ars antagonist flutamide (FLUT; 20 mg/Kg) in peripubertal male rats. Then, we evaluated the FLUT effect on general oculomotor performance in the VOR and OKR as well as VOR adaptive gain increases and decreases. We used a paradigm causing fast VOR adaptation that combined in phase/out phase visuo-vestibular stimulations. We found that FLUT impaired the gain increase and decrease in VOR adaptation. However, FLUT altered neither acute nor overtime basal ocular-motor performance in the VOR or OKR. These findings indicate that the activation of androgenic neural pathways participates in phenomena leading to fast VOR adaptation, probably through the modulation of plasticity mechanisms that underlie adaptation of this reflex. Conversely, androgens may not be essential for neural information processing demands in basal ocular-motor reflexes. Moreover, our results suggest that androgens, possibly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could rapidly regulate motor memory encoding in the VOR adaptation, acting at both cerebellar and extracerebellar plasticity sites.</p>

<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

<p>The expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) in the zebra finch brain showing unique differential expressions in subdivisions of the forebrain and the song nuclei. The white color represents mRNA signal.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission and cell signaling, which contribute to learning, memory, and the execution of motor skills. Birdsong is a complex learned motor skill in songbirds. Although the existence of 15 nAChR subunits has been predicted in the avian genome, their expression patterns and potential contributions to song learning and production have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we cloned all the 15 nAChR subunits (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) from the zebra finch brain and investigated the mRNA expression patterns in the neural pathways responsible for the learning and production of birdsong during a critical period of song learning. Although there were no detectable hybridization signals for ChrnA1, A6, A9, and A10, the other 11 nAChR subunits were uniquely expressed in one or more major subdivisions in the song nuclei of the songbird brain. Of these 11 subunits, ChrnA3–5, A7, and B2 were differentially regulated in the song nuclei compared with the surrounding anatomically related regions. ChrnA5 was upregulated during the critical period of song learning in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ChrnA7 and B2 to be the major subunits expressed in neurons of the vocal motor nuclei HVC and robust nucleus of the arcopallium, indicating the potential existence of ChrnA7-homomeric and ChrnB2-heteromeric nAChRs in limited cell populations. These results suggest that relatively limited types of nAChR subunits provide functional contributions to song learning and production in songbirds.</p>

<p>Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad) is a regulator of dendritic spine density. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. <i>Acad</i> was substantially expressed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus of intact brains. Cerebral ischemia dramatically upregulated <i>Acad</i> expression, mainly in the limbic and paralimbic regions. The upregulation of <i>Acad</i> depended on neuronal activation following cerebral ischemia. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity after brain ischemia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed <i>Acad</i> in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. <i>Acad</i> expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for <i>Acad</i> upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.</p>

     alt="Brain-wide mapping of inputs to the mouse lateral posterior (LP/Pulvinar) thalamus–anterior cingulate cortex network"/>
<p>We perform projection-specific monosynaptic mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP and ACC network in mice and show that the LP-ACC network integrates information from regions which parallel that of the primate pulvinar-prefrontal network. LP→ACC and ACC→LP neurons share common sources of inputs from regions involved in orienting and sensorimotor control. Inputs to the ACC→LP projection may serve to provide spatial context or visuomotor instructions, while the bottom-up LP→ACC circuit integrates multisensory information and could serve as a route for SC feedback to frontal cortex. Our study serves as a primer for future circuit-level examination of LP-ACC interactions and inputs integrated by this circuit.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent homolog of the primate pulvinar, the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus, is extensively interconnected with multiple cortical areas. While these cortical interactions can span the entire LP, subdivisions of the LP are characterized by differential connections with specific cortical regions. In particular, the medial LP has reciprocal connections with frontoparietal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and attentional regulation, likely exerting some of these functions via the LP. However, little is known about how ACC and LP interact, and about the information potentially integrated in this reciprocal network. Here, we address this gap by employing a projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to delineate brain-wide inputs to bottom-up LP→ACC and top-down ACC→LP neurons. We find that LP→ACC neurons receive inputs from widespread cortical regions, including primary and higher order sensory and motor cortical areas. LP→ACC neurons also receive extensive subcortical inputs, particularly from the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Sensory inputs to ACC→LP neurons largely arise from visual cortical areas. In addition, ACC→LP neurons integrate cross-hemispheric prefrontal cortex inputs as well as inputs from higher order medial cortex. Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provides a roadmap for understanding how LP and ACC communicate different sources of information to mediate attentional control and visuomotor functions.</p>

     alt="Estrogen receptors observed at extranuclear neuronal sites and in glia in the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the female rat: Evidence for localization to catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons"/>
<p>This study used electron microscopy to examine the distribution ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core and shell. These receptors are localized, almost exclusively, to extranuclear sites in the NAc. They are observed in all neuronal profiles and in glia, but are most prevalent in presynaptic profiles. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic neurons, and a larger proportion are localized to GABAergic neurons. These results provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens on dopaminergic transmission in the NAc.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied changes in the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [Cb] and parvalbumin [Pv]) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of four capuchin monkeys with laser-induced retinal lesions. The lesions were generated with the aid of a neodymium-YAG dual-frequency laser with shots of different intensity and at different survival time in each animal. The expression of these proteins in the layers of the dLGN was evaluated by performing histodensitometry of coronal sections throughout the nucleus. High-power laser shots administered at the border of the optic disc (OD)-injured fibers resulted in large scotomas. These lesions produced a devastating effect on fibers in this passage, resulting in large deafferentation of the dLGN. The time course of plasticity expressed in this nucleus varied with the degree of the retinal lesion. Topographically, corresponding portions of the dLGN were inferred by the extent of the ocular dominance column revealed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry in flattened preparations of V1. In the region representing the retinal lesion, the expression of GFAP, GAP43, Pv, and Cb increased and decreased in the corresponding dLGN layers shortly after lesion induction and returned to their original values with different time courses. Synaptogenesis (indicated by GAP43 expression) appeared to be increased in all layers, while “cleansing” of the glial-damaged region (indicated by GFAP expression) was markedly greater in the parvocellular layers, followed by the magnocellular layers.</p>

                Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable traits indexing genetic liability for a disorder. Here, we examined three potential endophenotypes, working memory function, response inhibition and reaction time variability, for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) measured as a dimensional latent trait in a large general population sample derived from the Adolescent Brain and Cognition Developmental study. The genetic risk for ADHD was estimated using polygenic risk scores (PRS) whereas ADHD traits were quantified as a dimensional continuum using Bartlett factor score estimates, derived from Attention Problems items from the Child Behaviour Checklist and Effortful Control items from the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised. The three candidate cognitive endophenotypes were quantified using task-based performance measures. Higher ADHD PRSs were associated with higher ADHD traits, as well as poorer working memory performance and increased reaction time variability. Lower working memory performance, poorer response inhibition, and increased reaction time variability were associated with more pronounced ADHD traits. Working memory and reaction time variability partially statistically mediated the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits, explaining 14% and 16% of the association, respectively. The mediation effect was specific to the genetic risk for ADHD and did not generalise to genetic risk for four other major psychiatric disorders. Together, these findings provide robust evidence from a large general population sample that working memory and reaction time variability can be considered endophenotypes for ADHD that mediate the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of neonatal brain functional centrality and alterations associated with preterm birth</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the functional connectome in early life underpins future learning and behaviour. However, our understanding of how the functional organisation of brain regions into interconnected hubs (centrality) matures in the early postnatal period is limited, especially in response to factors associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as preterm birth. We characterised voxel-wise functional centrality (weighted degree) in 366 neonates from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We tested the hypothesis that functional centrality matures with age at scan in term-born babies and is disrupted by preterm birth. Finally, we asked whether neonatal functional centrality predicts general neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. We report an age-related increase in functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and decrease within motor and auditory regions in term-born infants. Preterm-born infants scanned at term equivalent age had higher functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and lower measures in motor regions. Functional centrality was not related to outcome at 18 months old. Thus, preterm birth appears to affect functional centrality in regions undergoing substantial development during the perinatal period. Our work raises the question of whether these alterations are adaptive or disruptive, and whether they predict neurodevelopmental characteristics that are more subtle or emerge later in life.

                Neuronal ankyrin-B is an intracellular scaffolding protein that plays multiple roles in the axon. By contrast, relatively little is known about the function of ankyrin-B in dendrites, where ankyrin-B is also localized in mature neurons. Recently, we showed that ankyrin-B acts as a scaffold for the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.2, in dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons. How ankyrin-B is itself targeted to the dendritic membrane is not well understood. Here, we report that ankyrin-B is lipid-modified by S-palmitoylation to promote dendritic localization of Nav1.2. We identify the palmitoyl acyl transferase zDHHC17 as a key mediator of ankyrin-B palmitoylation in heterologous cells and in neurons. Additionally, we find that zDHHC17 regulates ankyrin-B protein levels independently of its S-acylation function through a conserved binding mechanism between the ANK repeat domain of zDHHC17 and the zDHHC ankyrin-repeat binding motif of ankyrin-B. We subsequently identify five cysteines in the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of ankyrin-B that are necessary for ankyrin-B palmitoylation. Mutation of these five cysteines to alanines not only abolishes ankyrin-B palmitoylation, but also prevents ankyrin-B from scaffolding Nav1.2 at dendritic membranes of neurons due to ankyrin-B's inability to localize properly at dendrites. Thus, we show palmitoylation is critical for localization and function of ankyrin-B at dendrites. Strikingly, loss of ankyrin-B palmitoylation does not affect ankyrin-B-mediated axonal cargo transport of synaptic vesicle synaptotagmin-1 in neurons. This is the first demonstration of S-palmitoylation of ankyrin-B as an underlying mechanism required for ankyrin-B localization and function in scaffolding Nav1.2 at dendrites.
