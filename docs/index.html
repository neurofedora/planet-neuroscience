              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Population-based sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals how current population dynamics are shaped by past epidemics</a></h4>

              
                Transmission is a driver of tuberculosis (TB) epidemics in high-burden regions, with assumed negligible impact in low-burden areas. However, we still lack a full characterization of transmission dynamics in settings with similar and different burdens. Genomic epidemiology can greatly help to quantify transmission, but the lack of whole genome sequencing population-based studies has hampered its application. Here, we generate a population-based dataset from Valencia region and compare it with available datasets from different TB-burden settings to reveal transmission dynamics heterogeneity and its public health implications. We sequenced the whole genome of 785 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strains and linked genomes to patient epidemiological data. We use a pairwise distance clustering approach and phylodynamic methods to characterize transmission events over the last 150 years, in different TB-burden regions. Our results underscore significant differences in transmission between low-burden TB settings, i.e., clustering in Valencia region is higher (47.4%) than in Oxfordshire (27%), and similar to a high-burden area as Malawi (49.8%). By modeling times of the transmission links, we observed that settings with high transmission rate are associated with decades of uninterrupted transmission, irrespective of burden. Together, our results reveal that burden and transmission are not necessarily linked due to the role of past epidemics in the ongoing TB incidence, and highlight the need for in-depth characterization of transmission dynamics and specifically tailored TB control strategies.

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was the verification of the Subdural Hematoma in the Elderly (SHE) score proposed by Alford et al. as a mortality predictor in patients older than 65 years with nontraumatic/minor trauma acute subdural hematoma (aSDH). Additionally, we evaluated further predictors associated with poor outcome. Methods: Patients were scored according to age (1 point is given if patients were older than 80 years), GCS by admission (1 point for GCS 5&amp;amp;ndash;12, 2 points for GCS 3&amp;amp;ndash;4), and SDH volume (1 point for volume 50 mL). The sum of points determines the SHE score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify additional independent risk factors associated with 30-day mortality. Results: We evaluated 131 patients with aSDH who were treated at our institution between 2008 and 2020. We observed the same 30-day mortality rates published by Alford et al.: SHE 0: 4.3% vs. 3.2%, p = 1.0; SHE 1: 12.2% vs. 13.1%, p = 1.0; SHE 2: 36.6% vs. 32.7%, p = 0.8; SHE 3: 97.1% vs. 95.7%, p = 1.0 and SHE 4: 100% vs. 100%, p = 1.0. Additionally, 18 patients who developed status epilepticus (SE) had a mortality of 100 percent regardless of the SHE score. The distribution of SE among the groups was: 1 for SHE 1, 6 for SHE 2, 9 for SHE 3, and 2 for SHE 4. The logistic regression showed the surgical evacuation to be the only significant risk factor for developing the seizure. All patients who developed SE underwent surgery (p = 0.0065). Furthermore, SHE 3 and 4 showed no difference regarding the outcome between surgical and conservative treatment. Conclusions: SHE score is a reliable mortality predictor for minor trauma acute subdural hematoma in elderly patients. In addition, we identified status epilepticus as a strong life-expectancy-limiting factor in patients undergoing surgical evacuation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Elevated plasma phosphorylated tau 181 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) is reliably elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less explored is its specificity relative to other neurodegenerative conditions. Here we find novel evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative condition typically lacking tau pathology. We performed a detailed evaluation to identify the clinical correlates of elevated p-tau<sub>181</sub> in ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were clinically or pathologically diagnosed with ALS (n=130) or AD (n=79), or were healthy non-impaired controls (n=26). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed and area under the curve (AUC) was used to discriminate AD from ALS. Within ALS, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests compared analytes by presence/absence of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs. Spearman correlations tested associations between plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> and postmortem neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A Wilcoxon test showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was higher in ALS than controls (W=2600, <i>p</i>=0.000015), and ROC analyses showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> poorly discriminated AD and ALS (AUC=0.60). In ALS, elevated plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with LMN signs in cervical (W=827, <i>p</i>=0.0072), thoracic (W=469, <i>p</i>=0.00025), and lumbosacral regions (W=851, <i>p</i>=0.0000029). In support of LMN findings, plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with neuron loss in the spinal cord (rho=0.46, <i>p</i>=0.017), but not in the motor cortex (<i>p</i>=0.41). CSF p-tau<sub>181</sub> and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) were included as reference analytes, and demonstrate specificity of findings.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found strong evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in ALS and may be a novel marker specific to LMN dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Inter-Animal Variability in Activity Phase Is Constrained by Synaptic Dynamics in an Oscillatory Network</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The levels of voltage-gated and synaptic currents in the same neuron type can vary substantially across individuals. Yet, the phase relationships between neurons in oscillatory circuits are often maintained, even in the face of varying oscillation frequencies. We examined whether synaptic and intrinsic currents are matched to maintain constant activity phases across preparations, using the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <I>Cancer borealis</I>. LP produces stable oscillatory bursts on release from inhibition, with an onset phase that is independent of oscillation frequency. We quantified the parameters that define the shape of the synaptic current inputs across preparations and found no linear correlations with voltage-gated currents. However, several synaptic parameters were correlated with oscillation period and burst onset phase, suggesting they may play a role in phase maintenance. We used dynamic clamp to apply artificial synaptic inputs and found that those synaptic parameters correlated with phase and period were ineffective in influencing burst onset. Instead, parameters that showed the least variability across preparations had the greatest influence. Thus, parameters that influence circuit phasing are constrained across individuals, while those that have little effect simply co-vary with phase and frequency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Extrahippocampal Seizure and Memory Circuits Overlap</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Seizures cause retrograde amnesia. We have previously demonstrated that seizures erode recently formed memories through shared ensembles and mechanisms in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here, we tested whether seizure circuits overlap spatial memory circuits outside of the CA. Spatial memory is consolidated by the hippocampal-cortical coupling that are connected via multiple pathways. We tested whether a seizure invades structures involved in memory consolidation by using the activity reporter TRAP2 mice. T-maze alternation learning activated neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG), mediodorsal thalamus (MD), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This spatial memory relies on the plasticity of the AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit. GluA1 knock-out (KO)/TRAP2 mice did not learn to alternate, and structures interposed between the hippocampus and the cortex were not active. A seizure prevented the recall of alternation memory and activated memory-labeled structures. There was a widespread overlap between learning-activated ensembles and seizure-activated neurons, which likely contributes to retrograde amnesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Coagulase-negative staphylococci as an evolving mastitis causing organism in cows: A review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The present review attempts to address the emergence of a fast-growing mastitis causing pathogen – coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) – and its multi-facet roles in dairy farms. CNS is divided into numerous species, but only a few succeed in bovine mastitis. The two predominant CNS species causing mastitis are Staphylococcus chromogenes and Staphylococcus simulans. These two mostly known CNS affects dairy cows at varied parities and at different lactation stages. CNS have been judged to be the most common bovine mastitis isolate in several countries of the world. However, CNS may not likely be as pathogenic as the other primary mastitis pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and its infection mostly remains subclinical. Conversely, CNS is capable of triggering persistent infections among dairy herds, resulting in reduced milk quality and high milk somatic cell count (SCC). One negative impact of CNS infection in dairy herds is that it can destroy cow udder tissue, hereby leading to a drop in milk production of dairy cows. CNS mastitis has a high cure rate when treated with anti-biotics as their infection in cows are not known to be a therapeutic problem. Judging from several literatures, it cannot be said whether CNS species act as an ecological or contagious pathogens. Regulator procedures, including pre- and post-milking teat disinfection, may reduce contagious mastitis pathogens of CNS infections in the dairy herd. Phenotypic methods for identification of CNS are not adequately dependable, and molecular techniques of identification may be better substitute for identification. Dairy farmers may benefit greatly from more empirical research on the epidemiology of CNS mastitis and more reliable methods for species identification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low back pain and associated risk factors among medical students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study determined the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.4 ± 1.9 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), non-specific (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

                Cardiac metastases are rare. Herein, we report a case of a 37-year-old female patient with a history of borderline breast phyllodes tumor (PT) treated by surgery, admitted to our department for concomitant cardiac and pulmonary metastases of malignant PT. Cardiac metastasis occurred through direct extension from pulmonary metastasis to the left atrium via the right inferior pulmonary vein, causing severe mitral valve obstruction. Although the total surgical removal of metastases, the patient had a huge relapse of the mediastinal metastasis resulting in her death.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness and safety profile of mesenchymal stem cell secretome as a treatment for severe cases of COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenesis effects that are useful for relieving inflammation, recovery, and protection of lung tissues in COVID-19 patients. Secretome, a secretory product of MSCs, has several advantages over MSCs. We conducted a study to investigate secretomes’ effectiveness and safety profile as a treatment for severe COVID-19.  Methods: A double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between February 2021 and July 2021 in three top COVID-19 referral hospitals in the Greater Jakarta area, Indonesia. Eligible subjects (n=40) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (n=20) and a control group (n=20). The primary outcome of this study was the changes in inflammatory markers and the ratio of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory markers. The secondary outcomes of this study included clinical outcome, laboratory outcome, radiological outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profile of MSC secretome. Results: Our analysis showed that on the 14th day after placebo administration, IL-6 level in the control group was significantly increased [4.110 (2.403–12.820) at baseline to 13.320 (2.958–33.285) on the 14th day after intervention, p=0.017]. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio in the control group was significantly increased (p=0.036) on the 14th day after placebo administration. We also found that most of the subjects who received placebo had high levels of IL-6 and ferritin (p=0.043) on the seventh day after the intervention. However, we found no significant differences in inflammatory marker levels on the seventh day and 14th day after intervention between both groups. There was no adverse event reported. There were no significant differences in the laboratory outcome, radiology outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profiles between both groups. Conclusions: MSC secretome can control inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and has a good safety profile. MSC secretome is a promising treatment modality for severe COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Examining the impact of ICU population interaction structure on modeled colonization dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew S. Mietchen, Christopher T. Short, Matthew Samore, Eric T. Lofgren, CDC Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare Program (MInD-Healthcare) </p>
Background <p>Complex transmission models of healthcare-associated infections provide insight for hospital epidemiology and infection control efforts, but they are difficult to implement and come at high computational costs. Structuring more simplified models to incorporate the heterogeneity of the intensive care unit (ICU) patient-provider interactions, we explore how methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) dynamics and acquisitions may be better represented and approximated.</p> Methods <p>Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared the rates of MRSA acquisition across three ICU population interaction structures: a model with nurses and physicians as a single staff type (SST), a model with separate staff types for nurses and physicians (Nurse-MD model), and a Metapopulation model where each nurse was assigned a group of patients. The proportion of time spent with the assigned patient group (γ) within the Metapopulation model was also varied.</p> Results <p>The SST, Nurse-MD, and Metapopulation models had a mean of 40.6, 32.2 and 19.6 annual MRSA acquisitions respectively. All models were sensitive to the same parameters in the same direction, although the Metapopulation model was less sensitive. The number of acquisitions varied non-linearly by values of γ, with values below 0.40 resembling the Nurse-MD model, while values above that converged toward the Metapopulation structure.</p> Discussion <p>Inclusion of complex population interactions within a modeled hospital ICU has considerable impact on model results, with the SST model having more than double the acquisition rate of the more structured metapopulation model. While the direction of parameter sensitivity remained the same, the magnitude of these differences varied, producing different colonization rates across relatively similar populations. The non-linearity of the model’s response to differing values of a parameter gamma (γ) suggests simple model approximations are appropriate in only a narrow space of relatively dispersed nursing assignments.</p> Conclusion <p>Simplifying assumptions around how a hospital population is modeled, especially assuming random mixing, may overestimate infection rates and the impact of interventions. In many, if not most, cases more complex models that represent population mixing with higher granularity are justified.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The dopamine circuit as a reward-taxis navigation system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Omer Karin, Uri Alon</p>

Studying the brain circuits that control behavior is challenging, since in addition to their structural complexity there are continuous feedback interactions between actions and sensed inputs from the environment. It is therefore important to identify mathematical principles that can be used to develop testable hypotheses. In this study, we use ideas and concepts from systems biology to study the dopamine system, which controls learning, motivation, and movement. Using data from neuronal recordings in behavioral experiments, we developed a mathematical model for dopamine responses and the effect of dopamine on movement. We show that the dopamine system shares core functional analogies with bacterial chemotaxis. Just as chemotaxis robustly climbs chemical attractant gradients, the dopamine circuit performs ‘reward-taxis’ where the attractant is the expected value of reward. The reward-taxis mechanism provides a simple explanation for scale-invariant dopaminergic responses and for matching in free operant settings, and makes testable quantitative predictions. We propose that reward-taxis is a simple and robust navigation strategy that complements other, more goal-directed navigation mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The computational relationship between reinforcement learning, social inference, and paranoia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joseph M. Barnby, Mitul A. Mehta, Michael Moutoussis</p>

Theoretical accounts suggest heightened uncertainty about the state of the world underpin aberrant belief updates, which in turn increase the risk of developing a persecutory delusion. However, this raises the question as to how an agent’s uncertainty may relate to the precise phenomenology of paranoia, as opposed to other qualitatively different forms of belief. We tested whether the same population (n = 693) responded similarly to non-social and social contingency changes in a probabilistic reversal learning task and a modified repeated reversal Dictator game, and the impact of paranoia on both. We fitted computational models that included closely related parameters that quantified the rigidity across contingency reversals and the uncertainty about the environment/partner. Consistent with prior work we show that paranoia was associated with uncertainty around a partner’s behavioural policy and rigidity in harmful intent attributions in the social task. In the non-social task we found that pre-existing paranoia was associated with larger decision temperatures and commitment to suboptimal cards. We show relationships between decision temperature in the non-social task and priors over harmful intent attributions and uncertainty over beliefs about partners in the social task. Our results converge across both classes of model, suggesting paranoia is associated with a general uncertainty over the state of the world (and agents within it) that takes longer to resolve, although we demonstrate that this uncertainty is expressed asymmetrically in social contexts. Our model and data allow the representation of sociocognitive mechanisms that explain persecutory delusions and provide testable, phenomenologically relevant predictions for causal experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chemophoresis engine: A general mechanism of ATPase-driven cargo transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeshi Sugawara, Kunihiko Kaneko</p>

Cell polarity regulates the orientation of the cytoskeleton members that directs intracellular transport for cargo-like organelles, using chemical gradients sustained by ATP or GTP hydrolysis. However, how cargo transports are directly mediated by chemical gradients remains unknown. We previously proposed a physical mechanism that enables directed movement of cargos, referred to as chemophoresis. According to the mechanism, a cargo with reaction sites is subjected to a chemophoresis force in the direction of the increased concentration. Based on this, we introduce an extended model, the <i>chemophoresis engine</i>, as a general mechanism of cargo motion, which transforms chemical free energy into directed motion through the catalytic ATP hydrolysis. We applied the engine to plasmid motion in a ParABS system to demonstrate the self-organization system for directed plasmid movement and pattern dynamics of ParA-ATP concentration, thereby explaining plasmid equi-positioning and pole-to-pole oscillation observed in bacterial cells and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. We mathematically show the existence and stability of the plasmid-surfing pattern, which allows the cargo-directed motion through the symmetry-breaking transition of the ParA-ATP spatiotemporal pattern. We also quantitatively demonstrate that the chemophoresis engine can work even under <i>in vivo</i> conditions. Finally, we discuss the chemophoresis engine as one of the general mechanisms of hydrolysis-driven intracellular transport.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model for the intrinsic limit of cancer therapy: Duality of treatment-induced cell death and treatment-induced stemness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erin Angelini, Yue Wang, Joseph Xu Zhou, Hong Qian, Sui Huang</p>

Intratumor cellular heterogeneity and non-genetic cell plasticity in tumors pose a recently recognized challenge to cancer treatment. Because of the dispersion of initial cell states within a clonal tumor cell population, a perturbation imparted by a cytocidal drug only kills a fraction of cells. Due to dynamic instability of cellular states the cells not killed are pushed by the treatment into a variety of functional states, including a “stem-like state” that confers resistance to treatment and regenerative capacity. This immanent stress-induced stemness competes against cell death in response to the same perturbation and may explain the near-inevitable recurrence after any treatment. This double-edged-sword mechanism of treatment complements the selection of preexisting resistant cells in explaining post-treatment progression. Unlike selection, the induction of a resistant state has not been systematically analyzed as an immanent cause of relapse. Here, we present a generic elementary model and analytical examination of this intrinsic limitation to therapy. We show how the relative proclivity towards cell death versus transition into a stem-like state, as a function of drug dose, establishes either a window of opportunity for containing tumors or the inevitability of progression following therapy. The model considers measurable cell behaviors independent of specific molecular pathways and provides a new theoretical framework for optimizing therapy dosing and scheduling as cancer treatment paradigms move from “maximal tolerated dose,” which may promote therapy induced-stemness, to repeated “minimally effective doses” (as in adaptive therapies), which contain the tumor and avoid therapy-induced progression.

Graphia is an open-source platform created for the graph-based analysis of the huge amounts of quantitative and qualitative data currently being generated from the study of genomes, genes, proteins metabolites and cells. Core to Graphia’s functionality is support for the calculation of correlation matrices from any tabular matrix of continuous or discrete values, whereupon the software is designed to rapidly visualise the often very large graphs that result in 2D or 3D space. Following graph construction, an extensive range of measurement algorithms, routines for graph transformation, and options for the visualisation of node and edge attributes are available, for graph exploration and analysis. Combined, these provide a powerful solution for the interpretation of high-dimensional data from many sources, or data already in the form of a network or equivalent adjacency matrix. Several use cases of Graphia are described, to showcase its wide range of applications in the analysis biological data. Graphia runs on all major desktop operating systems, is extensible through the deployment of plugins and is freely available to download from https://graphia.app/.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Estimating the transfer rates of bacterial plasmids with an adapted Luria–Delbrück fluctuation analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivia Kosterlitz, Adamaris Muñiz Tirado, Claire Wate, Clint Elg, Ivana Bozic, Eva M. Top, Benjamin Kerr</p>

To increase our basic understanding of the ecology and evolution of conjugative plasmids, we need reliable estimates of their rate of transfer between bacterial cells. Current assays to measure transfer rate are based on deterministic modeling frameworks. However, some cell numbers in these assays can be very small, making estimates that rely on these numbers prone to noise. Here, we take a different approach to estimate plasmid transfer rate, which explicitly embraces this noise. Inspired by the classic fluctuation analysis of Luria and Delbrück, our method is grounded in a stochastic modeling framework. In addition to capturing the random nature of plasmid conjugation, our new methodology, the Luria–Delbrück method (“LDM”), can be used on a diverse set of bacterial systems, including cases for which current approaches are inaccurate. A notable example involves plasmid transfer between different strains or species where the rate that one type of cell donates the plasmid is not equal to the rate at which the other cell type donates. Asymmetry in these rates has the potential to bias or constrain current transfer estimates, thereby limiting our capabilities for estimating transfer in microbial communities. In contrast, the LDM overcomes obstacles of traditional methods by avoiding restrictive assumptions about growth and transfer rates for each population within the assay. Using stochastic simulations and experiments, we show that the LDM has high accuracy and precision for estimation of transfer rates compared to the most widely used methods, which can produce estimates that differ from the LDM estimate by orders of magnitude.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">LiCl-induced sickness modulates rat gustatory cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bradly T. Stone, Jian-You Lin, Abuzar Mahmood, Alden J. Sanford, Donald B. Katz</p>

Gustatory cortex (GC), a structure deeply involved in the making of consumption decisions, presumably performs this function by integrating information about taste, experiences, and internal states related to the animal’s health, such as illness. Here, we investigated this assertion, examining whether illness is represented in GC activity, and how this representation impacts taste responses and behavior. We recorded GC single-neuron activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from healthy rats and rats made ill (via LiCl injection). We show (consistent with the extant literature) that the onset of illness-related behaviors arises contemporaneously with alterations in 7 to 12 Hz LFP power at approximately 12 min following injection. This process was accompanied by reductions in single-neuron taste response magnitudes and discriminability, and with enhancements in palatability-relatedness—a result reflecting the collapse of responses toward a simple “good-bad” code visible in the entire sample, but focused on a specific subset of GC neurons. Overall, our data show that a state (illness) that profoundly reduces consumption changes basic properties of the sensory cortical response to tastes, in a manner that can easily explain illness’ impact on consumption.

<p>The pooled cohort consisted of patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) &lt; 6 and internal carotid artery (ICA), M1, or M2 occlusions from the Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergecy Neurological Deficits - Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA) Trial,  Tenecteplase vs Alteplase before Endovascular Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trials Part I/II and prospective data from 15 EVT centers from October 2010 to April 2020. RAPID software estimated ischemic core and mismatch. Patients receiving primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>) were compared to those who received primary MM (MM<sub>pri</sub>), including those who deteriorated and received rescue EVT, in overall and propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. Patients were stratified by target mismatch (mismatch ratio ≥ 1.8 and mismatch volume ≥ 15ml). Primary outcome was functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale = 0–2). Secondary outcomes included safety (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [sICH], neurological worsening, and mortality).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 540 patients, 286 (53%) received EVT<sub>pri</sub> and demonstrated larger critically hypoperfused tissue (Tmax &gt; 6 seconds) volumes (median [IQR]: 64 [26–96] ml vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 40 [14–76] ml, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher presentation NIHSS (median [IQR]: 4 [2–5] vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 3 [2–4], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Functional independence was similar (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 75.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82–2.03, <i>p</i> = 0.27). EVT had worse safety regarding sICH (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 16.3% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 1.3%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and neurological worsening (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 19.6% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 6.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In 414 subjects (76.7%) with target mismatch, EVT was associated with improved functional independence (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 72.7%, aOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.01–2.81, <i>p</i> = 0.048), whereas there was a trend toward less favorable outcomes with primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 83.3%, aOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.12–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.13) without target mismatch (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.06). Similar findings were observed in a propensity score-matched subpopulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, EVT was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in mild strokes due to LVO, and sICH was increased. However, in patients with target mismatch profile, EVT was associated with increased functional independence. Perfusion imaging may be helpful to select mild stroke patients for EVT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Autism spectrum disorder in architecture perspective: a review of the literature and bibliometric assessment of research indexed in Web of Science [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: An increasing number of scholarly publications on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have urged researcher interest in this topic; however, there is still a lack of quantitative analysis. Therefore, this study aims to cover the knowledge gap between the amount of literature published on ASD research on architectural and designers' perspectives compared to the medical and psychological fields. The study has analyzed global research output on ASD from a designer's perspective to recognize this gap related to designing the physical environment.  Methodology: The bibliometric method was employed to analyze the published literature from 1992–to 2021. 812 papers were downloaded from the Web of Science for analysis based on annual growth of literature, prolific authors, authorship pattern, organizations, countries, international collaboration, and subject development by keywords and thematic map analyses. Various bibliometric and scientometric software was used to analyze the data, namely Bibexcel, Biblioshiny, and VOS viewer. Results: The812 research papers were published in 405 sources. 2019 appeared as a productive year (NP=101), and 2014 received the highest number of citations (TC=6634). Researchers preferred to publish as journal articles (NP=538; TC=24922). The University of Toronto, Canada, was identified as a productive institution with 42 publications and 5358 citations. The USA was the leading producing country with 433 publications, and most of the researchers published in the journal "Scientific Reports" (NP=16). The word autism (NP=257) and architecture (NP=165) were more frequently used keywords. Conclusion: The study identified a massive gap in the development of literature in ASD for architecture design and built environment perspective, the most important and trending keywords are missing, and the analyses also showed a lack of subject development. The authors have suggested areas and keywords for further research to fulfill the gap in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐duration progressive supranuclear palsy: clinical course and pathological underpinnings</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To identify the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of benign progressive supranuclear palsy with particularly long disease duration; to define neuropathological determinants underlying variability in disease duration in progressive supranuclear palsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and pathological features were compared among 186 autopsy-confirmed cases with progressive supranuclear palsy with ≥10 years and shorter survival times.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>45 cases (24.2%) had a disease duration of ≥10 years. The absence of ocular motor abnormalities within the first 3 years from disease onset was the only significant independent clinical predictor of longer survival. Histopathologically, the neurodegeneration parameters in each survival group were paralleled anatomically by the distribution of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, whereas the tufted astrocytes displayed anatomically an opposite severity pattern. Most interestingly, we found significantly less coiled bodies in those who survive longer, in contrast to patients with less favorable course.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>A considerable proportion of patients had a more ‘benign’ disease course with ≥10 years survival. They had a distinct pattern and evolution of core symptoms compared to patients with short survival. The inverted anatomical patterns of astrocytic tau distribution suggest distinct implications of these cell types in trans-cellular propagation. The tempo of disease progression appeared to be determined mostly by oligodendroglial tau, where high degree of oligodendroglial tau pathology might affect neuronal integrity and function on top of neuronal tau pathology. The relative contribution of glial tau should be further explored in cellular and animal models.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">On the flexibility of the cellular amination network in E. coli</a></h4>

              
                Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is essential to generate the nitrogenous building blocks of life. It gets assimilated via the canonical biosynthetic routes to glutamate and is further distributed throughout metabolism via a network of transaminases. To study the flexibility of this network, we constructed an <i>Escherichia coli</i> glutamate auxotrophic strain. This strain allowed us to systematically study which amino acids serve as amine sources and found that several amino acids complement the auxotrophy, either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, we identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, we extended the transaminase network by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine were introduced. Our study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Speed variations of bacterial replisomes</a></h4>

              
                Replisomes are multi-protein complexes that replicate genomes with remarkable speed and accuracy. Despite their importance, their dynamics is poorly characterized, especially in vivo. In this paper, we present an approach to infer the replisome dynamics from the DNA abundance distribution measured in a growing bacterial population. Our method is sensitive enough to detect subtle variations of the replisome speed along the genome. As an application, we experimentally measured the DNA abundance distribution in Escherichia coli populations growing at different temperatures using deep sequencing. We find that the average replisome speed increases nearly five-fold between 17°C and 37°C. Further, we observe wave-like variations of the replisome speed along the genome. These variations correlate with previously observed variations of the mutation rate, suggesting a common dynamical origin. Our approach has the potential to elucidate replication dynamics in E. coli mutants and in other bacterial species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ATP binding facilitates target search of SWR1 chromatin remodeler by promoting one‑dimensional diffusion on DNA</a></h4>

              
                One-dimensional (1D) target search is a well-characterized phenomenon for many DNA binding proteins but is poorly understood for chromatin remodelers. Herein, we characterize the 1D scanning properties of SWR1, a conserved yeast chromatin remodeler that performs histone exchange on +1 nucleosomes adjacent to a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) at gene promoters. We demonstrate that SWR1 has a kinetic binding preference for DNA of NDR length as opposed to gene-body linker length DNA. Using single and dual color single-particle tracking on DNA stretched with optical tweezers, we directly observe SWR1 diffusion on DNA. We found that various factors impact SWR1 scanning, including ATP which promotes diffusion through nucleotide binding rather than ATP hydrolysis. A DNA binding subunit, Swc2, plays an important role in the overall diffusive behavior of the complex, as the subunit in isolation retains similar, although faster, scanning properties as the whole remodeler. ATP-bound SWR1 slides until it encounters a protein roadblock, of which we tested dCas9 and nucleosomes. The median diffusion coefficient, 0.024 μm<sup>2</sup>/sec, in the regime of helical sliding, would mediate rapid encounter of NDR-flanking nucleosomes at length scales found in cellular chromatin.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-organization of kinetochore-fibers in human mitotic spindles</a></h4>

              
                During eukaryotic cell division, chromosomes are linked to microtubules (MTs) in the spindle by a macromolecular complex called the kinetochore. The bound kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) are crucial to ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Recent reconstructions by electron tomography (Kiewisz et al. 2021) captured the positions and configurations of every MT in human mitotic spindles, revealing that roughly half the KMTs in these spindles do not reach the pole. Here, we investigate the processes that give rise to this distribution of KMTs using a combination of analysis of large-scale electron tomography, photoconversion experiments, quantitative polarized light microscopy, and biophysical modeling. Our results indicate that in metaphase, KMTs grow away from the kinetochores along well-defined trajectories, with the speed of the KMT minus ends continually decreasing as the minus ends approach the pole, implying that longer KMTs grow more slowly than shorter KMTs. The locations of KMT minus ends, and the turnover and movements of tubulin in KMTs, are consistent with models in which KMTs predominately nucleate de novo at kinetochores in metaphase and are inconsistent with substantial numbers of non-KMTs being recruited to the kinetochore in metaphase. Taken together, this work leads to a mathematical model of the self-organization of kinetochore-fibers in human mitotic spindles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective endocytosis controls slit diaphragm maintenance and dynamics in Drosophila nephrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The kidneys generate about 180 liters of primary urine per day by filtration of plasma. An essential part of the filtration barrier is the slit diaphragm, a multiprotein complex containing nephrin as major component. Filter dysfunction typically manifests with proteinuria and mutations in endocytosis regulating genes were discovered as causes of proteinuria. However, it is unclear how endocytosis regulates the slit diaphragm and how the filtration barrier is maintained without either protein leakage or filter clogging. Here we study nephrin dynamics in podocyte-like nephrocytes of <i>Drosophila</i> and show that selective endocytosis either by dynamin- or flotillin-mediated pathways regulates a stable yet highly dynamic architecture. Short-term manipulation of endocytic functions indicates that dynamin-mediated endocytosis of ectopic nephrin restricts slit diaphragm formation spatially while flotillin-mediated turnover of nephrin within the slit diaphragm is needed to maintain filter permeability by shedding of molecules bound to nephrin in endosomes. Since slit diaphragms cannot be studied <i>in vitro</i> and are poorly accessible in mouse models, this is the first analysis of their dynamics within the slit diaphragm multiprotein complex. Identification of the mechanisms of slit diaphragm maintenance will help to develop novel therapies for proteinuric renal diseases that are frequently limited to symptomatic treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A network of cytosolic (co)chaperones promotes the biogenesis of mitochondrial signal-anchored outer membrane proteins</a></h4>

              
                Signal-anchored (SA) proteins are anchored into the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) via a single transmembrane segment at their N-terminus while the bulk of the proteins is facing the cytosol. These proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and are then targeted to the organelle and inserted into its OM by import factors. Recently, research on the insertion mechanisms of these proteins into the mitochondrial OM have gained a lot of attention. In contrast, the early cytosolic steps of their biogenesis are unresolved. Using various proteins from this category and a broad set of <i>in vivo</i>,<i> in organello</i>, and<i> in vitro</i> assays, we reconstituted the early steps of their biogenesis. We identified a subset of molecular (co)chaperones that interact with newly synthesized SA proteins, namely, Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones and co-chaperones from the Hsp40 family like Ydj1 and Sis1. These interactions were mediated by the hydrophobic transmembrane segments of the SA proteins. We further demonstrate that interfering with these interactions inhibits the biogenesis of SA proteins to a various extent. Finally, we could demonstrate direct interaction of peptides corresponding to the transmembrane segments of SA proteins with the (co)chaperones and reconstitute <i>in vitro</i> the transfer of such peptides from the Hsp70 chaperone to the mitochondrial Tom70 receptor. Collectively, this study unravels an array of cytosolic chaperones and mitochondrial import factors that facilitates the targeting and membrane integration of mitochondrial SA proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poor sensitivity of iPSC-derived neural progenitors and glutamatergic neurons to SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 is a respiratory disease affecting multiple organs including the central nervous system (CNS), with a characteristic loss of smell and taste. Although frequently reported, the neurological symptoms remain enigmatic. There is no consensus on the extent of CNS infection. Here, we derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and glutamatergic neurons to study their permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis indicated that NPCs and neurons do not express detectable levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We thus generated cells expressing ACE2 by lentiviral transduction to analyze in a controlled manner the properties of SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to ACE2 expression. Sensitivity of parental and ACE2 expressing cells was assessed with GFP- or luciferase- carrying pseudoviruses and with authentic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, D614G, Alpha or Delta variants. SARS-CoV-2 replication was assessed by microscopy, RT-qPCR and infectivity assays. Pseudoviruses infected only cells overexpressing ACE2. Neurons and NPCs were unable to efficiently replicate SARS-CoV-2, whereas ACE2 overexpressing neurons were highly sensitive to productive infection. Altogether, our results indicate that primary NPCs and glutamatergic neurons remain poorly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 across the SARS-CoV-2 variants inoculated, in the absence of ACE2 expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal Activity Alters Neuron to OPC Synapses</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that drive the timing and specificity of oligodendrocyte myelination during development, or remyelination after injury or immune attack are not well understood. Recent work has shown that oligodendrocyte progenitors receive synapses from neurons, providing a potential mechanism for neuronal-glial communication. We hypothesize that these connections are important both for correct myelination of neurons during development and for myelination during neuronal plasticity. We utilized chemogenetic tools and viral monosynaptic circuit tracing to analyze these neuroglial connections and to examine OPC proliferation, myelination, synapse formation, and neuronal-glial connectivity after increasing or decreasing neuronal activity in vivo. We found that increasing neuronal activity increased OPC activation, but not proliferation. We also found that altering neuronal activity altered neuronal-glial synaptic connections: while it did not impact the total number of neuronal inputs, or the number of inhibitory neuronal inputs, it did alter the number of excitatory neuron to OPC connections. We also found that increasing or decreasing neuronal activity impacted the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Our data show that neuronal activity affects OPC activation, neuronal synapse formation onto OPCs, as well as the types of neuronal inputs to OPCs, indicating that neuronal activity is important for OPC circuit composition and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single neurons in thalamus and subthalamic nucleus process cardiac and respiratory signals in humans</a></h4>

              
                Visceral signals are constantly processed by our central nervous system, enable homeostatic regulation, and influence perception, emotion, and cognition. While visceral processes at cortical level have been extensively studied using non-invasive imaging techniques, very few studies have investigated how this information is processed at the single neuron level, both in humans and animals. Subcortical regions, relaying signals from peripheral interoceptors to cortical structures, are particularly understudied and how visceral information is processed in thalamic and subthalamic structures remains largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of intraoperative microelectrode recordings in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to investigate the activity of single neurons related to cardiac and respiratory functions in three subcortical regions: Ventral Intermedius nucleus (Vim) and Ventral caudalis nucleus (Vc) of the thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We report that the activity of a large portion of the recorded neurons (about 70%) was modulated by either the heartbeat, the cardiac inter-beat interval, or the respiration. These cardiac and respiratory response patterns varied largely across neurons both in terms of timing and their kind of modulation. We observed neurons with increases or decreases in firing rate in response to either the heartbeat or the inter-beat interval. Peaks of neural activity were found at different phases of the cardiac and respiratory cycles. Whereas most neurons only responded to one of the tested signals, a substantial proportion of these visceral neurons (30%) was responsive to more than one of the tested signals, underlining specialization and integration of cardiac and respiratory signals in STN and thalamic neurons. By extensively describing for the first time single unit activity related to cardiorespiratory function in thalamic and subthalamic neurons, our results highlight the major role of these subcortical regions in the processing of visceral signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brainstem fMRI signaling of surprise across different types of deviant stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect deviant stimuli is crucial to adapt our behavior. Previous work showed that infrequent (hence deviant) stimuli elicit phasic activation of the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), which releases noradrenaline and controls central arousal. However, it is unclear whether deviance detection selectively recruits the LC or also other neuromodulatory systems related to dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. It is also unclear whether deviant-related responses in those systems only track infrequent stimuli in a sequence (which can be computed with bottom-up processes), or also violations of the sequence structure (which requires higher-order processings). Here, we combined human fMRI recordings optimized for brainstem imaging with pupillometry (a peripheral marker of central arousal) to perform a mapping of deviant-related responses in subcortical structures. Participants were exposed to a local-global paradigm that distinguishes between deviance based on the stimulus probability and the sequence structure. fMRI responses to deviant stimuli were quite distributed, detected in the LC but also other subcortical nuclei and many cortical areas. Both types of deviance elicited responses in the pupil, LC and other neuromodulatory systems. Our results reveal that deviance detection in humans recruits several subcortical systems and generalizes across computationally different types of deviance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive aging and categorical representations in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                A traditional view on cognitive aging is that visual working memory (VWM) capacity declines in older adults. Recent work has shown that visual information can be stored in VWM in different forms of representations. Specifically, VWM becomes more reliant on categorical representations (e.g., a prototypical red) as compared to continuous representations (e.g., a light reddish color) as memory load increases. Here, we replicated these findings and tested whether this holds for older adults. Participants memorized one to four colors; after a delay, an arrow pointed at the location of the color that needed to be reported. We used an extended mixture model (Zhou et al., 2022) to examine the extent to which memory responses were biased in the direction of the category prototypes. Our results showed that for both younger and older adults, VWM became more biased towards category prototypes with increasing memory load. Importantly, we found no difference in the extent to which VWM was biased towards category prototypes between younger and older adults. However, older adults showed an overall lower precision as compared to younger adults. Taken together, our results demonstrated that both younger and older adults became more reliant on categorical representations with increasing memory load; importantly, the extent to which categorical representations were involved in maintaining VWM information was insensitive to age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early β-amyloid accumulation and hypoconnectivity in the default mode network are related to its disengagement from global brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Importance: The specific pattern/trajectory of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathology spreading in Alzheimer's disease (AD), from default mode network (DMN) regions to sensory-motor areas, is well known, but poorly understood. Objective: To determine if resting-state global brain activity is linked to early A{beta} deposition in the DMN. Design: This is a retrospect analysis of multi-modal and longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Setting: The ADNI was a multicenter project involving 63 research centers. Participants: The study included 144 participants (72.6 {+/-} 7.5 years; 73 females) of whom 28 were controls, 21 had significant memory concerns, 72 had cognitive impairment (N=72), and 23 had AD. There were both baseline and 2-year follow-up data for A{beta}-PET for 112 of the subjects. They were classified into following stages based on the CSF A{beta}42 (CSF+: <192 ng/L) and cortical A{beta} (PET+: >0.872 SUVR) levels: non-A{beta}-accumulators (CSF-/PET-); early-A{beta}-accumulators (CSF+/PET-); and late-A{beta}-accumulators (CSF+/PET+). Exposure: Resting-state brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), whereas glymphatic function was estimated by the coupling between fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and CSF movements. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cortical A{beta} accumulation measured by 18F-AV45 amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET), CSF A{beta}42, and total and phosphorylated tau protein levels in all participants. Results: Glymphatic function assessed by fMRI was strongly ({rho} > 0.43, P < 0.042) associated with various markers of protein aggregation in early A{beta} accumulators in whom A{beta} just begins to accumulate cortically in the DMN. Among these early accumulators, the preferential A{beta} accumulation in the DMN regions in the subsequent two years was correlated with lower gBOLD signal ({rho} = 0.51, P = 0.027) and lower local glymphatic function ({rho} = 0.48, P = 0.041) in the same regions at baseline. Conclusions and Relevance: Resting-state global brain activity and related glymphatic function are linked to A{beta} pathology, particularly its preferential deposition in the DMN at the earliest AD stages. This suggests potential novel early therapeutic directions that might provide disease modification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of Dynamic Facial Information in the Middle Dorsal Face Area</a></h4>

              
                Faces in motion reveal a plethora of information through visual dynamics. Faces can move in complex patterns while transforming facial shape, e.g. during the generation of different emotional expressions. While motion and shape processing have been studied extensively in separate research enterprises, much less is known about their conjunction during biological motion. Here we took advantage of the discovery in brain-imaging studies of an area in the dorsal portion of the macaque monkey superior temporal sulcus (STS), the middle dorsal face area (MD), with selectivity for naturalistic face motion. To gain mechanistic insights into the coding of facial motion, we recorded single-unit activity from MD, testing whether and how MD cells encode face motion. The MD population was highly sensitive to naturalistic facial motion and facial shape. Some MD cells responded only to the conjunction of facial shape and motion, others were selective for facial shape even without movement, and yet others were suppressed by facial motion. We found that this heterogeneous MD population transforms face motion into a higher-dimensional activity space, a representation that would allow for high sensitivity to relevant small-scale movements. Indeed we show that many MD cells carry such sensitivity for eye movements. We further found that MD cells encode motion of head, mouth, and eyes in a separable manner, requiring the use of multiple reference frames. Thus, MD is a bona-fide face-motion area that uses highly heterogeneous cell populations to create codes capturing even complex facial motion trajectories.

                The hallmark amyloid-{beta} and tau deposition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents only a fraction of its diverse pathophysiology. Molecular subtyping using large-scale -omic strategies can help resolve this biological heterogeneity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured ~8,000 proteins across >600 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project participants with clinical diagnoses of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. Unbiased classification of MCI and AD cases based on individual proteomic profiles resolved three classes whose expression differed across numerous cell types and biological ontologies. Two of these classes displayed molecular signatures atypical of those previously observed in AD neurodegeneration, such as elevated synaptic and decreased inflammatory markers. In one class, these atypical proteomic features were associated with clinical and pathological hallmarks of disease resilience. These results promise to better define disease heterogeneity within the cognitively impaired elderly and meaningfully impact diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic precision.

	<p>Objective: To explore whether deep medullary veins (DMVs) in the unaffected hemisphere were associated with functional outcome in acute cardioembolic stroke patients. Methods: Acute cardioembolic stroke patients at a single center were retrospectively included. DMVs visibility in the unaffected hemisphere was assessed using a well-established four-grade scoring method based on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI): grades 0&amp;amp;ndash;3 (grade 0 for no visible DMVs; grade 1 for the numbers of conspicuous DMVs &amp;amp;lt; 5; grade 2 for numbers raging from 5 to 10; grade 3 for more than 10). Patients were further divided into mild-to-moderate (grade 0&amp;amp;ndash;2) and severe DMVs (grade 3) groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at three months. Poor outcome was defined as mRS &amp;amp;ge; 3. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between DMVs grade and functional outcome. Results: A total of 170 patients were finally included. Compared with the mild-to-moderate DMVs group (149 patients), the severe DMVs group (21 patients) had higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p = 0.002), lower levels of admission systolic blood pressure (BP) (p = 0.031), and elevated rates of large infarction (p = 0.003). At three months, the severe DMVs group had higher mRS (p = 0.002). Patients in the poor outcome group (82/170, 48.2%) had older age, higher baseline NIHSS score, lower admission diastolic BP, higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation and large infarction, and an increased proportion of severe DMVs (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, multivariable regression analysis showed that the severe DMVs grade (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.830, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.266&amp;amp;ndash;26.856, p = 0.024) was significantly associated with three-month functional outcomes without interaction with other potential risk factors (p for interaction &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: DMVs grade in the unaffected hemisphere was independently associated with three-month functional outcome in acute cardioembolic stroke patients. Patients with severe DMVs were more likely to have a poor functional outcome at three months.</p>

	<p>Pituitary adenoma (PA) is the most common benign tumor of the pituitary gland. The pathogenesis of most PA is considered as a multifactorial process, that involves genetic mutations, alterations in gene transcription, and epigenetic factors. Their interaction promotes tumorigenesis. The processes are increasingly focused on changes in telomere length. Our study enrolled 126 patients with PA and 368 healthy subjects. DNA samples from peripheral blood leukocytes were purified by the DNA salting-out method. The RT-PCR carried out SNPs and relative leukocyte telomere lengths (RLTL). ELISA determined the level of TEP1 in blood serum. Binary logistic regression revealed that TERC rs35073794 is likely associated with increased odds of PA development and macro-PA development. It is also associated with decreased odds of active PA, non-invasive PA, and PA without relapse development. Also, we discovered that PA patients with at least one G allele of the TEP1 gene polymorphism rs1713418 have lower serum TEP1 levels than healthy individuals (p = 0.035). To conclude, the study revealed that TERC rs35073794 might be a potential biomarker for PA development.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to assess the retinal structural and choroidal changes in carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients and their association with cerebral hemodynamic changes. Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with unilateral CAS were enrolled in our study. Material and methods: Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) was used to image the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), while SS-OCT angiography (SS-OCTA) was used to image and measure the choroidal vascular volume (CVV) and choroidal vascular index (CVI). Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) was used to assess the cerebral perfusion parameters; relative perfusion (r) was calculated as the ratio of the value on the contralateral side to that on the ipsilateral side. Results: Compared with contralateral eyes, ipsilateral eyes showed significantly thinner RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), GCIPL (p = 0.013) and CVV (p = 0.001). Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) showed a significant correlation with RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), GCIPL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and CVI (p = 0.027), while the relative permeability surface (rPS) correlated with RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Our report suggests that retinal and choroidal changes have the potential to detect hemodynamic changes in CAS patients and could predict the risk of stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phosphorylation Determines Whether Neuroligin-3 is at Excitatory or Inhibitory Synapses in Different Regions of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuroligin-3 is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule involved in development, function, and pathologies of synapses in the brain. It is a genetic cause of autism and a potent component of the tumor microenvironment in gliomas. There are four Neuroligins that operate at distinct synapse types, selectively interacting with presynaptic adhesion and postsynaptic scaffold proteins. We investigated the subcellular localization and scaffold specificities of synaptic Neuroligin-3 and demonstrate an unexpected pattern of localization to excitatory synapses in cortical areas, and inhibitory synapses in subcortical areas. Using phosphoproteomics, we identify Neuroligin-3-specific serine phosphorylation in cortex and hippocampus that obstructs a key binding site for inhibitory synapse scaffolds. Using in utero CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and replacement with phosphomimetic mutants, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site determines excitatory versus inhibitory synapse localization of Neuroligin-3 in vivo. Our data reveal a mechanism that differentially regulates the balance of Neuroligin-3 between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, adding to our emerging understanding of their role in the development of brain connectivity and associated pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mouse primary visual cortex neurons respond to the illusory ''darker than black'' in neon color spreading.</a></h4>

              
                Illusions are a powerful tool for studying the single neuron correlates of perception. Here, we introduce the neon color spreading (NCS) illusion in mice and report the neuronal correlates of illusory brightness, which has heretofore only been studied using human fMRI. We designed a novel NCS paradigm to evoke the percept of an illusory drifting grating and analyzed the activity of 520 single units in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). A substantial proportion of V1 single units (60.5%) responded to illusory gratings with direction tuning matched to their preferred direction, which was determined using physically presented luminance-defined gratings (LDG). Moreover, by presenting LDG gratings with a 180 {degrees} phase shift relative to NCS gratings, we show that spatial phase tuning shifted 180 {degrees} for most single units. This finding conclusively demonstrates that V1 single units respond to illusory brightness. Using this novel mouse paradigm, we show that responses to illusory gratings have a lower magnitude and are delayed relative to physical gratings. We determined where V1 single units fell in the V1 cellular hierarchy (based on their susceptibility to surround suppression, their putative classification as interneuron or pyramidal neuron, and designation as a simple or complex cell) and found that higher-level V1 single units are more responsive to NCS stimuli. These findings resolve the debate of whether V1 is involved in illusory brightness processing and reveal a V1 hierarchical organization in which higher-level neurons are pivotal to the processing of illusory qualities, such as brightness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient in vivo neuronal genome editing in the mouse brain using nanocapsules containing CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins</a></h4>

              
                Genome editing of somatic cells via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) offers promise for new therapeutics to treat a variety of genetic disorders, including neurological diseases. However, the dense and complex parenchyma of the brain and the post-mitotic state of neurons make efficient genome editing challenging. In vivo delivery systems for CRISPR-Cas proteins and single guide RNA (sgRNA) include both viral vectors and non-viral strategies, each presenting different advantages and disadvantages for clinical application. We developed non-viral and biodegradable PEGylated nanocapsules (NCs) that deliver preassembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Here, we show that the RNP NCs led to robust genome editing in neurons following intracerebral injection into the mouse striatum. Genome editing was predominantly observed in medium spiny neurons (>80%), with occasional editing in cholinergic, calretinin, and parvalbumin interneurons. Glial activation was minimal and was localized along the needle tract. Our results demonstrate that the RNP NCs are capable of safe and efficient neuronal genome editing in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in gamma bursts supporting working memory development through adolescence derived from EEG spectral processing</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a stage of development characterized by neurodevelopmental specialization of cognitive processes. In particular, working memory continues to improve through adolescence, with increases in response accuracy and decreases in response latency continuing well into the twenties. Human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate that gamma oscillations (30-75 Hz) during the working memory delay period support the maintenance of mnemonic information guiding subsequent goal driven behavior, which decreases in power with development. Importantly, recent electrophysiological studies have shown that gamma bursts, and not sustained activity, reinstate working memory during the delay period. Developmental changes in gamma bursts during working memory, have not been studied. Thus, we used EEG in conjunction with a novel spectral event processing approach to investigate age-related changes in transient gamma band activity during a memory guided saccade (MGS) task in 164 10- to 30-year-olds. As expected, accuracy improved, and latency decreased with age. EEG results indicated robust age-related decreases in mean gamma power and the number of gamma band events during both the working memory delay epoch but also the fixation epoch before working memory encoding, suggesting age-related change in core aspects of information processing. Relationships between gamma events and behavior however were only evident during the working memory delay period and only during adolescence where more gamma events were associated with faster latency and trial level event variability was associated with latency variability. These results suggest a process of specialization where developmental decreases in gamma events into adulthood support working memory responses reflecting optimization of executive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Closed-loop brain stimulation to reduce pathologic fear</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive processing of trauma related memory engrams leads to dysregulated fear reactions. In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dysfunctional extinction learning prevents discretization of trauma-related memory engrams and leads to generalized fear responses. PTSD is postulated as a mnemonic-based disorder, but we lack markers or treatments targeting pathological fear memory processing. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) and concurrent neocortical oscillations are scaffolds to consolidate contextual memory, but their role during fear processing remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that closed-loop SWRs triggered neuromodulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) can enhance the consolidation of fear extinction. It modified fear memories that became resistant to induced recall (i.e., "renewal" and "reinstatement") and did not reemerge spontaneously as a PTSD-like phenotype. The effects are mediated by D2 receptor signaling induced synaptic remodeling in the basolateral amygdala. These results suggest that SWRs help consolidating fear extinction memories. Furthermore, enhancing the consolidation of extinction engrams by SWR-triggered induction of reward signals can alleviate pathologic fear reactions in a rodent model of PSTD. No adverse effects were seen, suggesting this potential therapy for PTSD and anxiety disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural plasticity of axon initial segment in spinal cord neurons underlies inflammatory pain</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent structural plasticity of axon initial segment (AIS) regulates neuronal excitability, thus fine-tuning neuronal and overall network output. Here using behavioral, immunohistochemical, electrophysiological and computational approaches, we describe the structural plasticity of AIS in rat superficial spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) neurons, which underlies inflammatory pain. We show an inflammation-mediated distal shift of the AIS away from the soma in inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons, concomitant with the peak of inflammatory pain. This AIS translocation was accompanied by a decrease in excitability of the inhibitory neurons. Following recovery from inflammatory hyperalgesia, the AIS location and neuronal excitability reversed to baseline levels. The computational model of SDH inhibitory neurons predicts that the distal shift of AIS is sufficient to decrease the intrinsic excitability of these neurons. Our results provide evidence of differential inflammation-mediated AIS plasticity, reducing the excitability of inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons and contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An intestinal sphingolipid promotes neuronal health across generations</a></h4>

              
                Maternal diet and environment can influence the neuronal health of offspring. Here, we report that diet-induced intestinal sphingolipid biosynthesis reduces adult-onset neurodegeneration intergenerationally in Caenorhabditis elegans. Feeding C. elegans with ursolic acid (UA), a natural plant product, provides neuroprotection by enhancing maternal provisioning of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) - a bioactive sphingolipid. S1P promotes neuronal health across generations by upregulating transcription of the acid ceramidase-1 (asah-1) gene in the intestine. Intergenerational intestine-to-oocyte S1P transfer is essential for promoting neuronal health and is dependent on the lipoprotein yolk receptor RME-2 (Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis-2). Spatially regulating sphingolipid biosynthesis is critical, as inappropriate asah-1 neuronal expression causes developmental axon outgrowth defects. Our results reveal that sphingolipid homeostasis impacts the development and intergenerational health of the nervous system.

	<p>Humans and rodents have sexually dimorphic immune responses, which could influence the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to a systemic inflammatory insult. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a stimulator of the innate immune system and is routinely used in animal models to study blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we examined whether inflammatory response to LPS and the associated BBB disruption differed in male and female adult rats. Rats were treated with saline or two injections of 1 mg/kg LPS and studied 24 h after the second LPS injection. Plasma isolated from trunk blood and brain tissue homogenates of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal striatum (DS), hippocampus, and cerebellum were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines using a 9-plex panel from Meso Scale Discovery. BBB disruption was analyzed with tight junction proteins claudin-5 and VE-cadherin via Western blotting and VEGF by ELISA. This allowed us to compare sex differences in the levels of individual cytokines as well as associations among cytokines and expression of tight junction proteins between the plasma and specific brain regions. Higher levels of interferon-&amp;amp;gamma;, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-13, IL-4, CXCL-1, and VEGF in the plasma were revealed compared to the brain homogenates, and higher levels of TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, and IL-5 in the PFC were seen compared with plasma and other brain regions in males. Females showed higher levels of plasma CXCL1 and VEGF compared to males, and males showed higher levels of PFC TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-6, IL-4, and VEGF compared to females. LPS induced significant increases in plasma cytokines and VEGF in both sexes. LPS did not significantly alter cytokines in brain tissue homogenates, however, it increased chemokines in the PFC, DS, and hippocampus. In the PFC, LPS produced BBB disruption, which is evident as reduced expression of claudin-5 in males and reduced expression of VE-cadherin in both sexes. Taken together, our results reveal significant sex differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in plasma and brain that were associated with BBB disruption after LPS, and validate the use of multiplex assay for plasma and brain tissue samples.</p>

	<p>The use of electroencephalography to recognize human emotions is a key technology for advancing human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interactions. This study proposes an improved deep convolutional neural network model for emotion classification using a non-end-to-end training method that combines bottom-, middle-, and top-layer convolution features. Four sets of experiments using 4500 samples were conducted to verify model performance. Simultaneously, feature visualization technology was used to extract the three-layer features obtained by the model, and a scatterplot analysis was performed. The proposed model achieved a very high accuracy of 93.7%, and the extracted features exhibited the best separability among the tested models. We found that adding redundant layers did not improve model performance, and removing the data of specific channels did not significantly reduce the classification effect of the model. These results indicate that the proposed model allows for emotion recognition with a higher accuracy and speed than the previously reported models. We believe that our approach can be implemented in various applications that require the quick and accurate identification of human emotions.</p>

	<p>Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a kind of prevalent emotional disorder following stroke that usually results in slow functional recovery and even increased mortality. We had reported that the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2R) antagonist HAMI3379 (HM3379) contributes to the improvement of neurological injury. The present study was designed to investigate the role of HM3379 in PSD-induced chronic neuroinflammation and related mechanisms in gerbils. The gerbils were subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) and spatial restraint stress to induce the PSD model. They were randomized to receive the vehicle or HM3379 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) for a consecutive 14 days. In the PSD-treated gerbils, HM3379 had noteworthy efficacy in improving the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and depression-like behaviors, including the sucrose preference test and the forced swim test. HM3379 administration significantly mitigated neuron loss, lessened TUNEL-positive neurons, and reduced the activation of microglia in the cerebral cortex. Importantly, HM3379 downregulated protein expressions of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and pyroptosis including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, interleukin-1&amp;amp;beta; (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), IL-18, cleaved gasdermin-N domain (GSDMD-N), and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC). Mechanistically, HM3379 could repress pyroptosis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stimulation. Knockdown of CysLT2R by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or overexpression of CysLT2R by lentivirus (LV)-CysLT2R could abolish or restore the anti-depression effect of HM3379. Our results demonstrated that the selective CysLT2R antagonist HM3379 has beneficial effects on PSD, partially by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis pathway.</p>

	<p>Acute or chronic exposures to pesticides have been linked to neurotoxicity and the potential development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). This study aimed to consider the neurotoxicity of three widely utilized pesticides: malathion, chlorpyrifos, and paraquat within the hippocampus (HC), corpus striatum (CS), cerebellum (CER), and cerebral cortex (CC). Neurotoxicity was evaluated at relatively low, medium, and high pesticide dosages. All pesticides inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and neuropathy target esterase (NTE) in each of the brain regions, but esterase inhibition was greatest in the HC and CS. Each of the pesticides also induced greater disruption to cellular bioenergetics within the HC and CS, and this was monitored via inhibition of mitochondrial complex enzymes I and II, reduced ATP levels, and increased lactate production. Similarly, the HC and CS were more vulnerable to redox stress, with greater inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase and increased lipid peroxidation. All pesticides induced the production of nuclear Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these results show that pesticides disrupt cellular bioenergetics and that the HC and CS are more susceptible to pesticide effects than the CER and CC.</p>

	<p>Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a chronic brain disorder that involves frequent failures of inhibitory control and relapses into methamphetamine intake. However, it remains unclear whether the impairment of inhibitory control in MUD is proactive, reactive or both. To address this issue, the current study used the conditional stop-signal task to assess proactive and reactive inhibitory control in 35 MUD patients with long-term abstinence and 35 matched healthy controls. The results showed that MUD patients with long-term abstinence had greater preparation costs than healthy controls, but did not differ in performance, implying a less efficient utilization of proactive inhibitory control. In contrast, MUD patients exhibited intact reactive inhibitory control; reactive but not proactive inhibitory control was associated with high sensation seeking in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that proactive and reactive inhibitory control may be two different important endophenotypes of addiction in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. The current study provides new insight into the uses of proactive and reactive inhibitory control to effectively evaluate and precisely treat MUD patients with long-term abstinence.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have indicated that vitamin (Vit) D deficiency is frequent in psychiatric patients, regardless of diagnostic category. We aimed to assess whether acute psychiatric relapses in inpatients was associated with Vit D deficiency compared to stabilized outpatients. The cohort (152 total patients, 75 males and 77 females) had a mean age of 47.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.4 years at admission and was grouped according to psychiatric diagnosis. Psychopathological symptom severity was assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multidimensional symptom inventory. Total calcium serum levels were measured using standard laboratory methods, while plasma levels of 25-OH-Vit D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured by automated chemiluminescence immunoassays. The psychiatric inpatient subgroup showed a significant difference in serum levels of 25-OH-Vit D and PTH (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Correlation analysis between serum levels of 25-OH-Vit D and BPRS total and subitem scores indicated a significantly negative relationship. In addition, linear regression analysis evidenced that the inpatient condition might predict low PTH and 25-OH-Vit D serum levels. Hospitalized psychiatric patients are at increased risk for Vit D deficiency regardless of their diagnostic categories. The mechanism underlying the association between acute psychiatric relapses and Vit D deficiency remains unclear. Therefore, screening for Vit D deficiency should pertain to the health assessment of patients with major psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Risk factors for hippocampal cavities in a marginally housed population</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cavities in the hippocampus are morphological variants of uncertain significance. Aberrant neurodevelopment along with vascular and inflammatory etiologies have been proposed. We sought to characterize these cavities and their potential risk factors in a marginally housed population, with high rates of viral infection, addiction, and mental illness. (1) The volume of hippocampal cavities (HCavs) is greater in this highly multimorbid population compared to the general population. (2) Conventional vascular risk factors such as greater age and systolic blood pressure are associated with higher HCav volume. (3) Nonprescribed substance-related risk factors such as stimulant use or dependence, and smoking are associated with increased HCav volume independent of vascular risk factors. This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective study. We analyzed baseline data, including medical history, physical exam, psychiatric diagnosis, and MRI from a total of 375 participants. Hippocampal cavities were defined as spaces isointense to CSF on T1 MRI sequences, bounded on all sides by hippocampal tissue, with a volume of at least 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Risk factors were evaluated using negative binomial multiple regression. Stimulant use was reported by 87.3% of participants, with stimulant dependence diagnosed in 83.3% of participants. Prevalence of cavities was 71.6%, with a mean total bilateral HCav volume of 13.89 mm<sup>3</sup>. On average, a 1 mmHg greater systolic blood pressure was associated with a 2.17% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [0.57%, 3.79%], p = .0076), while each cigarette smoked per day trended toward a 2.69% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [−0.87%, 5.54%], p = .058). A diagnosis of stimulant dependence was associated with a 95.6% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [5.39%, 263.19%], p = .0335). Hypertension and diagnosis of stimulant dependence were associated with a greater total volume of HCav.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Debate continues regarding the possible role of the hippocampus across short-term and working memory tasks. The current study examined the possibility of a hippocampal contribution to precise, high-resolution cognition and conjunctive memory. We administered visual working memory tasks featuring a continuous response component to a well-established developmental amnesic patient with relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage (Jon) and healthy controls. The patient was able to produce highly accurate response judgments regarding conjunctions of color and orientation or color and location, using simultaneous or sequential presentation of stimuli, with no evidence of any impairment in working memory binding, categorical accuracy, or continuous precision. These findings indicate that hippocampal damage does not necessarily lead to deficits in high-resolution cognitive performance, even when the damage is severe and bilateral.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Episodic memory binds the spatial and temporal relationships between the elements of experience. The hippocampus encodes space through place cells that fire at specific spatial locations. Similarly, time cells fire sequentially at specific time points within a temporally organized experience. Recent studies in rodents, monkeys, and humans have identified time cells with discrete firing fields and cells with monotonically changing activity in supporting the temporal organization of events across multiple timescales. Using in vivo electrophysiological tetrode recordings, we simultaneously recorded neurons from the prefrontal cortex and dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus while rats performed a delayed match to sample task. During the treadmill mnemonic delay, hippocampal time cells exhibited sparser firing fields with decreasing resolution over time, consistent with previous results. In comparison, temporally modulated cells in the prefrontal cortex showed more monotonically changing firing rates, ramping up or decaying with the passage of time, and exhibited greater temporal precision for Bayesian decoding of time at long time lags. These time cells show exquisite temporal resolution both in their firing fields and in the fine timing of spikes relative to the phase of theta oscillations. Here, we report evidence of theta phase precession in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the temporal delay, however, hippocampal cells exhibited steeper phase precession slopes and more punctate time fields. To disentangle whether time cell activity reflects elapsed time or distance traveled, we varied the treadmill running speed on each trial. While many neurons contained multiplexed representations of time and distance, both regions were more strongly influenced by time than distance. Overall, these results demonstrate the flexible integration of spatiotemporal dimensions and reveal complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in supporting memory-guided behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">MeCP2 loss‐of‐function dysregulates microRNAs regionally and disrupts excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmission balance</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females primarily caused by loss of function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MeCP2. Loss of MeCP2 leads to a host of synaptic phenotypes that are believed to underlie Rett syndrome pathophysiology. Synaptic deficits vary by brain region upon MeCP2 loss, suggesting distinct molecular alterations leading to disparate synaptic outcomes. In this study, we examined the contribution of MeCP2's newly described role in miRNA regulation to regional molecular and synaptic impairments. Two miRNAs, miR-101a and miR-203, were identified and confirmed as upregulated in MeCP2 KO mice in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. miR-101a overexpression in hippocampal cultures led to opposing effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and in spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission, revealing the potential for a single miRNA to broadly regulate synapse function in the hippocampus. These results highlight the importance of regional alterations in miRNA expression and the specific impact on synaptic function with potential implications for Rett syndrome.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to discriminate between one's own and others' body parts can be lost after brain damage, as in patients who misidentify someone else's hand as their own (pathological embodiment). Surprisingly, these patients do not use visual information to discriminate between the own and the alien hand. We asked whether this impaired visual discrimination emerges only in the ecological evaluation when the pathological embodiment is triggered by the physical alien hand (the examiner's one) or whether it emerges also when hand images are displayed on a screen. Forty right brain-damaged patients, with (E+ = 20) and without (E− = 20) pathological embodiment, and 24 healthy controls underwent two tasks in which stimuli depicting self and other hands was adopted. In the Implicit task, where participants judged which of two images matched a central target, the self-advantage (better performance with Self than Other stimuli) selectively emerges in controls, but not in patients. Moreover, E+ patients show a significantly lower performance with respect to both controls and E− patients, whereas E− patients were comparable to controls. In the Explicit task, where participants judged which stimuli belonged to themselves, both E− and E+ patients performed worst when compared to controls, but only E+ patients hyper-attributed others' hand to themselves (i.e., false alarms) as observed during the ecological evaluation. The VLSM revealed that SLF damage was significantly associated with the tendency of committing false alarm errors. We demonstrate that, in E+ patients, the ability to visually recognize the own body is lost, at both implicit and explicit level.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Foundations and implications of astrocyte heterogeneity during brain development and disease</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play crucial roles in regulating brain circuit formation and physiology. Recent technological advances have revealed unprecedented levels of astrocyte diversity encompassing molecular, morphological, and functional differences. This diversification is initiated during embryonic specification events and (in rodents) continues into the early postnatal period where it overlaps with peak synapse development and circuit refinement. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest astrocyte diversity both influences and is a consequence of molecular crosstalk among developing astrocytes and other cell types, notably neurons and their synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration and identification of a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.</a></h4>

              
                The gut brain axis is thought to play a role in behavior and physiological responses through chemical, immunological, and metabolite signaling. Antibiotics, diet, and drugs can alter the transit time of gut contents as well as the makeup of the microbiome. Heterogeneity in genetics and environment are also well-known factors involved in the initiation and perpetuation of substance use disorders. Few viable genetic or biological markers are available to identify individuals who are at risk of escalating opioid intake. Primarily, the addiction field has focused on the nervous system, limiting the discovery of peripheral factors that contribute to addiction. To address this gap, we characterized the microbiome before and after drug exposure, and after antibiotics depletion in male and female heterogenous stock rats to determine if microbiome constituents are protective of escalation. We hypothesized that individuals that are prone to escalation of opioid self-administration will have distinct microbial and metabolic profiles. The fecal microbiome and behavioral responses were measured over several weeks of oxycodone self-administration and after antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by depleting microbes that ferment fiber into these essential signaling molecules for the gut-brain axis. Depletion of the microbiome increased oxycodone self-administration in a subpopulation of animals (Responders). Supplementation of SCFAs in antibiotic depleted animals decreased elevated oxycodone self-administration. Phylogenetic functional analysis reveals distinct metabolic differences in the subpopulations of animals that are sensitive to antibiotic depletion and animals rescued by SCFA supplementation. In conclusion, this study identifies pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration, demonstrates that escalation of oxycodone self-administration dysregulates the microbiome and metabolic landscape, and identifies a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of individual differences in response to methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in animal models of opioid use disorder</a></h4>

              
                RationaleCurrent medications for opioid use disorder include buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. While these medications show significant efficacy in reducing craving and opioid use, there are substantial individual differences in response to these treatments in humans. The reason for such difference is poorly known.

ObjectivesHere, we tested the hypothesis that similar individual differences may be observed in a large population of heterogenous stock rats, that have been bred to maximize genetic diversity, using a behavioral paradigm relevant to opioid use disorder.

MethodsOver 500 rats were given intermittent (4d/week) and extended access (12h/day) to oxycodone self-administration for 14 sessions to establish oxycodone dependence and escalation of intake. We then measured the effect of buprenorphine (0.5mg/kg), methadone (3mg/kg) and naltrexone (3mg/kg) on the motivation to self-administer oxycodone by using a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement.

ResultsWe found that naltrexone and buprenorphine significantly decreased motivation to oxycodone rewards. While naltrexone reduced oxycodone intake in both males and females, systemic administration with buprenorphine reduced progressive ratio responses only in males. Methadone reduced motivation to oxycodone self-administration in nearly 25% of the population, without reaching statical significance. Our results showed that the efficacy of these medications depends on the severity of addiction like behaviors, indicated by the addiction index.

ConclusionsThese results demonstrate individual differences in response to medications to treat opioid use disorder in a genetically diverse population of rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential effects of oxytocin receptor antagonist on social rank and other social behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social rank within a group is essential for survival in many animals. Rank in the community helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts and establish stable relationships with others. Recently, oxytocin has received increasing attention for its function in social behavior. However, the causal relationship between oxytocin levels and social rank has remained unclear. Here, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist L-368-899 on (1) social rank, (2) sex preference, and (3) dyadic interaction in male mice. In the tube test, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist had no effect on first-place mice, but caused rank fluctuation of the social rank in second-place mice, suggesting that the function of oxytocin in the maintenance of the social rank is rank-dependent. Second, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist dose-dependently impaired the sex preference of the male mice, confirming that oxytocin is essential in sexual behavior. Third, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist had no effect on the dyadic interaction between the male mice, suggesting that oxytocin is not necessary in direct social interaction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the role of the oxytocin in male mice is limited to a specific context of social behavior.

HighlightsO_LIThe stable social rank of the male mice in their cages was clearly observed in the tube test.
C_LIO_LIAdministration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist to first-place mice caused no change in social rank.
C_LIO_LIAdministration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist to second-place mice caused changes in social rank in some groups.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions modulate electrically evoked EEG responses in mice</a></h4>

              
                Perturbational complexity analysis predicts the presence of consciousness in humans by stimulating the brain with a brief pulse, recording cortical responses with electroencephalography (EEG), and measuring their spatiotemporal complexity. Measures reflecting perturbational complexity are low when consciousness vanishes in deep sleep, general anesthesia, or after widespread brain damage, and are high during wake, dreaming sleep and after recovery from brain injury. Here we examine the neural circuits underlying perturbational complexity in a mouse model by directly stimulating the cortex and recording high-density EEG, as well as spiking activity throughout the cortico-thalamo-cortical system with up to three Neuropixels probes, while subjects are awake or anesthetized via isoflurane. We find that when the mouse is awake, stimulation of deep cortical layers reliably evokes locally a brief pulse of excitation, followed by a bi-phasic sequence of a 120 ms profound off period and a rebound excitation. A similar pattern of spiking activity, some of which can be attributed to burst spiking, is seen in the connected thalamic nuclei. These spiking patterns are associated with a pronounced late component in the evoked EEG. We infer that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions drive the long-lasting evoked EEG signals elicited by deep cortical stimulation during the awake state. The cortical and thalamic off period and rebound excitation, as well as the late component in the EEG, are reduced in running mice and are absent in animals anesthetized with isoflurane. This is also mirrored in the perturbational complexity indices computed during quiet wakefulness, running, and anesthetized states. Taken together, these results suggest that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions contribute to ongoing activity in the conscious state that leads to highly complex global responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity manifolds and ion-channel degeneracy govern circadian oscillations of neuronal intrinsic properties in the suprachiasmatic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Motivation and methods: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock of the mammalian brain that sustains a neural code for circadian time through oscillations in the firing rate of constituent neurons. These cell-autonomous oscillations in intrinsic properties are mediated by plasticity in a subset of ion-channels expressed in SCN neurons and are maintained despite widespread neuron-to-neuron variability in ion channel expression profiles. How do SCN neurons undergo stable transitions and maintain precision in intrinsic properties spanning the day-night cycle if several ion channels change concomitantly in a heterogeneous neuronal population? Here, we address this important question using unbiased stochastic searches on the parametric and the plasticity spaces using populations of SCN models, each explored for multiple valid transitions spanning one complete circadian cycle (day-to-night followed by night-to-day transitions). Results: Our analyses provided three fundamental insights about the impact of heterogeneities on the circadian oscillations of SCN intrinsic properties. First, SCN neurons could achieve signature electrophysiological characteristics (day-like or night-like) despite pronounced heterogeneity in ion channel conductances, with weak pairwise correlations between their conductance values. This ion-channel degeneracy precluded the need to maintain precise ion-channel expression profiles for achieving characteristic electrophysiological signatures of SCN neurons, thus allowing for parametric heterogeneities despite functional precision. Second, it was not essential that specific conductances had to change by precise values for obtaining valid day-to-night or night-to-day transitions. This plasticity degeneracy, the ability of disparate combinations of ion-channel plasticity to yield the same functional transition, confers flexibility on individual neurons to take one of several routes to achieve valid transitions. Finally, we performed nonlinear dimensionality reduction analyses on the valid plasticity spaces and found the manifestation of a low-dimensional plasticity manifold in day-to-night transitions, but not in night-to-day transitions. These observations demonstrated that the concomitant changes in multiple ion channels are not arbitrary, but follow a structured plasticity manifold that provides a substrate for stability in achieving stable circadian oscillations. Implications: Our analyses unveil an elegant substrate, involving a synthesis of the degeneracy and the plasticity manifold frameworks, to effectuate stable circadian oscillations in a heterogeneous population of SCN neurons. Within this framework, the ability of multiple ion channels to change concomitantly provides robustness and flexibility to effectively achieve precise transitions despite widespread heterogeneities in ion-channel expression and plasticity.

                Brain lifespan trajectories of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in social cognition (SC) provide comprehensive insight and effective reference for normal development and clinical intervention. Unfortunately, for a lack of lifespan samples, the neural mechanism underlying SC in a lifespan developmental perspective is largely unknown, though relative behavior evidence has been investigated well. We, based on common functional networks, aim to map out voxel-wise iFC features between the SC networks and the entire cerebral cortex and further chart its corresponding trajectory patterns across the lifespan. Three networks, namely moral cognition, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy, are chosen as representatives of core SC networks. NKI-RS Enhanced (N = 316, ages 8-83 years old) dataset is selected as a lifespan resting-state fMRI dataset to delineate iFC characteristics and construct developmental trajectories. The result shows that the SC networks represent dissociable and network-specific connectivity profiles. Empathy network, as the most age-related susceptible network, shows a linear up trend with dorsal attention network, a linear decrease with ventral attention network, and a quadric-concave with somatomotor and dorsal attention networks. In addition, the sex effect is also discovered in empathy network, which exhibits linear and quadric gender differences with frontoparietal and vision networks respectively. ToM network follows a pronounced quadric-convex (inverted U-shape) trajectory with ventral attention network. No linear and quadric trajectory is found in moral cognition network. These findings indicate that SC networks display a wide range of iFC both with the fundamental networks (e.g., somatomotor, vision) and advanced networks (e.g., attention and control) in specific developmental trajectories, which will provide a better understanding of SC neural mechanism and life-span developmental trajectories also give valuable references for SC abnormal detection and effective therapy.

                Sign-tracking rats show enhanced cue sensitivity before drug experience that predicts greater discrete cue-induced drug-seeking compared to goal-tracking or intermediate- rats. Cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus Accumbens (NAc) is a neurobiological signature of sign-tracking behaviors. Here, we examine a critical regulator of the dopamine system; endocannabinoids, which bind the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to control cue-evoked striatal dopamine levels. We use cell-type specific optogenetics, intra-VTA pharmacology and fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that VTA CB1R receptor signaling regulates NAc dopamine levels to control sign-tracking. We trained rats in a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task (PLA) to determine their tracking groups before testing the effect of VTA to NAc dopamine inhibition. We found this circuit is critical for mediating the vigor of the ST response. Upstream of this circuit, intra-VTA infusions of rimonabant, a CB1R inverse agonist, during PLA decrease lever and increase foodcup approach in sign-tracking rats. Using fiber photometry to measure fluorescent signals from dopamine sensor, GRABDA, we tested the effects of intra-VTA rimonabant on NAc dopamine dynamics during autoshaping. We found that intra-VTA rimonabant-induced decreases in sign-tracking behaviors are not associated with changes to phasic cue(CS)-evoked NAc dopamine activity. Instead, intra-VTA rimonabant increases NAc shell, but not core, dopamine levels during reward delivery (US). Our results suggest that CB1R signaling in the VTA influences the balance between the CS- and US-evoked dopamine responses in the NAc shell and biases behavioral responding to cues in sign-tracking rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptome profiling implicates a role for Wnt signaling during epileptogenesis in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Mesial Temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures initiating in the hippocampus. mTLE can develop after exposure to risk factors such as seizure, trauma, and infection. Within the latent period between exposure and onset of recurrent seizures, pathological remodeling events occur which are believed to contribute to epileptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms responsible for epileptogenesis in the seizure network are currently unclear. We used the mouse intrahippocampal kainate model of mTLE to investigate transcriptional dysregulation in the ipsilateral-injected epileptogenic zone (EZ), and contralateral peri-ictal zone (PIZ) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus during the first 14-days after induction of status epilepticus (SE). DG were micro-dissected 3, 7 and 14-days after SE for high-throughput RNA-sequencing. In the EZ, dynamic transcriptional dysregulation was evident over 2-weeks with early expression of genes representing cell signaling, migration and proliferation. In the PIZ, gene dysregulation was most prominent at 3-days in similar domains. Inflammatory gene groups were also prominent over the 2-week epileptogenic period in the EZ and PIZ. We uncovered that the Wnt signaling pathway was dysregulated in the EZ and PIZ at 3-days and we validated these changes via immunohistochemistry. This suggests that critical gene changes occur early after neurological insult and that canonical Wnt signaling may play a role within this latent period. These findings offer new insights into gene expression changes that occur in the hippocampal DG early after SE and may help to identify novel therapeutic targets that could prevent epileptogenesis.

Significance statementMesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a severe life-threatening condition that is often medically refractory. While risk factors for the delayed development of mTLE are well-known, there are currently no therapeutic interventions that prevent epileptogenesis. Knowledge of the gene dysregulation events that occur during the latent period between exposure and epilepsy is critical to understanding epileptogenesis and developing new therapies. We utilized a mouse model of adult focal mTLE, the most common form of adult clinical epilepsy, and investigated transcriptional changes in the dentate gyrus during the first 2-weeks after status epilepticus. These data provide new insights into specific gene changes and pathways within different regions of the seizure network that could be targeted to prevent the development of epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Morphological evaluation of rat cerebellum following administration of nitrogen monoxide precursor and inhibitor</a></h4>

              
                In this study, the quantitative and qualitative effects of nitrogen monoxide on cerebellar histopathology, by increasing or decreasing in vivo production of this substance, were investigated. In this study, forty Wistar female rats (RAT) with a weight of about 200 to 250 grams and an average age of eight weeks were used. Rats were divided into five groups of eight, including control groups, normal saline, L-NAME, L-Arginine, L-NAME + L-Arginine. On the third, fourth and fifth days, the injection was performed intraperitoneally and on the eighteenth day, after anesthesia with ether and then craniotomy, the brain and cerebellum of the animals were removed and After quantitative measurements including weight and volume, organs were fixed in 10% formalin and after tissue preparation steps, to prepare the slide, sections with a thickness of 5 to 6 microns were prepared from the samples and by general method such as Hematoxylin-eosin and special techniques like Mason trichrome and toluidine blue were stained and evaluated. The results of this study show that in the case of cerebellum, there is no significant difference in the quantitative weight parameter between the control groups, normal saline, L-Arg, L-NAME and L-NAME + L-Arg groups. Regarding the volume parameter, a significant increase (P <0.01) was observed in L-Arg group compared to L-NAME, L-Arg + L-NAME and normal saline groups. In microscopic qualitative parameters, the most changes in the L-Arg group were seen as follows: The granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum became slightly thickened, some of the nuclei in the granular and molecular layers became severely hyperchromatized, and Purkinje cell accumulation was seen with lymphocytic invasion. In the other groups, there were no significant changes. It is inferred from this study that L-Arginine can cause histopathological changes in cerebellar tissue by increasing NO levels in cerebellum. However, in this study, unlike other similar studies, L-NAME injection did not cause significant histopathological change.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A large-scale brain network of species-specific dynamic human body perception</a></h4>

              
                This ultrahigh field 7T fMRI study addressed the question of whether there exists a core network of brain areas at the service of different aspects of body perception. Participants viewed naturalistic videos of monkey and human faces, bodies, and objects along with mosaic-scrambled videos for control of low-level features. ICA-based network analysis was conducted to find body and species modulations at both the voxel and the network levels. Among the body areas, the highest species selectivity was found in the middle frontal gyrus and amygdala. Two large-scale networks were highly selective to bodies, dominated by the lateral occipital cortex and right superior temporal sulcus (STS) respectively. The right STS network showed high species selectivity, and its significant human body-induced node connectivity was focused around the extrastriate body area (EBA), STS, temporoparietal junction (TPJ), premotor cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The human body-specific network discovered here may serve as a brain-wide internal model of the human body serving as an entry point for a variety of processes relying on body descriptions as part of their more specific categorization, action, or expression recognition functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FT-GO: a multiplex fluorescent tyramide signal amplification system for histochemical analysis</a></h4>

              
                Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) is a highly sensitive method for histochemical analysis. Previously, we reported a TSA system, BT-GO, for bright-filed imaging. Here, we develop FT-GO (Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase) as a multiplex fluorescent TSA system. FT-GO involves peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of FT with hydrogen peroxide produced in enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase. We showed that FT-GO enhanced immunofluorescence signals while maintaining low background signals. Compared with indirect immunofluorescence detections, FT-GO demonstrated a more widespread distribution of monoaminergic projection systems in mouse and marmoset brains. For multiplex labeling with FT-GO, we quenched Ab-conjugated peroxidase using sodium azide. We applied FT-GO to multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization, and succeeded in labeling neocortical interneuron subtypes by coupling with immunofluorescence. FT-GO immunofluorescence further increased the detectability of an adeno-associated virus tracer. Given its simplicity and a staining with a high signal-to-noise ratio, FT-GO would provide a versatile platform for histochemical analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical surface electrical potentials are composed of multiple bandlimited frequency components, including high-gamma</a></h4>

              
                A common challenge in neuroscience is how to decompose noisy, multi-source signals measured in experiments into biophysically interpretable components. Analysis of cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs) measured using electrocorticography arrays (ECoG) typifies this problem. We hypothesized that high frequency (70-1,000 Hz) CSEPs are composed of broadband (i.e., power-law) and bandlimited components with potentially differing biophysical origins. In particular, the high-gamma band (70-150 Hz) has been shown to be highly predictive for encoding and decoding behaviors and stimuli. Despite its demonstrated importance, whether high-gamma is composed of a bandlimited signal is poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded CSEPs from rat auditory cortex and demonstrate that the evoked CSEPs are composed of multiple distinct frequency components, including high-gamma. We then show, using a novel robust regression method, that at fast timescales and on single trials during speech production, human high-gamma amplitude cannot be explained by a modulating power-law component; thus, high-gamma is band-limited. Furthermore, we show that the power-law component is less predictive of produced speech compared to the raw high-gamma amplitude. Finally, we show that the largest variance component of human ECoG signals is low-frequency and band-limited, not broadband. Together these results demonstrate that there are multiple, band-limited components of high frequency power in cortical surface electrical potentials, including the high-gamma band, which may have different biophysical origins.

Significance StatementElectrocortigraphy (ECoG) records cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs). ECoG is utilized in both humans and animal models to understand distributed cortical processing and for brain machine interfaces. The spectral structure of evoked CSEPs is greatly debated. To address this issue, we recorded from rat auditory cortex using {micro}ECoG and human ventral sensory-motor cortex during speech production with high-density ECoG. Using novel analytic approaches, we found that evoked CSEPs are composed of multiple band-limited components, including high-gamma. These results contrast with the dominant thinking in the field that the high-frequency power in ECoG is broadband. Our results raise the possibility that distinct frequency components of ECoG are biomarkers of processing in different cortical layers.

                Despite continuation of some controversies, Alzheimers disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia nowadays, has been widely believed to derive mainly from excessive {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) aggregation, that would increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce neuroinflammation, leading to neuron loss and cognitive impairment. Existing drugs on A{beta} have been ineffective or offer only temporary relief at best, due to blood-brain barrier or severe side effects. The study employed thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) as an alternative AD therapy and compared its effect with continuous hyperthermia (HT) in vivo. It established an AD mice model via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35, proving that TC-HT is much more effective in alleviating its performance decline in Y-maze and NOR test, in comparison with HT. In addition, TC-HT also exhibits a better performance in decreasing the hippocampal A{beta} and BACE1 expressions as well as the neuroinflammation markers Iba-1 and GFAP levels. Furthermore, the study finds that TC-HT can elevate more protein expressions of IDE and antioxidative enzyme SOD2 than HT. Besides, after establishment of neuroprotective mechanism, removal of TC-HT-induced ROS can further augment protection of neural cells against A{beta}. In sum, the study proves the potential of TC-HT in AD treatment, which can be put into clinical application with the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical grey matter mediates increases in model-based control and learning from positive feedback from adolescence to adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Adolescents undergo maturation in cognition and brain structure. Model-based (MB) control is known to increase from childhood to young adulthood, which is mediated by cognitive abilities. Here, we asked two questions unaddressed in previous developmental studies: Firstly, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Secondly, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A developmental sample (n=103, age: 12-42) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive vs. negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that grey matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. While motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in learning from positive feedback was mediated by reduced GMD in the parietal, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that efficient brain maturation, as putatively reflected in lower GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions is a key developmental step towards age-related increases in planning and value-based choice.

Significance StatementAdolescents undergo extensive maturation in cognition and brain structure. Interestingly, model-based decision-making is also known to increase from childhood to adulthood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that grey matter density in the parietal cortex mediates an age-dependent increase in model-based control. An age-related increase in positive feedback learning was mediated by reduced grey matter density in the parietal, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, a manipulation of motivational context (gain reward vs. avoid punishment) did not impact age-related changes in model-based control. These findings highlight that efficient brain maturation in distinct and overlapping cortical brain regions constitutes a key developmental step towards increases in model-based planning and value-based choice.

                Summary ParagraphBiomarkers of behavior and psychiatric illness for cognitive and clinical neuroscience remain out of reach1-4. Suboptimal reliability of biological measurements, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is increasingly cited as a primary culprit for discouragingly large sample size requirements and poor reproducibility of brain-based biomarker discovery1,5-7. In response, steps are being taken towards optimizing MRI reliability and increasing sample sizes8-11, though this will not be enough. Optimizing biological measurement reliability and increasing sample sizes are necessary but insufficient steps for biomarker discovery; this focus has overlooked the  other side of the equation - the reliability of clinical and cognitive assessments - which are often suboptimal or unassessed. Through a combination of simulation analysis and empirical studies using neuroimaging data, we demonstrate that the joint reliability of both biological and clinical/cognitive phenotypic measurements must be optimized in order to ensure biomarkers are reproducible and accurate. Even with best-case scenario high reliability neuroimaging measurements and large sample sizes, we show that suboptimal reliability of phenotypic data (i.e., clinical diagnosis, behavioral and cognitive measurements) will continue to impede meaningful biomarker discovery for the field. Improving reliability through development of novel assessments of phenotypic variation is needed, but it is not the sole solution. We emphasize the potential to improve the reliability of established phenotypic methods through aggregation across multiple raters and/or measurements12-15, which is becoming increasingly feasible with recent innovations in data acquisition (e.g., web- and smart-phone-based administration, ecological momentary assessment, burst sampling, wearable devices, multimodal recordings)16-20. We demonstrate that such aggregation can achieve better biomarker discovery for a fraction of the cost engendered by large-scale samples. Although the current study has been motivated by ongoing developments in neuroimaging, the prioritization of reliable phenotyping will revolutionize neurobiological and clinical endeavors that are focused on brain and behavior.

                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often applied to the motor cortex to stimulate a collection of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in groups of peripheral muscles. The causal interface between TMS and MEP is the selective activation of the neurons in the motor cortex; moving the TMS 'spot' around over the motor cortex causes different MEP responses. A question of interest is whether a collection of MEP responses can be used to identify the stimulated locations on the cortex, which could potentially be used to then place the TMS coil to produce chosen sets of MEPs. In this work we leverage our previous report on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that predicted MEPs from the induced electric field, to tackle an inverse imaging task in which we start with the MEPs and estimate the stimulated regions on the motor cortex. We present and evaluate five different inverse imaging CNN architectures, both conventional and variational, in terms of several measures of reconstruction accuracy. We found that one architecture, which we denote as M2M-InvNet, consistently achieved the best performance.

                Understanding object representations requires a broad, comprehensive sampling of the objects in our visual world with dense measurements of brain activity and behavior. Here we present THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale datasets comprising functional MRI, magnetoencephalographic recordings, and 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of photographic images for up to 1,854 object concepts. THINGS-data is unique in its breadth of richly-annotated objects, allowing for testing countless hypotheses at scale while assessing the reproducibility of previous findings. Beyond the unique insights promised by each individual dataset, the multimodality of THINGS-data allows combining datasets for a much broader view into object processing than previously possible. Our analyses demonstrate the high quality of the datasets and provide five examples of hypothesis-driven and data-driven applications. THINGS-data constitutes the core release of the THINGS initiative (https://things-initiative.org) for bridging the gap between disciplines and the advancement of cognitive neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kv2 conductances are not required for C-bouton mediated enhancement of motoneuron output</a></h4>

              
                Neural motor systems have evolved complex circuits that afford animals a range 1 of behaviours essential for survival. C-bouton synapses arising from cholinergic V0C interneurons amplify motoneuron activity via muscarine type 2 receptors, thus increasing muscle contraction force. Recent work in neonatal mouse motoneurons suggests that delayed rectifier currents carried by post-synaptically clustered KV2.1 channels are crucial to C-bouton amplification. Here we use a motoneuron conditional KV2.1 knockout to show that while KV2.1 modulates maximal firing in neonatal mice, its removal minimally affects either mature motoneuron firing or the enhanced firing rates in response to exogenously applied muscarine. In keeping with this, pharmacological blockade of KV2 currents has minimal electrophysiological effects on mature motoneurons. Furthermore, amplification of electromyography activity during high force tasks was unchanged following KV2.1 deletion. We next show that KV2.2 is also expressed by spinal motoneurons and colocalises with KV2.1 opposite C-boutons. We suggest that the primary function of KV2 proteins -- KV2.1 and KV2.2 -- is non-conducting in motoneurons, and that KV2.2 can function in the absence of KV2.1, perhaps to ensure the integrity of the synapse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal in vivo monitoring of axonal integrity after brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury-induced axonal degeneration leads to acute and chronic neuropsychiatric impairment, neuronal death, and accelerated neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Thus, there is much interest in developing treatments that protect axons after injury. For this endeavor, extended comprehensive evaluation of axonal integrity in experimental systems is required to evaluate the efficacy of putative interventions in preclinical models. However, traditional histological tissue proccessing techniques are logistically prohibitive for assessments of long-term pathology. Here, we report a new method of longitudinally monitoring the functional activity of thalamocortical axons before and after injury in vivo in the same animal over an extended period of time. Specifically, we expressed an axonal-targeting genetically-encoded calcium indicator in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and then recorded axonal activity patterns in the visual cortex in response to visual stimulation. We demonstrate the utility of this method for assessing in vivo aberrant axonal activity patterns after traumatic brain injury, as well as for evaluating the therapuetic efficacy of the neuroprotective P7C3-A20 pharmacologic agent in vivo. We found that P7C3-A20 treatment minimized most, but not all, of the pathological changes in axonal activity patterns after traumatic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural substrates of body ownership and agency during voluntary movement</a></h4>

              
                Body ownership and the sense of agency are two central aspects of bodily self-consciousness. While multiple neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of body ownership and agency in isolation, few have investigated their relationship during voluntary movement when such experiences naturally combine. By eliciting the moving rubber hand illusion with active or passive finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated activations reflecting the sense of body ownership and agency, respectively, as well as their interaction, and assessed their overlap and anatomical segregation. We found that perceived hand ownership was associated with activity in premotor, posterior parietal and cerebellar regions whereas the sense of agency over the hand's movements was related to activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and superior temporal cortex. Moreover, one section of the dorsal premotor cortex showed overlapping activity for ownership and agency, and somatosensory cortical activity reflected the interaction of ownership and agency with higher activity when both agency and ownership was experienced. We further found that activations previously attributed to agency in the left insular cortex and right temporoparietal junction reflected the synchrony or asynchrony of the visuo-proprioceptive stimuli rather than agency. Collectively, these results identify the neural bases of agency and ownership during voluntary movement. Although the neural representations of these two experiences are largely distinct, there are functional neuroanatomical overlap and interactions during their combination, which has bearing on theories on bodily self-consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain fingerprint is based on the aperiodic, scale-free, neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The possibility to identify subjects from their brain activity was met enthusiastically, as it bears the possibility to individualize brain analyses. However, the nature of the processes generating subject-specific features remains unknown, as the literature does not point to specific mechanisms. In particular, most of the current literature uses techniques that are based on the assumption of stationarity (e.g. Pearson's correlation), which do not hypothesize any mechanisms, and crashes against a large body of literature showing the complex, highly non-linear nature of brain activity. In this paper, we hypothesize that intermittent moments when large, non-linear perturbations spread across the brain (defined as neuronal avalanches in the context of critical dynamics) are the ones that carry subject-specific information, and that contribute the most to identifiability. To test this hypothesis, we apply the recently-developed avalanche transition matrix (ATM) to source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic data, as to characterize subject-speficic fast dynamics. Then, we perform identifiability analysis based on the ATMs, and compared the performance to more classical ways of estimating large-scale connections (which assume stationareity). We demonstrate that selecting the moments and places where neuronal avalanches spread improves identifiability (p<0.0001, permutation testing), despite the fact that most ot the data (i.e. the linear part) are discarded. Our results show that the non-linear part of the brain signals carries most of the subject-specific information, shading light on the nature of the processes that underlie subject-identifiability. Borrowing from statistical mechanics, a solid branch of physics, we provide a principled way to link emergent large-scale personalized activations to non-observable, microscopic processes.

                Like many other animals, insects are capable of returning to previously visited locations using path integration. Recently, Drosophila has been added to the list of insects thought capable of this navigational memory. Existing experimental evidence, however, has a potential confound. Here we show that pheromones deposited at the site of reward might enable flies to find previously rewarding locations even without memory. Thus, we designed an experiment to determine if flies can use path integration memory despite potential pheromonal cues by displacing the flies shortly after an optogenetic reward. We found that rewarded flies returned to the location predicted by a memory-based model. Several analyses are consistent with path integration as the mechanism by which flies returned to the reward. We conclude that while pheromones may often be important in fly navigation and must be carefully controlled in future experiments, Drosophila may indeed be capable of performing path integration.

                There is increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in psychiatric disorders. In common with other serotonergic psychedelics, psilocybin is thought to act via the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Serotonin is the endogenous ligand of 5-HTR. In rodents, the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and psilocybin, induce a characteristic head twitch response (HTR), which is correlated with the human psychedelic trip in intensity and duration. We examined the role of other serotonergic receptors and the trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in modulating HTR induced by 5-HTP and psilocybin. Male C57BL/6J mice (11 weeks old, ~30g) were administered 5-HTP, 50-250 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) or 200 mg/kg i.p. after pretreatment with 5-HT/TAAR1 receptor modulators. Psilocybin was administered at 0.1-51.2 mg/kg i.p. or at 4.4 mg/kg i.p. preceded by 5-HT/TAAR1 receptor modulators. HTR was assessed in a custom-built magnetometer. 5-HTP and psilocybin induced a dose dependent increase in the frequency of HTR over 20 minutes with attenuation by the 5-HT2AR antagonist, M100907 (volanserin), and the 5-HT1AR agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. The 5-HT2CR antagonist, RS102221, enhanced HTR at lower doses but reduced it at higher doses for 5-HTP and psilocybin. The TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB, reduced 5-HTP- but not psilocybin-induced HTR. We have confirmed the key role of 5-HT2AR in HTR and have demonstrated an effect of 5-HT1AR and a bimodal contribution of 5-HT2CR as well as a role of TAAR1 in modulating HTR induced by 5-HTP. Compounds that modulate HTR induced by psychedelics have a potentially important role in the emerging therapeutic use of these compounds.

                Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions each year. Most PD cases (90%) are sporadic, resulting from the age-dependent accumulation of pathogenic effects. One key pathological hallmark of PD progression is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (-syn), which has been shown to negatively affect neuronal function and viability. Here, using 3- and 6-month-old Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice over expressing human -syn (PD model), we show that loss of NRF2 increases markers of ferroptosis across PD-relevant brain regions Increased ferroptosis was associated with an age- and genotype-dependent increase in -syn pathology and behavioral deficits. Finally, we demonstrate that -syn over expression sensitizes neuronal cells and ex vivo brain slices to ferroptosis induction, which may be due to -syn suppression of NRF2 at the protein level. Altogether, these results indicate that NRF2 is a critical anti-ferroptotic mediator of neuronal survival, and that the vicious cycle of -syn over expression and NRF2 suppression, leading to enhanced neuronal ferroptotic cell death, could represent a targetable and currently untapped means of preventing PD onset and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing visual cortex of children and adults reveals a late-stage change in the architecture of V1</a></h4>

              
                Adult visual ability differs markedly with stimulus polar angle: relative to the point of fixation, visual performance is best for stimuli to the left or right, intermediate for stimuli below, and poorest for stimuli above. These polar angle asymmetries in performance are paralleled by cortical asymmetries in the visual field representation in primary visual cortex (V1). Whereas children, like adults, show better performance for stimuli along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, they show no performance difference for stimuli above vs below fixation. Is the difference in visual performance between children and adults matched by a difference in the amount of V1 surface area representing these regions? We used fMRI to measure the distribution of the cortical surface representing the visual field in children and adults. Two properties of the V1, V2, and V3 maps were mature in children -overall map surface area and variation in surface area as a function of eccentricity. Further, like adults, children had much greater V1 surface area representing the horizontal than vertical meridian. However, unlike adults, children did not have greater V1 surface area for the lower than upper vertical meridian. These data indicate a late-stage change in the architecture of V1 that may drive the emergence of a visual performance asymmetry along the vertical meridian by adulthood.

                Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) plays an essential role in neuronal activities through interaction with various proteins involved in signaling at membranes. However, the distribution pattern of PI(4,5)P2 and the co-clustering with these proteins on the neuronal cell membranes remain elusive at the electron microscopic level. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the nanoscale distribution of PI(4,5)P2 on the neuronal cell membranes by SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling with cryo-fixed mouse cerebellum. We demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 makes clusters with a mean size of ~ 1,000 nm2 and these clusters show preferential accumulation in specific membrane compartments depending on cell types. Purkinje cell (PC) spines and granule cell (GC) presynaptic active zones are particularly rich in the PI(4,5)P2 clusters. Furthermore, these clusters are extensively associated with clusters of CaV2.1 and GIRK3 throughout different membrane compartments of PCs, GCs, and molecular layer interneurons. In contrast, these clusters showed compartment-specific association with mGluR1 in PC spines. These results suggest that visualization of the nanoscale PI(4,5)P2 distribution may provide insight into the physiological functions of PI(4,5)P2 in neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context matters: Changes in memory over a period of sleep are driven by encoding context</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, recently acquired episodic memories (i.e., autobiographical memories for specific events) are strengthened and transformed, a process termed consolidation. These memories are contextual in nature, with details of specific features interwoven with more general properties such as the time and place of the event. In this study, we hypothesized that the context in which a memory is embedded would guide the process of consolidation during sleep. To test this idea, we employed a spatial memory task and considered changes in memory over a 10-hour period including either sleep or wake. In both conditions, participants (N = 62) formed stories that contextually bound four objects together, and then encoded the on-screen spatial position of all objects. Results showed that the changes in memory over the sleep period were correlated among contextually linked objects, whereas no such effect was identified for the wake group. These results suggest that contexts binding different memories together play an active role in consolidation during sleep.

	<p>Poor motor function or physical performance is a predictor of cognitive decline. Additionally, slow gait speed is associated with poor cognitive performance, with gait disturbances being a risk factor for dementia. Parallel declines in muscular and cognitive performance (resulting in cognitive frailty) might be driven primarily by muscle deterioration, but bidirectional pathways involving muscle&amp;amp;ndash;brain crosstalk through the central and peripheral nervous systems are likely to exist. Following screening, early-stage parallel declines may be manageable and modifiable through simple interventions. Gait&amp;amp;ndash;brain relationships in dementia and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood; therefore, the current authors critically reviewed the literature on the gait&amp;amp;ndash;brain relationship and the underlying mechanisms and the feasibility/accuracy of assessment tools in order to identify research gaps. The authors suggest that dual-task gait is involved in concurrent cognitive and motor activities, reflecting how the brain allocates resources when gait is challenged by an additional task and that poor performance on dual-task gait is a predictor of dementia onset. Thus, tools or protocols that allow the identification of subtle disease- or disorder-related changes in gait are highly desirable to improve diagnosis. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive, cost-effective, safe, simple, portable, and non-motion-sensitive neuroimaging technique, widely used in studies of clinical populations such as people suffering from Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, depression, and other chronic neurological disorders. If fNIRS can help researchers to better understand gait disturbance, then fNIRS could form the basis of a cost-effective means of identifying people at risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. The major research gap identified in this review relates to the role of the central/peripheral nervous system when performing dual tasks.</p>

	<p>After the command and control information of the command and control cabin is displayed in the form of mixed reality, the large amount of real-time information and static information contained in it will form a dynamic situation that changes all the time. This brings a great burden to the system operator&#039;s cognition, decision-making and operation. In order to solve this problem, this paper studies the three-dimensional spatial layout of holographic command cabin information display in a mixed reality environment. A total of 15 people participated in the experiment, of which 10 were the subjects of the experiment and 5 were the staff of the auxiliary experiment. Ten subjects used the HoloLens 2 generation to conduct visual characteristics and cognitive load experiments and collected and analyzed the subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; task completion time, error rate, eye movement and EEG and subjective evaluation data. Through the analysis of experimental data, the laws of visual and cognitive features of three-dimensional space in a mixed reality environment can be obtained. This paper systematically explores the effects of three key attributes: depth distance, information layer number and target relative position depth distance of information distribution in a 3D space, on visual search performance and on cognitive load. The experimental results showed that the optimal depth distance range for information display in the mixed reality environment is: the best depth distance for operation interactions (0.6 m~1.0 m), the best depth distance for accurate identification (2.4 m~2.8 m) and the overall situational awareness best-in-class depth distance (3.4 m~3.6 m). Under a certain angle of view, the number of information layers in the space is as small as possible, and the number of information layers should not exceed five at most. The relative position depth distance between the information layers in space ranges from 0.2 m to 0.35 m. Based on this theory, information layout in a 3D space can achieve a faster and more accurate visual search in a mixed reality environment and effectively reduce the cognitive load.</p>

	<p>The activity of excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits in the motor cortex can be probed and modified by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS), noninvasively. At present, not only has a consensus regarding the interhemispheric effect of high frequency rTMS not been reached, but the attributes of these TMS-related circuits are also poorly understood. To address this question comprehensively, we integrated a single- and paired-pulse TMS evaluation with excitatory 20-Hz rTMS intervention in order to probe the interhemispheric effect on the intracortical circuits by high-frequency rTMS. In the rest state, after 20-Hz rTMS, a significant increase of single-pulse MEP and paired-pulse intracortical facilitation (ICF) in the non-stimulated hemisphere was observed with good test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. Intracortical inhibition (measured by the cortical silent period) in the unstimulated hemisphere also increased after rTMS. No significant time&amp;amp;ndash;course change was observed in the sham-rTMS group. The results provide the evidence that 20-Hz rTMS induced a reliable interhemispheric facilitatory effect. Findings from the present study suggest that the glutamatergic facilitatory system and the GABAergic inhibitory system may vary synchronously.</p>

	<p>Background. Few studies have evaluated cognitive functioning and mental health in children and adolescents who contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated the prevalence and association of neuropsychological difficulties, psychological symptoms, and self-reported long-COVID complaints in a sample of adolescents. Methods. Thirty-one adolescents infected by COVID-19 within 3&amp;amp;ndash;6 months prior to the assessment were included. Neuropsychological difficulties, psychological symptoms, and self-reported long-COVID complaints were evaluated using a checklist and a battery of multiple standardized measures, using a telehealth procedure. Symptoms during the infection were also detected. Results. We included 31 adolescents (23 girls, 8 boys; mean age 14.1, SD = 2). We found borderline scores in 32.3% and 45.2% of our sample for phonemic and category fluency, respectively. A high percentage of participants showed symptoms of depression (80.6%) and anxiety (61.3%). Fifty-eight percent reported at least one long-COVID symptom. The most common symptoms were headache and attention problems (58%). Subjects presenting numbness/weakness, fatigue, brain fog, or attention problems had higher scores in depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Conclusion. This is a pilot study limited by the lack of control group. However, we found that cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms were very common among adolescents recovered from COVID-19.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Continuous Tracking of Task Parameters Tunes Reaching Control Online</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A hallmark of human reaching movements is that they are appropriately tuned to the task goal and to the environmental context. This was demonstrated by the way humans flexibly respond to mechanical and visual perturbations that happen during movement. Furthermore, it was previously showed that the properties of goal-directed control can change within a movement, following abrupt changes in the goal structure. Such online adjustment was characterized by a modulation of feedback gains following switches in target shape. However, it remains unknown whether the underlying mechanism merely switches between prespecified policies, or whether it results from continuous and potentially dynamic adjustments. Here, we address this question by investigating participants&rsquo; feedback control strategies in presence of various changes in target width during reaching. More specifically, we studied whether the feedback responses to mechanical perturbations were sensitive to the rate of change in target width, which would be inconsistent with the hypothesis of a single, discrete switch. Based on movement kinematics and surface EMG data, we observed a modulation of feedback response clearly dependent on dynamical changes in target width. Together, our results demonstrate a continuous and online transformation of task-related parameters into suitable control policies.</p>

                Meigs’s syndrome is characterized by a triad of ovarian fibroma, ascites, and pleural effusion which can be managed surgically. Pleural effusion and ascites are usually transudative. Ovarian fibroma is an uncommon tumor. We herein report a case of Meigs’s syndrome in a 61-year-old woman who presented with complaints of abdominal pain for two-three months along with decreased appetite and constipation. On examination, there was decreased air entry in the right side of the chest, generalized abdominal distention, and a firm irregular mass was felt which was mobile and extending from upper border of symphysis pubis to just above the umbilicus on abdominal palpation. Chest X ray showed right sided pleural effusion, ultrasonogram (USG) abdominal and pelvis showed gross ascites, and a very large complex right ovarian cyst was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She underwent staging laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omental resection for biopsy. Biopsy showed right ovarian fibroma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determinants of mortality risk among Indonesian patients with COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mortality risk of the novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) remains a global concern. Particularly in Indonesia, patients aged 18–59 years have a high risk of death due to COVID-19. In this study, we analysed the determinants of mortality risk among patients with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from the Indonesian COVID-19 dashboard, tracking COVID-19 cases from April 2020 to May 2021 was performed. Data of 22,314 patients with COVID-19 aged 18–59 years were analysed using descriptive analysis, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Factors associated with confirmed mortality risk among patients aged 18–59 years with COVID-19 included increasing age (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.07–1.09), hospitalised and on ventilator support (AOR = 130.75; 95% CI = 69.03–247.63), having severe disease (AOR = 15.24; 95% CI = 11.51–20.17), and travelling history (AOR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.13–1.63). Conclusions: These findings confirmed that the increasing risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with increasing age, ventilator support during hospitalisation, developing severe disease, and having a travelling history. This suggests that curative strategies should be strengthened with a focus on improving clinical governance by prioritising patients with the above variables.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Professional qualifications of medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians and other internal stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians (MAPPs) have unique value to pharmaceutical companies due to their accountability for activities that benefit regulators, payors, prescribers and patients. This study assessed whether MAPPs’ specialist training and education in pharmaceutical medicine could account for this level of value by determining whether there was significant variation in education and training between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders of pharmaceutical companies. Methods: A systematic search of LinkedIn profiles from the 10 pharmaceutical companies by revenue was conducted between June and October 2021. Job title and type and year of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications were extracted. A one-sided Mann-Whitney test assessed for differences in the total number of qualifications between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders involved in medical affairs using MAPPs as the reference group. Other internal stakeholders included medical affairs pharmacists (MAPharm), other medical affairs professionals (MAOth), and market access (MAcc), commercial (COmm) and sales professionals. Sub-group analysis determined differences in undergraduate and postgraduate education. Results: In total, 524 profiles were included. Compared to all other internal stakeholders, MAPPs had a significantly higher number of undergraduate (p < 0.001) and postgraduate (MAPharm, p = 0.003; MAOth, p = 0.004; MAcc, COmm and Sales, p < 0.001) qualifications. Additionally, MAPPs had a significantly longer time to industry than other internal stakeholders apart from MAPharm. Of those with clinical qualifications, MAPPs were almost twice as likely to have business qualifications. Conclusions: Of all internal stakeholders, MAPPs had the highest number of qualifications and the best match between expertise and the contextual demands of decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies in the UK can use these findings to clarify role boundaries and decision-making power based on the nature and level of expertise of each internal stakeholder.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Heterogeneity of Rift Valley fever virus transmission potential across livestock hosts, quantified through a model-based analysis of host viral load and vector infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hélène Cecilia, Roosmarie Vriens, Paul J. Wichgers Schreur, Mariken M. de Wit, Raphaëlle Métras, Pauline Ezanno, Quirine A. ten Bosch</p>

Quantifying the variation of pathogens’ life history traits in multiple host systems is crucial to understand their transmission dynamics. It is particularly important for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), which are prone to infecting several species of vertebrate hosts. Here, we focus on how host-pathogen interactions determine the ability of host species to transmit a virus to susceptible vectors upon a potentially infectious contact. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral, vector-borne, zoonotic disease, chosen as a case study. The relative contributions of livestock species to RVFV transmission has not been previously quantified. To estimate their potential to transmit the virus over the course of their infection, we 1) fitted a within-host model to viral RNA and infectious virus measures, obtained daily from infected lambs, calves, and young goats, 2) estimated the relationship between vertebrate host infectious titers and probability to infect mosquitoes, and 3) estimated the net infectiousness of each host species over the duration of their infectious periods, taking into account different survival outcomes for lambs. Our results indicate that the efficiency of viral replication, along with the lifespan of infectious particles, could be sources of heterogeneity between hosts. Given available data on RVFV competent vectors, we found that, for similar infectious titers, infection rates in the <i>Aedes</i> genus were on average higher than in the <i>Culex</i> genus. Consequently, for <i>Aedes</i>-mediated infections, we estimated the net infectiousness of lambs to be 2.93 (median) and 3.65 times higher than that of calves and goats, respectively. In lambs, we estimated the overall infectiousness to be 1.93 times higher in individuals which eventually died from the infection than in those recovering. Beyond infectiousness, the relative contributions of host species to transmission depend on local ecological factors, including relative abundances and vector host-feeding preferences. Quantifying these contributions will ultimately help design efficient, targeted, surveillance and vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulations of tumor growth and response to immunotherapy by coupling a spatial agent-based model with a whole-patient quantitative systems pharmacology model</a></h4>

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models and spatial agent-based models (ABM) are powerful and efficient approaches for the analysis of biological systems and for clinical applications. Although QSP models are becoming essential in discovering predictive biomarkers and developing combination therapies through <i>in silico</i> virtual trials, they are inadequate to capture the spatial heterogeneity and randomness that characterize complex biological systems, and specifically the tumor microenvironment. Here, we extend our recently developed spatial QSP (spQSP) model to analyze tumor growth dynamics and its response to immunotherapy at different spatio-temporal scales. In the model, the tumor spatial dynamics is governed by the ABM, coupled to the QSP model, which includes the following compartments: central (blood system), tumor, tumor-draining lymph node, and peripheral (the rest of the organs and tissues). A dynamic recruitment of T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) from the QSP central compartment has been implemented as a function of the spatial distribution of cancer cells. The proposed QSP-ABM coupling methodology enables the spQSP model to perform as a coarse-grained model at the whole-tumor scale and as an agent-based model at the regions of interest (ROIs) scale. Thus, we exploit the spQSP model potential to characterize tumor growth, identify T cell hotspots, and perform qualitative and quantitative descriptions of cell density profiles at the invasive front of the tumor. Additionally, we analyze the effects of immunotherapy at both whole-tumor and ROI scales under different tumor growth and immune response conditions. A digital pathology computational analysis of triple-negative breast cancer specimens is used as a guide for modeling the immuno-architecture of the invasive front.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty quantification in cerebral circulation simulations focusing on the collateral flow: Surrogate model approach with machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Changyoung Yuhn, Marie Oshima, Yan Chen, Motoharu Hayakawa, Shigeki Yamada</p>

Collateral circulation in the circle of Willis (CoW), closely associated with disease mechanisms and treatment outcomes, can be effectively investigated using one-dimensional–zero-dimensional hemodynamic simulations. As the entire cardiovascular system is considered in the simulation, it captures the systemic effects of local arterial changes, thus reproducing collateral circulation that reflects biological phenomena. The simulation facilitates rapid assessment of clinically relevant hemodynamic quantities under patient-specific conditions by incorporating clinical data. During patient-specific simulations, the impact of clinical data uncertainty on the simulated quantities should be quantified to obtain reliable results. However, as uncertainty quantification (UQ) is time-consuming and computationally expensive, its implementation in time-sensitive clinical applications is considered impractical. Therefore, we constructed a surrogate model based on machine learning using simulation data. The model accurately predicts the flow rate and pressure in the CoW in a few milliseconds. This reduced computation time enables the UQ execution with 100 000 predictions in a few minutes on a single CPU core and in less than a minute on a GPU. We performed UQ to predict the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion (CH), a life-threatening condition that can occur after carotid artery stenosis surgery if collateral circulation fails to function appropriately. We predicted the statistics of the postoperative flow rate increase in the CoW, which is a measure of CH, considering the uncertainties of arterial diameters, stenosis parameters, and flow rates measured using the patients’ clinical data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the impact of each uncertain parameter on the flow rate increase. Results indicated that CH occurred when two conditions were satisfied simultaneously: severe stenosis and when arteries of small diameter serve as the collateral pathway to the cerebral artery on the stenosis side. These findings elucidate the biological aspects of cerebral circulation in terms of the relationship between collateral flow and CH.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sweet sensors support stressed cell survival</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel J. Himmel, Richard Benton</p>

Gustatory receptors (Grs) are well known for their functions in sensory neurons in detecting food and toxins. An intriguing new study in PLOS Biology provides evidence for a role for Grs in Drosophila epithelia in protecting stressed cells from proteotoxicity.

Gustatory receptors on sensory neurons have a well established role in chemosensation. This Primer explores the implications of a PLOS Biology study revealing that a gustatory receptor gene cluster has an unexpected role in regulating cell survival during proteotoxic stress.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Development of Parkinson's disease and its relationship with incidentally‐discovered white matter disease and covert brain infarction in a real‐world cohort</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the relationship between covert cerebrovascular disease, comprised of covert brain infarction and white matter disease, discovered incidentally in routine care, and subsequent Parkinson's disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were ≥50 years and received neuroimaging for non-stroke indications in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California system from 2009 to 2019. Natural language processing identified incidentally-discovered covert brain infarction and white matter disease and classified white matter disease severity. The Parkinson's disease outcome was defined as two ICD diagnosis codes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>230,062 patients were included (median follow-up 3.72 years). 1,941 Parkinson's disease cases were identified (median time-to-event 2.35 years). Natural language processing identified covert cerebrovascular disease in 70,592 (30.7%) patients, 10,622 (4.6%) with covert brain infarction and 65,814 (28.6%) with white matter disease. After adjustment for known risk factors, white matter disease was associated with Parkinson's disease, (hazard ratio 1.67 [95%CI, 1.44, 1.93] for patients &lt;70 years and 1.33 [1.18, 1.50] for those ≥70 years). Greater severity of white matter disease was associated with increased incidence of Parkinson's disease(/1000 person-years), from 1.52 (1.43, 1.61) in patients without white matter disease to 4.90 (3.86, 6.13) in those with severe disease. Findings were robust when more specific definitions of Parkinson's disease were used. Covert brain infarction was not associated with Parkinson's disease (adjusted hazard ratio=1.05 [0.88, 1.24]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Incidentally-discovered white matter disease was associated with subsequent Parkinson's disease, an association strengthened with younger age and increased white matter disease severity. Incidentally-discovered covert brain infarction did not appear to be associated with subsequent Parkinson's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prognostic Discussion for Infants with Neurologic Conditions: Qualitative Analysis of Family Conferences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We characterize the content and role of prognostic discussion for infants with neurologic conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this descriptive qualitative study, we prospectively enrolled infants (age &lt; 1 year) in the intensive care unit with a neurologic condition anticipated to have ≥ 1 family conference about prognosis or goals of care. We audio-recorded family conferences as they occurred. We used a rapid-cycle qualitative approach to identify and refine themes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty infants and 61 parents were enrolled; 68 family conferences occurred for 24 infants. The majority of infant cases (n=23/24, 96%) and conferences (n=64/68, 94%) included discussion of neurologic prognosis. Common infant diagnoses included prematurity (n=12, 52%), genetic conditions (n=9, 35%), and brain malformations (n=7, 30%). We identified two themes relating to the characterization of the infant's prognosis: 1) <i>Predictions of impairment</i> and 2) <i>Rationale for prognostic predictions</i>. We identified three themes characterizing the role of prognostic discussion: 1) <i>Aligning parent and clinician understanding of infant outcome</i>, 2) <i>Influencing decision making</i>, and 3) <i>Preparing for life at home</i>. We identified two themes characterizing discussion of prognostic uncertainty: 1) <i>Multi-layered types of uncertainty</i> and 2) <i>Holding space for hope alongside uncertainty</i>.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this cohort of infants with neurologic conditions and their parents, we identified salient themes characterizing the content and role of discussion about neurologic outcome. Our findings highlight that prognostic discussion focuses on anticipated impairments, informs decision making, and helps families prepare for home life. Future work should characterize whether these findings align with parent preferences for prognostic disclosure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Intact HIV proviruses persist in the brain despite viral suppression with ART</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) persistence in blood and tissue reservoirs including the brain is a major barrier to HIV cure and possible cause of comorbid disease. However, the size and replication competent nature of the CNS reservoir is unclear. Here we used the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) to provide the first quantitative assessment of the intact and defective HIV reservoir in the brain of people with HIV (PWH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Total, intact and defective HIV proviruses were measured in autopsy frontal lobe tissue from viremic (n=18) or virologically suppressed (n=12) PWH. Total or intact/defective proviruses were measured by detection of HIV <i>pol</i> or the IPDA, respectively, through use of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). HIV-seronegative individuals were included as controls (n=6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Total HIV DNA was present at similar levels in brain tissues from untreated viremic and antiretroviral (ART)-suppressed individuals (median: 22.3 vs 26.2 HIV pol copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells), reflecting a stable CNS reservoir of HIV that persists despite therapy. Furthermore, 8/10 viremic and 6/9 virally suppressed PWH also harbored intact proviruses in the CNS (4.63 vs 12.7 intact copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells). Viral reservoirs in CNS and matched lymphoid tissue were similar in the composition of intact and/or defective proviruses, albeit at lower levels in the brain. Importantly, CNS resident CD68+ myeloid cells in virally suppressed individuals harbored HIV DNA, directly showing the presence of a CNS resident HIV reservoir.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate the first evidence for an intact, potentially replication competent HIV reservoir in the CNS of virally suppressed PWH.</p>

                The zebrafish is an important model in systems neuroscience but viral tools to dissect the structure and function of neuronal circuitry are not established. We developed methods for efficient gene transfer and retrograde tracing in adult and larval zebrafish by herpes simplex viruses (HSV1). HSV1 was combined with the Gal4/UAS system to target cell types with high spatial, temporal, and molecular specificity. We also established methods for efficient transneuronal tracing by modified rabies viruses in zebrafish. We demonstrate that HSV1 and rabies viruses can be used to visualize and manipulate genetically or anatomically identified neurons within and across different brain areas of adult and larval zebrafish. An expandable library of viruses is provided to express fluorescent proteins, calcium indicators, optogenetic probes, toxins and other molecular tools. This toolbox creates new opportunities to interrogate neuronal circuits in zebrafish through combinations of genetic and viral approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BIRC6 modifies risk of invasive bacterial infection in Kenyan children</a></h4>

              
                Invasive bacterial disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in African children. Despite being caused by diverse pathogens, children with sepsis are clinically indistinguishable from one another. In spite of this, most genetic susceptibility loci for invasive infection that have been discovered to date are pathogen specific and are not therefore suggestive of a shared genetic architecture of bacterial sepsis. Here we utilise probabilistic diagnostic models to identify children with a high probability of invasive bacterial disease among critically unwell Kenyan children with P. falciparum parasitaemia. We construct a joint dataset including 1,445 bacteraemia cases and 1,143 severe malaria cases, and population controls, among critically unwell Kenyan children that have previously been genotyped for human genetic variation. Using these data we perform a cross-trait genome-wide association study of invasive bacterial infection, weighting cases according to their probability of bacterial disease. In doing so we identify and validate a novel risk locus for invasive infection secondary to multiple bacterial pathogens, that has no apparent effect on malaria risk. The locus identified modifies splicing of BIRC6 in stimulated monocytes, implicating regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the pathogenesis of sepsis in Kenyan children.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tracking receptor motions at the plasma membrane reveals distinct effects of ligands on CCR5 dynamics depending on its dimerization status</a></h4>

              
                G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are present at the cell surface in different conformational and oligomeric states. However, how these states impact GPCRs biological function and therapeutic targeting remains incompletely known. Here, we investigated this issue in living cells for the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a major receptor in inflammation and the principal entry co-receptor for Human Immunodeficiency Viruses type 1 (HIV-1). We used TIRF microscopy and a statistical method to track and classify the motion of different receptor subpopulations. We showed a diversity of ligand-free forms of CCR5 at the cell surface constituted of various oligomeric states and exhibiting transient Brownian and restricted motions. These forms were stabilized differently by distinct ligands. In particular, agonist stimulation restricted the mobility of CCR5 and led to its clustering, a feature depending on β-arrestin, while inverse agonist stimulation exhibited the opposite effect. These results suggest a link between receptor activation and immobilization. Applied to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp120, our quantitative analysis revealed agonist-like properties of gp120s. Distinct gp120s influenced CCR5 dynamics differently, suggesting that they stabilize different CCR5 conformations. Then, using a dimerization-compromized mutant, we showed that dimerization (i) impacts CCR5 precoupling to G proteins, (ii) is a pre-requisite for the immobilization and clustering of receptors upon activation, and (iii) regulates receptor endocytosis, thereby impacting the fate of activated receptors. This study demonstrates that tracking the dynamic behavior of a GPCR is an efficient way to link GPCR conformations to their functions, therefore improving the development of drugs targeting specific receptor conformations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Posttranslational modifications of the DUX4 protein impact toxic function</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by abnormal de-repression of the transcription factor DUX4, which is toxic to muscle in vitro and in vivo. While the transcriptional targets of DUX4 are known, the regulation of DUX4 protein and the molecular consequences of this regulation are unclear. Here, we used in vitro models of FSHD to identify and characterize DUX4 posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and their impact on the toxic function of DUX4. Methods: DUX4 protein was immunoprecipitated and mass spectrometry performed to identify PTMs. We then extensively characterized DUX4 PTMs and potential enzyme modifiers using mutagenesis, proteomics and biochemical assays in human cell lines and human myoblast cell lines. Results: Our in vitro screen of DUX4 PTM mutants identified arginine methyl-null and serine/threonine phosphomimetic mutants that protected cells against DUX4-mediated toxicity and reduced the ability of DUX4 to transactivate downstream gene targets, including FSHD biomarkers. Using additional proteomics and biochemical approaches, we identified protein kinase A (PKA) and a protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT1) as components of the DUX4 complex. Importantly, over-expression of PRKACA, a catalytic subunit of the PKA holoenzyme, mitigated DUX4 toxicity, while pharmacologic inhibition of PRMT1 protected human myoblasts from DUX4-mediated apoptosis. Interpretation: These results demonstrate that DUX4 is regulated by PTMs and that DUX4 PTMs, or associated modifying enzymes, may be druggable targets for FSHD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tauopathy and alcohol consumption interact to alter locus coeruleus excitatory transmission and excitability in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder is a major public health concern in the United States. Recent work has suggested a link between chronic alcohol consumption and the development of tauopathy disorders, such as Alzheimers Disease and Frontal-Temporal Dementia. However, relatively little work has investigated changes in neural circuitry involved in both tauopathy disorders and alcohol use disorder. The locus coeruleus (LC) is the major noradrenergic nuclei in the brain and is one of the earliest sites to be affected by tau lesions. The LC is also implicated in the rewarding effects of ethanol and alcohol withdrawal. In this study we assessed effects of long-term ethanol consumption and tauopathy on the physiology of LC neurons. Male and female P301S mice, a humanized transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, underwent 16 weeks of intermittent access to 20% ethanol from 3 to 7 months of age. We observed higher total alcohol consumption in female mice regardless of genotype. Male P301S mice consumed more ethanol and had a greater preference for ethanol than WT males. At the end of the drinking study, LC function was assessed using ex vivo whole cell electrophysiology. We found significant changes in excitatory inputs to the LC due to both ethanol and genotype. We found significantly increased excitability of the LC due to ethanol with greater effects in female P301S mice than WT. Our study identifies significant changes in the LC due to interactions between tauopathy and long-term ethanol use. These findings could have important implications regarding LC activity and changes in behavior due to both ethanol and tauopathy related dementia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structure and dynamics that specialize neurons for high-frequency coincidence detection in the barn owl nucleus laminaris</a></h4>

              
                A principal cue for sound source localization is the difference in arrival times of sounds at an animal's two ears (interaural time difference, ITD). Neurons that process ITDs are specialized to compare the timing of inputs with submillisecond precision. In the barn owl, ITD processing begins in the nucleus laminaris (NL) region of the auditory brainstem. Remarkably, NL neurons are sensitive to ITDs in high-frequency sounds (kilohertz-range). This contrasts with ITD-based sound localization in analogous regions in mammals where ITD-sensitivity is typically restricted to lower-frequency sounds. Guided by previous experiments and modeling studies of tone-evoked responses of NL neurons, we propose NL neurons achieve high-frequency ITD sensitivity if they respond selectively to the small-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations in their inputs, and remain relatively non-responsive to mean input level. We use a biophysically-based model to study the effects of soma-axon coupling on dynamics and function in NL neurons. First, we show that electrical separation of the soma from the axon region in the neuron enhances high-frequency ITD sensitivity. This soma-axon coupling configuration promotes linear subthreshold dynamics and rapid spike initiation, making the model more responsive to input fluctuations, rather than mean input level. Second, we provide new evidence for the essential role of phasic dynamics for high-frequency neural coincidence detection. Transforming our model to the phasic firing mode further tunes the model to respond selectively to the fluctuating inputs that carry ITD information. Similar structural and dynamical mechanisms specialize mammalian auditory brainstem neurons for ITD-sensitivity, thus our work identifies common principles of ITD-processing and neural coincidence detection across species and for sounds at widely-different frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible selection of task-relevant features through across-area population gating</a></h4>

              
                Brains can gracefully weed out irrelevant stimuli to guide behavior. This feat is believed to rely on a progressive selection of task-relevant stimuli across the cortical hierarchy, but the specific across-area interactions enabling stimulus selection are still unclear. Here, we propose that population gating, occurring within A1 but controlled by top-down inputs from mPFC, can support across-area stimulus selection. Examining single-unit activity recorded while rats performed an auditory context-dependent task, we found that A1 encoded relevant and irrelevant stimuli along a common dimension of its neural space. Yet, the relevant stimulus encoding was enhanced along an extra dimension. In turn, mPFC encoded only the stimulus relevant to the ongoing context. To identify candidate mechanisms for stimulus selection within A1, we reverse-engineered low-rank RNNs trained on a similar task. Our analyses predicted that two context-modulated neural populations gated their preferred stimulus in opposite contexts, which we confirmed in further analyses of A1. We finally integrated our within-area observations in a two-region RNN and proposed a novel mechanism for flexible across-area communication through fixed connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A 3D bioengineered neural tissue model generated from patient-derived iPSCs develops Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Background Current models to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) include cell cultures and animal models. Human diseases, however, are often poorly reproduced in animal models. Developing techniques to differentiate human brain cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides a novel approach to studying AD. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures to model AD are represented by organoids, neurospheroids, and scaffold-based cultures. Methods We developed a 3D bioengineered model of iPSC-derived neural tissue that combines a porous scaffold composed of silk fibroin protein with an intercalated collagen hydrogel to support the growth of neurons and glial cells into complex and functional networks. This biomaterial scaffold, designed to match the mechanical properties of brain tissue, can support 3D neural cultures for an extended time without necrosis, a fundamental requisite for aging studies. We have optimized our protocol by seeding neural precursor cells (NPCs) into these scaffolds. Having NPCs stocks derived from multiple subjects allows synchronization of their differentiation and minimizes experimental variability. Cultures were generated from iPSC lines obtained from two subjects carrying the familial AD (FAD) APP London mutation, two well-studied control lines, and an isogenic control. Cultures were analyzed at 2 and 4.5 months. Results An elevated A{beta}42/40 ratio was detected in FAD cultures at both time points, as previously reported in 2D cultures derived from the same FAD lines. Extracellular A{beta}42 deposition and enhanced neuronal excitability were observed in FAD culture at 4.5 months. Notably, neuronal hyperexcitability has been described in AD patients early in the disease. Transcriptomic analysis revealed deregulation of multiple gene sets in FAD samples. Such alterations were similar to those observed in human AD brains in a large study that performed a co-expression meta-analysis of harmonized data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) across three independent cohorts. Conclusions Our 3D tissue model supports the differentiation of healthy iPSC-derived cultures in a porous silk-collagen composite sponge with an optically clear central region. This design facilitates nutrient delivery to meet the metabolic demand of long-term cultures. These data provide evidence that our bioengineered model from patient-derived FAD iPSCs develops AD-related phenotypes, including AD transcriptomic features. Thus, it can represent a valuable model for studying AD-related pathomechanisms.

                Correcting head motion artifacts in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) scans is particularly challenging due to the dramatic changes in image contrast at different gradient strengths and directions. Head motion correction is typically performed using a Gaussian Process model implemented in FSL's Eddy. Recently, the 3dSHORE-based SHORELine method was introduced to correct any dMRI sequence that has more than one shell. Here we perform a comprehensive evaluation of both methods on realistic simulations of a software fiber phantom that provides known ground-truth head motion. We demonstrate that both methods perform remarkably well, but that performance can be impacted by sampling scheme, the pervasiveness of head motion, and the denoising strategy applied before head motion correction. Our study also provides an open and fully-reproducible workflow that could be used to accelerate evaluation studies of other dMRI processing methods in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus duration encoding occurs early in the moth olfactory pathway</a></h4>

              
                Flying insects encounter turbulent environments, where chemotaxis along a concentration gradient makes little sense. Detection of the onset and offset of discrete odor pulses is then expected to become crucial for navigation, but it is not well understood how the olfactory system encodes the offset of the odor pulse. Previous works indicated that the duration of a male moth olfactory receptor neuron's (ORN) spike firing response to pheromone stimuli greatly exceeds the pulse duration. However, these works were based on imprecise odor delivery systems. We built an odor delivery system capable of delivering much sharper pheromone stimuli. The stimuli evoked ORN firing responses that faithfully tracked the stimulus duration, provided the stimulus lasted at least 200 ms. A transient inhibition marked the termination of such stimuli. Shorter stimuli produced a firing response exceeding the stimulus duration. The response shapes could be explained by adaptation of the ORN on only two time scales. With simulations, we showed that the observed limits in stimulus offset detection propagate to the antennal lobe and are likely to be behaviorally significant. Our results increase the understanding of the mechanisms necessary for male moths to navigate through pheromone plumes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical, muscular, and kinetic activity underpinning attentional focus strategies during visuomotor control</a></h4>

              
                Focusing internally on movement control or bodily sensations is frequently shown to disrupt the effectiveness and efficiency of motor control when compared to focusing externally on the outcome of movement. Whilst the behavioural consequences of these attentional strategies are well documented, it is unclear how they are explained at the corticomuscular level. The aim of the present study was to investigate how attentional focus strategies affect kinetic, cortical, muscular, and corticomuscular activity during an isometric force precision task. In a repeated measures design, we measured force, EEG and EMG activity from twenty-seven participants who performed 160 isometric contractions of the right hand whilst encouraged to adopt either an internal or external focus through a combination of instructions, secondary tasks, and self-report evaluations. Results indicated that focusing internally led to poorer force accuracy and steadiness compared to an external focus. An internal focus also increased muscle activity of the forearm flexor, increased EEG alpha activity across the parieto-occipital cortex, lowered frontal midline EEG theta activity, and lowered beta corticomuscular coherence between the forearm flexor and contralateral motor cortex. The results of this study provide a holistic understanding of how attentional focus strategies alter neuromuscular control during an isometric force precision task, paving the way for exploring how the behavioural consequences of attentional strategies can be explained at the corticomuscular levels across a wide range of motor tasks and contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fiber-Specific Structural Properties Relate to Reading Skills in Children</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that the cross-sectional relationship between reading skills and white matter microstructure, as indexed by fractional anisotropy, is not as robust as previously thought. Fixel-based analyses yield fiber-specific micro- and macrostructural measures, overcoming several shortcomings of traditional DTI approaches. We ran a whole-brain analysis investigating whether fixel-derived metrics related to single-word reading skills in a large, open, quality-controlled data set of 983 children and adolescents ages 6-18. We also compared fixel metrics between participants with (n = 102) and without (n = 570) reading disabilities. We found that the product of fiber density (FD) and cross-section (FC), or FDC, positively related to reading skills throughout the brain, especially in left temporoparietal and cerebellar white matter, but did not differ between groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that among metrics from other diffusion models - DTI, DKI, and NODDI - only orientation dispersion index (ODI) from NODDI was associated (inversely) with reading skills. Our findings further support the importance of left-hemisphere dorsal temporoparietal white matter tracts in reading. Additionally, our results suggest future DWI studies of reading should be designed to benefit from advanced diffusion models, include cerebellar coverage, and consider continuous analyses that account for individual differences in reading skill.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human Brain Development: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study integrating multiple neuromorphological features</a></h4>

              
                Brain maturation studies typically examine relationships linking a single morphometric feature with aspects of cognition, behavior, age, or other demographic characteristics. However, the coordinated spatiotemporal arrangement of morphological features across development and their associations with behavior are unclear. Here, we examine covariation across multiple cortical features (cortical thickness [CT], surface area [SA], local gyrification index [GI], and mean curvature [MC]) using magnetic resonance images from the long-running National Institute of Mental Health developmental cohort (ages 5-25). Neuroanatomical covariance was examined using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which decomposes covariance resulting in a parts-based representation. Cross-sectionally, we identified six components of covariation which demonstrate differential contributions of CT, GI, and SA in hetero- vs. unimodal areas. We sought to use this technique longitudinally to examine covariance in rates of change, which highlighted a preserved SA in unimodal areas and changes in CT and GI in heteromodal areas. Using behavioral partial least squares (PLS), we identified a single latent variable (LV; 96 % covariance explained) that recapitulated patterns of reduced CT, GI, and SA that are generally related to older age, with limited contributions of IQ and SES. Longitudinally, PLS revealed three LVs that demonstrated a nuanced developmental pattern that highlighted a higher rate of maturational change in SA and CT in higher IQ and SES females. This novel characterization of brain maturation provides an important understanding of the interdependencies between morphological measures, their coordinated development, and their relationship to biological sex, cognitive ability, and the resources of the local environment.

                Hearing and vision sensory systems are tuned to the natural statistics of acoustic and electromagnetic energy on earth, and are evolved to be sensitive in ethologically relevant ranges. But what are the natural statistics of odors, and how do olfactory systems exploit them? Dissecting an accurate machine learning model for human odor perception, we find a computable representation for odor at the molecular level that can predict the odor-evoked receptor, neural, and behavioral responses of nearly all terrestrial organisms studied in olfactory neuroscience. Using this olfactory representation (Primary Odor Map, POM), we find that odorous compounds with similar POM representations are more likely to co-occur within a substance and be metabolically closely related; metabolic reaction sequences also follow smooth paths in POM despite large jumps in molecular structure. Just as the brain's visual representations have evolved around the natural statistics of light and shapes, the natural statistics of metabolism appear to shape the brain's representation of the olfactory world.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive decision making depends on pupil-linked arousal in rats performing tactile discrimination tasks</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decision making is a dynamic cognitive process and is shaped by many factors, including behavioral state, reward contingency, and sensory environment. To understand the extent to which adaptive behavior in decision making is dependent upon pupil-linked arousal, we trained head-fixed rats to perform perceptual decision making tasks and systematically manipulated the probability of Go and No-go stimuli while simultaneously measuring their pupil size in the tasks. Our data demonstrated that the animals adaptively modified their behavior in response to the changes in the sensory environment. The response probability to both Go and No-go stimuli decreased as the probability of the Go stimulus being presented decreased. Analyses within the signal detection theory framework showed that while the perceptual sensitivity of the animals was invariant, their decision criterion increased as the probability of the Go stimulus decreased. Simulation results indicated that the adaptive increase in the decision criterion will increase possible water rewards during the task. Moreover, the adaptive decision making is dependent upon pupil-linked arousal as the increase in the decision criterion was the largest during low pupil-linked arousal periods. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the rats were able to adjust their decision making to maximize rewards in the tasks, and that adaptive behavior in perceptual decision making is dependent upon pupil-linked arousal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct mechanisms of CB1 and GABAB receptor presynaptic modulation of striatal indirect pathway projections to mouse Globus Pallidus</a></h4>

              
                Presynaptic modulation is a fundamental process regulating synaptic transmission. Striatal indirect pathway projections originate from A2A- expressing spiny projection neurons (iSPNs), targeting the globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and control the firing of the tonically active GPe neurons via GABA release. It is unclear if and how the presynaptic GPCRs, GABAB and CB1 receptors, modulate iSPN projections. Here we used an optogenetic platform to study presynaptic Ca2+ and GABAergic transmission at iSPN projections, using a genetic strategy to express the calcium sensor GCaMP6f or the excitatory channelrhodopsin (hChR2) on iSPNs. We found that P/Q-type calcium channels are the primary VGCC-subtype controlling presynaptic calcium and GABA release at iSPN-GPe projections. N-type and L-type VGCCs contribute to GABA release at iSPN-GPe projections. GABAB receptor activation resulted in a reversible inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ transients (PreCaTs) and an inhibition of GABAergic transmission at iSPN-GPe synapses. CB1 receptor activation did not inhibit PreCaTs while inhibiting GABAergic oIPSCs at iSPN-GPe synapses. CB1 effects on GABAergic transmission persisted in experiments where NaV and KV1 were blocked, indicating a VGCC- and KV1 independent presynaptic mechanism of action of CB1 receptors. Taken together, presynaptic modulation of iSPN-GPe projections by CB1 and GABAB receptors is mediated by distinct mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared and distinct neural activity during anticipation and outcome of win and loss: A meta-analysis of the monetary incentive delay task</a></h4>

              
                Reward and punishment motivate decision making and behavioral changes. Numerous studies have examined regional activities during anticipation and outcome of win and loss in the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT). However, the great majority of studies reported findings of anticipation or outcome and of win or loss alone. It remains unclear how the neural correlates share and differentiate amongst these processes. We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of 77 studies of the MIDT (5,779 subjects), including 24 published since the most recent meta-analysis, to identify and, with conjunction and subtraction, contrast regional responses to win anticipation, loss anticipation, win outcome, and loss outcome. Win and loss anticipation engaged a shared network of bilateral anterior insula (AI), striatum, thalamus, supplementary motor area (SMA), and precentral gyrus. Win and loss outcomes did not share regional activities. Win and loss outcome each engaged higher activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Bilateral striatum and right occipital cortex responded to both anticipation and outcome of win, and right AI to both phases of loss. Win anticipation vs. outcome engaged higher activity in bilateral AI, striatum, SMA and precentral gyrus and right thalamus, and lower activity in bilateral mOFC and posterior cingulate cortex as well as right inferior frontal and angular gyri. Loss anticipation relative to outcome involved higher activity in bilateral striatum and left AI. These findings collectively suggest shared and distinct regional responses during monetary wins and losses. Delineating the neural correlates of these component processes may facilitate empirical research of motivated behavior and dysfunctional approach and avoidance in psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring Stop Signal Reaction Time Over Two Sessions of the Anticipatory Response Inhibition Task</a></h4>

              
                Various behavioural tasks can measure the motor component of impulse control, response inhibition. Response inhibition encompasses the ability to cancel unwanted actions and is evaluated via stop signal reaction time (SSRT). The current study explored the effect of two sessions on SSRT within the anticipatory response inhibition task (ARIT) and how this compared to the stop signal task (SST). Forty-four participants completed two sessions of the ARIT and SST, 24 hours apart. SSRT and its constituent measures (Go trial reaction time, stop signal delay) were calculated. SSRT reflecting non-selective inhibition was consistent between sessions in both tasks (both p > .293). Reaction time and stop signal delay also remained stable across sessions in the ARIT (all p > .063), whereas in the SST, both reaction time (p = .013) and stop signal delay (p = .009) increased. Across the two sessions, SSRT reflecting partial inhibition improved (p < .001), which was underpinned by changes to reaction time (p < .001) and stop signal delay (p < .001). The maximal efficiency of non-selective inhibition remained stable across two sessions in the ARIT. Results of the SST confirmed that non-selective inhibition can however be affected by more than inhibitory network integrity when Go trial reaction times are not constrained in task design. Partial response inhibition measures changed across sessions, suggesting the sequential process captured by the SSRT occurred more quickly in session two. These findings highlight the absence/extent of inherent SSRT changes possible during multiple-session study designs e.g., pre/post, or active/sham comparisons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization and Preclinical Treatment of Rotational Force-Induced Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Millions of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur annually. TBIs commonly result from falls, traffic accidents, and sports-related injuries, all of which involve rotational acceleration/deceleration of the brain. During these injuries, the brain endures a multitude of primary insults including compression of brain tissue, damaged vasculature, and diffuse axonal injury. All of these deleterious effects can contribute to secondary brain ischemia, cellular death, and neuroinflammation that progress for weeks to months after injury and impede neurological recovery. While the linear effects of head trauma have been extensively modeled, less is known about how rotational injuries mediate neuronal damage following injury. Here, we developed a new model of rotational head trauma in rodents and extensively characterized the pathological, behavioral, and electrophysiological effects of rotational TBI (rTBI). We identify aberrant cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity as a principal mediator of rTBI and show pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 reduces the cognitive and pathological consequences of injury. Finally, we utilize Cdk5-enriched phosphoproteomics to uncover potential downstream mediators of rTBI. These studies contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the mechanisms of rTBI and how they may be effectively treated.

                The mouse gustatory cortex (GC) is involved in taste-guided decision-making in addition to sensory processing. Rodent GC exhibits metastable neural dynamics during ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity, but how these dynamics evolve in the context of a taste-based decision-making task remains unclear. Here we employ analytical and modeling approaches to i) extract metastable dynamics in ensemble spiking activity recorded from the GC of mice performing a perceptual decision-making task; ii) investigate the computational mechanisms underlying GC metastability in this task; and iii) establish a relationship between GC dynamics and behavioral performance. Our results show that activity in GC during perceptual decision-making is metastable and that this metastability may serve as a substrate for sequentially encoding sensory, abstract cue, and decision information over time. Perturbations of the model's metastable dynamics indicate that boosting inhibition in different coding epochs differentially impacts network performance, explaining a counterintuitive effect of GC optogenetic silencing on mouse behavior.

                Humans and animals alike form oppositely valenced memories for stimuli that predict the occurrence versus the termination of a reward: appetitive 'reward' memory for stimuli associated with the occurrence of a reward and aversive 'frustration' memory for stimuli that are associated with its termination. We characterize these memories in larval Drosophila using a combination of Pavlovian conditioning, optogenetic activation of the dopaminergic central-brain DAN-i1864 neuron, and high-resolution video-tracking. This reveals their dependency on the number of training trials and the duration of DAN-i1864 activation, their temporal stability, and the parameters of locomotion that are modulated during memory expression. Together with previous results on 'punishment' versus 'relief' learning by DAN-f1 neuron activation, this reveals a 2x2 matrix of timing-dependent memory valence for the occurrence/ termination of reward/ punishment. These findings should aid the understanding and modelling of how brains decipher the predictive, causal structure of events around a target reinforcing occurrence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GPC3-Unc5D complex structure and role in cell migration</a></h4>

              
                Neural migration is a critical step during brain development that requires the interactions of cell-surface guidance receptors. Cancer cells often hijack these mechanisms to disseminate. Here we reveal crystal structures of Uncoordinated-5 receptor D (Unc5D) in complex with morphogen receptor glypican-3 (GPC3), forming an octameric glycoprotein complex. In the complex, four Unc5D molecules pack into an antiparallel bundle, flanked by four GPC3 molecules. Central glycan-glycan interactions are formed by N-linked glycans emanating from GPC3 (N241 in human) and C-mannosylated tryptophans of the Unc5D thrombospondin-like domains. MD simulations, mass-spectrometry and structure-based mutants validate the crystallographic data. Anti-GPC3 nanobodies enhance or weaken Unc5-GPC3 binding. Using these tools in vivo, we show that Unc5/GPC3 guide migrating pyramidal neurons in the mouse cortex, and cancer cells in an embryonic xenograft neuroblastoma model. The results demonstrate a conserved structural mechanism of cell-guidance, with the potential for wide- ranging biomedical implications in development and cancer biology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in default mode network connectivity in healthy aging adults</a></h4>

              
                Women show an increased lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to men. Characteristic brain connectivity changes, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), have been associated with both symptomatic and preclinical AD, but the impact of sex on DMN function throughout aging is poorly understood. We investigated sex differences in DMN connectivity over the lifespan in 595 cognitively healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project - Aging cohort. We used the intrinsic connectivity distribution (a robust voxel-based metric of functional connectivity) and a seed connectivity approach to determine sex differences within the DMN and between the DMN and whole brain. Compared with men, women demonstrated increased connectivity with age in posterior DMN nodes and decreased connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Differences were most prominent in the decades surrounding menopause. Seed-based analysis revealed increased connectivity in women from the posterior cingulate to angular gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, which correlated with neuropsychological measures of declarative memory. Taken together, we show significant sex differences in DMN subnetworks over the lifespan, including patterns in aging women that resemble changes previously seen in preclinical AD. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex in neuroimaging studies of aging and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential Role of GABAergic and Cholinergic Ventral Pallidal Neurons in Behavioral Despair, Conditioned Fear Memory and Active Coping</a></h4>

              
                The ventral pallidum (VP), a core structure of the reward circuit, is well-associated with appetitive behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that this basal forebrain nucleus may have an overarching role in affective processing, including behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. We investigated this possibility by utilizing selective immunotoxin lesions and a series of behavioral tests in adult male Wistar rats. We made bilateral GAT1-Saporin, 192-IgG-Saporin or PBS (vehicle) injections into the VP to respectively eliminate GABAergic and cholinergic neurons, and tested the animals in the forced swim test (FST), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM) and cued fear conditioning. Both GAT1-Saporin and 192-IgG-Saporin injections reduced behavioral despair without altering general locomotor activity. This antidepressant-like effect was accompanied by reduced freezing and increased darting in the acquisition phase of cued fear conditioning. In the test phase, cholinergic, but not GABAergic lesions, impaired context-dependent fear memory, while both groups showed diminished conditioned freezing in a novel context. In line with this, selective cholinergic lesions impaired spatial memory in the MWM as compared to GAT1-Saporin or vehicle-injected animals. No differential effect was observed in anxiety-like behavior assessed in the OFT or EPM. These findings show that both the GABAergic and cholinergic cell groups of the VP contribute to behavioral despair and acquired fear responses by suppressing active coping. In conditioned learning, cholinergic ventral pallidal neurons contribute to the fear response in a context-independent manner, while the GABAergic population is required when the context information is missing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative Census of Local Somatic Features in Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian neocortex contains a highly diverse set of cell types. These types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches. Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell type specialization. While many morphological surveys focus on branching patterns of individual cells, fewer have been devoted to sub-cellular structure of cells. Electron microscopy (EM) provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective into the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometer scale morphology. Here we present the first systematic survey of the somatic region of nearly 100,000 cortical cells, using quantitative features obtained from EM. This analysis demonstrates a surprising sufficiency of the perisomatic region to recapitulate many known aspects of cortical organization, while also revealing novel relationships. Parameters of cell size, nuclear infolding and somatic synaptic innervation co-vary with distinct patterns across depth and between types. Further, we describe how these subcellular features can be used to create highly accurate predictions of cell-types across large scale EM datasets. More generally, our results suggest that the shifts in cellular physiology and molecular programming seen across cell types accompany profound differences in the fine-scale structure of cells.

	<p>Recommended treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) includes stimulant medication. While these medicines are effective for most ADHD patients, benefits may wear off, suggesting tolerance. This paper reviews the published literature on tolerance to stimulant medication treatment for ADHD. As there are relatively few studies published, pivotal studies and ADHD treatment guidelines were also reviewed. Research demonstrates physiological changes related to continued stimulant usage in neurons and certain brain regions, suggesting a mechanism for tolerance development. One clinical study showed that 24.7% of patients developed tolerance to stimulants in the time of days to weeks; another showed 2.7% developed tolerance over 10 years. Long term follow-up studies demonstrate that medication response may lessen over longer durations of treatment in a high percentage of patients. Strategies to manage tolerance include switching stimulant medicines, drug holidays, or clinical reassessment. Three cases illustrate challenges with treating patients who develop tolerance to stimulant medication. The paucity of research and lack of guidance to clinicians may contribute to significant under recognition of tolerance to stimulant medication. Further research is required to define clinical tolerance for stimulants in ADHD and to provide guidance on identifying and managing tolerance in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Co-registration of stereotactic and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images can serve as an alternative for trajectory planning. However, the role of this strategy has not yet been proven by any control studies, and the trajectories of commonly used targets have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the trajectories for various targets, and to assess the role of trajectories realized on fused images in preventing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Data from 1019 patients who underwent electrode placement for deep brain stimulation were acquired. Electrode trajectories were not planned for 396 patients, whereas trajectories were planned for 623 patients. Preoperative various MRI sequences and frame-placed MRI images were fused for trajectory planning. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical characteristics, the stereotactic systems, intracranial hemorrhage cases, and trajectory angles were recorded and analyzed. No statistically significant differences in the proportions of male patients, patients receiving local anesthesia, and diseases or target distributions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05) were found between the trajectory planning group and the non-trajectory planning group, but statistically significant differences were observed in the numbers of both patients and leads associated with symptomatic ICH (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Regarding the ring and arc angle values, statistically significant differences were found among various target groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The anatomic structures through which leads passed were found to be diverse. Trajectory planning based on MRI fusion is a safe technique for lead placement. The electrode for each given target has its own relatively constant trajectory.</p>

	<p>Background and Purpose: Previous studies showed that acute reocclusion after endovascular therapy is related to residual stenosis. However, we observed that reperfusion status but not residual stenosis severity is related to acute reocclusion. This study aimed to assess which factor mention above is more likely to be associated with artery reocclusion after endovascular treatment. Methods: This study included 86 acute ischemic stroke patients who had middle cerebral artery (MCA) atherosclerotic occlusions and received endovascular treatment within 24 h of a stroke. The primary outcomes included intraprocedural reocclusion assessed during endovascular treatment and delayed reocclusion assessed through follow-up angiography. Results: Of the 86 patients, the intraprocedural reocclusion rate was 7.0% (6/86) and the delayed reocclusion rate was 2.3% (2/86). Regarding intraprocedural occlusion, for patients with severe residual stenosis, patients with successful thrombectomy reperfusion showed a significantly lower rate than unsuccessful thrombectomy reperfusion (0/30 vs. 6/31, p = 0.003); on the other hand, for patients with successful thrombectomy reperfusion, patients with severe residual stenosis showed no difference from those with mild to moderate residual stenosis in terms of intraprocedural occlusion (0/30 vs. 0/25, p = 1.00). In addition, after endovascular treatment, all patients achieved successful reperfusion. There was no significant difference in the delayed reocclusion rate between patients with severe residual stenosis and those with mild to moderate residual stenosis (2/25 vs. 0/61, p = 0.085). Conclusion: Reperfusion status rather than residual stenosis severity is associated with artery reocclusion after endovascular treatment. Once successful reperfusion was achieved, the reocclusion occurrence was fairly low in MCA atherosclerosis stroke patients, even with severe residual stenosis.</p>

	<p>Background: The role of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) has received increased focus in recent studies on the pathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The predictive value for pharmacological treatment and its link to other health or social limitations has been little-studied. This follow-up research on adult patients with ADHD aimed to explore whether the therapy response and health and social impairments depend on baseline individual NET availability. Methods: Data were collected from 10 patients on personal, family and professional situations, mental and physical health and treatments received after baseline via online and telephone surveys and were compared to baseline data to evaluate treatment-related changes. Results: The majority of our ADHD patients did not show therapy responses but showed improvements due to pharmacological treatment. There was no evidence of relationships between pre-treatment NET availability and therapy response or health/social limitations. Conclusions: Pharmacological monotherapy was insufficient to promote symptom remission, especially for participants with extreme insufficiency in NET availability, but improved outcomes in academic and social functioning. Psychotherapy should be considered as an add-on to the standard treatment approach due to its positive outcome in reducing social limitations. The prognostic value of individual NET availability in predicting the response to therapy needs further studies with large sample sizes.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to investigate the association between the functional connectivity (FC) of the olfactory cortex and olfactory performance in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Eighty-two early PD patients and twenty-one healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological assessments from the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progression Markers Initiative database. A whole brain voxel-wise regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the FC of the entorhinal cortex (EC-FC) and olfactory performance. Then, a one-way ANCOVA, based on the regions of interest, was performed with SPSS to investigate the group differences and correlation analysis that were used to analyze the relationships between the FC and neuropsychological assessments. In addition, regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors for the decreased olfactory function. A significantly negative correlation was observed between the olfactory performance and the left EC-FC in the right dorsal cingulate gyrus (dCC) in patients. The PD patients with anosmia exhibited significantly higher FC values than the PD patients with normal olfaction or the PD patients with mild to moderate microsomia. Except for the olfactory performance, no significant correlation was detected between the neuropsychological assessments and the FC values. A linear regression analysis revealed that the increased FC and Geriatric Depression Scale are independently associated with lower the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test scores. The current findings enhanced the understanding of olfactory dysfunction-related pathophysiological mechanisms in early PD and suggested that the left EC-FC in the right dCC may be a potential neuroimaging biomarker for olfactory performance.</p>

	<p>Dysfunctions in body processing have been documented in adults with brain damage, while limited information is available for children. This study aimed to investigate body processing in children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI) (N = 33), compared to peers with typical development. Two well-known computerized body-representation paradigms, namely Visual Body Recognition and Visuo-spatial Imagery, were administered. Through the first paradigm, the body inversion and composite illusion effects were tested with a matching to sample task as measures of configural and holistic processing of others&amp;amp;rsquo; bodies, respectively. The second paradigm investigated with a laterality judgement task the ability to perform first-person and object-based mental spatial transformations of own body and external objects, respectively. Body stimuli did not convey any emotional contents or symbolic meanings. Patients with TBI had difficulties with mental transformations of both body and object stimuli, displaying deficits in motor and visual imagery abilities, not limited to body processing. Therefore, cognitive rehabilitation of body processing in TBI might benefit from the inclusion of both general training on visuo-spatial abilities and specific exercises aimed at boosting visual body perception and motor imagery.</p>

	<p>Background: Inattention and impulsivity are common causes of accidents and injury. The aim of the current study was to examine the level of attention deficit (AD), hyperactivity, and impulsivity (HI) in individuals with and without self-reported impaired wound healing (IWH). Methods: A survey was conducted among N = 773 Dutch young adults, 18&amp;amp;ndash;30 years old. N = 198 were allocated to the IWH group and N = 575 to the control group. All participants completed the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale. Results: The analysis revealed that the IWH group has significantly higher scores on AD and HI, compared to the control group. Among the IWH group, 12.8% screened positive for AD (compared to 5.8% of the control group) and 14.0% screened positive for HI (compared to 7.4% of the control group). Conclusion: Clinically relevant increased inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity were observed among individuals with self-reported impaired wound healing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: posterior approach with sub-laminar wiring as management of comminuted fracture of the odontoid process of the axis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Odontoid fractures (OF) account for 5-18% and 10-19% of all injuries at C2 and in the cervical region, respectively. According to the Anderson and D'Alonzo classification, there are three main types of OF: Type I, II and III. Most cases involving OF of the axis by high impact trauma result in death. Case presentation: A 21-year-old male patient, with comminuted OF caused by a high impact traffic accident. On admission, the patient reported moderate to severe pain in the posterior craniocervical junction, with significant limitation to lateral rotation of the head and severe cervical muscle spasm. There was evidence of comminuted OF of C2 without apparent displacement in the cervical region. The patient underwent surgery via a posterior approach with double sub-laminar wiring between C1 and C2. The procedure was considered to be completely resolutive with no postoperative complications or sequelae, with total recovery of the patient's functionality. Discussion: The posterior approach is a viable option when the anterior approach is not possible due to the nature of the comminuted fracture and risks of complications, even when it involves a degree of compromise in the rotation of the C1-C2 joint. OF is a medical emergency, requiring individualized treatment tailored to the characteristics of the patient. There are currently no standardized treatment guidelines for OF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Haisu: Hierarchically supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Christopher VanHorn, Murat Can Çobanoğlu</p>

We propose a novel strategy for incorporating hierarchical supervised label information into nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Specifically, we extend t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE to include known or predicted class labels and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Our approach, “Haisu,” is applicable across domains and methods of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In general, the mathematical effect of Haisu can be summarized as a variable perturbation of the high dimensional space in which the original data is observed. We thereby preserve the core characteristics of the visualization method and only change the manifold to respect known or assumed class labels when provided. Our strategy is designed to aid in the discovery and understanding of underlying patterns in a dataset that is heavily influenced by parent-child relationships. We show that using our approach can also help in semi-supervised settings where labels are known for only some datapoints (for instance when only a fraction of the cells are labeled). In summary, Haisu extends existing popular visualization methods to enable a user to incorporate labels known <i>a priori</i> into a visualization, including their hierarchical relationships as defined by a user input graph.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetric and adaptive reward coding via normalized reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenway Louie</p>

Learning is widely modeled in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science by prediction error-guided reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. While standard RL assumes linear reward functions, reward-related neural activity is a saturating, nonlinear function of reward; however, the computational and behavioral implications of nonlinear RL are unknown. Here, we show that nonlinear RL incorporating the canonical divisive normalization computation introduces an intrinsic and tunable asymmetry in prediction error coding. At the behavioral level, this asymmetry explains empirical variability in risk preferences typically attributed to asymmetric learning rates. At the neural level, diversity in asymmetries provides a computational mechanism for recently proposed theories of distributional RL, allowing the brain to learn the full probability distribution of future rewards. This behavioral and computational flexibility argues for an incorporation of biologically valid value functions in computational models of learning and decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The spectrum of covariance matrices of randomly connected recurrent neuronal networks with linear dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Hu, Haim Sompolinsky</p>

A key question in theoretical neuroscience is the relation between the connectivity structure and the collective dynamics of a network of neurons. Here we study the connectivity-dynamics relation as reflected in the distribution of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the dynamic fluctuations of the neuronal activities, which is closely related to the network dynamics’ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the associated effective dimensionality. We consider the spontaneous fluctuations around a steady state in a randomly connected recurrent network of stochastic neurons. An exact analytical expression for the covariance eigenvalue distribution in the large-network limit can be obtained using results from random matrices. The distribution has a finitely supported smooth bulk spectrum and exhibits an approximate power-law tail for coupling matrices near the critical edge. We generalize the results to include second-order connectivity motifs and discuss extensions to excitatory-inhibitory networks. The theoretical results are compared with those from finite-size networks and the effects of temporal and spatial sampling are studied. Preliminary application to whole-brain imaging data is presented. Using simple connectivity models, our work provides theoretical predictions for the covariance spectrum, a fundamental property of recurrent neuronal dynamics, that can be compared with experimental data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic fluctuations promote ordered pattern formation of cells in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Madeline Galbraith, Federico Bocci, José N. Onuchic</p>

The Notch-Delta signaling pathway mediates cell differentiation implicated in many regulatory processes including spatiotemporal patterning in tissues by promoting alternate cell fates between neighboring cells. At the multicellular level, this "lateral inhibition” principle leads to checkerboard patterns with alternation of Sender and Receiver cells. While it is well known that stochasticity modulates cell fate specification, little is known about how stochastic fluctuations at the cellular level propagate during multicell pattern formation. Here, we model stochastic fluctuations in the Notch-Delta pathway in the presence of two different noise types–shot and white–for a multicell system. Our results show that intermediate fluctuations reduce disorder and guide the multicell lattice toward checkerboard-like patterns. By further analyzing cell fate transition events, we demonstrate that intermediate noise amplitudes provide enough perturbation to facilitate “proofreading” of disordered patterns and cause cells to switch to the correct ordered state (Sender surrounded by Receivers, and vice versa). Conversely, high noise can override environmental signals coming from neighboring cells and lead to switching between ordered and disordered patterns. Therefore, in analogy with spin glass systems, intermediate noise levels allow the multicell Notch system to escape frustrated patterns and relax towards the lower energy checkerboard pattern while at large noise levels the system is unable to find this ordered base of attraction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the modulation of cortical Up-Down state switching by astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lisa Blum Moyse, Hugues Berry</p>

Up-Down synchronization in neuronal networks refers to spontaneous switches between periods of high collective firing activity (Up state) and periods of silence (Down state). Recent experimental reports have shown that astrocytes can control the emergence of such Up-Down regimes in neural networks, although the molecular or cellular mechanisms that are involved are still uncertain. Here we propose neural network models made of three populations of cells: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes, interconnected by synaptic and gliotransmission events, to explore how astrocytes can control this phenomenon. The presence of astrocytes in the models is indeed observed to promote the emergence of Up-Down regimes with realistic characteristics. Our models show that the difference of signalling timescales between astrocytes and neurons (seconds versus milliseconds) can induce a regime where the frequency of gliotransmission events released by the astrocytes does not synchronize with the Up and Down phases of the neurons, but remains essentially stable. However, these gliotransmission events are found to change the localization of the bifurcations in the parameter space so that with the addition of astrocytes, the network enters a bistability region of the dynamics that corresponds to Up-Down synchronization. Taken together, our work provides a theoretical framework to test scenarios and hypotheses on the modulation of Up-Down dynamics by gliotransmission from astrocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pooling strategies in V1 can account for the functional and structural diversity across species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Victor Boutin, Angelo Franciosini, Frédéric Chavane, Laurent U. Perrinet</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective to orientation with various degrees of selectivity to the spatial phase, from high selectivity in simple cells to low selectivity in complex cells. Various computational models have suggested a possible link between the presence of phase invariant cells and the existence of orientation maps in higher mammals’ V1. These models, however, do not explain the emergence of complex cells in animals that do not show orientation maps. In this study, we build a theoretical model based on a convolutional network called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) and show that a single computational mechanism, pooling, allows the SDPC model to account for the emergence in V1 of complex cells with or without that of orientation maps, as observed in distinct species of mammals. In particular, we observed that pooling in the feature space is directly related to the orientation map formation while pooling in the retinotopic space is responsible for the emergence of a complex cells population. Introducing different forms of pooling in a predictive model of early visual processing as implemented in SDPC can therefore be viewed as a theoretical framework that explains the diversity of structural and functional phenomena observed in V1.

Conferences are spaces to meet and network within and across academic and technical fields, learn about new advances, and share our work. They can help define career paths and create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities. However, these opportunities are not equal for all. This article introduces 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference based on the authors’ recent experience organizing the 2021 edition of the useR! statistical computing conference, which attracted a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector. Coming from different backgrounds, career stages, and even continents, we embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and making it a kind, inclusive, and accessible experience for as many people as possible. The rules result from our lessons learned before, during, and after the organization of the conference. They have been written mainly for potential organizers and selection committees of conferences and contain multiple practical tips to help a variety of events become more accessible and inclusive. We see this as a starting point for conversations and efforts towards building more inclusive conferences across the world. * Translated versions of the English abstract and the list of rules are available in 10 languages in S1 Text: Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Thai.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Helix 8 in chemotactic receptors of the complement system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Szymon Wisniewski, Paulina Dragan, Anna Makal, Dorota Latek</p>

Host response to infection involves the activation of the complement system leading to the production of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Complement factor C5a exerts its effect through the activation of C5aR1, chemotactic receptor 1, and triggers the G protein-coupled signaling cascade. Orthosteric and allosteric antagonists of C5aR1 are a novel strategy for anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we discuss recent crystal structures of inactive C5aR1 in terms of an inverted orientation of helix H8, unobserved in other GPCR structures. An analysis of mutual interactions of subunits in the C5aR1—G protein complex has provided new insights into the activation mechanism of this distinct receptor. By comparing two C5aR receptors C5aR1 and C5aR2 we explained differences between their signaling pathways on the molecular level. By means of molecular dynamics we explained why C5aR2 cannot transduce signal through the G protein pathway but instead recruits beta-arrestin. A comparison of microsecond MD trajectories started from active and inactive C5aR1 receptor conformations has provided insights into details of local and global changes in the transmembrane domain induced by interactions with the Gα subunit and explained the impact of inverted H8 on the C5aR1 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Gr64 cluster of gustatory receptors promotes survival and proteostasis of epithelial cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael E. Baumgartner, Alex Mastrogiannopoulos, Iwo Kucinski, Paul F. Langton, Eugenia Piddini</p>

Gustatory Receptor 64 (Gr64) genes are a cluster of 6 neuronally expressed receptors involved in sweet taste sensation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Gr64s modulate calcium signalling and excitatory responses to several different sugars. Here, we discover an unexpected nonneuronal function of Gr64 receptors and show that they promote proteostasis in epithelial cells affected by proteotoxic stress. Using heterozygous mutations in ribosome proteins (<i>Rp</i>), which have recently been shown to induce proteotoxic stress and protein aggregates in cells, we show that <i>Rp/+</i> cells in <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs up-regulate expression of the entire Gr64 cluster and depend on these receptors for survival. We further show that loss of Gr64 in <i>Rp/+</i> cells exacerbates stress pathway activation and proteotoxic stress by negatively affecting autophagy and proteasome function. This work identifies a noncanonical role in proteostasis maintenance for a family of gustatory receptors known for their function in neuronal sensation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">If amyloid drives Alzheimer disease, why have anti-amyloid therapies not yet slowed cognitive decline?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christian Haass, Dennis Selkoe</p>

Strong genetic evidence supports an imbalance between production and clearance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia that are potentially involved in alternative mechanisms are actually integral to the amyloid cascade. Fluid biomarkers and brain imaging place accumulation of Aβ at the beginning of molecular and clinical changes in the disease. So why have clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies not provided clear-cut benefits to patients with AD? Can anti-amyloid therapies robustly decrease Aβ in the human brain, and if so, could this lowering be too little, too late? These central questions in research on AD are being urgently addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Likely community transmission of COVID-19 infections between neighboring, persistent hotspots in Ontario, Canada [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to support decision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis, space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positive individuals. Methods: COVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) in municipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran’s I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries. The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-available software, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital maps for public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contact tracing and distribution of other resources.  Results: This study provided indicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission through innovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging. Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, and presence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions: Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Framing and understanding the whole aspect of oral sex from social and health perspectives: a narrative review [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Historically, oral sex is part of human sexual behaviour even though some consider it taboo, and its expression is deemed inappropriate. Human rights also stand out as technology becomes more sophisticated, leading to its practice disclosure in the 21st century. The large-scale oral sex discussion in media encourages people to express it, and there is feedback on whether it is right or not. It all depends on each person’s values. We found this sexual behaviour occurs everywhere regardless of religion, culture and race. Pop culture influences this behaviour considerably. It can be seen in music, movies and television programmes that allude to oral sex. Numerous motivations underlying this behaviour include sexual pleasure for the sake of psychological well-being. It is undeniable that this behaviour is still controversial. There is a risk of it causing disease, but it reportedly provides many benefits. Oral sex is not a new behaviour crossing boundaries, according to our theory. It is an old behaviour that has been highlighted because of the factors that support it. This behaviour, still considered taboo, has its disadvantages, such as sexually transmitted disease and oral cancer, but also has benefits, such as preventing preeclampsia.
