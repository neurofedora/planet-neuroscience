              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08405">Field-theoretic approach to compartmental neuronal networks: impact of dendritic calcium spike-dependent bursting</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons are spatially extended cells; different parts of a neuron have specific voltage dynamics. Important types of neurons even generate different spikes in different parts of the cell. Neurons' inputs are also often spatially compartmentalized, with different sources targeting different locations on the cell. Classic mean-field theories for neural population activity, however, rely on point-neuron models with at most one type of spike. Here, we develop a statistical field-theoretic approach to understanding collective activity in networks of compartmental neurons, including those generating multiple types of spikes. We use this to examine simple models of networks with thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal cells, which generate calcium spikes in their apical dendrite when dendritic depolarization coincides with a back-propagating somatic spike. In the weakly-coupled regime, we uncover an exact mean-field limit for these networks that maps them to a marked point process. We use this mean-field limit to compare the impact of compartmentalized recurrent excitatory and inhibitory connectivity on the equilibrium phase diagram. This exposes regions of metastability between various activity states, including activity with silent vs active dendrites, with and without inhibitory activity, and oscillations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08681">Multi-dimensional Neural Decoding with Orthogonal Representations for Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current brain-computer interfaces primarily decode single motor variables, limiting their ability to support natural, high-bandwidth neural control that requires simultaneous extraction of multiple correlated motor dimensions. We introduce Multi-dimensional Neural Decoding (MND), a task formulation that simultaneously extracts multiple motor variables (direction, position, velocity, acceleration) from single neural population recordings. MND faces two key challenges: cross-task interference when decoding correlated motor dimensions from shared cortical representations, and generalization issues across sessions, subjects, and paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose OrthoSchema, a multi-task framework inspired by cortical orthogonal subspace organization and cognitive schema reuse. OrthoSchema enforces representation orthogonality to eliminate cross-task interference and employs selective feature reuse transfer for few-shot cross-session, subject and paradigm adaptation. Experiments on macaque motor cortex datasets demonstrate that OrthoSchema significantly improves decoding accuracy in cross-session, cross-subject and challenging cross-paradigm generalization tasks, with larger performance improvements when fine-tuning samples are limited. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effects of all components are crucial, with OrthoSchema effectively modeling cross-task features and capturing session relationships for robust transfer. Our results provide new insights into scalable and robust neural decoding for real-world BCI applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08922">Neural correlates of learned categorical perception of visual stimuli with local features</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to categorize requires distinguishing category members from non-members by detecting the features that covary with membership. Whether this process can induce changes in perception is still a matter of debate. In prior studies, wereported Learned Categorical Perception (Learned CP) effects in the form of between-category separation and within-category compression in perceived similarity after training subjects to categorize visual stimuli with distributed, holistic features.These effects were correlated with changes in an early, perceptual component of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Using the same methodology, in this experiment we trained 96 subjects to sort line drawings of fish with local, verbalizable features into two categories by trial and error with corrective feedback. We tested for Learned CP effects and their neural correlates by measuring subjects' pairwise dissimilarity judgments and(ERPs) before and after the training. With the same frequency of trials and feedback,about 40% of the participants succeeded in learning the categories ("learners") while the rest did not ("non-learners"). Learners showed a) significant between-category separation and within-category compression after training compared to before and b) an increase in a late parietal ERP positivity (LPC; 400-600 ms) and an early, occipital positivity (P1; 80-140 ms), correlated with categorization accuracy and degree of Learned CP. These behavioral and neural changes after learning a category, absent in Non Learners, provide further evidence that category learning can modulate perceptual processes, regardless of the nature of the visual features. We complement our experimental results with a neural net model using the same stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08289">Understanding Transformers through the Lens of Pavlovian Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and (3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone, but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over millions of years of evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08435">Fast weight programming and linear transformers: from machine learning to neurobiology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548">Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities.
  Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges.
  Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key.
  Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation.
  An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14213">Effective and anatomical connectivity of the dorso-central insula during the processing of action forms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.14213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In both human and monkeys the observation and execution of actions produced the activation of a network consisting of parietal and frontal areas. Although this network is involved in the encoding of the action goal, it does not consider the affective component of the action: vitality form (VF). Several studies showed that the observation and execution of actions conveying VFs selectively activated the dorso-central insula (DCI). In the present study, we aimed to clarify, by using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), the direction of the information flow across DCI, parieto-frontal areas (PMv, IPL) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) during both observation and execution of actions conveying VFs. Results indicate that, during observation, DCI receives the visual input from pSTS, and, in turn, sends it to the fronto-parietal network. Moreover, DCI significantly modulates PMv. Conversely, during execution, the motor input starts from PMv, reaches DCI and IPL, with a significant modulation from PMv to DCI. The reciprocal exchange of information between PMv and DCI suggests that these areas work closely together in the VFs action processing. An additional tractography analysis corroborates our DCM models, showing a correspondence between functional connections and anatomical tracts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14498">Diverging network architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome and signaling network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.14498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connectome describes the complete set of synaptic contacts through which neurons communicate. While the architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome has been extensively characterized, much less is known about the organization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions between neurons. Understanding how effective communication pathways relate to or diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in neuroscience. Here, we analyze the modular architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ signal propagation network, measured via calcium imaging and optogenetics, and compare it to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy. Compared to the connectome, we find that signaling modules are not aligned with the modular boundaries of the anatomical network, highlighting an instance where function deviates from structure. However, we find that some of the most striking features of the anatomical network are preserved, as exemplified by the pharynx, which is delineated into a separate community in both anatomy and signaling. We analyze the cellular compositions of the signaling architecture and find that its modules are enriched for specific cell types and functions, suggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically relevant. Lastly, we identify a "rich club" of hub neurons in the signaling network. The membership of the signaling rich club differs from the rich club detected in the anatomical network, challenging the view that structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional (signaling) networks. Our results provide new insight into the interplay between brain structure, in the form of a complete synaptic-level connectome, and brain function, in the form of a system-wide causal signal propagation atlas.

Abstract: In realistic neural circuits, both neurons and synapses are coupled in dynamics with separate time scales. The circuit functions are intimately related to these coupled dynamics. However, it remains challenging to understand the intrinsic properties of the coupled dynamics. Here, we develop the neuron-synapse coupled quasi-potential method to demonstrate how learning induces the qualitative change in macroscopic behaviors of recurrent neural networks. We find that under the Hebbian learning, a large Hebbian strength will alter the nature of the chaos transition, from a continuous type to a discontinuous type, where the onset of chaos requires a smaller synaptic gain compared to the non-plastic counterpart network. In addition, our theory predicts that under feedback and homeostatic learning, the location and type of chaos transition are retained, and only the chaotic fluctuation is adjusted. Our theoretical calculations are supported by numerical simulations.

                arXiv:2204.05138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the iterative updating of the human working memory system. It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level representational patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). Representations held in persistent activity are recursively replaced resulting in incremental changes to the content of the working memory system. As this content gradually evolves, successive processing states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article will explore how this architecture can lead to iterative shift in the distribution of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between processing states, and thus to human-like thought and cognition. Like the human brain, this AI working memory store will be linked to multiple imagery (topographic map) generation systems corresponding to various sensory modalities. As working memory is iteratively updated, the maps created in response will construct sequences of related mental imagery. Thus, neural networks emulating the prefrontal cortex and its reciprocal interactions with early sensory and motor cortex capture the imagery guidance functions of the human brain. This sensory and motor imagery creation, coupled with an iteratively updated working memory store may provide an AI system with the cognitive assets needed to achieve synthetic consciousness or artificial sentience.

                arXiv:2508.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space. Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by the CMA-ES algorithm.

                arXiv:2508.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

                arXiv:2508.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters, making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks, there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex network architectures and learning tasks.

                arXiv:2503.02303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on current goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.

                arXiv:2504.13522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting in financial markets requires integrating diverse data sources, from historical prices to macroeconomic indicators and financial news. However, existing models often fail to align these modalities effectively, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based deep learning framework, Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF), that fuses structured and unstructured financial data for improved market prediction. The model incorporates a tensor interpretation module for feature selection and an auto-training pipeline for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results using FTSE 100 stock data demonstrate that CMTF achieves superior performance in price direction classification compared to classical and deep learning baselines. These findings suggest that our framework is an effective and scalable solution for real-world cross-modal financial forecasting tasks.

">Disentangling the influences of pre- and postnatal periods on human cortical microstructure</a></h4>

              
                During late gestation and early postnatal development a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors drive the maturation of the human cortex. This process is regionally heterogeneous, with cortical areas developing at different paces and trajectories. Leveraging submillimetre T1-weighted/T2w-weighted (T1w/T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from pre- and full-term neonates (n = 599, 0-7 weeks), we sampled intracortical microstructure profiles across the cortex and characterised the profiles' shapes according to their central moments. We found that gestational age at birth dominated the effects on early cortical development, with significant, global increases in microstructural density, increasing intracortical homogeneity and a bimodal change of the microstructural balance between superficial and deeper cortical layers. On the other hand, weeks since birth (i.e. postnatal age) exhibited different effects on microstructure, with density increasing at a slower pace, increasing intracortical heterogeneity, and intracortical balance only shifting towards deeper layers in posterior temporal, occipital, medial parietal areas and some prefrontal areas. These effects align with low spatial-frequency geometric eigenmodes of the human cortex, specifically the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and central-polar axes. Our findings demonstrate that separating prenatal from postnatal influences, and analysing intracortical profiles rather than macroscale features, provides finer-grained insights into how human cortical microstructure changes during perinatal development and lays the groundwork for investigating the biological underpinnings that govern normative cortical maturation.

                <p>Interoception and associated subjective states shape adaptive behaviors. In humans, interoceptive information is hierarchically processed in the insular cortex (IC), being integrated first in the posterior IC (PIC) and then processed in the anterior IC (AIC) to generate subjective states. However, it has not been established whether this is the case in other species nor whether utilization of interoceptive states to guide behavior is also specifically associated with functional engagement of the AIC, as suggested by this hierarchical model. We investigated in male Sprague Dawley rats whether the use of pharmacologically induced internal states to guide instrumental behavior in a discrimination task functionally engages the AIC as opposed to the mere experience of such states. Rats trained to use the interoceptive state produced by the centrally acting GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or the peripherally acting &beta;-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol to guide their behavior performed as well in a discrimination task as those trained to use an exteroceptive visual discriminative stimulus. While interoceptive internal states were as potent as exteroceptive cues to guide instrumental behavior, only the former were associated with an increase in mRNA levels of the cellular plasticity marker, zif268 in the PIC, as assessed using qPCR. In contrast, zif268 mRNA levels increased in the AIC only after rats had used PTZ-induced interoceptive states to guide behavior, not simply in response to PTZ administration. These results show that in rats, the utilization of interoceptive states to guide behavior is associated with functional engagement of the AIC.</p>

                <p>Despite the vivid experience of homogeneous vision, our visual system is inherently endowed with highly inhomogeneous structures. Although the temporal characteristics of visual responses vary with eccentricity, the connection between this variation, the speed of visual processing, and its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remains a topic of debate. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of high-precision gaze positions and EEG activity to investigate how foveal and perifoveal stimulations impact reaction times (RTs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Volunteers discriminated the position and orientation of a U-shaped figure with the aperture facing either upward or downward. Stimuli were presented briefly (50 ms) either in the foveola (0.33&deg;) or perifovea (6.5&deg;), to the right or left of the fixation point. Stimulus size in the perifovea condition was adjusted according to the cortical magnification factor (stimulus size: 0.2&deg; and 0.75&deg; for the foveola and perifovea conditions, respectively). When stimuli were equated for sensitivity and cortical area of stimulation, we observed faster RTs in the perifovea condition (16.8 &plusmn; 4 ms) compared to the foveola. The analysis of the VEP revealed a similar effect for the N1 response (11.0 &plusmn; 4 ms), a parieto-occipital component associated with discriminative processing and influenced by spatial attention. Overall, our findings suggest that visual discrimination speeds vary across eccentricities, with faster processing and shorter latency of early visual responses in the perifovea compared to the foveola.</p>

                <p>by Sunyoung Park, John T. Serences</p>

Top-down feedback from prefrontal cortex (PFC) can enhance the gain of feature selective neurons in early sensory areas that are tuned to behaviorally relevant stimuli (termed <i>feature-based attention</i>). Importantly, feature-based attention can even modulate the gain of neurons that do not respond directly to the spatial location of the relevant stimulus, a phenomenon that is thought to globally prime sensitivity to detect relevant features – irrespective of their location – during visual search. However, the neurons in PFC that are thought to provide top-down feedback typically have high-dimensional tuning for multiple features, so it is unclear how feedback selectively modulates responses in neurons tuned to a relevant stimulus without incidentally causing interference by co-modulating neurons tuned to irrelevant features. To investigate this issue, we adapted a spiking neural network model with a first ‘sensory’ layer composed of neurons selective for single features. Neurons in a second ‘control’ layer formed random and reciprocal connections with different sensory neurons, giving rise to PFC-like high-dimensional feature tuning. Stimulating second layer neurons that responded robustly to a relevant stimulus led to corresponding gain modulations in sensory neurons that were directly driven by a relevant stimulus. Importantly, no spurious stimulus-like representations arose in unstimulated sensory neurons – despite high-dimensional tuning in second layer neurons – because the random connections averaged out feedback targeted on irrelevant features. Next, we show that subtly increasing the probability that similarly tuned sensory neurons converge on the same second layer neurons can yield most of the noise-cancelling benefits of completely random connections while simultaneously producing spatially global feature-selective modulations in unstimulated sensory neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that a delicate balance between randomness and structure can support top-down feedback signals that globally enhance sensory neurons tuned to relevant features, without leading to spurious stimulus representations that might interfere with perceptual processing.

                <p>by Eric C. Dykeman</p>

Efficient functioning of the prokaryotic translational system depends on a steady supply of aminoacylated tRNAs to be delivered to translating ribosomes via ternary complex. As such, tRNA synthetases play a crucial role in maintaining efficient and accurate translation in the cell, as they are responsible for aminoacylating the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. Moreover, the kinetic rate at which they perform this reaction will dictate the overall rate of supply of aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosome and will have consequences for the average translational speed of ribosomes in the cell. In this work, I develop an empirical kinetic model for the 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase enzymes in <i>E. coli</i> enabling the study of the effects of tRNA charging dynamics on translational efficiency. The model is parametrised based on <i>in vitro</i> experimental measurements of substrate <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values for both pyrophosphate exchange and aminoacylation. The model also reproduces the burst kinetics observed in class I enzymes and the transfer rates measured in single turnover experiments. Stochastic simulation of <i>in vivo</i> translation shows the kinetic model is able to support the tRNA charging demand resulting from translation in exponentially growing <i>E. coli</i> cells at a variety of different doubling times. This work provides a basis for the theoretical study of the amino acid starvation and the stringent response, as well as the complex behaviour of tRNA charging and translational dynamics in response to cellular stresses.

                <p>by Tomoko Sakiyama, Akihiro Takahara</p>

Many studies have proposed spatial game theory on network systems. Heterogeneous structures seem to contribute to population dynamics. However, few studies have addressed both dynamical population evolution and network growth events, especially incorporating individual players’ decision-making processes into the model. In this study, we considered a spatial prisoner’s dilemma (SPD) on a random network. In our model, the players were allowed to access the recent past information on themselves and neighboring players. In the “unlikely to happen” scenario, players adopted a strategy that rarely happens, which may have brought some risks to players. Moreover, the players in our model evolved their link with other players by altering their neighborhood when they received a low payoff. As a result, we found that our model spontaneously evolved as an approximate scale-free network around a critical parameter. Interestingly, hub players sometimes decreased their node degree; thus, these players are changeable in our system.

A mechanistic understanding of how intracellular pathogens evade the intrinsic defenses of their host cells could open up intriguing therapeutic opportunities. Here, we applied a genome-wide genetic screening approach to investigate the nature of the defensive host cell death response suppressed by the membrane trafficking modulator CpoS, an effector protein secreted by the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. Initially, this work revealed a CpoS-deficient mutant to exhibit a markedly increased dependence on host cellular synthesis of ceramides, the precursors of complex sphingolipids. Using novel microscopic reporters, we then established CpoS’ role in defense evasion to occur by preserving the integrity of <i>Chlamydia</i>’s parasitophorous vacuole (the inclusion) via ensuring an adequate sphingolipid supply. More specifically, we observed CpoS deficiency to destabilize inclusions, initially characterized by a release of individual bacteria into the host cell cytosol, then followed by inclusion rupture concomitant with host cell death. Exogenous addition of sphingosine stabilized CpoS-deficient inclusions, whereas disruption of host cellular ceramide synthesis destabilized wild-type inclusions. In combination, CpoS deficiency and impaired ceramide synthesis – presumably disrupting both <i>Chlamydia</i>’s vesicular and non-vesicular sphingolipid supply routes – destabilized inclusions even earlier, resulting in infection clearance and host cell survival rather than host cell death. Overall, this study highlights how the vacuolar pathogen <i>C. trachomatis</i> maintains vacuole integrity by ensuring a steady sphingolipid supply, potentially offering inspiration and directions for future therapeutic strategies targeting parasitophorous vacuoles.

                Noxious heat sensation involves multiple molecular receptors that operate under complex regulatory mechanisms. In a recent study, Gao, Yan, and colleagues identified Copine-6 as a calcium-sensitive phospholipid-binding protein that promotes TRPM3 trafficking to the plasma membrane in thermal sensory neurons and thereby enhances noxious heat sensitivity in mice. These findings expand current understanding of the mechanisms regulating thermal sensation.

                Gut microbiome and its metabolic byproducts have significant influence on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Song et al. report that NSCLC-depleted gut probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis suppresses NSCLC in experimental models. Mechanistically, B. animalis-derived indole-3 acetic acid modulates AHR/METTL3/STAT3 axis and improves tumor immunity to prevent NSCLC progression.

                Rao et al. demonstrate that convergent somatic hypermutations in the light chain, enriched within a sarbecovirus-specific public antibody clonotype, drive affinity maturation. This antibody targets a previously undescribed central interface epitope, occluded in pre-fusion spike, with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations boosting serum antibodies targeting this epitopic region.

We further demonstrated functional roles of human imGC-enriched proton-transporting ATPase subtypes in neuronal development.

                A combination of sectioning and microscopy techniques, along with the application of finite-difference-time-domain modeling on a fossil feather, results in the novel estimation of the range of iridescent colors from the fossilized melanosome type and organization preserved in the elongate head crest feathers of a new Cretaceous enantiornithine bird. The densely packed rod-like melanosomes are estimated to have yielded from red to deep blue iridescent coloration of the head feathers. The shape and density of these melanosomes also may have further increased the feather’s structural strength. This occurrence on a likely male individual is highly suggestive of both a signaling function of the iridescent crest and a potential behavioral role in adjusting the angle of light incidence to control the display of this iridescent structural coloration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102515">An increase in reactive oxygen species underlies neonatal cerebellum repair</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal mouse cerebellum shows remarkable regenerative potential upon injury at birth, wherein a subset of Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) undergoes adaptive reprogramming to replenish granule cell progenitors that die. Here, we investigate how the microenvironment of the injured cerebellum changes upon injury and contributes to the regenerative potential of normally gliogenic-NEPs and their adaptive reprogramming. Single-cell transcriptomic and bulk chromatin accessibility analyses of the NEPs from injured neonatal cerebella compared to controls show a temporary increase in cellular processes involved in responding to reactive oxygen species (ROS), a known damage-associated molecular pattern. Analysis of ROS levels in cerebellar tissue confirms a transient increase 1 day after injury at postnatal day 1, overlapping with the peak cell death in the cerebellum. In a transgenic mouse line that ubiquitously overexpresses human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT), ROS is reduced 1 day after injury to the granule cell progenitors, and we demonstrate that several steps in the regenerative process of NEPs are curtailed, leading to reduced cerebellar growth. We also provide preliminary evidence that microglia are involved in one step of adaptive reprogramming by regulating NEP replenishment of the granule cell precursors. Collectively, our results highlight that changes in the tissue microenvironment regulate multiple steps in adaptive reprogramming of NEPs upon death of cerebellar granule cell progenitors at birth, highlighting the instructive roles of microenvironmental signals during regeneration of the neonatal brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104779">A tight relationship between BOLD fMRI activation/deactivation and increase/decrease in single neuron responses in human association cortex</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and increases or decreases in neural firing rate across human brain regions, especially the association cortex, remains largely unknown. Here, we contrast direct measures of neuronal activity in two adjacent brain regions of the fusiform gyrus (FG) associated with fMRI increases (lateral FG portion) or decreases (medial FG portion) of the same category-selective neural activity. In both individual brains tested across multiple recording sessions, a frequency-tagging stimulation objectively identified a substantial proportion (about 70%) of face-selective neurons. While single units recorded in the lateral FG showed a selective increase to faces, neurons localized in the medial FG decreased spiking activity selectively to faces. Beyond a relative reduction to faces compared to non-face objects, about a third of the single neurons found in the medial FG showed genuine suppression of baseline spiking activity upon presentation of a face. These observations clarify the nature of face-selective neural activity in the human brain, which can be expressed both as increases and active suppressions of spiking activity and, more generally, shed light on the physiological basis of the fMRI signal.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106892">Domain coupling in allosteric regulation of SthK measured using time-resolved transition metal ion FRET</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) ion channels are vital for cellular signaling and excitability, with activation regulated by cyclic adenosine- or guanosine-monophosphate (cAMP, cGMP) binding. However, the allosteric mechanisms underlying this activation, particularly the energetics that describe conformational changes within individual domains and between domains, remain unclear. The prokaryotic CNBD channel SthK has been a useful model for better understanding these allosteric mechanisms. Previously, we applied time-resolved transition metal ion Förster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) to investigate the conformational dynamics and energetics in the CNBD of a soluble C-terminal fragment of the SthK protein, SthK<sub>Cterm</sub> (Eggan et al., 2024). Here, we used a similar strategy to measure the conformational energetics of the CNBD in the full-length channel, SthK<sub>Full</sub>, and compared them to measurements from SthK<sub>Cterm</sub>. We incorporated the noncanonical amino acid Acd as a FRET donor and a metal bound to a chelator conjugated to a cysteine as an acceptor. We used time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) to measure time-resolved FRET and fit the TCSPC data to obtain donor-acceptor distance distributions in the absence and presence of cAMP. The distance distributions allowed us to quantify the energetics of coupling between the C-terminal domains and the transmembrane domains by comparing the donor-acceptor distance distributions for SthK<sub>Cterm</sub> and SthK<sub>Full</sub>. Our data indicate that the presence of the SthK transmembrane domains makes the activating conformational change in the CNBD more favorable. These findings highlight the power of time-resolved tmFRET to uncover the structural and energetic landscapes of allosteric proteins and of the ligand-mediated mechanism in CNBD channels specifically.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103844">Glaucoma-associated Optineurin mutations increase transcellular degradation of mitochondria in a vertebrate optic nerve</a></h4>

              
                We previously described a process whereby mitochondria shed by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons are transferred to and degraded by surrounding astrocytes in the optic nerve head of mice. Since the mitophagy receptor Optineurin (OPTN) is one of few large-effect glaucoma genes and axonal damage occurs at the optic nerve head in glaucoma, here we explored whether OPTN mutations perturb the transcellular degradation of mitochondria. Live-imaging of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> optic nerves revealed that diverse human mutant but not wildtype OPTN increase stationary mitochondria and mitophagy machinery and their colocalization within, and in the case of the glaucoma-associated OPTN mutations also outside of, RGC axons. These extra-axonal mitochondria are degraded by astrocytes. Our studies demonstrate that expression of OPTN carrying a glaucoma-associated mutation results in increased transcellular degradation of axonal mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94918">An Hfq-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism fine tunes RecB expression in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                All living organisms have developed strategies to respond to chromosomal damage and preserve genome integrity. One such response is the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), one of the most toxic forms of DNA lesions. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, DSBs are repaired via RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination. RecBCD is essential for accurate chromosome maintenance, but its over-expression can lead to reduced DNA repair ability. This apparent paradox suggests that RecBCD copy numbers may need to be tightly controlled within an optimal range. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have established that RecB is present in very low abundance at mRNA and protein levels. RecB transcription shows high fluctuations, yet cell-to-cell protein variability remains remarkably low. Here, we show that the post-transcriptional regulator Hfq binds to <i>recB</i> mRNA and downregulates RecB protein translation in vivo. Furthermore, specific disruption of the Hfq-binding site leads to more efficient translation of <i>recB</i> mRNAs. In addition, we observe a less effective reduction of RecB protein fluctuations in the absence of Hfq. This fine-tuning Hfq-mediated mechanism might have the underlying physiological function of maintaining RecB protein levels within an optimal range.

We extended an experiment simulating selection in response to herbivory in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to assess a potential contribution of epigenetic variation to the selected phenotypes within three accessions. To minimize maternal effects, we grew offspring from replicate populations and their ancestors for two generations in a common environment and assessed the phenotypes in the second generation. We found weak evidence for the selection of epigenetic variation: bolting time differed significantly in one accession. Significant differences between maternal lines suggested random residual or novel genetic and/or epigenetic variation. Our results are in conflict with those of a recent study reporting that environment-induced heritable variation is common in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Reanalyzing the data from that study showed that the reported findings resulted from a mix-up of accessions and, thus, reflected genetic rather than epigenetic variation between accessions. To avoid future misinterpretations of studies investigating epigenetic inheritance, we provide guidelines to design experiments that clearly differentiate between epigenetic and genetic variation and distinguish standing variation from de novo variation acquired during an experiment.

">Evaluating scientific theories as predictive models in language neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Modern data-driven encoding models are highly effective at predicting brain responses to language stimuli. However, these models struggle to explain the underlying phenomena, i.e. what features of the stimulus drive the response? We present Question Answering encoding models, a method for converting qualitative theories of language selectivity into highly accurate, interpretable models of brain responses. QA encoding models annotate a language stimulus by using a large language model to answer yes-no questions corresponding to qualitative theories. A compact QA encoding model that uses only 35 questions outperforms existing baselines at predicting brain responses in both fMRI and ECoG data. The model weights also provide easily interpretable maps of language selectivity across cortex; these maps show quantitative agreement with meta-analyses of the existing literature and selectivity maps identified in a follow-up fMRI experiment. These results demonstrate that LLMs can bridge the widening gap between qualitative scientific theories and data-driven models.

">A Computational Model of Action Specification in the Basal Ganglia</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia has traditionally been modelled as a system that represents the available, discrete action space using a finite set of distinct and non-overlapping representational units. This limits these models from addressing questions around how the basal ganglia is involved in action specification: the selection of continuously valued action dynamics such as speed and vigor. In this article we present a novel computational model of the basal ganglia which incorporates vector-symbolic algebras in order to represent continuous action spaces. The stages of model development are presented along with simulation experiments to test the basic properties of the model. This work represents a promising foundational step in providing a mechanistic account for neuroscientific and behavioural evidence implicating the basal ganglia in action specification, thereby filling a gap in the literature.

">Acetylcholine Enhances Deviance Detection in Hodgkin-Huxley Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to detect unexpected events, deviance detection (DD), is critical for survival. While DD has been computationally explained by synaptic plasticity, the role of neuromodulators like acetylcholine (ACh) remains less understood. Here, we examine how ACh modulates DD without invoking additional plasticity mechanisms. Using a cholinergic-sensitive Hodgkin-Huxley network of 200 neurons arranged in 2D space and stimulated via five spatially distinct inputs (A-E), we implemented an oddball paradigm with three conditions: standard (80% A, 20% B), deviant (20% A, 80% B), and a multi-standard control (20% each of A-E). ACh levels were controlled by the conductance of the slow K current. In the absence of ACh, the network already exhibited DD, responding more strongly to deviant A compared to control A. Notably, introducing a small amount of ACh amplified DD, while further increases suppressed it. Maximal DD occurred when strong spike frequency adaptation to standard B reduced competition, and enhanced phase-locking synchronized the network's response to deviant A. These findings reveal how neuromodulation can shape context-sensitive neural computation, optimizing detection of salient events through a dynamic balance of suppression and synchronization.

">δ-catenin haploinsufficiency is sufficient to alter behaviors and glutamatergic synapses in mice</a></h4>

              
                {delta}-catenin (also known as CTNND2) functions as an anchor for the glutamatergic AMPA receptor (AMPARs) to regulate synaptic activity in excitatory synapses. Alteration in the gene coding {delta}-catenin has been implicated in many neurological disorders. Some of these genetic alterations exhibit a profound loss of {delta}-catenin functions in excitatory synapses. We have shown that {delta}-catenin deficiency induced by the homozygous {delta}-catenin knockout (KO) and autism-associated missense glycine 34 to serine (G34S) mutation significantly alters AMPAR-mediated synaptic activity in cortical neurons and disrupts social behavior in mice. Importantly, many genetic disorders are caused by haploinsufficiency. Indeed, {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency contributes to severe autism and learning disabilities in humans. However, previous studies have used only homozygous {delta}-catenin deficiency models. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency on animals' behaviors and excitatory synapses. Here, we use heterozygous {delta}-catenin KO and G34S mice as a {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency model to examine this idea. Multiple behavioral assays, a social behavior test, contextual fear conditioning, and an open field test, reveal that both {delta}-catenin KO and G34S haploinsufficiency significantly disrupt animals' social behavior and fear learning and memory. Interestingly, only KO haploinsufficiency mice show anxiety-like behavior. A biochemical assay using brain extracts demonstrates that {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency significantly affects the levels of synaptic {delta}-catenin and AMPARs. Our findings thus suggest that {delta}-catenin haploinsufficiency affects animals' behaviors via altering glutamatergic synaptic activity.

">From Wiring to Firing: Collapse of embryonic identities and emergence of functional diversity during motor neuron maturation</a></h4>

              
                Neurons born in the embryo undergo a protracted process of maturation during which time they project axons to their specific targets, integrate into circuits, refine synapses, and acquire unique electrophysiological properties. The molecular strategies that individual neuron types deploy to complete this complex process remain poorly understood. In this work, we used single nucleus multiome sequencing (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) to track the transition from specification to functional maturation in mouse skeletal motor neurons (SMNs). Our data show that individual SMNs undergo significant transcriptional changes as they mature, but more strikingly, we find that diversity within SMNs fluctuates dramatically as the functional needs of these cells change over time. At embryonic day E15.5, when motor axons are innervating their specific muscle targets, SMNs can be subdivided into dozens of transcriptional subclusters. These embryonic subclusters represent known motor columns and pools, which utilize column- and pool-specific genes to innervate unique muscle targets. About a week later, at postnatal day 3 (P3) many column- and pool-specific genes are downregulated or become broadly expressed and SMNs coalesce on the molecular level into a more homogenous state. These neurons then undergo a second round of diversification during the first two weeks of postnatal life (P3-P13), acquiring gene expression patterns that divide them into the functionally distinct alpha, gamma, and type3 subtypes found in adults. The fluctuations in SMN diversity go hand-in-hand with changes in accessible chromatin regions and transcription factor (TF) expression. Differential ATAC-seq peaks that define embryonic diversity are lost over time while new peaks that control expression in adult subtypes are gained. TFs that are known to regulate embryonic diversity are also downregulated over time, as a separate set of TFs that likely regulate adult subtype identities are upregulated. Our work uncovers a novel maturation trajectory for postmitotic neurons where extensive spatial diversity is first acquired in the embryo to ensure proper circuit wiring; this diversity is then lost as maturing neurons re-diversify into functional identities required for proper circuit firing in postnatal life. Therefore, all aspects of a neuron's identity - its morphology, circuitry, and electrophysiologically - may not be fully described by its gene expression program at adulthood, but instead is a culmination of transcriptional events that occur throughout its specification and maturation trajectory as the functional needs of the cells evolve.

">Dynamic Neural Encoding of Prior Expectations and Auditory Evidence Drive Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decision-making has been studied extensively as the integration of evidence over time. Yet how moment-to-moment fidelity of sensory encoding interacts with prior expectations in shaping our choices remains poorly understood--particularly in the auditory domain. Here we quantify how priors act at the stage of sensory encoding and how these fluctuations predict behaviour. In a human model-based EEG study, we augmented a canonical click-train evidence accumulation task with probabilistic cues to shape prior expectations and analysed all activity with trial-resolved linear encoding models. Probabilistic cues drove alpha-oscillatory EEG patterns and induced symmetric shifts in response bias but did not change temporal integration dynamics. Neural encoding strength in lateralised auditory cortex uniquely predicted single-trial choice and confidence beyond what was explained by evidence strength or cueing alone. These findings identify sensory encoding fidelity as a mechanistic, behaviourally relevant link between priors and perceptual choice, offering new understanding how neural noise and expectations jointly shape decisions under uncertainty.

">Tactile stimulation transiently disrupts encoding of whisker position by cerebellar molecular layer interneuron ensembles</a></h4>

              
                Molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) within the cerebellar cortex mediate feed-forward inhibition onto Purkinje cells, positioning them as pivotal modulators of cerebellar output. We asked how motor patterns and salient sensory input influence MLI population activity during active whisking and tactile interactions. Utilizing two-photon calcium imaging combined with high-speed videography, we examined MLI population dynamics in awake, behaving mice engaged in voluntary whisker movements. Our results demonstrate that during free whisking, MLI population activity reliably tracks whisker position, yielding uniform graded responses that provide stable and precise representations over time. Tactile contact with external stimuli evokes additional activation in a subset of MLIs. Sensory input transiently disrupts the linear relationship between MLI activity and whisker position and may account for rapid synchronous inhibition of Purkinje cell spiking activity following tactile stimulation. These findings indicate that MLIs in Crus 1 maintain an accurate internal model of whisker position which is perturbed upon encountering obstacles. This disruption likely reflects the integration of sensory feedback, disrupting predictive signals that are subsequently passed forward to Purkinje cells. Such signals can alert the brain to novel happenings and be used to update motor commands, thereby contributing to cerebellar function in response to environmental changes.

">Short-term synaptic dynamics in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial periaqueductal gray</a></h4>

              
                The ability to assess and rapidly respond to predator threats in the environment is necessary for survival and requires dedicated neural circuits for threat detection, sensorimotor integration, and execution of ethologically appropriate behavioral responses. Although numerous brain circuits are involved in these processes, the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) serves as an important central hub to generate ethologically appropriate passive and/or active defensive behaviors. Despite its central role in generating defensive behaviors, little is known about the intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons across columns in the PAG. To address this knowledge gap, we made whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings from unlabeled neurons in the vl- and dmPAG of mice. Consistent with in vivo work, our data highlights the relative importance of synaptic inhibition in both columns. Further, our results suggest that neurons in both the vl- and dmPAG prioritize frequency-invariant coding strategies, showing remarkably stable paired pulse ratios across interstimulus intervals. Despite this common theme, the underlying mechanism each column utilizes to achieve such frequency invariant coding is distinct, reflecting important differences in synaptic processing across columns. More specifically, while the vlPAG is relatively resistant to phasic short-term depression across stimulation frequencies, neurons in the dmPAG show a pronounced buildup of tonic/slow current during high frequency stimulation trains, which counteracts short-term depression of the phasic current amplitude observed during high frequency stimulation trains. This prolonged tonic current observed in the dmPAG prolongs the period of spike elevation, suggesting that high frequency stimulation may drive sustained activity in the dmPAG. Together, these results provide fundamental information of synaptic integration and network properties across columns in the PAG, which ultimately support their distinct roles in threat processing.

">Basal ganglia-independent thalamic bursts do not wake cortex during sleep</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a key forebrain structure that gates peripheral, subcortical, and cortico-cortical communication (1,2). Awake thalamic bursts provide the cortex with a "wake-up" signal (2-4). Paradoxically, thalamic neurons discharge tonically during cellular depolarization and activated brain states (wakefulness, REM sleep) but burst during hyperpolarization and NREM sleep (5-9). It has been proposed that NREM thalamic bursts do not awaken the cortex because of their periodic and synchronized nature (2-4); however, this has never been tested in vivo during natural sleep. We simultaneously recorded polysomnographic signals, local field potentials, and spiking activity from multiple thalamic neurons in the ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei of two female non-human primates during naturally occurring vigilance states. These nuclei receive GABAergic output from the basal ganglia (10,11), with discharge rate and GABA outflow decreasing during NREM sleep (12). We found that despite the expected thalamic depolarization, bursting increased significantly. NREM bursts were neither periodic nor highly synchronized. However, EEG activity time-locked to burst onset during NREM sleep differed markedly from that observed during wakefulness and REM sleep. These results support a modulatory, rather than a driving, relationship between the basal ganglia and thalamus. NREM thalamic bursts do not awaken the cortex, probably due to unique state-dependent thalamocortical dynamics.

">Specific Combinations of Physiological Tau Phosphorylation Regulate Tau-Microtubule Interactions in Developing Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Tau phosphorylation is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, yet it also plays an essential physiological role in stabilizing microtubules (MTs) during normal neuronal development. While individual phosphorylation sites have been well-studied in pathology, it remains largely unknown how combinatorial phosphorylation is regulated under physiological conditions. Here, we uncover distinct, site-specific phosphorylation patterns on tau in developing human neurons. With top-down mass spectrometry we find that functional, endogenous tau is highly modified, with up to 21 phosphates per molecule. We identify patterns of co-occurrence between phosphorylation sites that are in proximity in the linear protein sequence, such as epitopes S202/T205/T212/T217 and T231/S235/S262. Moreover, these phospho-epitopes define discrete pools of tau and regulate tau-MT interactions in coordination, providing a mechanism for fine-tuning the binding of tau to MTs. Intriguingly, we find that co-occurring phospho-epitopes are dynamically regulated in response to changes in MT integrity; chemical perturbation of neuronal MTs promotes rapid tau dephosphorylation by phosphatase PP2a at most sites to enhance tau-MT interactions and counteract destabilization. We then use the PS19 tauopathy mouse model to demonstrate that developmental and pathological tau phosphorylation patterns partially overlap, and that co-occurring phospho-epitopes exhibit similar associations with the insoluble fraction in aged mice. Our results reveal an isoform-dependence on the effects of site-specific tau phosphorylation on its behavior. Together, these findings define a combinatorial phosphorylation code that modulates tau's physiological function in neurons and raises the possibility that MT destabilization precedes tau phosphorylation in disease. This work provides a mechanistic framework for distinguishing functional from pathological tau phosphorylation, with implications for the development of therapies that specifically target disease-associated tau proteoforms.

">Geometric Characterization of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Morphology: A Cross-Sectional and Temporal Analysis using Differential Geometry</a></h4>

              
                Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) involves aggressive inflammation and large lesions; however, its detailed shapes and structures remain poorly understood. Traditional volumetric metrics often overlook the complex geometry of these lesions. The main objective of this study is to develop a differential geometry-based framework to quantify the shape and structure of lesions in pediatric multiple sclerosis(MS) patients using longitudinal 3D FLAIR MRI. The goal was to identify reproducible lesion morphotypes and to track their evolution over time. Our approach sensitively tracked shape changes over time and revealed consistent progression patterns. Our findings suggest that geometric biomarkers offer a powerful new lens for decoding MS heterogeneity and tracking disease activity in the pediatric population.

">SynAnno: Interactive Guided Proofreading of Synaptic Annotations</a></h4>

              
                Connectomics, a subfield of neuroscience, aims to map and analyze synapse-level wiring diagrams of the nervous system. While recent advances in deep learning have accelerated automated neuron and synapse segmentation, reconstructing accurate connectomes still demands extensive human proofreading to correct segmentation errors. We present SynAnno, an interactive tool designed to streamline and enhance the proofreading of synaptic annotations in large-scale connectomics datasets. SynAnno integrates into existing neuroscience workflows by enabling guided, neuron-centric proofreading. To address the challenges posed by the complex spatial branching of neurons, it introduces a structured workflow with an optimized traversal path and a 3D mini-map for tracking progress. In addition, SynAnno incorporates fine-tuned machine learning models to assist with error detection and correction, reducing the manual burden and increasing proofreading efficiency. We evaluate SynAnno through a user and case study involving seven neuroscience experts. Results show that SynAnno significantly accelerates synapse proofreading while reducing cognitive load and annotation errors through structured guidance and visualization support.

">Comparison and Dynamic interaction between Auditory Cortex and Prefrontal Cortex of Behaving Monkeys during Novelty Detection</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect deviations from expected sensory input is critical for adaptive behavior. Here, we investigated the neural dynamics of novelty detection in the auditory cortex (AC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of macaques performing an auditory oddball task. Using high-density electrocorticography and Granger causality analyses (GCA), we identified distinct repetition-related signals in both regions: the AC showed both suppression and facilitation to repeated stimuli, while the PFC exhibited robust enhancement, particularly in low-frequency (2 Hz) oscillatory activity. These predictive responses were accompanied by bidirectional AC-PFC coupling in the delta band, reflecting a temporally coordinated predictive state. Deviant tones elicited early responses in the AC, followed by PFC activation, and were associated with increased feedforward and feedback connectivity across delta, theta, and gamma bands. Task engagement amplified both prediction and prediction-error signals, enhancing interareal interactions and behavioral selectivity. Our results reveal that the AC encodes early sensory regularities and violations, while the PFC supports integrative and state-dependent prediction, jointly forming a distributed cortical network for hierarchical predictive coding.

">Generalized brain-state modeling with KenazLBM</a></h4>

              
                The large-scale functional state of a human brain remains difficult to characterize, much less predict. Regardless, humans have engineered techniques to electrically neuromodulate the brain to treat a subset of neurologic and psychiatric diseases with moderate efficacy. Accurate characterization of a brain's instantaneous functional state has stymied the development of more effective neuromodulation paradigms. Advanced computational methods are required to address this gap and enable large-scale neuroscience. Here we define the concept of generalized brain-state modeling across humans as Large Brain-State Modeling (LBM) and present KenazLBM as the world's first example. KenazLBM can instantaneously characterize the functional state of a person's brain with raw iEEG data, and predict future brain-states. KenazLBM was trained on over 17.9 billion unique multichannel tokens from people undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings, and has learned to meld brain-states between people into a common interpretable topology. Most importantly, the model generalizes to unseen subject data with significant recording channel heterogeneity from the training set. We offer KenazLBM as a first generalized brain-state model to serve as a new paradigm of basic neuroscience inquiry and potential translation into neuromodulation therapeutics.

">B Cell Tolerance and BCR Signaling Dysregulation in NF155-Mediated Autoimmune Nodopathies</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Autoimmune nodopathies (AINs) are a group of rare, acquired autoimmune neuropathies with distinct clinical features and the presence of circulating autoantibodies - often of the immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) subclass - targeting proteins at the node of Ranvier. Defects in B cell tolerance checkpoints have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases. Prior work identified defective B cell tolerance, reflected by a high frequency of self-reactive naive B cells, in patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis (MG), mediated by IgG4 autoantibodies. Here, we investigated whether tolerance defects exist in neurofascin-155-mediated AIN (NF155-AIN), similar to MuSK+ MG. Additionally, we analyzed B and T cell transcriptomics and interactions at the single-cell level to explore the underlying pathomechanism. Methods: Using a well-established assay, we assessed B cell tolerance fidelity by generating recombinant antibodies from new emigrant (NE) and mature naive (MN) B cell populations, directly downstream of key tolerance checkpoints-from three NF155-AIN patients, and testing these antibodies for polyreactivity and autoreactivity, thereby determining the frequency of polyreactive and autoreactive B cells. The transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was studied, with a special focus on naive B cells and CD4+ T cells at the single-cell level, along with characterization of cell-cell interactions. Results: NF155-AIN patients have an elevated frequency of polyreactive B cells in the NE (37.4% compared to 9.7% in healthy controls (HCs), p = 0.03) and MN (31.5% compared to 10.5% in HCs, p = 0.03) compartments with increased B cell clones expressing autoreactive antibodies, consistent with a breach in early tolerance checkpoints. We observed abnormal B cell receptor (BCR) signaling characterized by low CD79B, CSK, BLNK, and BTK expression, which may contribute to a breach in B cell tolerance. We also observed evidence of impaired follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and regulatory T cells (Treg), which may limit the normal development and suppression of autoreactive B cells. Moreover, comparative gene expression analysis of B cells and CD4+ T cells from three patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a related autoimmune neuropathy, confirmed that these differences are largely specific to NF155-AIN, supporting a distinct pathophysiology in this subset. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated a breach in early B cell tolerance checkpoints, defective BCR signaling, and disrupted T cell-B cell interactions in NF155-IN, all of which may contribute to the development of pathogenic autoreactivity. These immunologic abnormalities appear distinct from those seen in CIDP, supporting NF155-AIN as a unique immunopathologic entity.

">Females with epilepsy show abnormal changes to perimenstrual sensory induced long-term potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Catamenial epilepsy refers to a cyclical exacerbation of seizure frequency and/or severity linked to stages of the menstrual cycle. To investigate the contribution of underlying excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms of this exacerbation we induced and measured long-term potentiation (LTP). Oestradiol modulates primarily NMDA receptor driven excitation and would enhance visual LTP. Allopregnanolone modulates GABA receptor mediated inhibition and would suppress visual LTP. Method: A control cohort (n = 25) and a cohort with epilepsy (n = 20) were recruited. Participants took part in a visual LTP task while EEG was recorded. Three study visits were timed to capture the mid-follicular (days +5 to +8), mid-luteal (days -9 to -5) phases, as well as the hormone withdrawal in the perimenstrual phase (days -3 to +2). Blood samples confirmed session timing. Generative computational modelling of thalamocortical changes in the EEG was paired with standard evoked potential analysis. Result: 17 (age 26 +/- 9.40) participants with epilepsy, and a control cohort of 25 (age 30 +/-7.06) without epilepsy completed the study. The P2 visually evoked potential (a positive-going component of the visual event related potential waveform) was significantly more enhanced by LTP induction in the mid-follicular phase than the mid-luteal or perimenstrual phases in the control cohort (F(2, 144) =11.54, p = 0.004 corrected). In contrast, in the epilepsy cohort the P2 was significantly more potentiated in the perimenstrual phase than the mid-follicular or mid-luteal phases (F(2,108) = 12.21, p = 0.005 corrected). The effect of cycle on visual LTP was robust, with only 3/17 participants with epilepsy showing highest P2 modulation in the mid-follicular phase (which is the pattern the healthy cohort showed). The computational modelling showed that in epilepsy, the perimenstrual phase was associated with a decrease in superficial pyramidal grain control as well as decreased LTP driven modulation of feed-forward superficial connections to layer 5 and layer 6 to thalamus. Discussion: Our finding of enhanced visual LTP in the luteal phase and perimenstrual phase of females with epilepsy indicates a breakthrough of glutamatergic excitation. Given the relationship between oestrogen and n-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dependent LTP this is plausibly NMDA receptor driven. Several thalamocortical model parameter changes observed warrant further investigation in studies stratifying participants by catamenial epilepsy type. Overall, while research into allopregnanolone and its inhibitory effects dominate perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy research, this study justifies consideration of the role of seizure exacerbating oestradiol.

">The Hsp40 co-chaperone DNAJC7 modifies polyglutamine but not polyglycine aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, including Huntington's disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias, are caused by abnormally expanded CAG nucleotide repeats, which encode aggregation-prone polyQ tracts. Substantial prior evidence supports a pathogenic role for polyQ protein misfolding and aggregation, with molecular chaperones showing promise in suppressing disease phenotypes in cellular and animal models. In this study, we developed a FRET-based reporter system that models polyQ aggregation in human cells and used it to perform a high-throughput CRISPR interference screen targeting all known molecular chaperones. This screen identified as a strong suppressor of polyQ aggregation the Hsp40 co-chaperone DNAJC7, which has previously been shown to modify aggregation of other disease proteins (tau and TDP-43) and has mutations causative for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We validated this phenotype and further established a physical interaction between DNAJC7 and polyQ-expanded protein. In contrast, DNAJC7 did not modify aggregation of polyglycine (polyG) in a FRET-based model of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. In addition to establishing new inducible, scalable cellular models for polyQ and polyG aggregation, this work expands the role of DNAJC7 in regulating folding of disease-associated proteins.

">When Firing Rate Falls Short: Spike Synchrony to Efficiently Disentangle Stimulus Saliency and Familiarity</a></h4>

              
                The function of temporal coding in the brain remains controversial, with debate centering on the following question: does spike timing information, such as their temporal synchrony, play a meaningful role in neural computation which cannot be attributed to firing rate? We propose the solution to this dilemma: spike synchrony provides crucial information about stimulus familiarity under conditions when the firing rate alone is insufficient - namely, when the input stimulus is varied in saliency. Using simulations of recurrent spiking networks, we show that synchrony is particularly effective in distinguishing familiar stimuli of low saliency from novel stimuli of high saliency - an important distinction for both biological perception and artificial agents navigating dynamic environments. We evaluate familiarity detection across two frameworks: a biologically inspired model of the primary visual cortex (V1) and an abstract associative memory model. We show that in both cases, synchrony is more sensitive to recurrent connectivity, that encodes prior experiences, compared to input firing rate. This highlights the relevance of synchrony for familiarity encoding in a scenario of realistic input variability.

">Online supervised learning of temporal patterns in biological neural networks under feedback control</a></h4>

              
                In vitro biological neural networks (BNNs) provide well-defined model systems for constructively investigating how living cells interact with their environments to shape high-dimensional dynamics that can be used to generate coherent temporal outputs, such as those required for motor control. Here, we develop a real-time closed-loop BNN system that is capable of generating periodic and chaotic temporal signals by integrating cultured cortical neurons with microfluidic devices and high-density microelectrode arrays. We show that training a simple linear decoder with fixed feedback weights enables the system to learn and autonomously generate diverse temporal patterns. When feedback is switched on, the irregular activity in the BNNs is transformed into low-dimensional, structured dynamics, producing coherent trajectories that are characterized by stable transitions between different neural states. BNNs trained on various target frequencies -- ranging from 4 to 30 s -- can be trained to sustain oscillations at distinct frequencies, demonstrating their adaptability. Importantly, top-down control of the self-organized network formation with microfluidic devices is the key to suppressing excessive synchronization and increasing dynamic complexity in BNNs, facilitating the training process and the generation of robust outputs. This work offers a biologically inspired platform for understanding the physical basis of cortical computations and for advancing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing paradigms.

">Rapid cognitive testing predicts real-world driving risk in commercial and medically at-risk drivers</a></h4>

              
                Road safety is a major public and occupational health issue. Safe driving requires numerous cognitive and sensorimotor skills, and past literature suggests that cognitive testing can predict safe or unsafe driving in both healthy and medically at-risk drivers. However, such testing is often time-consuming and inaccessible. In this study, we designed a modified version of the Trail Making Test (TMT) which can be completed on a smartphone in approximately 5 minutes. We recruited 4405 commercially-licensed drivers and 314 medically at-risk drivers to complete the TMT, plus an on-road test of their driving abilities. We then trained and tested a logistic regression model using 50-50 splits on each dataset. The results of the model showed that the longer it took drivers in both groups to complete the TMT, the more likely they were to fail the on-road driving test. Accuracy for the commercial group was 83.8%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 34.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85.3%. Accuracy for the medically at-risk group was 63.1%, with a PPV of 55.8% and an NPV of 65.8%. Overall accuracy was 82.5%, with a PPV of 43.0% and an NPV of 84.3%. Log-transformed reaction time to targets was significantly associated with on-road failure in both driving groups. The results of this study suggest that a rapid and accessible version of the TMT can predict unsafe driving with comparable accuracy to more time-consuming and administratively burdensome means of testing.

">A quantitative framework for predicting odor intensity across molecule and mixtures</a></h4>

              
                In vision and hearing, standardized units such as lumens (for brightness) and decibels (for loudness) allow consistent quantification of stimulus intensity, enabling precise control of sensory experiences. Olfaction, by contrast, currently lacks a robust quantitative framework linking physical stimulus properties directly to perceived odor intensity, complicating efforts to accurately characterize and manipulate aromas. To bridge this gap, we used a precisely controlled odor delivery system combined with deep learning models to predict the intensity of both single molecules and mixtures from physical properties. These models allowed us to develop an automated, quantitative method that accurately identifies which volatile components meaningfully contribute to aroma perception, overcoming the limitations of traditional heuristic approaches such as odor activity values and demonstrating practical utility in complex naturalistic odors.

">Heartbeat-evoked responses in M/EEG: A systematic review of methods with suggestions for analysis and reporting</a></h4>

              
                Heartbeat-evoked responses (HER), as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), have become widely used as a marker of cardiac interoception in the study of brain-body interactions. However, HER studies report largely variable findings, at least partially due to methodological variability. To achieve consensus on HER processing and improve the reproducibility of findings, the field urgently requires a structured summary of the methods employed so far. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of 132 HER studies using non-invasive M/EEG recordings in humans. Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity across most steps of HER analysis, ranging from data acquisition and preprocessing to HER estimation and statistical approaches. The large diversity in the processing choices is accompanied by considerable proportions of unreported methodological information across reviewed studies, reaching up to 80% for key processing steps. In addition, less than 33% of studies had enough statistical power to reliably detect meta-level HER effects, while their reported spatiotemporal locations varied substantially. We provide a comprehensive reporting and quality control checklist to aid in the development of more standardized procedures, highlighting critical steps for robust HER investigations. Additionally, we share the full extracted dataset, including an interactive version, to support other researchers in answering additional specific questions they may have. We hope that these resources will improve the robustness, reproducibility, and transparency of research in the growing HER field.

">Mental Imagery abilities affect visual working memory performance: evidence from aphantasic participants</a></h4>

              
                Visual imagery refers to the mental generation of visual representations of stimuli, while visual working memory involves retaining visual information for a short period without external input. Due to the conceptual overlap between these two constructs, successful performance on visual working memory tasks may rely on the use of visual imagery to rehearse items during the retention interval. Consequently, individuals with aphantasia, who lack voluntary visual imagery, may experience difficulties with such tasks. However, prior research has suggested that some individuals with aphantasia might employ non-visual strategies to compensate for this deficit. In two experiments, we examined visual working memory performance in aphantasic and control participants across a range of stimulus types. In Experiment 1, participants completed a change localization task using color squares and complex fractals; in Experiment 2, stimuli included real words, phonologically valid pseudowords, and phonologically invalid pseudowords. Across both experiments, aphantasic participants demonstrated significantly impaired visual working memory compared to controls. Notably, their performance was equally impaired for stimuli that were easily verbalizable (i.e., colors and words) and those that were not (i.e., fractals and pseudowords). Furthermore, individual differences in visual imagery ability, as measured by the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), significantly predicted working memory performance across all stimulus types. These findings provide direct evidence for the critical role of visual imagery in supporting visual working memory.

">Geometry of neural dynamics along the cortical attractor landscape reflects changes in attention</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a complex dynamical system whose activity reflects changes in internal states, such as attention. While prior work has shown that large-scale brain activity reflects attention, the mechanism governing this association in a time-varying and task-dependent manner remains unknown. Here, we tested a hypothesis that the geometry of neural dynamics on the attractor landscape, or the movement along the "hills and valleys", reflects changes in attentional states over time and variations across controlled and naturalistic contexts. We fit a parametric dynamical systems model to fMRI data collected during rest, task performance, and naturalistic movie-watching. The model decomposes neural dynamics into components that are intrinsic versus extrinsically driven by stimuli. Model parameters were biologically meaningful, reflecting both cognitive states and individual differences. Model simulations revealed a set of attractors that mirrored functional brain networks, spanning the canonical gradient from sensorimotor to default mode network regions. The speed and direction of neural trajectories toward these attractors systematically varied across attentional states in a context-dependent manner. When participants were paying attention to effortful tasks, neural dynamics converged directly toward a task-relevant attractor, suggesting that it occupied a steeper region of the attractor landscape. In contrast, when participants were engaged in sitcom episodes, neural dynamics were in a flattened region of the landscape, directed away from the attractors. These findings demonstrate that while the positions of the attractors are largely determined by the cortical organization, the geometry of neural dynamics on the attractor landscape changes systematically across attentional states and situational contexts.

">Function aligns with geometry in locally connected neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                The geometry of the brain imposes fundamental constraints on its activity and function. However, the mechanisms linking its shape to neuronal dynamics remain elusive. Here, we investigate how geometric eigenmodes relate to functional connectivity gradients within three-dimensional structures using numerical simulations and calcium imaging experiments in larval zebrafish. We show that functional connectivity gradients arising from network activity closely match the geometric eigenmodes of the network's spatial embedding when neurons are locally connected. By systematically varying network parameters such as the connectivity radius and the prevalence of long-range connections introduced via edge swaps, we reveal a robust geometry-function correspondence that progressively deteriorates as local connectivity is disrupted. Additionally, we demonstrate that spatial filtering can artificially impose geometric structure on functional gradients, even at modest levels. To support our computational results, we conduct volumetric calcium imaging experiments at cellular resolution in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. We uncover cellular functional gradients that closely align with geometric eigenmodes up to a certain eigenmode wavelength that reflects the spatial extent of neuronal arborizations measured in single-neuron reconstructions, as predicted by our simulations. Our findings highlight the importance of short-range anatomical connectivity in shaping the geometric structure of brain activity.

">Global and local origins of trial-to-trial spike count variability in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neuron spiking responses vary across repeated presentations of the same stimuli, but whether this trial-to-trial variability represents noise versus unidentified signals remains unresolved. Some of the variability can be attributed to correlations between neural activity and arousal, locomotion, and other overt movements. We hypothesized that correlations with global activity factors, i.e., patterns of neural activity observable in other brain regions, may explain additional variability in spike count responses of visual cortical neurons. To test this, we used Neuropixels 2.0 probes to record neural activity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) while subjects passively viewed images. We recorded videos of behavior alongside neural activity from other brain regions, either spiking activity of neural populations in anterior cingulate area (ACA) or widefield calcium signals from across the dorsal cortex. We then used a model based on reduced rank regression to partition the explainable variability of visual cortical responses by source. Some of the trial-to-trial variability in V1 spike counts was attributable to locally shared patterns of activity uncorrelated with either behavior or global activity patterns. Locally shared activity patterns explained trial-to-trial variability that was in excess of Poisson spike generation. Of the parts of variability attributable to non-local sources, global cortical activity predicted significantly more V1 spike count variability than behavioral factors. Additionally, behavioral factors explained little variability uniquely and comprised a geometric subspace of the globally predictable V1 activity. Finally, optogenetically perturbing ACA directly impacted V1 activity, and ACA activity patterns predicted V1 spike count variability even on trials without overt behaviors. Our data indicate that globally shared factors from other cortical areas contribute substantially to shared spike count variability in V1, with only a minority of shared variability confined to local V1 circuits.

">Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation reduces total striatal GABA content and facilitates early-phase motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive technique for modulating neuroplasticity. Previous studies have suggested that changes in regional brain GABA signaling contribute to these effects, but empirical neurophysiological evidence remains limited. Methods: We investigated the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of tVNS (200 microsecond pulses at 20 Hz, alternating 30 s ON, 1 s OFF cycles, 30 min total duration) in healthy adults using two experimental paradigms. In Experiment 1, GABA levels were measured in the left striatum (STR), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sensorimotor cortex (SM) of 34 participants by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before and after ipsilateral tVNS. In Experiment 2, 28 participants performed a right-hand force-control motor learning task before, during, and after tVNS. Results: Administration of tVNS significantly reduced GABA levels in the left STR compared to sham stimulation (p < 0.05), and also significantly improved motor task performance compared to the sham group at 10 minutes after stimulus onset (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Transcutaneous VNS may facilitate early-phase motor learning by reducing striatal GABA levels and consequently inducing corticobasal circuit disinhibition. These findings support tVNS as a potential noninvasive intervention to enhance motor learning for neurorehabilitation and motor disorder treatment.

">Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation during short-term motor practice drives cortical plasticity without behavioral improvement</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is emerging as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique to augment neurorehabilitation, yet its mechanisms in humans remain poorly understood. Animal studies suggest that VNS delivered during motor skill practice drives task-specific plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1), but direct evidence in humans has been lacking. Here, we provide the first demonstration that taVNS paired with motor skill practice selectively enhances cortical plasticity without boosting motor performance beyond practice alone during short-term training. Thirty-one healthy right-handed adults practiced a novel implicit motor task, rotating two balls with the non-dominant hand for 15 minutes. Participants were randomized to receive taVNS to the left tragus or sham stimulation during practice. Motor performance, M1 hand representation (TMS mapping), and spinal excitability (F-wave) were assessed pre- and post-practice, while pupil diameter was continuously monitored as an index of noradrenergic activity. Motor performance improved similarly in both groups, whereas cortical map expansion was significantly greater in the taVNS group than in the sham group. F-wave amplitude increased only in the sham group, suggesting that taVNS-driven plasticity was restricted to cortical circuits. Moreover, taVNS uniquely elicited pupil dilation during practice, consistent with noradrenergic system engagement. These findings reveal that taVNS can promote task-specific cortical reorganization in humans independent of immediate behavioral improvement. By linking taVNS-induced plasticity to noradrenergic modulation and dissociating cortical from spinal effects, this study provides novel mechanistic insight into how taVNS may lay the neural groundwork for enhanced motor recovery, with critical implications for neurorehabilitation.

">Effects of experimentally induced fatigue on motor learning: A scoping review</a></h4>

              
                The literature on the effect of fatigue on motor learning is limited and marked by inconsistent findings. This scoping review aimed to explore the available knowledge on the effects of fatigue induced by physical and cognitive exertion on motor learning, and to compile and understand how it is studied. A comprehensive search strategy using relevant index terms and keywords was conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and Dissertations & Theses Global. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed considerable inconsistencies in how fatigue and motor learning were defined and measured. None of the studies examined the effect of fatigue induced by combined physical and cognitive exertion, and only 27% investigated fatigue induced by cognitive exertion. Acuity tasks were the most frequently used to assess motor learning, employed in 59% of the studies. Notably, all participants were between 19 and 31 years of age, and reporting of key demographic and physiological characteristics such as sex, gender, physical activity level, and body mass index was inconsistent or absent. This review highlights the need for comprehensive definitions of both fatigue and motor learning to improve consistency and reproducibility across studies. Given the limited research on the effects of fatigue induced by cognitive and combined physical and cognitive exertion, future studies should prioritize using these experimental manipulations. Also, future studies should diversify the motor learning tasks used in research to allow both direct and conceptual replication. Additionally, broader age ranges and comprehensive participant profiling should be prioritized.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>For children with congenital heart disease (CHD), differences in brain structure are already present at birth. Cortical surface area and gyrification increase dramatically over the third trimester, and cortical expansion has been hypothesized to drive brain folding. This study sought to quantify differences in cortical expansion in fetuses with CHD and typically developing controls. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at early (26-31 weeks) and late (34-39 weeks) gestational time points, and cortical surfaces were reconstructed using a high resolution, motion-corrected pipeline. For fetuses with reconstructions at both time points (36 CHD, 24 control), anatomically-constrained multimodal surface matching (aMSM) was used to generate individualized maps of cortical surface expansion. Global analysis revealed significant reductions in total cortical expansion and gyrification index among CHD fetuses. Furthermore, expansion maps revealed high expansion in the lateral temporal lobes of control fetuses that was reduced in fetuses with CHD, consistent with previous reports of atypical folding in this region. This study is the first to reveal spatiotemporal patterns of cortical expansion in typical and atypical fetal development. This detailed understanding of cortical growth trajectory may improve understanding of functional deficits associated with specific cortical areas and inform clinical interventions for patients with CHD.</span>

Resolving protein-ligand interactions in atomic detail is key to understanding how small molecules regulate macromolecular function. Although recent breakthroughs in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled high-quality reconstruction of numerous complex biomolecules, the resolution of bound ligands is often relatively poor. Furthermore, methods for building and refining molecular models into cryo-EM maps have largely focused on proteins and may not be optimized for the diverse properties of small-molecule ligands. Here, we present an approach that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with cryo-EM density-guided simulations to fit ligands into experimental maps. Using three inputs: 1) a protein amino acid sequence, 2) a ligand specification, and 3) an experimental cryo-EM map, we validated our approach on a set of biomedically relevant protein-ligand complexes including kinases, GPCRs, and solute transporters, none of which were present in the AI training data. In cases for which AI was not sufficient to predict experimental poses outright, integration of flexible fitting into molecular dynamics simulations improved ligand model-to-map cross-correlation relative to the deposited structure from 40-71% to 82-95%. This work offers a straightforward pipeline for integrating AI and density-guided simulations to model building in cryo-EM maps of ligand-protein complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013294">A hierarchical multiscale model of forward and backward alpha-band traveling waves in the visual system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jakob C. B. Schwenk, Andrea Alamia</p>

Recent studies have shown that cortical low-frequency oscillations are often organized as traveling waves. The properties of these waves have been linked to both sensory processing and cognitive functions. In EEG recordings, alpha-band (~10Hz) traveling waves propagate predominantly along the occipital-frontal axis, with forward waves being most prominent during visual processing, while backward waves dominate at rest and during sensory suppression. While a previous study has proposed a functional model to explain their generation and propagation, a biologically plausible implementation is lacking. Here, we present a multi-scale network model with mean-field dynamics that, building on known cortical connectivity, reproduces the dynamics of alpha-band traveling waves observed in EEG recordings. We show that forward and backward waves can arise from two distinct cortical sub-networks that are connected in infragranular layers at each area. At rest, the network generates spontaneous backward waves and switches to a forward state upon sensory stimulation, reproducing the dynamics observed in EEG recordings. We then show that a cortico-thalamic pathway through the pulvinar can bias the dynamics to the forward state and that pulvinar engagement leads to spontaneous forward waves at rest. This is in line with previous studies suggesting a key role for the pulvinar in directing cortical information flow. In summary, our model provides a biologically plausible architecture for modeling the dynamics of macroscale traveling waves. It bridges the gap between scales by connecting laminar activity to scalp-level spatial patterns, providing a biologically grounded and comprehensive view of the spatial propagation of alpha-band traveling waves.

Vaccination is vital for preventing disease spread, as demonstrated by its role played in recent outbreaks such as measles, COVID-19, and the 2014 West Africa Ebola crisis. Classical ring vaccination–targeting individuals near infected cases to form protective clusters–has become of interest due to its effectiveness, yet it is strongly influenced by the quality of contact tracing and availability of medical resources. Here, we model the efficiency of a family of ring vaccination-inspired strategies that address these limiting factors and disentangle them from the structure of the contact patterns. In particular, we evaluate scenarios that consider a vaccination radius <i>r</i>, used to vaccinate nodes in the network up to <i>r</i> contacts away (<i>block vaccination</i>) or exactly <i>r</i> contacts away (<i>ring vaccination</i>) from nodes of interest. Each one of these is tested under two further scenarios: the <i>preventive</i> one, where individuals are vaccinated before the epidemic takes place, and the <i>containment</i> one, where vaccination occurs during an outbreak to limit disease spread. They are tested in synthetic networks, where we find that in the preventive scenario, ring outperforms block vaccination, reducing the size of the epidemic and, in some cases, even preventing it from happening. On the other hand, in the containment scenario, we find that both strategies perform slightly similarly in reducing the impact of the diseases but block vaccination using fewer resources. As a case study, the proposed strategies are used to create epidemiological risk maps by employing the spatial position of olive trees in the Salento region in Italy, which recently suffered the impact of the bacterium <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>.

In the quest for improved therapeutics targeting immune checkpoints (ICs), we turn to spontaneously developing dog (canine) cancers, some of which genetically and clinically mirror the human counterparts. Despite its potential, canine cancer immunology remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the RNA-seq-based expression of 44 ICs across 14 canine cancer types and an extensive human dataset. We unveil diverse canine IC expression patterns and unique human IC signatures that reflect the histological type and primary site of cancer. We uncover a striking similarity between canine brain cancers, osteosarcoma, and their human counterparts, identifying them as prospective immunotherapy models. Four ICs - CD160, A2AR, NKG2A, and OX40 - are key to the differences observed between species. We also find that individual human IC signatures vary in how well they align with their respective cancer types, a pattern that may influence future approaches to personalized therapy. This exploration highlights aspects of canine and human cancer immunology that warrant further study, setting the stage for discoveries at their crossroads.

Hypovolemic shock and hemorrhage continue to shape healthcare delivery and incur a heavy burden on public health and wellbeing. Many healthcare organizations have specific transfusion protocols that are referenced when a patient meets certain physiological criteria. These protocols are shaped around best practices and nuanced understanding of the physiology of the patient. Despite their importance, these protocols are extremely difficult to change or challenge and, to date, there does not exist a sufficient mathematical model that may be employed towards investigating simulated patient hemorrhage. We show that once constructed, we can consider the health of the patient in phase-space rather than traditional time-series representations, quantifying the recovery of the patient due to the geometry of the trajectories. We construct a whole-body physiology model of hemorrhagic shock and trauma that encompasses multiple organ systems, non-linear feedback mechanisms and patient variability. We validate this model by constructing a major hemorrhage scenario, that includes transit time and associated mass transfusion resuscitation of the patient. We then use this model to create phase-plane diagrams of patient trajectories as a function of lactate blood pH and volumes, among other relevant physiological metrics. Exploring these patient trajectories amongst a varied patient population yields a series of high curvature points associated with the transition from deterioration to recovery of the patient. We then construct a convex hull, covering the high curvature regions of a diverse simulated patient population. These hulls, constructed by simulated numerous patients, exposed to three distinct hemorrhagic severities, are then used to validate the model by comparing experimental serum lactate levels as a function of blood volume to these regions in phase-space. In conclusion, we show that the model is highly accurate and accounts for distinct lactate trajectories amongst the simulated patient cohorts. Finally, we fit a logistic curve to the resulting data for a quick patient severity tool and denote the standard error of parameterization based on the delta method.

Multisensory integration has primarily been studied in static environments, where optimal integration relies on the precision of the respective sensory modalities. However, in numerous situations, sensory information is dynamic and changes over time, due to changes in our bodily state and the surrounding environment. Given that different sensory modalities have different delays, this suggests that optimal integration may not solely depend on sensory precision but may also be affected by the delays associated with each sensory system. To investigate this hypothesis, participants (n = 22, 16 female) engaged in a continuous steering task. Participants sat on a motion platform facing a screen that displayed a cartoonish traffic scene, featuring a car traveling along a road. In the visuoinertial condition, where vestibular and somatosensory feedback were available, they were tasked with counteracting an external multi-frequency perturbation signal, which laterally perturbed the platform and the car, such that the car was kept within the center of the road. In the visual condition, the visual car was perturbed, while the motion platform remained stationary. We show that participants compensate better for the perturbation in the visuoinertial than the visual condition, particularly in the high frequency range of the perturbation. Using computational modelling, we demonstrate that this enhanced performance is partially due to the shorter delay of the vestibular modality. In this condition, participants rely more on the vestibular information, which is less delayed than the more precise but longer delayed, visual information.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell cancer that occurs in the bone marrow. A leading treatment for MM is the monoclonal antibody Daratumumab, targeting the CD38 receptor, which is highly overexpressed in myeloma cells. In this work we model drug resistance via loss of CD38 expression, which is a proposed mechanism of resistance to Daratumumab treatment. We develop an ODE model that includes drug resistance via two mechanisms: a direct effect in which CD38 expression is lost without cell death in response to Daratumumab, and an indirect effect in which CD38 expression switches on and off in the cancer cells; myeloma cells that do not express CD38 have lower fitness but are shielded from the drug action. The model also incorporates competition with healthy cells, death of healthy cells due to off-target drug effects, and a Michaelis-Menten type immune response. Using optimal control theory, we study the effect of the drug resistance mechanisms and the off-target drug effect on the optimal treatment regime. We identify a general increase in the duration and costs of optimal treatment, as a result of these added mechanisms. Several distinct optimal treatment regimes are identified within the parameter space.

Variation in infection history is an important but often underappreciated driver of individual variability in responses to infections. Such individual heterogeneity in immune responses, stemming from variable previous exposure to pathogens, subsequently influences epidemiological outcomes. By comparing research on innate immune priming in invertebrates, which lack adaptive immune memory but demonstrate enhanced responses to re-infections, to patterns seen in vertebrates, this Essay reveals broad implications for disease dynamics. Insights from mathematical modelling and experimental data highlight the critical need to integrate evolutionary disease ecology into public health initiatives to better predict and manage infectious diseases.

<p>Enoxaparin pretreatment reduces the proportion of poor outcomes by reducing early microthrombus formation, enhancing microcirculation, increasing reperfusion blood flow, and mitigating BBB disruption.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Microcirculatory disturbances may play an important role in futile recanalization. This study investigated the early factors affecting the prognosis of cerebral infarction in rats and whether low-molecular-weight heparin improves microcirculation disorders. We used a male rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model with 90 min transient MCAO (tMCAO) or permanent MCAO (pMCAO) ischemia, and analyzed after 24 h. Cortical blood flow was monitored using laser speckle blood flow imaging. Furthermore, 1.5 mg/kg Enoxaparin (Enox) was administered 30 min before ischemia or 1 h post-reperfusion. The tMCAO group received saline. Our results showed that the proportion of moderate and severe (M&amp;S) injuries was 54.2% in tMCAO rats, 100% in pMCAO rats, and reduced to 25% in the enoxaparin pre-ischemic (Enox-pre) group. The reperfusion rats had persistent hypoperfusion and the lowest blood flow after 1 h post-reperfusion. The 1 and 24 h post-reperfusion cortical blood flow was negatively correlated with infarct volume and neurological scores. The Enox-pre group had higher blood flow than the tMCAO group at 1 h post-reperfusion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Enox-pre reduced fibrin deposition after 1 h post-reperfusion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), improved microvascular patency after 1 and 24 h (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and decreased Evans blue leakage after 24 h (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). We concluded that 50% of the futile recanalization rate also exists in rats with recanalization 1.5 h post-infarction. The degree of reperfusion blood flow recovery significantly affects cerebral infarction outcomes. Enox-pre reduces the proportion of poor outcomes by reducing early microthrombus formation, enhancing microcirculation, increasing reperfusion blood flow, and mitigating blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption.</p>

                Rizzo et al. describe an imageable breast cancer mouse model to study nanomedicine targeting to primary tumors vs. metastases. Clinical-stage polymeric micelles preferentially accumulate in metastases over healthy tissues, albeit less efficiently than in primary tumors, due to collagen crosslinking. Docetaxel-loaded micelles show superior efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to Taxotere.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106261">Navigating contradictions in enteric chemotactic stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed Enterobacteriaceae use chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr for attraction to blood serum (Glenn et al., 2024). Here, we investigated the complementary role of Tsr in mediating chemorepulsion, a behaviour by which motile bacteria avoid deleterious compounds to locate permissive niches. In the gut, indole is a bacteriostatic compound produced by microbiota and thought to act as a chemorepellent for invading pathogens, thereby protecting the host against infection. The principal reservoir of intestinal indole is fecal matter, a complex biological material that contains both attractant and repellent stimuli. Whether indole in its natural context is sufficient for pathogen chemorepulsion or host protection has remained unknown. Using an intestinal explant system, we show that pure indole suppresses an infection advantage mediated through chemotaxis for the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium, but this effect is abolished in the presence of other fecal chemoeffectors, including the chemoattractant L-Serine (L-Ser), dependent on the chemoreceptor Tsr. Live imaging reveals that although S. Typhimurium is repelled by pure indole, the pathogen is actually strongly attracted to human fecal matter despite its high indole content, and this response is mediated by Tsr, which simultaneously senses both stimuli. Fecal attraction is conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae species that harbor Tsr orthologues, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, and clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella. In a defined system of fecal chemoeffectors, L-Ser and other fecal chemoattractants override indole chemorepulsion, but the magnitude of bacterial chemoattraction is controlled by indole levels. Together, these findings suggest chemorepulsion elicited by indole is not protective against enteric infection and actually benefits pathogens by helping them locate niches with lower competitor density. Our study highlights the limitations of applying single-effector studies in predicting bacterial behavior in natural environments, where chemotaxis is shaped by the integration of multiple, often opposing, chemical signals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89225">Hexokinase regulates Mondo-mediated longevity via the PPP and organellar dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The transcriptional complex Mondo/Max-like, MML-1/MXL-2, acts as a convergent transcriptional regulatory output of multiple longevity pathways in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These transcription factors coordinate nutrient sensing with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism across the evolutionary spectrum. While most studies have focused on the downstream outputs, little is known about the upstream inputs that regulate these transcription factors in a live organism. Here, we found that knockdown of various glucose metabolic enzymes decreases MML-1 localization in the nucleus and identified two hexokinase isozymes, <i>hxk-1</i> and <i>hxk-2,</i> as the most vigorous regulators of MML-1 function. Upon hexokinase knockdown, MML-1 redistributes to mitochondria and lipid droplets (LDs), and concomitantly, transcriptional targets are downregulated and germline longevity is abolished. Further, we found that <i>hxk-1</i> regulates MML-1 through mitochondrial β-oxidation, while <i>hxk-2</i> regulates MML-1 by modulating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its coordinated association with LDs. Similarly, inhibition of the PPP rescues mammalian MondoA nuclear translocation and transcriptional function upon starvation. These studies reveal how metabolic signals and organellar communication regulate a key convergent metabolic transcription factor to promote longevity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102352">A biofilm-tropic Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage uses the exopolysaccharide Psl as receptor</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria in nature can exist in multicellular communities called biofilms. Biofilms also form in the course of many infections. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections frequently involve biofilms, which contribute materially to the difficulty to treat these infections with antibiotic therapy. Many biofilm-related characteristics are controlled by the second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP, which is upregulated on surface contact. Among these factors is the exopolysaccharide Psl, which is a critically important component of the biofilm matrix. Here, we describe the discovery of a <i>P. aeruginosa</i> bacteriophage, which we have called Clew-1, that directly binds to and uses Psl as a receptor. While this phage does not efficiently infect planktonically growing bacteria, it can disrupt <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms and replicate in biofilm bacteria. We further demonstrate that the Clew-1 can reduce the bacterial burden in a mouse model of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> keratitis, which is characterized by the formation of a biofilm on the cornea. Due to its reliance on Psl for infection, Clew-1 does not actually form plaques on wild-type bacteria under standard in vitro conditions. This argues that our standard isolation procedures likely exclude bacteriophage that are adapted to using biofilm markers for infection. Importantly, the manner in which we isolated Clew-1 can be easily extended to other strains of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and indeed other bacterial species, which will fuel the discovery of other biofilm-tropic bacteriophage and expand their therapeutic use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106288">Recurrent mutations drive the rapid evolution of pesticide resistance in the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae</a></h4>

              
                The genetic basis of pesticide resistance has been widely studied, but the exact nature of this evolutionary process in the field is often unclear, particularly when a limited number of populations is considered and when there is a lag between the evolutionary event and its investigation. We showed that an unprecedented number of recurrently evolved mutations in an arthropod pest, the two-spotted spider mite <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, drive the rapid evolution of resistance to a recently commercialized acaricide, cyetpyrafen. We first observed high levels of resistance that appeared and became widespread within three years. Genome scans revealed genetic heterogeneity of resistance among populations and identified 15 target mutations, including six mutations on five amino acid residues of subunit <i>sdhB</i>, and nine mutations on three amino acid residues of subunit <i>sdhD</i> of the pesticide target succinate dehydrogenase, with as many as five substitutions on one residue. No mutations were present in 2,317 screened historical specimens, suggesting that mutations arose rapidly through de novo substitutions or from very rare segregating mutations. Identical mutations recurrently appeared in different genetic backgrounds, increasing the likelihood of resistance evolution. The high number of mutational options available for the evolution of target site resistance in this pest challenges resistance management practices.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99936">Redistribution of fragmented mitochondria ensures symmetric organelle partitioning and faithful chromosome segregation in mitotic mouse zygotes</a></h4>

              
                In cleavage-stage embryos, preexisting organelles partition evenly into daughter blastomeres without signiﬁcant cell growth after symmetric cell division. The presence of mitochondrial DNA within mitochondria and its restricted replication during preimplantation development makes their inheritance particularly important. While chromosomes are precisely segregated by the mitotic spindle, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial partitioning remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) controls the mitochondrial redistribution and partitioning during embryonic cleavage. Depletion of Drp1 in mouse zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation, and the majority of embryos arrest at the 2 cell stage. Clumped mitochondria are located in the center of mitotic Drp1-depleted zygotes with less uniform distribution, thereby preventing their symmetric partitioning. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance is accompanied by functionally inequivalent blastomeres with biased ATP and endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We also find that marked mitochondrial centration in Drp1-depleted zygotes prevents the assembly of parental chromosomes, resulting in chromosome segregation defects and binucleation. Thus, mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by Drp1 ensures proper organelle positioning and partitioning into functional daughters during the first embryonic cleavage.

Recent studies suggest that EEG microstate transitions are gradual and continuous phenomena, contrary to the classical view of binary transitions. To update conventional microstate analysis to reflect continuous EEG dynamics and examine differences in age-related electrophysiological state transitions, we considered the relative positions of EEG microstates on the neural manifold and their topographical polarity. Transition probability results revealed fewer transitions on the microstate D-C-E axis in older adults but increased transitions among microstates A, D, B, and E that were mainly observed within polarity and A-B between polarity. Furthermore, the 100 microstate transitions, which are variations of the shortest transitions between 10 microstates, could be reduced to 8 principal components based on each transition co-occurrence, including hubs C and E, planar transitions through msA/B and D, and unidirectional transition components. Several transition components were potentially significant predictors of age group, independent of age-related alpha activity reductions. These patterns remained stable across longer continuous transitions over time and were nearly replicated in independent data, indicating their robustness in characterizing age-related electrophysiological spatiotemporal dynamics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Working memory is an important cognitive process that develops throughout early life. During adolescence, there is marked improvement in this process that is associated with structural and functional brain changes. These changes have been linked to age; however, endogenous testosterone is thought to regulate structural and functional changes in the brain during puberty, with differential influences across adolescence into early adulthood. Thus, testosterone may have a direct impact on brain activity that is modulated by age. The current study aimed to examine this using a working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in adolescents and young adults. Saliva samples collected prior to scanning were assayed for endogenous testosterone levels. One hundred and forty-five typically developing participants (74 female), aged 12–25 yr, completed a working memory fMRI task. Results showed that, for the most difficult versus the 0back conditions, younger female participants (≤19) only had more deactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex with higher level of testosterone. In contrast, male participants showed increased activation in the precentral gyrus with higher testosterone, regardless of age. These findings indicate sex differences in how endogenous testosterone relates to the activity of different brain regions recruited during working memory. Furthermore, these associations vary across typical adolescent development.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although episodic memory is typically impaired in older adults (OAs) compared to young adults (YAs), this deficit is attenuated when OAs can leverage their rich semantic knowledge, such as their knowledge of schemas. Memory is better for items consistent with pre-existing schemas and this effect is larger in OAs. Neuroimaging studies have associated schema use with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), angular gyrus (AG), and hippocampus (HPC), but most of this research has been limited to YAs. This fMRI study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying how schemas boost episodic memory in OAs. Participants encoded scene-object pairs with varying congruency, and memory for the objects was tested the following day. Congruency with schemas enhanced object memory for YAs and, more substantially, for OAs. fMRI analyses examined cortico-hippocampal interactions at encoding. We found that a vmPFC-HPC interaction was related to enhanced subsequent memory for congruent objects in both age groups, whereas an AG-HPC interaction contributed to subsequent memory for congruent objects only in OAs. Individual difference analyses of the AG-HPC interaction suggested that OAs made use of semantic knowledge to facilitate encoding. Collectively, our findings illustrate age-related differences in how schemas influence episodic memory encoding via distinct cortico-hippocampal interactions.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The substantia nigra (SN) is a midbrain nucleus implicated not only in motor control and reward processing but also in higher-order cognitive functions. Iron homeostasis in this region is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, especially for dopamine, and thus, iron dysregulation may contribute to the symptomatology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, iron deposition and functional circuits of the SN in the autistic brain remain underexplored. This study investigated iron deposition and functional connectivity (FC) of the SN in 53 adult males with ASD and 99 typically developing controls using quantitative susceptibility mapping and resting-state fMRI. Compared to controls, the ASD group exhibited higher magnetic susceptibility in the right SN, suggesting elevated iron deposition. Within the ASD group, higher iron deposition was associated with more severe socio-communicative deficits and reduced sensory-seeking behavior. Seed-based FC analyses further revealed that the ASD group exhibited stronger FC between the right SN and bilateral visual cortices and reduced FC with the right superior frontal gyrus. These results highlight the critical role of the SN in the autistic brain and indicate that altered iron homeostasis in the SN may contribute to disruptions in the dopaminergic system that underlie the core symptoms of ASD.</span>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle activities (LA) are strongly related, and both are associated with dementia risk. We investigated the influence of SES and LA on brain atrophy and cognitive decline considering amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 221 older adults (mean age, 67.1 ± 8.2 years) who underwent cognitive testing annually over a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. Longitudinal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was available for 181 participants. Measures of SES and LA were collected using questionnaires and combined to SES and LA scores using a latent variable approach. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate if SES and LA are independently or interactively with Aβ and WMH load associated with decline in domains language, processing speed/attention, executive function, and episodic memory. Mediation models assessed whether these associations were explained by gray matter atrophy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SES and LA were associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, but were not associated with cognitive decline over time. In interaction with brain pathologies, higher LA reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ and WMH load on language decline, whereas higher SES reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ pathology on episodic memory decline. Individuals with low SES showed faster Aβ-related gray matter atrophy, which mediated the association between Aβ and episodic memory decline but not language decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that multiple resilience mechanisms underlie the protective effects of SES and LA on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting SES-related risk factors may be most effective when implemented early, before neurodegenerative changes begin. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tofersen is the first effective and approved therapy for superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>)-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS [SOD1-ALS]). Following treatment with tofersen, neurofilament levels in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum seem to respond earlier than clinical parameters. This evidence prompted us to hypothesize that this novel treatment could provide an opportunity to identify additional biomarkers responsive to therapy in SOD1-ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated a panel of 120 neural, glial, and inflammatory markers in CSF and serum samples longitudinally collected from a total of 28 SOD1-ALS patients at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment with tofersen, followed by validation with conventional methodology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of proteins, including neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, amyloid-beta 1–40 and amyloid-beta 1–42, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), whose CSF levels both differed between SOD1-ALS and the control group, and were responsive to tofersen at 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Another group of markers, including the neuropentraxin (NPTX) family members NPTX1, NPTX2 and NPTXR, did not separate untreated SOD1-ALS from controls, but was responsive to tofersen. At 12 months on tofersen the levels of neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, NPTX1, NPTX2, and NPTXR remained reduced compared with baseline, and correlated with the clinical response to tofersen. Consistent with increasing CSF pleocytosis and intrathecal immunoglobulin production, inflammatory markers were significantly increased after 12 months of treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight a complex, time-dependent differential response of CSF biomarkers to tofersen treatment, and may pave the way for developing a panel of responsive proteins to make biomarker endpoints more robust in clinical trials for SOD1-ALS and beyond.

<p>NfL expression in oligodendrocytes was assessed using RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining in human and mouse brain slices, as well as flow cytometry in mouse brain single-cells. The MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cell line was used to mimic MSA pathology with α-syn overexpression or preformed fibril treatment. NfL levels were detected in cell line, brain tissues and condition media, and the differences between MSA pathology and controls were compared. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were quantified using nano-scale flow cytometry in a cohort of 101 MSA patients, 96 PD patients, and 97 HCs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both <i>NEFL</i> mRNA and NfL protein showed co-localization with typical oligodendrocyte marker anti-2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). A total of 58.5% of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes co-expressed NfL. Increased α-syn load elevates NfL expression in both oligodendrocyte cell line and MSA patient brain slices. NfL overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, but did not affect α-syn-induced cell viability deficits. α-Syn promoted oligodendrocytic NfL release via extracellular vesicles. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were elevated in MSA patients compared to PD and HCs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest additional cellular roles for NfL in oligodendrocytes beyond its established function in neurons and have potential implications for the neurodegenerative pathophysiology of MSA. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Spreckels et al. study human milk oligosaccharides and milk microbiota in Lifelines NEXT families. Human milk has an individual-specific composition, which is affected by maternal genetics, lactation stage, subclinical mastitis, and different feeding practices. Specific milk components associate with early infant gut microbiota composition and, potentially, infant growth and eczema.

High-resolution posture tracking of <i>C. elegans</i> has applications in genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening. While classic methods can reliably track isolated worms on uniform backgrounds, they fail when worms overlap, coil, or move in complex environments. Model-based tracking and deep learning approaches have addressed these issues to an extent, but there is still significant room for improvement in tracking crawling worms. Here we train a version of the DeepTangle algorithm developed for swimming worms using a combination of data derived from Tierpsy tracker and hand-annotated data for more difficult cases. DeepTangleCrawl (DTC) outperforms existing methods, reducing failure rates and producing more continuous, gap-free worm trajectories that are less likely to be interrupted by collisions between worms or self-intersecting postures (coils). We show that DTC enables the analysis of previously inaccessible behaviours and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in phenotypic screens, even for data that was specifically collected to be compatible with legacy trackers including low worm density and thin bacterial lawns. DTC broadens the applicability of high-throughput worm imaging to more complex behaviours that involve worm-worm interactions and more naturalistic environments including thicker bacterial lawns.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is critical for memory formation and has been widely used to identify the neural substrate of memory traces, termed memory engram cells. Functions of IEGs have been known to be different depending on their types. However, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which different types of IEGs are selectively or concurrently involved in the formation of memory engram. To address this question, we investigated the combinative expression of c-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 proteins using immunohistochemistry following aversive and rewarding experiences across subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Using an automated cell detection algorithm, we found that expression patterns of c-Fos, Npas4, and Arc varied across different brain areas, with a higher increase of IEG expressing cells in the PFC and posterior BLA than in the DG. The combinative expression patterns, along with their experience-induced changes, also differed across brain areas; the co-expression of IEGs increased in the PFC and BLA following experience, whereas the increase was less pronounced in the DG and RSC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different area-to-area functional connectivity networks were extracted by different IEGs. These findings provide insights into how different IEGs and their combinations identify engram cells, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of IEG-tagged memory engram cells.</p>
