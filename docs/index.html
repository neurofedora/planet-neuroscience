              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-term transverse imaging of the hippocampus with glass microperiscopes</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus consists of a stereotyped neuronal circuit repeated along the septal-temporal axis. This transverse circuit contains distinct subfields with stereotyped connectivity that support crucial cognitive processes, including episodic and spatial memory. However, comprehensive measurements across the transverse hippocampal circuit in vivo are intractable with existing techniques. Here, we developed an approach for two-photon imaging of the transverse hippocampal plane in awake mice via implanted glass microperiscopes, allowing optical access to the major hippocampal subfields and to the dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons. Using this approach, we tracked dendritic morphological dynamics on CA1 apical dendrites and characterized spine turnover. We then used calcium imaging to quantify the prevalence of place and speed cells across subfields. Finally, we measured the anatomical distribution of spatial information, finding a non-uniform distribution of spatial selectivity along the DG-to-CA1 axis. This approach extends the existing toolbox for structural and functional measurements of hippocampal circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced hippocampal LTP but typical NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor function in a novel rat model of CDKL5 deficiency disorder</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the X-linked gene cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) cause a severe neurological disorder characterised by early-onset epileptic seizures, autism and intellectual disability (ID). Impaired hippocampal function has been implicated in other models of monogenic forms of autism spectrum disorders and ID and is often linked to epilepsy and behavioural abnormalities. Many individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) have null mutations and complete loss of CDKL5 protein, therefore in the current study we used a novel Cdkl5 KO rat model to elucidate the impact of CDKL5 loss on cellular excitability and synaptic function of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs). We hypothesised abnormal pre and/or post synaptic function underlie the enhanced LTP we observe in the hippocampus of Cdkl5 KO rats. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of extracellular and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, biochemistry, and histology. We show that NMDA receptor function and subunit expression are unaltered throughout development, and Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptor mediated currents are unchanged in Cdkl5 KO rats. We observe reduced mEPSC frequency accompanied by increased spine density in basal dendrites of CA1 PCs, however we find no evidence supporting an increase in silent synapses when assessed using a minimal stimulation protocol in slices. Additionally, we found no change in paired-pulse ratio, consistent with normal release probability in Cdkl5 KO rats and supported by typical expression of pre-synaptic proteins in synaptosome preparations. Together these data indicate a role for CDKL5 in hippocampal synaptic function and raise the possibility that altered intracellular signalling rather than synaptic deficits might contribute to the altered plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metabolic and epigenetic dysfunctions underlie the arrest of in vitro fertilized human embryos in a senescent-like state</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yang Yang, Liyang Shi, Xiuling Fu, Gang Ma, Zhongzhou Yang, Yuhao Li, Yibin Zhou, Lihua Yuan, Ye Xia, Xiufang Zhong, Ping Yin, Li Sun, Wuwen Zhang, Isaac A. Babarinde, Yongjun Wang, Xiaoyang Zhao, Andrew P. Hutchins, Guoqing Tong</p>

Around 60% of in vitro fertilized (IVF) human embryos irreversibly arrest before compaction between the 3- to 8-cell stage, posing a significant clinical problem. The mechanisms behind this arrest are unclear. Here, we show that the arrested embryos enter a senescent-like state, marked by cell cycle arrest, the down-regulation of ribosomes and histones and down-regulation of MYC and p53 activity. The arrested embryos can be divided into 3 types. Type I embryos fail to complete the maternal-zygotic transition, and Type II/III embryos have low levels of glycolysis and either high (Type II) or low (Type III) levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment with the SIRT agonist resveratrol or nicotinamide riboside (NR) can partially rescue the arrested phenotype, which is accompanied by changes in metabolic activity. Overall, our data suggests metabolic and epigenetic dysfunctions underlie the arrest of human embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A versatile new tool derived from a bacterial deubiquitylase to detect and purify ubiquitylated substrates and their interacting proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengwen Zhang, Jason M. Berk, Adrian B. Mehrtash, Jean Kanyo, Mark Hochstrasser</p>

Protein ubiquitylation is an important posttranslational modification affecting a wide range of cellular processes. Due to the low abundance of ubiquitylated species in biological samples, considerable effort has been spent on methods to purify and detect ubiquitylated proteins. We have developed and characterized a novel tool for ubiquitin detection and purification based on OtUBD, a high-affinity ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) derived from an <i>Orientia tsutsugamushi</i> deubiquitylase (DUB). We demonstrate that OtUBD can be used to purify both monoubiquitylated and polyubiquitylated substrates from yeast and human tissue culture samples and compare their performance with existing methods. Importantly, we found conditions for either selective purification of covalently ubiquitylated proteins or co-isolation of both ubiquitylated proteins and their interacting proteins. As proof of principle for these newly developed methods, we profiled the ubiquitylome and ubiquitin-associated proteome of the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Combining OtUBD affinity purification with quantitative proteomics, we identified potential substrates for the E3 ligases Bre1 and Pib1. OtUBD provides a versatile, efficient, and economical tool for ubiquitin research with specific advantages over certain other methods, such as in efficiently detecting monoubiquitylation or ubiquitin linkages to noncanonical sites.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and the subtheme ‘general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise’ were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dry textile electrode for ambulatory monitoring after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: A pilot study of simultaneous comparison to the Holter electrocardiogram [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for ambulatory monitoring of atrial fibrillation (AF) but it is insufficient because of its limited recording time. Although several consumer ECG devices provide longer recording time, they generally do not undergo the regulatory process for medical use. Furthermore, current medical-grade devices for longer ECG monitoring are not continuous or too invasive for AF monitoring. A wearable ECG with a medical-grade dry textile electrode is a promising technology to remedy this limitation. This pilot study aimed to simultaneously compare the wearable and Holter ECGs for ambulatory monitoring in a clinical setting. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 18 patients who underwent AF ablation. One day after AF ablation, ambulatory ECG was obtained for three hours simultaneously using both the wearable and Holter ECG devices. Automatic ECG interpretations between devices were compared with correlation and agreement analyses. Results: Simultaneous ECG monitoring demonstrated a comparable analysis time and total heart beats between the two devices. Almost complete correlation and agreement were also demonstrated in all clinically relevant testing aspects except in R-wave amplitude (r = 0.743, p < .001). AF was detected in three patients. AF duration was the same in both ECG devices in two patients with continuous AF. In the remaining patient with intermittent AF, AF duration was shortened by 0.6% with the wearable ECG as compared to that with the Holter ECG. Conclusions: Simultaneous ECG comparison revealed a high consistency between the wearable and Holter ECG devices. The results of this study warrant further clinical studies for long-term monitoring of ambulatory ECG after AF ablation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determinants of under-five anaemia in the high prevalence regions of Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Anaemia is a serious public health issue that mostly affects children and women throughout their lives, resulting in a high morbidity and mortality burden. It is the third most dominant cause of hospital admission among children under-five in Ghana and the fourth leading cause of under-five mortality in Ghana.  This study aims to identify the determinants of under-five anaemia in the high prevalent regions of Ghana using the Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey (2019 GMIS). Methods: An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey (2019 GMIS). The data was analysed using SPSS version 20.  The relationship between the dependent and independent variables was established using the chi-square test and binary logistic regression model. A p-value of 0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance of the study. Results: There were 913 eligible under-five children for this study, with 50.2% males and 49.8% females. The prevalence of under-five anaemia recorded in this current study for the three northern regions was 68.0%. The region with dominant (72.9%) prevalence was the Upper East region. Children of lower age group were more likely to be diagnosed with anaemia (P < 0.05). Children with female household heads were 35% less likely to be diagnosed with anaemia (AOR=0.65, 95% C.I.= 0.421-0.995). Those who had mothers with higher educational attainment were 79% less likely to be diagnosed with anaemia (AOR=0.21, 95% C.I.=0.085–0.541). Finally, those with history of fever in the last weeks were 62% more likely (AOR=1.62, 95% C.I. = 1.155–2.282). Conclusions: The high prevalence in the three northern regions of Ghana can be corrected with women empowerment through higher formal educational achievement and improved income status.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Expressive writing in a Saudi university English foreign language (EFL) classroom: Evaluating gains in syntactic complexity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study determines if the English foreign language (EFL) Saudi students achieve greater syntactic complexity when they engage in expressive writing than when they write about a general topic. Methods: This study employs an ex post facto research design to compare the writing output of EFL learners. The sample comprised of 24 college students enrolled in an English writing course, at Department of English and Translation, College of Sciences and Arts, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia for the academic year 2021-2022. The participants were assigned randomly, and their writing was analyzed using the computer software named Web-based L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer. Lu’s (2010) four board element of syntactic complexity and 14 units is employed to analyze the data. Results: Results show that students achieve higher syntactic complexity when engaging in writing on emotional topics (expressive writing) than when writing on general topics. Further, analysis shows that students' emotional writings are significant on three syntactic complexity measures, i.e., length of production units; amount of subordination; and phrase sophistication. The fourth measure, i.e., coordination, does not reflect significant differences between their expressive writing and general writing. Conclusions: The study's implications are expected to aid EFL instructors and curriculum designers in successfully implementing language education, particularly in writing, in the Saudi context. In line with the input hypothesis, this research suggests that writing about personal emotional events may enhance the quality of language two (L2) writing by increasing syntactic complexity. In this dimension, this study could be additional evidence of the Krashen hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection of mecA gene and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from milk and risk factors from farms in Probolinggo, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in dairy cows and is a source of contamination in milk. S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand swabs. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow’s milk and 41 samples of farmers’ hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Jamaica salt consumption, Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (Salt-KAP) study: A research protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Excess dietary salt consumption is a major contributor to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Public education programs on the dangers of high salt intake, and population level interventions to reduce the salt content in foods are possible strategies to address this problem. In Jamaica, there are limited data on the levels of salt consumption and the population’s knowledge and practices with regards to salt consumption. This study therefore aims to obtain baseline data on salt consumption, salt content in foods sold in restaurants, and evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Jamaicans regarding salt consumption. Methods: The study is divided into four components. Component 1 will be a secondary analysis of data on urinary sodium from spot urine samples collected as part of a national survey, the Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2016-2017. Component 2 will be a survey of chain and non-chain restaurants in Jamaica, to estimate the sodium content of foods sold in restaurants. Component 3 is another national survey, this time on a sample 1,200 individuals to obtain data on knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding salt consumption and estimation of urinary sodium excretion. Component 4 is a validation study to assess the level of agreement between spot urine sodium estimates and 24-hour urinary sodium from 120 individuals from Component 3. Discussion: This study will provide important baseline data on salt consumption in Jamaica and will fulfil the first components of the World Health Organization SHAKE Technical Package for Salt Reduction. The findings will serve as a guide to Jamaica’s Ministry of Health and Wellness in the development of a national salt reduction program. Findings will also inform interventions to promote individual and population level sodium reduction strategies as the country seeks to achieve the national target of a 30% reduction in salt consumption by 2025.

                Background: Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs which improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by preventing the kidney from reabsorbing glucose back to blood. Community pharmacists have long-term relationships with most of their chronic patients, so they play a key role in care for people with diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess pharmacists’ knowledge and practice towards SGLT2 inhibitors. Thus, improving pharmacists’ knowledge about this group of medications could improve the treatment outcome of people with diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to meet the study objectives. A convenience sample of 348 community pharmacists in Jordan was recruited. knowledge and practice were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire created for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 400 community pharmacists were reached, of whom 348 answered the survey (response rate 87%). The results indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors knowledge score among community pharmacists in Jordan was 6.61 (out of 12). Factors like age, gender, location of the pharmacy, years of pharmacists’ experience had no effect on knowledge score; however, pharmacists who attended training courses on diabetes had higher knowledge scores. Additionally, pharmacists’ dispensing practice toward SGLT2 inhibitors had insufficient knowledge, such as lack of knowledge about the superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors over other anti-diabetics and inability to give the best advice to patients. Conclusions: Our findings reflect a moderate knowledge among community pharmacists about SGLT2 inhibitors which may negatively affect the patients’ outcome; thus, continuous education for the pharmacists is essential.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central melanocortin system is fundamentally important for controlling food intake and energy homeostasis. Melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is one of two major receptors of the melanocortin system found in the brain. In contrast to the well-characterized melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), little is known regarding the organization of MC3R-expressing neural circuits. To increase our understanding of the intrinsic organization of MC3R neural circuits, identify specific differences between males and females, and gain a neural systems level perspective of this circuitry, we conducted a brain-wide mapping of neurons labeled for MC3R and characterized the distribution of their projections. Analysis revealed MC3R neuronal and terminal labeling in multiple brain regions that control a diverse range of physiological functions and behavioral processes. Notably, dense labeling was observed in the hypothalamus, as well as areas that share considerable connections with the hypothalamus, including the cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and brainstem. Additionally, MC3R neuronal labeling was sexually dimorphic in several areas, including the anteroventral periventricular area, arcuate nucleus, principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and ventral premammillary region. Altogether, anatomical evidence reported here suggests that MC3R has the potential to influence several different classes of motivated behavior that are essential for survival, including ingestive, reproductive, defensive, and arousal behaviors, and is likely to modulate these behaviors differently in males and females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scientific literacy and preferred resources used by Latin American medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational survey [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to identify the preferred sources for acquiring knowledge about COVID-19 and to evaluate basic knowledge on critical scientific literature appraisal in students from medical schools located in Spanish speaking countries in Latin America.  Methods: We designed an online survey of 15 closed-ended questions related to demographics, preferred resources for COVID-19 training, and items to assess critical appraisal skills. A snowball method was used for sampling. We conducted a descriptive analysis and Chi-squared tests to compare the proportion of correct identification of the concept of a preprint and a predatory journal when considering a) self-perceived level of knowledge, b) public vs private school, c) inclusion of a scientific literature appraisal subject in the curriculum, and d) progress in medical school. Results: Our sample included 770 valid responses, out of which most of the participants included were from Mexico (n=283, 36.8%) and Ecuador (n=229, 29.7%). Participants preferred using evidence-based clinical resources (EBCRs) to learn more about COVID-19 (n=182, 23.6%). The preferred study design was case report/series (n=218, 28.1%). We found that only 265 participants correctly identified the concept of a preprint (34.4%), while 243 students (31.6%) correctly identified the characteristics of a predatory journal. We found no significant differences in the proportion of correct answers regardless of the self-perceived level of knowledge, progress in medical school, or scientific literature critical appraisal classes. Conclusion: This study is novel in its approach of identifying sources of knowledge used by Latin American medical students and provides insights into the need to reinforce training in critical appraisal of scientific literature during medical school.

                Background: Numerous smoke-free tobacco or nicotine-containing product (TNP) alternatives have been introduced to support individual- and population-level harm reduction relative to continued cigarette smoking. This article details the nationwide prevalence and patterns of TNP use between 2016 and 2019 in Japan following the commercialization of IQOSTM, a smoke-free heated tobacco product (HTP). Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted over a period of three study years (2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019) in representative samples of the Japanese general adult population and samples of Japanese adult IQOS users registered in the IQOS owner database of Philip Morris International’s affiliate in Japan. Results: Across the three study years (Y1-Y3), the prevalence of overall current TNP use (Y1-Y3: 18.5%, 18.9%, and 18.2%) and overall TNP use by age and sex remained similar. However, there was a growing shift from cigarette smoking to smoke-free TNP use across the three study years. While the cigarette smoking prevalence (Y1-Y3: 17.6%, 17.3%, and 16.0%) decreased, the use prevalence of smoke-free TNPs, including the HTP IQOS (Y1-Y3: 1.8%, 3.2%, and 3.3%) and e-cigarettes (Y1-Y3, 0.7%, 1.6%, and 2.0%) increased. At the same time, TNP initiation, TNP relapse, and TNP reinitiation with IQOS were all very low across the three study years. Across Y1-Y3, exclusive use of only one type of TNP (Y1-Y3: 82.3%, 75.0%, and 70.4%) decreased, while dual use of two types of TNPs (Y1-Y3: 14.3%, 17.2%, and 16.7%) increased, and poly-TNP use (Y1-Y3: 2.1%, 6.1%, and 10.0%) increased markedly. Moreover, the majority of adult IQOS users were exclusive IQOS users. Conclusions: These findings suggest that current IQOS use behavior trends are in line with the principles of tobacco harm reduction and that HTPs are effective tools for complementing current tobacco control measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health, sleep quality and quality of life in individuals with and without multiple health conditions during home quarantine in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                  Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the healthcare workers across the world, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychological stress, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of individuals with multiple health issues during home quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study was conducted between 28th March to 30th April 2020. We recruited 50 individuals who have a history of chronic health issues, and 50 individuals with no health issues for this cross-sectional study. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the mental health [depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)], and QoL [short form of health-related questionnaire (SF-36)] of the participants. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student’s t-test, using SPSS software v16. Results: Baseline demographic characteristics were homogenous for both groups of participants. Intergroup analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental health (p<0.001), sleep quality (p<0.001), and QoL (p<0.001) between the two groups.  The results showed high levels of depression, anxiety and stress; poor sleep quality and low health-related QoL in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that individuals with chronic health issues exhibit higher mental health problems, lower quality of sleep and have a lower health-related QoL. More research is required and also government should plan on taking care of those patients.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cracking the encoding of human scent in the mosquito brain</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Zhao et al. decipher how the olfactory system encodes human versus animal odors in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. By combining genome engineering, in vivo calcium imaging, advanced chemistry, and behavioral analysis, the authors provide compelling evidence that the discriminatory coding of host odors is surprisingly simple – and bridges labeled line with combinatorial coding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptor linked K63 di-Ubiquitin activates Nedd4/Rsp5 E3 ligase</a></h4>

              
                Nedd4/Rsp5 family E3 ligases mediate numerous cellular processes, many of which require the E3 ligase to interact with PY-motif containing adaptor proteins. Several Arrestin-Related Trafficking adaptors (ARTs) of Rsp5 were self-ubiquitinated for activation, but the regulation mechanism remains elusive. Remarkably, we demonstrate that Art1, Art4, and Art5 undergo K63 linked di-Ubiquitination by Rsp5. This modification enhances the PM recruitment of Rsp5 by Art1 or Art5 upon substrate induction, required for cargo protein ubiquitination. In agreement with these observations, we find that di-ubiquitin strengthens the interaction between the Pombe orthologs of Rsp5 and Art1, Pub1 and Any1. Further, we discover that the HECT domain exosite protects the K63 linked di-Ubiquitin on the adaptors from cleavage by the deubiquitination enzyme Ubp2. Together, our study uncovers a novel ubiquitination modification implemented by Rsp5 adaptor proteins, underscoring the regulatory mechanism of how adaptor proteins control the recruitment and activity of Rsp5 for the turnover of membrane proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gene expression phylogenies and ancestral transcriptome reconstruction resolves major transitions in the origins of pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                Structural and physiological changes in the female reproductive system underlie the origins of pregnancy in multiple vertebrate lineages. In mammals, the glandular portion of the lower reproductive tract has transformed into a structure specialized for supporting fetal development. These specializations range from relatively simple maternal nutrient provisioning in egg-laying monotremes to an elaborate suite of traits that support intimate maternal-fetal interactions in Eutherians. Among these traits are the maternal decidua and fetal component of the placenta, but there is considerable uncertainty about how these structures evolved. Previously we showed that changes in uterine gene expression contributes to several evolutionary innovations during the origins of pregnancy (Marinic, Mika, and Lynch 2021). Here we reconstruct the evolution of entire transcriptomes ('ancestral transcriptome reconstruction') and show that maternal gene expression profiles are correlated with degree of placental invasion. These results indicate that an epitheliochorial-like placenta evolved early in the mammalian stem-lineage and that the ancestor of Eutherians had a hemochorial placenta, and suggest maternal control of placental invasiveness. These data resolve major transitions in the evolution of pregnancy and indicate that ancestral transcriptome reconstruction can be used to study the function of ancestral cell, tissue, and organ systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">State-dependent activity dynamics of hypothalamic stress effector neurons</a></h4>

              
                The stress response necessitates an immediate boost in vital physiological functions from their homeostatic operation to elevated emergency response. However, neural mechanisms underlying this state-dependent change remain largely unknown. Using a combination of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology with computational modeling, we report that corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the effector neurons of hormonal stress response, rapidly transition between distinct activity states through recurrent inhibition. Specifically, <i>in vivo</i> optrode recording shows that under non-stress conditions, CRH<sub>PVN</sub> neurons often fire with rhythmic brief bursts (RB), which, somewhat counterintuitively, constrains firing rate due to long (~2 s) inter-burst intervals. Stressful stimuli rapidly switch RB to continuous single spiking (SS), permitting a large increase in firing rate. A spiking network model shows that recurrent inhibition can control this activity-state switch, and more broadly the gain of spiking responses to excitatory inputs. In biological CRH<sub>PVN</sub> neurons <i>ex vivo</i>, the injection of whole-cell currents derived from our computational model recreates the <i>in vivo</i>-like switch between RB and SS, providing a direct evidence that physiologically relevant network inputs enable state-dependent computation in single neurons. Together, we present a novel mechanism for state-dependent activity dynamics in CRH<sub>PVN</sub> neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of lactate metabolism in the peripheral nervous system leads to motor-selective deficits</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells (SCs) myelinate and provide trophic support to axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and disruption of SC cellular metabolism leads to demyelination and axon degeneration, both symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. The lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes that glycolytic support cells supply lactate to adjacent axons to sustain their high metabolic demands, a process that requires the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in both SCs and neurons. To test this hypothesis in the PNS, we selectively knocked out the genes for both LDH enzymes, LDHA and LDHB, in motor neurons (MNs), sensory neurons (SNs), or SCs. Interestingly, motor axons and their synapses progressively degenerate when LDH is deleted from either MNs or SCs; however, defects in sensory axons or their terminals were not observed when LDH was excised from either SNs or SCs. Deletion of LDH in SCs also leads to a decrease in total ATP levels in peripheral nerves despite a marked accumulation of pyruvate and glycolytic intermediates, consistent with the failure of pyruvate to lactate conversion in SCs leading to energetic deficits in axons. These results support a model in which motor axons are more dependent on SC-derived lactate than are sensory axons, a specific dependency that suggests LDH and lactate shuttling influence the course of motor-dominated neuropathies such as ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local axonal translation sustains synapse-type-specific neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic protein synthesis is a well-known regulator of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. For example, local on-demand protein synthesis in dendrites is required for hippocampal long-term and homeostatic plasticity. Although axonal protein synthesis is a key regulator in neural circuit assembly during early development, it is unclear if local translation in mature axons plays a functional role in neurotransmission of the mammalian central nervous system. Here we show that local translation in axons regulates pyramidal cell neurotransmission in primary visual cortex microcircuits in a synapse-type-specific manner. Using paired recordings to manipulate pre- and postsynaptic neurons independently, we found that presynaptic translation sustains neurotransmission and regulates short-term plasticity. This was mediated via mTOR and cap-dependent translation, with presynaptic NMDA receptors acting as an up-stream trigger. By isolating the axon from the soma with laser microsurgery, we unveiled that axonal translation was required to sustain neurotransmission. With live endogenous RNA imaging, we found that RNA granules stably docked in individual presynaptic compartments, suggesting bouton-specific regulation. In agreement, presynaptic translation influenced pyramidal cell synapses to neighbouring pyramidal cells, but not to inhibitory Martinotti cells. Our study establishes local protein synthesis in mature axons as a fundamental regulatory principle that governs information transfer at central synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Interictal Suppression Hypothesis in Focal Epilepsy: Electrographic and Structural Evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Why are people with focal epilepsy not constantly seizing? Previous molecular work has implicated gamma-aminobutyric acid balance as integral to seizure generation and termination, but is the high-level distributed brain network involved in suppressing seizures? Recent intracranial electrographic evidence has suggested that seizure onset zones have an increased inward connectivity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that seizure onset zones are actively suppressed by the rest of the brain network during interictal states. We tested this hypothesis on 81 subjects with drug resistant focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation. We utilized intracranial electrographic resting-state and neurostimulation recordings to evaluate the network connectivity of seizure onset, propagative, and non-involved regions. We then utilized diffusion imaging to acquire estimates of white matter connectivity to evaluate structure-function coupling effects on connectivity findings. Finally, using our observations, we generated a resting-state classification model to assist clinicians in detecting seizure onset and propagative zones without the need for multiple ictal recordings. Our findings indicate that seizure onset and propagative zones demonstrate markedly increased inward connectivity and decreased outward connectivity on both resting-state and neurostimulation analyses. When controlling for distance between regions, the difference between inward vs. outward connectivity remained stable up to 80 mm between brain connections. Structure-function coupling analyses revealed that seizure onset zones exhibit abnormally enhanced coupling (hypercoupling) of surrounding regions compared to presumably healthy tissue. Using these observations, our classification models achieved a maximum held-out testing set accuracy of 92.0+/-2.2%. These results indicate that seizure onset zones are actively segregated and suppressed by a widespread brain network. Furthermore, this electrographically observed functional suppression is disproportionate to any observed structural connectivity alterations of the seizure onset zones. These findings have implications for the identification of seizure onset zones using only brief resting-sate recordings to reduce patient morbidity and augment the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy. Furthermore, testing of the interictal suppression hypothesis can provide insight into potential new resective, ablative, and neuromodulation approaches to improve surgical success rates in those suffering from drug resistant focal epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian regulation of dentate gyrus excitability mediated by G-protein signaling</a></h4>

              
                The central circadian regulator within the suprachiasmatic nucleus transmits time of day information by a diurnal spiking rhythm that is driven by intrinsic activity of molecular clock genes controlling membrane excitability. Most brain regions, including the hippocampus, harbor similar intrinsic circadian transcriptional machinery but whether these molecular programs generate oscillations of membrane properties is unexplored. Here, we show that intrinsic excitability of mouse dentate granule neurons exhibits a 24-hour oscillation that controls spiking probability. Diurnal changes in excitability are mediated by antiphase G-protein regulation of potassium and sodium conductances to reduce excitability during the light phase. Disruption of the circadian transcriptional machinery by conditional deletion of Bmal1 enhances excitability selectively during the light phase, increasing engram recruitment and spatial discrimination memory. These results reveal that circadian transcriptional machinery regulates intrinsic excitability, highlighting the role of cell-autonomous oscillations in hippocampal function and behavior.

                Efferent neurons are believed to play essential roles in maintaining auditory function. The lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons, which project from the brainstem to the inner ear where they release multiple transmitters including peptides, catecholamines and acetylcholine, are the most numerous yet least understood elements of efferent control of the cochlea. Using in vitro calcium imaging and patch-clamp recordings, we found that LOC neurons in juvenile and young adult mice exhibited extremely slow waves of activity (~0.1 Hz). These seconds-long bursts of Na+ spikes were driven by an intrinsic oscillator dependent on L-type Ca2+ channels, and were not observed in prehearing mice, suggesting an age-dependent mechanism underlying the intrinsic oscillator. Using optogenetic approaches, we identified both ascending (cochlear nucleus) and descending (auditory cortex) sources of synaptic excitation, as well as the synaptic receptors used for such excitation. Additionally, we identified potent inhibition originating in the glycinergic medial nucleus of trapezoid body (MNTB). Conductance-clamp experiments revealed an unusual mechanism of electrical signaling in LOC neurons, in which synaptic excitation and inhibition served to switch on and off the intrinsically generated spike burst mechanism, allowing for prolonged periods of activity or silence controlled by brief synaptic events. Protracted bursts of action potentials may be essential for effective exocytosis of the diverse transmitters released by LOC fibers in the cochlea.

                One of the significant challenges in real-time fMRI environments is to ensure that the functional images are exported in real-time. The prerequired ability to reconstruct these images immediately after the acquisition has already been resolved in 2004. Nowadays, more sophisticated sequences allow for higher resolution and faster repetition times and thereby challenging the ability to export this data in real-time. In this article, we tackle the potentially arising problem of sending the reconstructed data from the MRI to an external PC to perform the real-time fMRI analysis. We show that depending on the implementation of the data transfer, long delays can occur that can differ drastically in time and how often they occur. In addition, we propose a solution for SIEMENS MRI devices which was tested and applied already on multiple MRI devices including 3T and 7T machines on different vendor software versions. This new technique can be used as a blueprint that can be directly applied to other manufacturers. We also provide the source code of the described solution and show that the delay in the data transfer can be completely resolved using our proposed procedure. Finally, we integrate measurement options for the data transfer times to improve quality measures in real-time fMRI environments (e.g., clinical) that can implement the proposed solution. Efforts should be taken by the real-time community and MRI manufacturers to employ a standardized real-time export e.g., similar to the lab streaming layer which is used as a standard export method in EEG environments.

                The complexity of affected brain regions and cell types is a challenge for Huntington disease (HD) treatment. Here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to investigate mechanism of pathology in the cortex and striatum from R6/2 mice at 8 and 12w and in three regions of human HD post-mortem tissue. We identified cell type-specific and cell agnostic signatures and found changes suggesting oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) were arrested in intermediate maturation states. OL-lineage regulators OLIG1 and OLIG2 were negatively correlated with CAG length in human OPCs, and ATACseq analysis of HD mouse NeuN-negative cells showed decreased accessibility of sites regulated by OL maturation genes. Glucose and lipid metabolism were implicated in abnormal cell maturation and PRKCE and Thiamine Pyrophosphokinase 1 were identified as central genes. High dose thiamine/biotin treatment of R6/1 HD mice to target thiamine metabolism not only restored OL maturation, but also rescued pathology in neurons. These findings reveal insights into HD OL pathology that spans multiple brain regions and link OL maturation deficits to abnormal thiamine metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired neuromodulator crosstalk delays vigilance-dependent astroglia Ca2+ activation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Degeneration in neuronal nuclei producing the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therapeutic interventions that increase acetylcholine in brain ameliorate AD symptoms in human patients, and augmenting norepinephrine restores cognitive function in mouse models of AD as well as Down Syndrome, the most frequent cause of early onset AD. A prominent cellular target of noradrenergic and potentially cholinergic signaling during states of heightened vigilance are astroglia and recent studies indicate that astroglia Ca2+ dynamics in awake mice contribute to optimal cognitive performance. Here we tested the hypothesis that vigilance-dependent Ca2+ signaling in mouse primary visual cortex astrocytes is altered in mouse models of AD and provide mechanistic insight into upstream neuromodulator signaling that shapes astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics in healthy and AD conditions. In two mouse models of AD (APPswe/PSEN1dE9 and AppNL-F KI), we consistently observed delayed and less coordinated astrocyte Ca2+ elevations in response to locomotion, a well-controlled behavioral paradigm triggering widespread Ca2+ activation in astroglia throughout the brain. Combining pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we found that noradrenergic signaling to astrocytes was facilitated by cholinergic signaling, but this neuromodulator crosstalk was impaired in AppNL-F mice. Pharmacological facilitation of norepinephrine release rescued delayed and less coordinated astrocyte Ca2+ activation in AppNL-F mice and suggests that astrocytes preserve a functional reserve that can be recruited even during late-stage disease. Our findings of delayed and less coordinated astroglia Ca2+ activation predict impaired noradrenergic signaling and may contribute to the cognitive decline in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Population Dynamics of Computing with Synaptic Modulations</a></h4>

              
                In addition to long-time scale rewiring, synapses in the brain are subject to significant modulation that occurs at much shorter time scales and allows them to process short-term information. Despite this, models of the brain like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) often have their weights frozen after training, relying on an internal state stored in neuron activity to process temporal information. Although networks with dynamical synapses have been explored previously, often said dynamics are added to networks that also have recurrent connections and thus the short-time scale computational capabilities of synapse modulation alone remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of a network that relies solely on synaptic modulations to process short-time scale information, the multi-plasticity network (MPN). We thoroughly examine the neural population dynamics of the MPN trained on integration-based tasks and compare it to known RNN dynamics, findings the two to have fundamentally different behavior and attractor structure. We find said differences in dynamics allow the MPN to outperform its RNN counterparts on several neuroscience-relevant tasks. Of note, the MPN has a significantly simpler attractor structure that allows it to be more flexible in training and sequential-learning settings. Lastly, how the dynamics change for MPNs trained on contextual and continuous integration tasks is also investigated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active search signatures in a free-viewing task exploiting concurrent EEG and eye movements recordings</a></h4>

              
                Early access to categorical visual information plays an important role in real-world behaviour. Under fixed-gaze conditions, there are well-established electrophysiological signatures of categorical processing like the N170 EEG component. Here we aimed to study how the sensitivity to category information extends to a free viewing paradigm and consider how ecologically-relevant variables such as the particular task performed influence the brain activity. We co-registered EEG and eye-tracking to investigate fixation-related potentials to pictures of different categories during visual search and exploration. Participants were asked to observe or search for one target from an array of faces and objects embedded in random noise. We applied a deconvolution analysis approach to estimate the contribution of the different elements embedded in the task. Consistent with classical fixed-gaze experiments and a handful of free viewing studies, we found a robust categorial effect in occipital and occipitotemporal electrodes. We also report a task effect, which was reflected by a negative occipital activation and a positive frontal activation of the estimates. To further investigate the dynamics along the trial, we defined a trial progression score and found significant effects of trial progression, and the interaction between the trial progression and task effects. Overall, these results generalise the characterisation of early visual face processing to a wider range of experiments and show how a suitable analysis approach allows to discern among multiple neural contributions to the signal, preserving key attributes of real-world tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Involvement of CaV2.2 channels and α2δ-1 in hippocampal homeostatic synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brain, presynaptic CaV2 channels play a pivotal role for synaptic transmission by mediating fast neurotransmitter exocytosis via influx of Ca2+ into the active zone of presynaptic terminals. However, the distribution and modulation of CaV2.2 channels at highly plastic hippocampal synapses remains to be elucidated. Here, we assess CaV2.2 channels during homeostatic synaptic plasticity, a compensatory form of homeostatic control preventing excessive or insufficient neuronal activity during which extensive active zone remodelling has been described. We show that chronic silencing of neuronal activity in mature hippocampal cultures resulted in elevated presynaptic Ca2+ transients, mediated by increased levels of CaV2.2 channels at the presynaptic site. This work focussed further on the role of 2{delta}-1 subunits, important regulators of synaptic transmission and CaV2.2 channel abundance at the presynaptic membrane. We find that 2{delta}-1-overexpression reduces the contribution of CaV2.2 channels to total Ca2+ flux without altering the amplitude of the Ca2+ transients. Levels of endogenous 2{delta}-1 decreased during homeostatic synaptic plasticity, whereas the overexpression of 2{delta}-1 prevented homeostatic synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Together, this study reveals a key role for CaV2.2 channels and novel roles for 2{delta}-1 during synaptic plastic adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mice lacking dopamine production in neurotensin receptor 1 neurons voluntarily undergo time-restricted feeding of high fat diet and resist obesity</a></h4>

              
                The introduction of processed foods high in fat and sugars has caused a dramatic increase in obesity in humans. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) can be modeled in laboratory mice by increasing the fat content of their diet. Previously, it was determined that mice lacking dopamine receptor 1 (Drd1) are completely resistant to DIO and do not eat as much food during the day as control mice. Surprisingly, when Drd1 is restored to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the central regulator of circadian rhythms, these mice increase day-eating and become obese. The source of dopamine in the SCN is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the genetic identity of the dopamine neurons is unknown. Here we create conditional deletion mutants for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using neurotensin receptor 1 (Ntsr1) Cre and other Cre drivers and measure feeding and body weight homeostasis on standard and high fat diets. Control mice were susceptible to DIO and overate during the day whereas Ntsr1-Cre conditional knockouts for TH mice did not increase day-eating, nor did they gain much weight on HFD. We used an adeno-associated virus to selectively restore TH to the VTA Ntsr1 neurons and observed an increase in body weight and increased day-eating of HFD. These results implicate VTA Ntsr1 dopamine neurons as promoting out-of-phase feeding behavior on a high fat diet that could be an important contributor to diet-induced obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High Variability Periods in the EEG: A New Temporal Metric that Reflects Brain States</a></h4>

              
                Here we define a new metric to characterize temporal patterns of amplitude variability in the EEG signal and demonstrate that this feature of the signal varies significantly with brain state. The metric uses the standard deviation of waveform amplitude in a short moving time window of 3-20 seconds with 50% overlap. We define High Variability Periods or HVPs as segments when the moving standard deviation of the waveform amplitude is continuously higher than a cutoff defined as the 25th percentile of variability. HVPs typically last on the order of tens of seconds and are punctuated by Low Variability Periods or LVPs of shorter duration. We further show that the HVP characteristics differ between various conditions. HVPs in the resting state eyes closed condition are substantially and significantly shorter in duration and smaller in area relative to eyes open. In addition, in recordings from monkeys, HVPs disappear under anesthesia and do not reappear in early periods of recovery from anesthesia suggesting long term changes to the signal. Altogether this demonstrates that HVP metrics have discriminatory power and may therefore be important in predicting brain states and outcomes. Finally, they are fast to estimate and can be tracked in time, and therefore suited for near real-time monitoring in low-electrode configuration systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of changing food choices while bypassing values</a></h4>

              
                Current theories suggest that altering choices requires value modification. To investigate this, normal-weight participants' food choices and values were tested before and after an approach-avoidance training (AAT), while neural activity was recorded during the choice task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During AAT, participants consistently approached low- while avoiding high-calorie food cues. AAT facilitated low-calorie food choices, leaving food values unchanged. Instead, we observed a shift in indifference points, indicating the decreased contribution of food values in food choices. Training-induced choice shifts were associated with increased activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In contrast, the medial PFC activity was not changed. Additionally, PCC grey matter density predicted individual differences in training-induced functional changes, suggesting anatomic predispositions to training impact. Our findings demonstrate neural mechanisms underlying choice modulation independent of valuation-related processes, with substantial theoretical significance for decision-making frameworks and translational implications for health-related decisions resilient to value shifts.

                The intestinal mucus layer protects the host from invading pathogens and is essential for maintaining a healthy mucosal microbial community. Alterations in the mucus layer and composition of mucus-residing microbiota in people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) may contribute to dysbiosis and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Although microbial dysbiosis based on sequencing data is frequently reported in autism, spatial profiling of microbes adjacent to the mucosa is needed to identify changes in bacterial subtypes in close contact with host tissues. Here, we analysed the spatial distribution of the MUC-2 protein using immunofluorescence as well as total bacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes phyla and Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) using fluorescent in situ hybridization in mice expressing the autism-associated R451C mutation in the Neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3) gene. We show that the Nlgn3 R451C mutation increases mucus density adjacent to the distal ileal epithelium in mice. The relative density of total bacteria, Firmicutes and A. muciniphila was increased whereas the density of Bacteroidetes was decreased closer to the epithelium in Nlgn3R451C mice. In summary, this study suggests that increased mucus density could contribute to mucosal microbial dysbiosis in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations in the human hippocampus normalize the information content of episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                The principles governing the formation of episodic memories from the continuous stream of sensory stimuli are not fully understood. Theoretical models of the hippocampus propose that the representational format of episodic memories comprise oscillations in the theta frequency band (2-8 Hz) that set the time boundaries in which discrete events are bound encoded in the gamma frequency range (>30 Hz). We investigated this temporal segmentation and binding process by analyzing the intracranial EEG (iEEG) of surgically implanted epileptic patients performing a virtual-navigation task. We found a positive correlation between sensory information density encountered by the subject and hippocampal theta-frequency, suggesting that the human hippocampus normalizes the information content of episodic memories relative to the density of sensory information. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that as a marker of mnemonic encoding, i.e. the amount of persistent gamma events, directly correlates with sensory information density, gamma-frequency power and the phase relation between theta and gamma oscillations remain constant. Using a theoretical model of the hippocampus, we build a model that analogously displays a similar normalization of gamma episodes per theta cycle relative to information density by accounting for the physiological signatures of theta-gamma coding through combining fast and slow inhibitory feedback. We propose that this intrinsic normalization mechanism optimizes the trade-off between the discretization and compression of continuous experience relative to the limited capacity of episodic memory.

	<p>The past decade has witnessed the great success of deep neural networks in various domains. However, deep neural networks are very resource-intensive in terms of energy consumption, data requirements, and high computational costs. With the recent increasing need for the autonomy of machines in the real world, e.g., self-driving vehicles, drones, and collaborative robots, exploitation of deep neural networks in those applications has been actively investigated. In those applications, energy and computational efficiencies are especially important because of the need for real-time responses and the limited energy supply. A promising solution to these previously infeasible applications has recently been given by biologically plausible spiking neural networks. Spiking neural networks aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning, using biologically realistic models of neurons to carry out the computation. Due to their functional similarity to the biological neural network, spiking neural networks can embrace the sparsity found in biology and are highly compatible with temporal code. Our contributions in this work are: (i) we give a comprehensive review of theories of biological neurons; (ii) we present various existing spike-based neuron models, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we detail synapse models; (iv) we provide a review of artificial neural networks; (v) we provide detailed guidance on how to train spike-based neuron models; (vi) we revise available spike-based neuron frameworks that have been developed to support implementing spiking neural networks; (vii) finally, we cover existing spiking neural network applications in computer vision and robotics domains. The paper concludes with discussions of future perspectives.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to evaluate the resected area of endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA) and transcranial approach (TCA) for skull base meningiomas (SBMs) using voxel-based-lesion mapping and visualized the appropriate tumor location in each approach. Methods: We retrospectively examined 182 patients with SBMs who underwent tumor resection in our hospital between 2014 and 2019. Pre- and post-operative SBMs were manually delineated on MRI to create the voxels-of-interest (VOIpre and VOIpost) and were registered onto the normalized brain (normalized VOIpre and normalized VOIpost). The resected map was created by subtracting normalized VOIpost from the normalized VOIpre divided by the number of cases. The resected maps of TCA and EEA were compared by subtracting them. Results: Twenty patients underwent EEA and 135 patients underwent TCA. The tumor resected map demonstrated that the resected area of EEA frequently accumulated on the central skull base, while that of TCA accumulated near the central skull base. The border of both approaches matched the circle that connects neural foramens at the skull base. Conclusions: The resected area of SBMs by EEA and TCA was well visualized by voxel-based-lesion mapping. The circle connecting the neural foramens was the border of EEA and TCA.</p>

	<p>Olduvai protein domains (also known as DUF1220 or NBPF) have undergone the greatest human-specific increase in the copy number of any coding region in the genome. Their repeat number was strongly associated with the evolutionary expansion of brain volumes, neuron counts and cognitive abilities, as well as with disorders of the autistic spectrum. Nevertheless, the domain function and cellular mechanisms underlying the positive selection of Olduvai DNA sequences in higher primates remain obscure. Here, I show that the inclusion of Olduvai exon doublets in mature transcripts is facilitated by a potent splicing enhancer that was created through duplication within the first exon. The enhancer is the strongest among the NBPF transcripts and further promotes the already high splicing activity of the unexpanded first exons of the two-exon domains, safeguarding the expanded Olduvai exon doublets in the mature transcriptome. The duplication also creates a predicted RNA guanine quadruplex that may regulate the access to spliceosomal components of the super-enhancer and influence the splicing of adjacent exons. Thus, positive Olduvai selection during primate evolution is likely to result from a combination of multiple targets in gene expression pathways, including RNA splicing.</p>

	<p>Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly characterized by developmental delay in social and communication skills, it has been shown that neuromotor deficits are an early component of ASD. The neuromotor development of B6.129-Shank3tm2Gfng/J (Shank3B&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus;) mice as an animal model of autism has not been analyzed yet. The aim of this study was to compare the early neuromotor development of Shank3B&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; to wild-type mice. The mice underwent a multitude of neurodevelopmental tests and observations from postnatal day 1 (PND = 1) to weaning. Shank3B&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice opened their eyes later than their wild-type litter mates (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Shank3B&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice were also slower in the negative geotaxis test from PND = 13 to PND = 16 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in both sexes. The results of this study indicate neurodevelopmental deficits in Shank3B&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice. The test is partially dependent on truncal motor control, and these lines of evidence suggest a phenotype of developmental hypotonia, which corresponds with the phenotypes seen in patients with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. There was no observable effect of sex in any of the tests. There were no observed differences in upper and lower incisor eruption, ear unfolding, air righting, surface righting and ear twitch reflexes. Further studies should prove whether the delay in neuromotor development is linked to social or communication deficits, and thus, whether it may serve as an early indicator of autistic-like phenotype in mice.</p>

	<p>This study investigated the structure of sensorimotor representations during goal-directed grasping actions and explored their relationship with object features. Sixteen 3D-printed spheres that varied in size (i.e., a diameter of 20 mm, 40 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm) and weight (i.e., 40 g, 52 g, 76 g, 91 g) were used as experimental stimuli. The Structural Dimensional Analysis of Mental Representation (SDA-M) method was used to assess the sensorimotor representation structure during grasping. Participants were instructed in each trial to weigh, lift, or transport sets of two different spheres and to judge the similarity of the objects&amp;amp;rsquo; features, taking into account the executed grasping movement. Each participant performed a total of 240 trials, and object presentation was randomized. The results suggest that the functional interplay between object features and goal-directed actions accounts for the significant variations in the structure of sensorimotor representations after grasping. Specifically, the relevance of the perceived objects&amp;amp;rsquo; size and weight is closely interrelated to the grasping task demands and movement dynamics of the executed action. Our results suggest that distinct sensorimotor representations support individual grasping actions according to top-down influences modulated by motor intentions, functional task demands, and task-relevant object features.</p>

	<p>A whole-exome capture and next-generation sequencing was applied to an 11 y/o patient with a clinical history of congenital hypotonia, generalized motor and cognitive neurodevelopmental delay, and severe cognitive deficit, and without any identifiable Syndromic pattern, and to her parents, we disclosed a de novo heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.697_699del p.Phe233del (rs786204835)(ACMG classification PS2, PM1, PM2, PP5), harbored in the PURA gene (MIM*600473) (5q31.3), associated with Autosomal Dominant Mental Retardation 31 (MIM # 616158). We used the significant improvement in the accuracy of protein structure prediction recently implemented in AlphaFold that incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein structures. The wild-type (WT) sequence and the mutated sequence, missing the Phe233, were reconstructed. The predicted local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) for the PURAwt and the PURA&amp;amp;ndash;Phe233del showed that the occurrence of the Phe233del affects between 220&amp;amp;ndash;320 amino acids. The distortion in the PURA structural conformation in the ~5 &amp;amp;Aring; surrounding area after the p.Phe233del produces a conspicuous disruption of the repeat III, where the DNA and RNA helix unwinding capability occurs. PURA Protein&amp;amp;ndash;DNA docking corroborated these results in an in silico analysis that showed a loss of the contact of the PURA&amp;amp;ndash;Phe233del III repeat domain model with the DNA. Together, (i) the energetic and stereochemical, (ii) the hydropathic indexes and polarity surfaces, and (iii) the hybrid Quantum Mechanics&amp;amp;ndash;Molecular Mechanics (QM&amp;amp;ndash;MM) analyses of the PURA molecular models demarcate, at the atomic resolution, the specific surrounding region affected by these mutations and pave the way for future cell-based functional analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo mutation underpinning a PURA syndrome in a Latin American patient and highlights the importance of predicting the molecular effects in protein structure using artificial intelligence algorithms and molecular and atomic resolution stereochemical analyses.</p>

	<p>The electromyography bridge (EMGB) plays an important role in promoting the recovery of wrist joint function in stroke patients. We investigated the effects of the EMGB on promoting the recovery of upper limb function in hemiplegia. Twenty-four stroke patients with wrist dorsal extension dysfunction were recruited. Participants were randomized to undergo EMGB treatment or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Treatments to wrist extensors were conducted for 25 min, twice a day, 5 days per week, for 1 month. Outcome measures: active range of motion (AROM) of wrist dorsal extension; Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE); Barthel index (BI); and muscle strength of wrist extensors. After interventions, patients in the NMES group had significantly greater improvement in the AROM of wrist dorsal extension at the 4th week and 1st month follow-up (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). However, patients in the EMGB group had a statistically significant increase in AROM only at the follow-up assessment. No significant differences were observed in the AROM between the EMGB group and the NMES group (p&amp;amp;#65310;0.05). For secondary outcomes in the EMGB group, compared to baseline measurements, FMA-UE, BI, extensor carpi radialis and extensor carpi ulnaris muscle strength were significantly different as early as the 4th week (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The muscle strength of the extensor digitorum communis muscle showed significant differences at the follow-up (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between patients in the two groups in any of the parameters evaluated (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). The combination of EMGB or NMES with conventional treatment had similar effects on the improvement of the hemiplegic upper limb as assessed by wrist dorsal extension, FMA-UE, and activities of daily living. The improvement in both groups was maintained until 1 month after the intervention.</p>

	<p>In our contemporary societies, environmental issues are more and more important. An increasing number of studies explore the biological processes involved in environment perception and in particular try to highlight the mechanisms underlying the perception of environmental scenes by our brain. The main objective of the present study was to establish whether the visualization of clean and polluted environmental scenes would lead to differential postural reactions. Our hypothesis was based on a differential postural modulation that could be recorded when the subject is confronted with images representing a &amp;amp;ldquo;polluted&amp;amp;rdquo; environment, differential modulation which has been reported in previous studies in response to painful-scenes compared to non-painful scenes visualization.Thirty-one subjects participated in this study. Physiological measurements [heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity] and postural responses (Center Of Pression&amp;amp;mdash;COP&amp;amp;mdash;displacements) were recorded in response to perception of polluted or clean environmental scenes. We show, for the first time, that images representing polluted scenes evoke a weaker approach movement than images representing clean scenes. The displacement of the COP in the anteroposterior axis reflects an avoidance when subjects visualize &amp;amp;ldquo;polluted&amp;amp;rdquo; scenes. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between &amp;amp;ldquo;clean&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;polluted&amp;amp;rdquo; environments according to the postural change they induce, correlated with the ratings of pleasure and approach evoked by images.</p>

	<p>Subliminal stimuli are gaining growing interest due to their capability to induce desensitization to pathologically feared (e.g., phobic) pictures without inducing exaggerated emotional reactions. However, unresolved methodological issues cast significant doubt on the reliability of these findings and their interpretation. The studies most robustly assessing stimulus detection found that ~30% of the supposed-to-be-subliminal stimuli were, in fact, detected, suggesting that the beneficial effects attributed to subliminal stimuli may result from those actually seen. Nevertheless, a deeper analysis of the data underlying this misinterpretation unveils theoretical and clinical implications. Since the purpose of subliminal stimulation is to reduce the aversiveness of exposure therapies while maintaining their efficacy, researchers should measure the emotional relevance of supposed-to-be-subliminal stimuli that are, in fact, detected. A distinction is needed between perceptually- and emotionally-subliminal stimuli: the former is not consciously detected; the latter just fails to elicit emotional reactions. Emotionally-subliminal stimuli could represent an intermediate step of exposure in addition to those involving perceptually subliminal or supraliminal stimuli. Importantly, emotionally subliminal stimuli could make patients able to sustain a conscious exposure to feared stimuli without exaggeratedly reacting to them: if confirmed by empirical data, this unexpected disconfirmation of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; beliefs could pave the way for successful therapy while increasing their self-efficacy and compliance to treatment.</p>

	<p>Mitophagy is an important mechanism for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury. &amp;amp;beta;-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a natural sesquiterpene compound found in the essential oil of plants and has been shown to ameliorate CIR injury. However, whether BCP protects neurons from CIR injury by activating mitophagy is still unclear, and the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, a mouse neuron HT-22 cell of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and C57BL/6 male mouse of transient middle artery occlusion followed by 24 h reperfusion (MCAO/R) were established the model of CIR injury. Our results show that BCP remarkably protected against cell death and apoptosis induced by OGD/R, and decreased neurologic injury, infarct volume, and the injury of neurons in CA1 region on MCAO/R mice. In addition, BCP accelerated mitophagy by regulating expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker molecules and the mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratio (reflecting the relative number of mitochondria), and promoting autophagosome formation compared with OGD/R and MCAO/R groups both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this study revealed that BCP pre-treatment could activate the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway, also with mitophagy activation. To explore the mechanisms, mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) was used to investigate the role of BCP in CIR injury. We found that Mdivi-1 not only decreased BCP-induced facilitation of mitophagy, but also significantly weakened BCP-induced protection against OGD/R and MCAO/R models, which was consistent with levels of Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that facilitating mitophagy via Pink1/Parkin2 signaling is essential for the neuroprotective effect of BCP against CIR injury.</p>

	<p>Acute low-tone hearing loss (ALHL) is a common clinical disease and was first proposed by Abe in 1981 as sensorineural hearing loss confined to low frequencies. The best strategy for initiating medication is still unclear, as the superiority of steroids and diuretics is still debated, and combination therapy might yield additional benefits. However, no study regarding combination therapy has been published. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroid therapy versus combination therapy of diuretics with steroids by conducting a systematic review with a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). Studies enrolling patients with a diagnosis of acute low-tone hearing loss were considered eligible. After searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases from inception to 31 December 2021, five studies including 433 patients were enrolled. Overall, the comparison between combination therapy with steroids and diuretics and single-modality treatment with steroids (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.59; p = 0.74; I2 = 34%) and the comparison between combination therapy and treatment with diuretics alone (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.93 to 3.23; p = 0.09; I2 = 5%) showed that combination therapy did not confer significant benefits when compared to single-modality treatments. A trial sequential analysis (TSA) showed conclusive nonsignificant results of the comparison between the combination of steroids and diuretics and a single-modality treatment. In conclusion, we reported that the combination of steroids and diuretics did not yield significant benefits when compared to single-modality treatment with steroids or diuretics. We suggest that treatment should be initiated with steroids or diuretics alone to avoid potential adverse effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Acute stroke care has greatly improved in recent decades. However, the increasing stroke mortality in low-to-middle income countries suggests that progress has not been reached completely by these populations. Here we present the analysis of the hospital phase of the first population-based stroke surveillance study. Methods: A daily hospital surveillance method was used to identify adult patients with acute stroke during 18 months in six hospitals. We abstracted data on demographics, vascular risk factors, neuroimaging-confirmed stroke types, and clinical data. Results: A total of 1361 adults with acute stroke were identified (mean age 69.2 years; 52% women) with transient ischemic attack (5.5%), acute ischemic stroke (68.6%), intracerebral hemorrhage (23.1%), cerebral venous thrombosis (0.2%), and undetermined stroke (2.6%). The main risk factors were hypertension (80.7%) and diabetes mellitus (47.6%). The usage rate of thrombolysis was 3.6%, in spite of the fact that 37.2% of acute ischemic stroke patients arrived in &amp;amp;lt;4.5 h. The 30-day case fatality rate was 32.6%, higher in hemorrhagic than ischemic stroke. Conclusion: We identified limitations in acute stroke care in the Mexico City, including neuroimaging availability and thrombolysis usage. The door-to-door phase will help to depict the acute stroke burden in Mexico.</p>

	<p>Recent meta-analyses highlight alterations in cognitive functioning among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), with performance deficits observed across multiple cognitive domains including executive functioning, memory, and attention. Moreover, impaired concentration is a formal diagnostic criterion for a major depressive episode. Notably, cognitive impairment is reported frequently in MDD and is associated with poor treatment response. Despite this knowledge, research examining the effectiveness of top-down, adjunctive treatments for cognitive dysfunction in MDD remains in its infancy. The primary aim of the present study was to perform a pilot investigation of the implementation of a standardized cognitive remediation program, Goal Management Training (GMT), among individuals with a primary diagnosis of MDD. A secondary aim was to explore how comorbid symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among those MDD patients exposed to trauma may affect treatment response. A final sample of thirty individuals were randomized to either participate in the nine-week GMT program (active group; n = 16) or to complete a nine-week waiting period (waitlist control; n = 14). One participant was excluded from the GMT group analysis following study completion due to meeting an exclusion criteria. In total, 60% of the individuals allocated to the GMT program were trauma exposed (n = 9). Groups were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and at three-month follow-up. The assessment comprised neuropsychological tasks assessing a variety of cognitive domains, subjective measures of functioning and symptom severity, as well as a clinical interview to establish a primary diagnosis of MDD. Significant gains in processing speed, attention/concentration, and response inhibition were observed for the participants in the GMT condition relative to participants in the waitlist control condition. Individuals in the GMT condition also reported improvements in subjective cognitive functioning from baseline to post-treatment. Heightened PTSD symptom severity was associated with reduced response to treatment with respect to the domain of processing speed. The results of this pilot investigation highlight not only the potential utility of GMT as an augmentative treatment in MDD, but also highlight the contribution of comorbid symptoms of PTSD to diminished treatment response among trauma-exposed individuals with MDD. The study is limited primarily by its small pilot sample and the absence of a program evaluation component to gauge participant opinions and feedback of the treatment protocol.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Inhibition by Shh Signaling-Dependent Stellate Cell Pool Is Critical for Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cerebellar inhibitory interneurons are important regulators of neural circuit activity for diverse motor and nonmotor functions. The molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), consisting of basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs), provide dendritic and somatic inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells, respectively. They are sequentially generated in an inside-out pattern from Pax2<sup>+</sup> immature interneurons, which migrate from the prospective white matter to the ML of the cortex. However, little is known about how MLI subtype identities and pool sizes are determined, nor are their contributions to motor learning well understood. Here, we show that GABAergic progenitors fated to generate both BCs and SCs respond to the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal. Conditional abrogation of Shh signaling of either sex inhibited proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and reduced the number of Pax2<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas persistent Shh pathway activation increased their numbers. These changes, however, did not affect early born BC numbers but selectively altered the SC pool size. Moreover, genetic depletion of GABAergic progenitors when BCs are actively generated also resulted in a specific reduction of SCs, suggesting that the specification of MLI subtypes is independent of Shh signaling and their birth order and likely occurs after Pax2<sup>+</sup> cells settle into their laminar positions in an inside-out sequence. Mutant mice with reduced SC numbers displayed decreased dendritic inhibitory synapses and neurotransmission onto Purkinje cells, resulting in an impaired acquisition of eyeblink conditioning. These findings also reveal an essential role of Shh signaling-dependent SCs in regulating inhibitory dendritic synapses and motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellar circuit that enables fine motor learning involves MLIs of BCs and SCs, which provide dendritic and somatic inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells. Little is known about how their identities and numbers are determined, nor are their specific contributions to motor learning well understood. We show that MLI subtypes are specified independent of Shh signaling and their birth orders but appear to occur in their terminal laminar positions according to the inside-out sequence. This finding challenges the current view that MLI subtypes are specified sequentially at the progenitor level. We also demonstrate that dendritic inhibition by Shh signaling-dependent SC pool is necessary for motor learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Notch Inhibition Promotes Regeneration and Immunosuppression Supports Cone Survival in a Zebrafish Model of Inherited Retinal Dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Photoreceptor degeneration leads to irreversible vision loss in humans with retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa. Whereas photoreceptor loss is permanent in mammals, zebrafish possesses the ability to regenerate retinal neurons and restore visual function. Following acute damage, Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) re-enter the cell cycle and produce multipotent progenitors whose progeny differentiate into mature neurons. Both MG reprogramming and proliferation of retinal progenitor cells require reactive microglia and associated inflammatory signaling. Paradoxically, in zebrafish models of retinal degeneration, photoreceptor death does not induce the MG to reprogram and regenerate lost cells. Here, we used male and female zebrafish <I>cep290</I> mutants to demonstrate that progressive cone degeneration generates an immune response but does not stimulate MG proliferation. Acute light damage triggered photoreceptor regeneration in <I>cep290</I> mutants but cones were only restored to prelesion densities. Using <I>irf8</I> mutant zebrafish, we found that the chronic absence of microglia reduced inflammation and rescued cone degeneration in <I>cep290</I> mutants. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed sustained expression of <I>notch3</I> in MG of <I>cep290</I> mutants and inhibition of Notch signaling induced MG to re-enter the cell cycle. Our findings provide new insights on the requirements for MG to proliferate and the potential for immunosuppression to prolong photoreceptor survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are genetic diseases that lead to the progressive loss of photoreceptors and the permanent loss of vision. Zebrafish can regenerate photoreceptors after acute injury by reprogramming Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) into stem-like cells that produce retinal progenitors, but this regenerative process fails to occur in zebrafish models of IRDs. Here, we show that Notch pathway inhibition can promote photoreceptor regeneration in models of progressive degeneration and that immunosuppression can prevent photoreceptor loss. These results offer insight into the pathways that promote MG-dependent regeneration and the role of inflammation in photoreceptor degeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Spiking Is Governed by Broadband Fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Populations of cortical neurons generate rhythmic fluctuations in their ongoing spontaneous activity. These fluctuations can be seen in the local field potential (LFP), which reflects summed return currents from synaptic activity in the local population near a recording electrode. The LFP is spectrally broad, and many researchers view this breadth as containing many narrowband oscillatory components that may have distinct functional roles. This view is supported by the observation that the phase of narrowband oscillations is often correlated with cortical excitability and can relate to the timing of spiking activity and the fidelity of sensory evoked responses. Accordingly, researchers commonly tune in to these channels by narrowband filtering the LFP. Alternatively, neural activity may be fundamentally broadband and composed of transient, nonstationary rhythms that are difficult to approximate as oscillations. In this view, the instantaneous state of the broad ensemble relates directly to the excitability of the local population with no particular allegiance to any frequency band. To test between these alternatives, we asked whether the spiking activity of neocortical neurons in marmoset of either sex is better aligned with the phase of the LFP within narrow frequency bands or with a broadband measure. We find that the phase of broadband LFP fluctuations provides a better predictor of spike timing than the phase after filtering in narrow bands. These results challenge the view of the neocortex as a system composed of narrowband oscillators and supports a view in which neural activity fluctuations are intrinsically broadband.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research into the dynamical state of neural populations often attributes unique significance to the state of narrowband oscillatory components. However, rhythmic fluctuations in cortical activity are nonstationary and broad spectrum. We find that the timing of spontaneous spiking activity is better captured by the state of broadband fluctuations over any latent oscillatory component. These results suggest narrowband interpretations of rhythmic population activity may be limited, and broader representations may provide higher fidelity in describing moment-to-moment fluctuations in cortical activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping the Integration of Sensory Information across Fingers in Human Sensorimotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The integration of somatosensory signals across fingers is essential for dexterous object manipulation. Previous experiments suggest that this integration occurs in neural populations in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, the integration process has not been fully characterized, as previous studies have mainly used 2-finger stimulation paradigms. Here, we addressed this gap by stimulating all 31 single- and multifinger combinations. We measured population-wide activity patterns evoked during finger stimulation in human S1 and primary motor cortex (M1) using 7T fMRI in female and male participants. Using multivariate fMRI analyses, we found clear evidence of unique nonlinear interactions between fingers. In Brodmann area (BA) 3b, interactions predominantly occurred between pairs of neighboring fingers. In BA 2, however, we found equally strong interactions between spatially distant fingers, as well as interactions between finger triplets and quadruplets. We additionally observed strong interactions in the hand area of M1. In both M1 and S1, these nonlinear interactions did not reflect a general suppression of overall activity, suggesting instead that the interactions we observed reflect rich, nonlinear integration of sensory inputs from the fingers. We suggest that this nonlinear finger integration allows for a highly flexible mapping from finger sensory inputs to motor responses that facilitates dexterous object manipulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Processing of somatosensory information in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is essential for dexterous object manipulation. To successfully handle an object, the sensorimotor system needs to detect complex patterns of haptic information, which requires the nonlinear integration of sensory inputs across multiple fingers. Using multivariate fMRI analyses, we characterized brain activity patterns evoked by stimulating all single- and multifinger combinations. We report that progressively stronger multifinger interactions emerge in posterior S1 and in the primary motor cortex (M1), with interactions arising between inputs from neighboring and spatially distant fingers. Our results suggest that S1 and M1 provide the neural substrate necessary to support a flexible mapping from sensory inputs to motor responses of the hand.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Cerebellar Connectivity Underlying Motor Control in Chronic Poststroke Individuals</a></h4>

              
                <p>The robust, reciprocal anatomic connections between the cerebellum and contralateral sensorimotor cerebral hemisphere underscore the strong physiological interdependence between these two regions in relation to human behavior. Previous studies have shown that damage to sensorimotor cortex can result in a lasting reduction of cerebellar metabolism, the magnitude of which has been linked to poor rehabilitative outcomes. A better understanding of movement-related cerebellar physiology as well as cortico-cerebellar coherence (CCC) in the chronic, poststroke state may be key to developing novel neuromodulatory techniques that promote upper limb motor rehabilitation. As a part of the first in-human phase I trial investigating the effects of deep brain stimulation of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) on chronic poststroke motor rehabilitation, we collected invasive recordings from DN and scalp EEG in participants (both sexes) with middle cerebral artery stroke during a visuo-motor tracking task. We investigated the excitability of ipsilesional cortex, DN, and their interaction as a function of motor impairment and performance. Our results indicate the following: (1) event-related oscillations in the ipsilesional cortex and DN were significantly correlated at movement onset in the low beta band, with moderately and severely impaired participants showing desynchronization and synchronization, respectively; and (2) significant CCC was observed during the isometric hold period in the low beta band, which was critical for maintaining task accuracy. Our findings support a strong coupling between ipsilesional cortex and DN in the low beta band during motor control across all impairment levels, which encourages the exploitation of the cerebello&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical pathway as a neuromodulation target to promote rehabilitation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cerebral infarct because of stroke can lead to lasting reduction in cerebellar metabolism, resulting in poor rehabilitative outcomes. Thorough investigation of the cerebellar electrophysiology, as well as cortico-cerebellar connectivity in humans that could provide key insights to facilitate the development of novel neuromodulatory technologies, has been lacking. As a part of the first in-human phase I trial investigating deep brain stimulation of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) for chronic, poststroke motor rehabilitation, we collected invasive recordings from DN and scalp EEG while stroke survivors performed a motor task. Our data indicate strong coupling between ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and DN in the low beta band across all impairment levels encouraging the exploration of electrical stimulation of the DN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Stimulus Statistics Affect the Receptive Fields of Cells in Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>We studied the changes that neuronal receptive field (RF) models undergo when the statistics of the stimulus are changed from those of white Gaussian noise (WGN) to those of natural scenes (NSs), by fitting the models to multielectrode data recorded from primary visual cortex (V1) of female cats. This allowed the estimation of both a cascade of linear filters on the stimulus, as well as the static nonlinearities that map the output of the filters to the neuronal spike rates. We found that cells respond differently to these two classes of stimuli, with mostly higher spike rates and shorter response latencies to NSs than to WGN. The most striking finding was that NSs resulted in RFs that had additional uncovered filters compared with WGN. This finding was not an artifact of the higher spike rates observed for NSs relative to WGN, but rather was related to a change in coding. Our results reveal a greater extent of nonlinear processing in V1 neurons when stimulated using NSs compared with WGN. Our findings indicate the existence of nonlinear mechanisms that endow V1 neurons with context-dependent transmission of visual information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study addresses a fundamental question about the concept of the receptive field (RF): does the encoding of information depend on the context or statistical regularities of the stimulus type? We applied state-of-the-art RF modeling techniques to data collected from multielectrode recordings from cat visual cortex in response to two statistically distinct stimulus types: white Gaussian noise and natural scenes. We find significant differences between the RFs that emerge from our data-driven modeling. Natural scenes result in far more complex RFs that combine multiple features in the visual input. Our findings reveal that different regimes or modes of operation are at work in visual cortical processing depending on the information present in the visual input. The complexity of V1 neural coding appears to be dependent on the complexity of the stimulus. We believe this new finding will have interesting implications for our understanding of the efficient transmission of information in sensory systems, which is an integral assumption of many computational theories (e.g., efficient and predictive coding of sensory processing in the brain).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interactions between Brainstem Neurons That Regulate the Motility to the Stomach</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is essential to gastric motility regulation. We and others have previously shown that this activity is greatly influenced by local GABAergic signaling, primarily because of somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic neurons. To further understand the network dynamics associated with gastric motility control in the DVC, we focused on another neuron prominently distributed in this complex, neuropeptide-Y (NPY) neurons. However, the effect of these neurons on gastric motility remains unknown. Here, we investigate the anatomic and functional characteristics of the NPY neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and their interactions with SST neurons using transgenic mice of both sexes. We sought to determine whether NPY neurons influence the activity of gastric-projecting neurons, synaptically interact with SST neurons, and affect end-organ function. Our results using combined neuroanatomy and optogenetic <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> show that NPY neurons are part of the gastric vagal circuit as they are trans-synaptically labeled by a viral tracer from the gastric antrum, are primarily excitatory as optogenetic activation of these neurons evoke EPSCs in gastric-antrum-projecting neurons, are functionally coupled to each other and reciprocally connected to SST neurons, whose stimulation has a potent inhibitory effect on the action potential firing of the NPY neurons, and affect gastric tone and motility as reflected by their robust optogenetic response <I>in vivo.</I> These findings indicate that interacting NPY and SST neurons are integral to the network that controls vagal transmission to the stomach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brainstem neurons in the dorsal nuclear complex are essential for regulating vagus nerve activity that affects the stomach via tone and motility. Two distinct nonoverlapping populations of predominantly excitatory NPY neurons and predominantly inhibitory SST neurons form reciprocal connections with each other in the NTS and with premotor neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus to control gastric mechanics. Light activation and inhibition of NTS NPY neurons increased and decreased gastric motility, respectively, whereas both activation and inhibition of NTS SST neurons enhanced gastric motility</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functional (ir)Relevance of Posterior Parietal Cortex during Audiovisual Change Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a key role in integrating sensory inputs from different modalities to support adaptive behavior. Neuronal activity in PPC reflects perceptual decision-making across behavioral tasks, but the mechanistic involvement of PPC is unclear. In an audiovisual change detection task, we tested the hypothesis that PPC is required to arbitrate between the noisy inputs from the two different modalities and help decide in which modality a sensory change occurred. In trained male mice, we found extensive single-neuron and population-level encoding of task-relevant visual and auditory stimuli, trial history, as well as upcoming behavioral responses. However, despite these rich neural correlates, which would theoretically be sufficient to solve the task, optogenetic inactivation of PPC did not affect visual or auditory performance. Thus, despite neural correlates faithfully tracking sensory variables and predicting behavioral responses, PPC was not relevant for audiovisual change detection. This functional dissociation questions the role of sensory- and task-related activity in parietal associative circuits during audiovisual change detection. Furthermore, our results highlight the necessity to dissociate functional correlates from mechanistic involvement when exploring the neural basis of perception and behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is active during many daily tasks, but capturing its function has remained challenging. Specifically, it is proposed to function as an integration hub for multisensory inputs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, rather than classical cue integration, mouse PPC is involved in the segregation and discrimination of sensory modalities. Surprisingly, although neural activity tracked current and past sensory stimuli and reflected the ongoing decision-making process, optogenetic inactivation did not affect task performance. Thus, we show an apparent redundancy of sensory and task-related activity in mouse PPC. These results narrow down the function of parietal circuits, as well as direct the search for those neural dynamics that causally drive perceptual decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brain System for Social Categorization by Narrative Roles</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cognitive system applies categorical thinking to facilitate perception of the rich environment around us. In person cognition, research has focused on the roles of gender, race, age, or appearance in social categorical thinking. Here we investigated how narrative roles, as portrayed by different cinematic characters, are categorized in the neurocognitive system. Under functional MRI, 17 human participants (7 females) were asked to make different judgments regarding personality traits of 16 renowned cinematic characters representing four roles: hero, sidekick, mentor, and villain. Classification analysis showed a brain network, comprising the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus and the temporoparietal junction bilaterally, and the left occipital face area (OFA), to discriminate among the four roles. No such classification was found between other individual attributes including age or the associated film. Moreover, regions overlapping the default mode network (DMN) were found to better discriminate between roles, rather than the individual characters, while the OFA was found to better discriminate between individuals. These results demonstrate the inherent role of roles in person cognition, and suggest an intimate relation between roles categorization and self-referential activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social categorization, the assignment of different people in our social network to subgroups, is a powerful strategy in social cognition. How is this managed by the brain? We provide evidence that different characters from different stories, representing similar roles in their corresponding narrative, elicit similar brain activation patterns, as revealed by functional MRI. Unlike previous studies of social categorization, these brain activations were similar to those elicited by social cognition rather than face processing, and included regions at the prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the temporoparietal junction. The identified brain network significantly overlapped the default mode network. We suggest that social categorization by roles is fundamental to the cognitive system, relying on brain regions related to social cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Dependent Plasticity in the Temporal Association Cortex Originates from the Primary Auditory Cortex, and Is Modified by the Secondary Auditory Cortex and the Medial Geniculate Body</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain areas that mediate the formation of auditory threat memory and perceptual decisions remain uncertain to date. Candidates include the primary (A1) and secondary (A2) auditory cortex, the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGm), amygdala, and the temporal association cortex. We used chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations with <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> patch-clamp recordings to assess the roles of these brain regions in threat memory learning in female mice. We found that conditioned sound (CS) frequency-dependent plasticity resulted in the formation of auditory threat memory in the temporal association cortex. This neural correlated auditory threat memory depended on CS frequency information from A1 glutamatergic subthreshold monosynaptic inputs, CS lateral inhibition from A2 glutamatergic disynaptic inputs, and non&ndash;frequency-specific facilitation from MGm glutamatergic monosynaptic inputs. These results indicate that the A2 and MGm work together in an inhibitory-facilitative role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:</b> The ability to recognize specific sounds to avoid predators or seek prey is a useful survival tool. Improving this ability through experiential learning is an added advantage requiring neural plasticity. As an example, humans must learn to distinguish the sound of a car horn, and thus avoid oncoming traffic. Our research discovered that the temporal association cortex can encode this kind of auditory information through tonal receptive field plasticity. In addition, the results revealed the underlying synaptic mechanisms of this process. These results extended our understanding of how meaningful auditory information is processed in an animal's brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Animal-to-Animal Variability in Partial Hippocampal Remapping in Repeated Environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal place cells form a map of the environment of an animal. Changes in the hippocampal map can be brought about in a number of ways, including changes to the environment, task, internal state of the subject, and the passage of time. These changes in the hippocampal map have been called remapping. In this study, we examine remapping during repeated exposure to the same environment. Different animals can have different remapping responses to the same changes. This variability across animals in remapping behavior is not well understood. In this work, we analyzed electrophysiological recordings from the CA3 region of the hippocampus performed by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B1">Alme et al. (2014)</cross-ref>, in which five male rats were exposed to 11 different environments, including a variety of repetitions of those environments. To compare the hippocampal maps between two experiences, we computed average rate map correlation coefficients. We found changes in the hippocampal maps between different sessions in the same environment. These changes consisted of partial remapping, a form of remapping in which some place cells maintain their place fields, whereas other place cells remap their place fields. Each animal exhibited partial remapping differently. We discovered that the heterogeneity in hippocampal representational changes across animals is structured; individual animals had consistently different levels of partial remapping across a range of independent comparisons. Our findings highlight that partial hippocampal remapping between repeated environments depends on animal-specific factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Context identification is a difficult problem. Animals are not provided with objective context identity labels, so they must infer which experiences come from which contexts. Different animals may have different strategies for performing this inference. We find that different animals have stereotypically different extents of partial hippocampal remapping, a neural correlate of subjective assessment of context identity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Blocking Mitochondrial Zn2+ Accumulation after Ischemia Reduces Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Neuronal Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Zn<sup>2+</sup> is an important contributor to ischemic brain injury, and recent studies support the hypothesis that mitochondria are key sites of its injurious effects. In murine hippocampal slices (both sexes) subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), we found that Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and its entry into mitochondria precedes and contributes to the induction of acute neuronal death. In addition, if the ischemic episode is short (and sublethal), there is ongoing Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in CA1 mitochondria after OGD that may contribute to their delayed dysfunction. Using this slice model of sublethal OGD, we have examined Zn<sup>2+</sup> contributions to the progression of changes evoked by OGD and occurring over 4-5 h. We detected progressive mitochondrial depolarization occurring from ~2 h after ischemia, a large increase in spontaneous synaptic activity between 2 and 3 h, and mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation at 4 h. Blockade of the primary route for Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (with ruthenium red [RR]) or Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation shortly after OGD withdrawal substantially attenuated the mitochondrial depolarization and the changes in synaptic activity. RR also largely reversed the mitochondrial swelling. Finally, using an <I>in vivo</I> rat (male) asphyxial cardiac arrest model of transient global ischemia, we found that ~8 min asphyxia induces considerable injury of CA1 neurons 4 h later that is associated with strong Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within many damaged mitochondria. These effects were substantially attenuated by infusion of RR on reperfusion. Our findings highlight mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation after ischemia as a possible target for neuroprotective therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain ischemia is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability that still lacks effective treatment. After transient ischemia, delayed death of neurons occurs in vulnerable brain regions. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms of this delayed neurodegeneration which can be targeted for neuroprotection. We found progressive and long-lasting mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation to occur in highly vulnerable CA1 neurons after ischemia. Here we demonstrate that this Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation contributes strongly to deleterious events occurring after ischemia, including mitochondrial dysfunction, swelling, and structural changes. We suggest that this mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry may constitute a promising target for development of therapeutic interventions to be delivered after termination of an episode of transient global ischemia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discovering molecular features of intrinsically disordered regions by using evolution for contrastive learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex X. Lu, Amy X. Lu, Iva Pritišanac, Taraneh Zarin, Julie D. Forman-Kay, Alan M. Moses</p>

A major challenge to the characterization of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are widespread in the proteome, but relatively poorly understood, is the identification of molecular features that mediate functions of these regions, such as short motifs, amino acid repeats and physicochemical properties. Here, we introduce a proteome-scale feature discovery approach for IDRs. Our approach, which we call “reverse homology”, exploits the principle that important functional features are conserved over evolution. We use this as a contrastive learning signal for deep learning: given a set of homologous IDRs, the neural network has to correctly choose a held-out homolog from another set of IDRs sampled randomly from the proteome. We pair reverse homology with a simple architecture and standard interpretation techniques, and show that the network learns conserved features of IDRs that can be interpreted as motifs, repeats, or bulk features like charge or amino acid propensities. We also show that our model can be used to produce visualizations of what residues and regions are most important to IDR function, generating hypotheses for uncharacterized IDRs. Our results suggest that feature discovery using unsupervised neural networks is a promising avenue to gain systematic insight into poorly understood protein sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The origin of RNA interference: Adaptive or neutral evolution?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alessandro Torri, Johannes Jaeger, Thomas Pradeu, Maria-Carla Saleh</p>

The origin of RNA interference (RNAi) is usually explained by a defense-based hypothesis, in which RNAi evolved as a defense against transposable elements (TEs) and RNA viruses and was already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). However, since RNA antisense regulation and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are ancient and widespread phenomena, the origin of defensive RNAi should have occurred in parallel with its regulative functions to avoid imbalances in gene regulation. Thus, we propose a neutral evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of RNAi in which qualitative system drift from a prokaryotic antisense RNA (asRNA) gene regulation mechanism leads to the formation of RNAi through constructive neutral evolution (CNE). We argue that RNAi was already present in the ancestor of LECA before the need for a new defense system arose and that its presence helped to shape eukaryotic genomic architecture and stability.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in <i>C9orf72</i>. An important neuropathological hallmark associated with this mutation is the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of TAR (trans-activation response element) DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43). Glia plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration observed in <i>C9orf72</i>-associated disorders. However, less is known about the role of oligodendrocytes (OLs). Here, we applied digital neuropathological methods to compare the expression pattern of glial cells in the frontal cortex (FrCx) of human post-mortem samples from patients with C9-FTLD and C9-FTLD/ALS, sporadic FTLD (sFTLD), and healthy controls (HCs). We also compared MBP levels in CSF from an independent clinical FTD cohort. We observed an increase in GFAP, and Iba1 immunoreactivity in C9 and sFTLD compared to controls in the gray matter (GM) of the FrCx. We observed a decrease in MBP immunoreactivity in the GM and white matter (WM) of the FrCx of C9, compared to HC and sFTLD. There was a negative correlation between MBP and pTDP-43 in C9 in the WM of the FrCx. We observed an increase in CSF MBP concentrations in C9 and sFTLD compared to HC. In conclusion, the C9 expansion is associated with myelin loss in the frontal cortex. This loss of MBP may be a result of oligodendroglial dysfunction due to the expansion or the presence of pTDP-43 in OLs. Understanding these biological processes will help to identify specific pathways associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> expansion.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The spinal cord of the tree pangolin is known to be very short compared to the overall length of the body and tail. Here, we provide a description of the tree pangolin spinal cord to determine whether the short length contributes to specific structural, and potentially functional, differences. The short spinal cord of the adult tree pangolin, at around 13 cm, terminates at the midthoracic level. Within this shortened spinal cord, we could identify six regions, which from rostral to caudal include the prebrachial, brachial, interramal, crural, postcrural, and caudal regions, with both the brachial and crural regions showing distinct swellings. The chemoarchitecture of coronal sections through these regions confirmed regional assignation, being most readily delineated by the presence of cholinergic neurons forming the intermediolateral column in the interramal region and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus in the postcrural region. The 10 laminae of Rexed were observed throughout the spinal cord and presented with an anatomical organization similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the shortened length of the tree pangolin spinal cord, the regional and laminar anatomical organization is very similar to that observed in other mammals. This indicates that the functional aspects of the short tree pangolin spinal cord can be inferred from what is known in other mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mechanistic contribution of CaV3.2 calcium channels to trigeminal neuralgia pathophysiology not clarified [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare, yet debilitating trigeminal pain disorder, with jolts of supramaximal-debilitating pain in one or more of the three trigeminal branches. Familial TN is now recognized, with a recent report describing several human genetic polymorphisms. One affected gene is the voltage-gated calcium channel, CaV3.2 (CACNA1H), with 19 polymorphisms first described. A recent study in PAIN by Gambeta-et-al (DOI:10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002651) is entitled "CaV3.2 calcium channels contribute to trigeminal neuralgia ". Here, I call into question their claim. My main arguments are 1)-3):  1) Gambeta-et-al studied 4/19 mutations reported in heterologous cellular expression, with two mutations showing gain-of-function of CaV3.2, two mutations not showing gain-of-function. Therefore the exemplary picks of familial TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations do not show a uniform change of channel function, such as gain-of-function.  2) In Gambeta-et-al, one gain-of-function mutation, CaV3.2(G563R) was directed to mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, and their resulting hyperexcitability was demonstrated. A critical control of a non-gain-of-function channel was not included here, it was unclear whether neurons were separated by sex, and human sensory neurons were not used. Importantly, it is not clear that TG  neurons are the critical cellular site of CaV3.2 mutations. 3) Gambeta-et-al used CaV3.2-/- pan-null knockout mice. Human TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations were not over-expressed. They used a infraorbital nerve constriction injury and measured facial heat hyperalgesia.  CaV3.2-/- show a pain phenotype similar to control, yet are not affected by a CaV3-inhibitory compound, Z944. My argument is that when starting with TN-associated human mutations, use of a trigeminal neuropathic pain model is of limited value, and that human mutations have to be expressed against a mouse null background. Re thermal cue, Gambeta-et-al failed to study cold-evoked pain which is a TN clinical hallmark. Thus, Gambeta-et-al's 2022 PAIN-paper offers little new mechanistic evidence why CaV3.2 polymorphisms are associated with trigeminal neuralgia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of a peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Frequent positional changes and movements during labour is one of the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent prolonged labour, thereby avoiding cesarean sections. However, labour induction, continuous fetal monitoring in supine position and immobilising the women during labour are standard practices in most private hospitals. To combat these problems and to implement WHO recommendations, the peanut ball is an effective device through which frequent positional changes will be achieved without disrupting the labour procedures. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes and assess the stress response induced by labour in terms of maternal and neonatal cortisol in low-risk primigravid women. The study is a prospective, block randomised controlled trial with parallel arms. A total of 768 study participants will be randomised to the peanut-ball group (intervention) and standard care group (control). The intervention group will receive different peanut ball positions during labour at or after 4 cm of cervical dilatation. The primary outcomes of the study are maternal outcome that includes measurement of duration of the active and the second stage of labour, stress level as measured by serum cortisol level at 3–4 cm and at 10 cm of cervical dilatation, mode of delivery, perception of pain, behavioural response during the active stage of labour and neonatal outcomes, which includes the pattern of fetal heart rate, APGAR score, birth injuries, and umbilical serum and salivary cortisol level. The collected data will be compared between the intervention and control groups.  Trial Registration: This research is registered under the CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry of India) (CTRI/2019/08/020802) (21/8/2019).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation top-down techniques based on brain stimulation present variable outcomes in unilateral spatial neglect (USN) after stroke. This study aimed to examine the effects of physical therapy after anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS and C-tDCS, respectively) to improve visuospatial and functional impairments in individuals with USN after stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This double-blinded, pilot randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with USN after ischemic stroke. Randomization was stratified according to the Behavior Inattention Test–Conventional (BIT-C) and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Outpatient physical therapy was conducted for 7.5 weeks after 20 minutes of tDCS. The primary outcome was the USN degree evaluated by the BIT-C. Secondary outcomes were the difference in CBS score, stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), disability (modified Rankin Scale), autonomy (Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure), and quality of life (EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire). Outcomes were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model corrected by age, baseline NIHSS, and baseline BIT-C. Pairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using Bonferroni correction.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the primary outcomes, A-tDCS led to greater improvement in BIT-C after intervention (mean difference [MD] = 18.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9–32.8, <i>p</i> = 0.008) compared to sham. However, no significant differences were observed between A-tDCS and C-tDCS (MD = 13.9, 95% CI = −0.3 to 28.1, <i>p</i> = 0.057), or C-tDCS and sham (MD = 4.5, 95% CI = −9.7 to 18.8, <i>p</i> = 0.99). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of secondary outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A-tDCS associated with physical therapy can decrease the severity of USN after stroke. However, these preliminary findings must be confirmed by collecting additional evidence in a larger phase 3 trial. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Magnetoencephalography with optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG): the next generation of functional neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures human brain function via assessment of the magnetic fields generated by electrical activity in neurons. Despite providing high-quality spatiotemporal maps of electrophysiological activity, current MEG instrumentation is limited by cumbersome field sensing technologies, resulting in major barriers to utility. Here, we review a new generation of MEG technology that is beginning to lift many of these barriers. By exploiting quantum sensors, known as optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), ‘OPM-MEG’ has the potential to dramatically outperform the current state of the art, promising enhanced data quality (better sensitivity and spatial resolution), adaptability to any head size/shape (from babies to adults), motion robustness (participants can move freely during scanning), and a less complex imaging platform (without reliance on cryogenics).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current">BIGDML—Towards accurate quantum machine learning force fields for materials</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 29 June 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31093-x">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31093-x</a></p>Most machine-learning force fields dismiss long-range interactions. Here the authors demonstrate the BIGDML approach for building materials’ potential energy surfaces that enables a broad range of materials simulations within accuracies better than 1 meV/atom using just 10–200 structures for training.
