              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04139">Psychophysics assessment of anomalous contrast</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of image encoding mechanisms of the retina is made possible by the high precision control of timing and intensity of LED displays. One can provide stimulus flicker that reveals differential activation of ON and OFF retinal channels at frequencies above the flicker-fusion threshold. The light energy provided to ON and OFF channels can be balanced, such that a flickering letter will vanish into the background. Yet if the luminance balance has been produced using ultra-brief flashes, an "anomalous contrast" is produced that provides the letter with visibility. The present work contributes additional details about the conditions that will produce anomalous contrast, and discusses how the retinal circuitry can provide this visibility.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04427">Role of connectivity anisotropies in the dynamics of cultured neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory-grown, engineered living neuronal networks in vitro have emerged in the last years as an experimental technique to understand the collective behavior of neuronal assemblies in relation to their underlying connectivity. An inherent obstacle in the design of such engineered systems is the difficulty to predict the dynamic repertoire of the emerging network and its dependence on experimental variables. To fill this gap, and inspired on recent experimental studies, here we present a numerical model that aims at, first, replicating the anisotropies in connectivity imprinted through engineering, to next realize the collective behavior of the neuronal network and make predictions. We use experimentally measured, biologically-realistic data combined with the Izhikevich model to quantify the dynamics of the neuronal network in relation to tunable structural and dynamical parameters. These parameters include the synaptic noise, strength of the imprinted anisotropies, and average axon lengths. The latter are involved in the simulation of the development of neurons in vitro. We show that the model captures the behavior of engineered neuronal cultures, in which a rich repertoire of activity patterns emerge but whose details are strongly dependent on connectivity details and noise. Results also show that the presence of connectivity anisotropies substantially improves the capacity of reconstructing structural connectivity from activity data, an aspect that is important in the quest for understanding the structure-to-function relationship in neuronal networks. Our work provides the in silico basis to assist experimentalists in the design of laboratory in vitro networks and anticipate their outcome, an aspect that is particularly important in the effort to conceive reliable brain-on-a-chip circuits and explore key aspects such as input-output relationships or information coding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04037">Fluctuation induced intermittent transitions between distinct rhythms in balanced excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittent transitions, associated with critical dynamics and characterized by power-law distributions, are commonly observed during sleep. These critical behaviors are evident at the microscopic level through neuronal avalanches and at the macroscopic level through transitions between sleep stages. To clarify these empirical observations, models grounded in statistical physics have been proposed. At the mesoscopic level of cortical activity, critical behavior is indicated by the intermittent transitions between various cortical rhythms. For instance, empirical investigations utilizing EEG data from rats have identified intermittent transitions between $\delta$ and $\theta$ rhythms, with the duration of $\theta$ rhythm exhibiting a power-law distribution. However, a dynamic model to account for this phenomenon is currently absent. In this study, we introduce a network of sparsely coupled excitatory and inhibitory populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons to demonstrate that intermittent transitions can emerge from the intrinsic fluctuations of a finite-sized system, particularly when the system is positioned near a Hopf bifurcation point, which is a critical point. The resulting power-law distributions and exponents are consistent with empirical observations. Additionally, we illustrate how modifications in network connectivity can affect the power-law exponent by influencing the attractivity and oscillation frequency of the stable limit cycle. Our findings, interpreted through the fundamental dynamics of neuronal networks, provide a plausible mechanism for the generation of intermittent transitions between cortical rhythms, in alignment with the power-law distributions documented in empirical researches.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07150">Adaptive behavior with stable synapses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.07150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral changes in animals and humans, as a consequence of an error or a verbal instruction, can be extremely rapid. Improvement in behavioral performances are usually associated in machine learning and reinforcement learning to synaptic plasticity, and, in general, to changes and optimization of network parameters. However, such rapid changes are not coherent with the timescales of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for that could be a dynamical network reconfiguration. In the last few years, similar capabilities have been observed in transformers, foundational architecture in the field of machine learning that are widely used in applications such as natural language and image processing. Transformers are capable of in-context learning, the ability to adapt and acquire new information dynamically within the context of the task or environment they are currently engaged in, without the need for significant changes to their underlying parameters. Building upon the notion of something unique within transformers enabling the emergence of this property, we claim that it could also be supported by input segregation and dendritic amplification, features extensively observed in biological networks. We propose an architecture composed of gain-modulated recurrent networks that excels at in-context learning, showing abilities inaccessible to standard networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12188">Structure of activity in multiregion recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.12188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural circuits comprise multiple interconnected regions, each with complex dynamics. The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity -- roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04007">Untapped Potential in Self-Optimization of Hopfield Networks: The Creativity of Unsupervised Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Self-Optimization (SO) model can be considered as the third operational mode of the classical Hopfield Network (HN), leveraging the power of associative memory to enhance optimization performance. Moreover, is has been argued to express characteristics of minimal agency which, together with its biological plausibility, renders it useful for the study of artificial life. In this article, we draw attention to another facet of the SO model: its capacity for creativity. Drawing on the creativity studies literature, we argue that the model satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of a creative process. Moreover, we explore the dependency of different creative outcomes based on learning parameters, specifically the learning and reset rates. We conclude that the SO model allows for simulating and understanding the emergence of creative behaviors in artificial systems that learn.

                arXiv:2501.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning systems excel in complex tasks but often lack transparency, limiting their use in critical applications. Counterfactual explanations, a core tool within eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), offer insights into model decisions by identifying minimal changes to an input to alter its predicted outcome. However, existing methods for time series data are limited by univariate assumptions, rigid constraints on modifications, or lack of validity guarantees. This paper introduces Multi-SpaCE, a multi-objective counterfactual explanation method for multivariate time series. Using non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-SpaCE balances proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and contiguity. Unlike most methods, it ensures perfect validity, supports multivariate data and provides a Pareto front of solutions, enabling flexibility to different end-user needs. Comprehensive experiments in diverse datasets demonstrate the ability of Multi-SpaCE to consistently achieve perfect validity and deliver superior performance compared to existing methods.

                arXiv:2501.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examined the viability of enhancing the prediction accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in image classification tasks by developing ANNs with evolution patterns similar to those of biological neural networks. ResNet is a widely used family of neural networks with both deep and wide variants; therefore, it was selected as the base model for our investigation. The aim of this study is to improve the image classification performance of ANNs via a novel approach inspired by the biological nervous system architecture of planarians, which comprises a brain and two nerve cords. We believe that the unique neural architecture of planarians offers valuable insights into the performance enhancement of ANNs. The proposed planarian neural architecture-based neural network was evaluated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed method exhibits higher prediction accuracy than the baseline neural network models in image classification tasks. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of biologically inspired neural network architectures in improving the performance of ANNs in a wide range of applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04040">A Survey on Large Language Models with some Insights on their Capabilities and Limitations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the transformer architecture, has redefined the capabilities of natural language processing. These models now exhibit remarkable performance across various language-related tasks, such as text generation, question answering, translation, and summarization, often rivaling human-like comprehension. More intriguingly, LLMs have demonstrated emergent abilities extending beyond their core functions, showing proficiency in tasks like commonsense reasoning, code generation, and arithmetic. This survey paper explores the foundational components, scaling mechanisms, and architectural strategies that drive these capabilities. Emphasizing models like GPT and LLaMA, we analyze the impact of exponential data and computational growth on LLM performance, while also addressing the trade-offs associated with scaling. We also examine LLM applications across sectors, such as healthcare, finance, education, and law, highlighting their adaptability and potential to solve domain-specific challenges. Central to this work are the questions of how LLMs generalize across diverse tasks, exhibit planning, and reasoning abilities, and whether these emergent abilities can be systematically elicited or enhanced. In particular, we provide some insights into the CoT (Chain of Thought) and PoT (Plan of Thought) abilities within LLMs, focusing on how pre-training data influences their emergence. Additionally, we investigate LLM-modulo frameworks that integrate external systems, allowing LLMs to handle complex, dynamic tasks. By analyzing these factors, this paper aims to foster the ongoing discussion on the capabilities and limits of LLMs, promoting their responsible development and application in novel and increasingly complex environments.

                arXiv:2402.13809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI enables fine-grained retrieval of brain activity. However, the accurate reconstruction of diverse details, including structure, background, texture, color, and more, remains challenging. The stable diffusion models inevitably result in the variability of reconstructed images, even under identical conditions. To address this challenge, we first uncover the neuroscientific perspective of diffusion methods, which primarily involve top-down creation using pre-trained knowledge from extensive image datasets, but tend to lack detail-driven bottom-up perception, leading to a loss of faithful details. In this paper, we propose NeuralDiffuser, which incorporates primary visual feature guidance to provide detailed cues in the form of gradients. This extension of the bottom-up process for diffusion models achieves both semantic coherence and detail fidelity when reconstructing visual stimuli. Furthermore, we have developed a novel guidance strategy for reconstruction tasks that ensures the consistency of repeated outputs with original images rather than with various outputs. Extensive experimental results on the Natural Senses Dataset (NSD) qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the advancement of NeuralDiffuser by comparing it against baseline and state-of-the-art methods horizontally, as well as conducting longitudinal ablation studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02906">Domain-Agnostic Co-Evolution of Generalizable Parallel Algorithm Portfolios</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.02906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization is the core objective when training optimizers from data. However, limited training instances often constrain the generalization capability of the trained optimizers. Co-evolutionary approaches address this challenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and an instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet, when applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major limitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially tailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work proposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named domain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key innovation of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance representation and generation mechanism that delimitates the need for domain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated across three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary influence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization problem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small set of training instances from these classes, DACE, without requiring any domain knowledge, constructs PAPs with better generalization performance than existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of domain-specific instance generators.

                arXiv:2311.15963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates video game identification through single screenshots, utilizing ten convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet152, MobileNet, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, EfficientNetB3, and EfficientNetV2S) and three transformers architectures (ViT-B16, ViT-L32, and SwinT) across 22 home console systems, spanning from Atari 2600 to PlayStation 5, totalling 8,796 games and 170,881 screenshots. Except for VGG16, all CNNs outperformed the transformers in this task. Using ImageNet pre-trained weights as initial weights, EfficientNetV2S achieves the highest average accuracy (77.44%) and the highest accuracy in 16 of the 22 systems. DenseNet201 is the best in four systems and EfficientNetB3 is the best in the remaining two systems. Employing alternative initial weights fine-tuned in an arcade screenshots dataset boosts accuracy for EfficientNet architectures, with the EfficientNetV2S reaching a peak accuracy of 77.63% and demonstrating reduced convergence epochs from 26.9 to 24.5 on average. Overall, the combination of optimal architecture and weights attains 78.79% accuracy, primarily led by EfficientNetV2S in 15 systems. These findings underscore the efficacy of CNNs in video game identification through screenshots.

                arXiv:2412.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. The framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal Darwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs through dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%. We further discuss implications for control (e.g. legislation) and Digico as a means of studying evolutionary principles.

	<p>Background/Objectives: A neurobiological framework of bi- or multilingual neurocognitive development must consider the following: (i) longitudinal behavioral and neural measures; (ii) brain developmental constraints across structure and function; and (iii) the development of global multilingual competence in a homogeneous social environment. In this study, we investigated whether multilingual competence yields early changes in executive attention control mechanisms and their underlying neural structures in the frontal&amp;amp;ndash;striatal system, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplemental area and the left caudate. Methods: We employed longitudinal neuroimaging and functional connectivity methods in a small group of multilingual children over two years. Results: We found that the dACC/preSMA is functionally influenced by changes in multilingual competence but not yet structurally adapted, while the left caudate, in a developmental stage, is influenced, adapts, and specializes due to multilingual experience. Furthermore, increases in multilingual competence strengthen connections between the dACC/preSMA, left caudate, and other structures of the cognitive control network, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. Conclusions: These findings suggest that multilingual competence impacts brain &amp;amp;ldquo;adaptation&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;specialization&amp;amp;rdquo; during childhood. The results may provide insights and guide future research on experience-expectant and experience-dependent brain plasticity to explain the &amp;amp;ldquo;interaction&amp;amp;rdquo; between multilingualism and neurodevelopment.</p>

                <p>Status epilepticus (SE) links to high mortality and morbidity. Considering the neuroprotective property of baicalein (BA), we investigated its effects on post-SE neuronal injury via the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. Mice were subjected to SE modeling and BA interference, with seizure severity and learning and memory abilities evaluated. The histological changes, neurological injury and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-positive cell number in hippocampal CA1 region, and cell death were assessed. Levels of the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)/gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pathway-related proteins, inflammatory factors, and Iba-1 + NLRP3+ and Iba-1 + GSDMD-N+ cells were determined. BA ameliorated post-SE cognitive dysfunction and neuronal injury in mice, as evidenced by shortened escape latency, increased number of crossing the target quadrant within 60&nbsp;s and the time staying in the target quadrant, alleviated hippocampal damage, increased viable cell number, decreased neuronal injury, and increased NSE-positive cells. Mechanistically, BA repressed microglial pyroptosis, reduced inflammatory factor release, and attenuated neuronal injury by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. The NLRP3 inhibitor exerted similar effects as BA on SE mice, while the NLRP3 activator partially reversed BA-improved post-SE neuronal injury in mice. Conjointly, BA reduced microglial pyroptosis in hippocampal CA1 area by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway, thereby ameliorating post-SE neuronal injury in mice.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A major obstacle in understanding the relationship between diet and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) lies in the subjectivity and the bias in traditional dietary intake assessment methods. Food diaries, 24-hour food recall interviews, and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) result in under- and over-reporting of nutrient and energy intake, compromising the accuracy of studies linking diet to NCDs. The emergence of image classification technology has facilitated a new approach to dietary intake assessment which addresses the subjective limitations associated with traditional self-reporting methods. Furthermore, a need to integrate multi-omics and advanced health analyses to comprehensively characterise NCD risk presents an opportunity to combine a range of technologies to better understand diet-induced NCD. Method This observational study will adopt an enhanced surveillance method, whereby we will utilise wearable cameras and activity monitors to record dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep. Participants will wear these for 3 separate one-week periods at home (with a 2 and 3-week break in between each period). At the end of each monitoring period, participants will attend a study visit at the clinical research facility, where they will undergo body composition assessments, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and autonomic nervous system health analysis using state-of-the-art technologies that measure Advanced Glycation End products (AGE) and accelerated photoplethysmography (APG). At the end of the first and last monitoring period, participants will also provide blood, urine, stool, and breath samples, and an in-depth interview will also be conducted during the final visit to assess participants’ perceptions towards the novel technologies. The study parameters will be integrated to advance our insights into how diet intricately influences the mechanisms underlying NCDs.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Additionally, advancements in long-read RNA sequencing are expected to drive the evolution of differential splicing tools, reducing the need for isoform deconvolution and prompting further innovation.

                <p>by José María Salazar Campos, Lena F. Burbulla, Sarah Jäkel</p>

The major pathological feature of Parkinson ‘s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease and most common movement disorder, is the predominant degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the midbrain. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms of the origin of the disease remain unknown. While the disease was initially viewed as a purely neuronal disorder, results from single-cell transcriptomics have suggested that oligodendrocytes may play an important role in the early stages of Parkinson’s. Although these findings are of high relevance, particularly to the search for effective disease-modifying therapies, the actual functional role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson’s disease remains highly speculative and requires a concerted scientific effort to be better understood. This Unsolved Mystery discusses the limited understanding of oligodendrocytes in PD, highlighting unresolved questions regarding functional changes in oligodendroglia, the role of myelin in nigral dopaminergic neurons, the impact of the toxic environment, and the aggregation of alpha-synuclein within oligodendrocytes.

                <p>by Jeff Maltas, Anh Huynh, Kevin B. Wood</p>

As failure rates for traditional antimicrobial therapies escalate, recent focus has shifted to evolution-based therapies to slow resistance. Collateral sensitivity—the increased susceptibility to one drug associated with evolved resistance to a different drug—offers a potentially exploitable evolutionary constraint, but the manner in which collateral effects emerge over time is not well understood. Here, we use laboratory evolution in the opportunistic pathogen <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> to phenotypically characterize collateral profiles through evolutionary time. Specifically, we measure collateral profiles for 400 strain-antibiotic combinations over the course of 4 evolutionary time points as strains are selected in increasing concentrations of antibiotic. We find that at a global level—when results from all drugs are combined—collateral resistance dominates during early phases of adaptation, when resistance to the selecting drug is lower, while collateral sensitivity becomes increasingly likely with further selection. At the level of individual populations; however, the trends are idiosyncratic; for example, the frequency of collateral sensitivity to ceftriaxone increases over time in isolates selected by linezolid but decreases in isolates selected by ciprofloxacin. We then show experimentally how dynamic collateral sensitivity relationships can lead to time-dependent dosing windows that depend on finely timed switching between drugs. Finally, we develop a stochastic mathematical model based on a Markov decision process consistent with observed dynamic collateral profiles to show measurements across time are required to optimally constrain antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947">Cortical direction selectivity increases from the input to the output layers of visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weifeng Dai, Tian Wang, Yang Li, Yi Yang, Yange Zhang, Yujie Wu, Tingting Zhou, Hongbo Yu, Liang Li, Yizheng Wang, Gang Wang, Dajun Xing</p>

Sensitivity to motion direction is a feature of visual neurons that is essential for motion perception. Recent studies have suggested that direction selectivity is re-established at multiple stages throughout the visual hierarchy, which contradicts the traditional assumption that direction selectivity in later stages largely derives from that in earlier stages. By recording laminar responses in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats of both sexes, we aimed to understand how direction selectivity is processed and relayed across 2 successive stages: the input layers and the output layers within the early visual cortices. We found a strong relationship between the strength of direction selectivity in the output layers and the input layers, as well as the preservation of preferred directions across the input and output layers. Moreover, direction selectivity was enhanced in the output layers compared to the input layers, with the response strength maintained in the preferred direction but reduced in other directions and under blank stimuli. We identified a direction-tuned gain mechanism for interlaminar signal transmission, which likely originated from both feedforward connections across the input and output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers. This direction-tuned gain, coupled with nonlinearity, contributed to the enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. Our findings suggest that direction selectivity in later cortical stages partially inherits characteristics from earlier cortical stages and is further refined by intracortical connections.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Interneurons (INs) play a crucial role in the regulation of neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region critically involved in executive functions and behavioral control. In recent preclinical studies, dysregulation of INs in the mPFC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of substance use disorder, characterized by vulnerability to chronic drug use. Here, we explore the diversity of mPFC INs and their connectivity and roles in vulnerability to addiction. We also discuss how these INs change over time with drug exposure. Finally, we focus on noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic approach for targeting INs in substance use disorder, highlighting its potential to restore neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-46/v1?src=rss">Fluimucil as a neuroprotective, is there anything new? Bibliometric study from 1996 to 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fluimucil, also known as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been used as a medicinal drug for treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Recent research has shown NAC’s potential as a neuroprotective agent, preventing oxidative damage and promoting neurodegenerative treatment. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of articles related to NAC use, identifying research trends, current trends, and correlations between research and institutions. The findings can help identify unpublished research and guide future research strategies. This research not only provides public interest in NAC research but also offers valuable insights for future research. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords fluimucil, nac, n-acetylcystein, and neuroprotective. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Documents by Author, Documents by Affiliations, Documents by country or territory, Documents by funding sponsor, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Subject Area, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, and Qualitative Analysis. Conclusions Research on the neuroprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or fluimucil has several limitations and strengths. It uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify research trends and mechanisms of NAC action. However, the data may be biased and the methodology may differ. The study has significant potential for future research, particularly in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson and Alzheimer. It also contributes to the understanding of NAC mechanisms.

                Background Cervical spondylosis is the common degenerative disease of the vertebrae in adults which can lead to change in sagittal alignment of cervical spine. Radiograph and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used imaging modalities for measuring the sagittal parameters. However sagittal parameters measured using radiograph and MRI can be influence by patient positioning and imaging technique. The study aims to compare sagittal parameters measured using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and radiograph in cervical spondylosis patients. Methods The study was done retrospectively. 77 patients who underwent both MRI and radiograph were included in the study. The sagittal parameters such as Neck Tilt (NT), T1 slope (T1S), thoracic inlet angle (TIA), C2-C7 angle (C2-C7A) and C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2-C7 SVA) were measured on sagittal MRI and lateral cervical spine radiograph. Paired t-test was used to compare cervical sagittal measurements between MRI and radiography. Results The cervical sagittal parameters such as NT, T1S, TIA and C2-7 SVA showed significant difference between MRI and radiograph (p < 0.05). But C2-C7A did not show significant difference (p > 0.05) Conclusion The study concludes that MRI cannot be used as an alternative to cervical spine radiograph in spondylosis patient for measuring the sagittal balance as there was significant difference between sagittal parameters except C2-C7 A.

                The role of posture in spinal pain is unclear which might be linked to characteristics of postural outcome measures. This systematic scoping review mapped the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for spinal pain. Following Joanna Briggs Institute framework, twelve bibliographic databases were searched until 8th August 2023. Article selection, characterisation/mapping and synthesis using qualitative content analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Tools being underpinned by the biopsychosocial model of pain, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model.

                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.

                Background It is uncommon to develop vision-threatening orbital cellulitis with panophthalmitis during pregnancy. Typically, the reasons are trauma-related or endogenous. It requires immediate diagnosis and treatment, but this has proven difficult because of local and systemic medications’ safety and adverse effects during pregnancy. Globe salvage has a poor prognosis, with most patients undergoing enucleation or evisceration of the diseased eye. Case presentation We presented a 22-year-old woman in her third trimester of pregnancy who encountered orbital cellulitis with panophthalmitis caused by methicillin-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Despite rigorous intravenous and topical antibiotics, she underwent evisceration of the affected eye. However, the pregnancy, progressed without incident, with the delivery of a healthy baby at full-term. Conclusion Bacterial infection is uncommon during pregnancy, but may cause endogenous panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis, especially in immunosuppression and anemia, with a poor visual outcome.

                Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited countries relies primarily on bacteriological confirmation using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain on sputum or other representative samples. However, this method has low sensitivity due to suboptimal sampling and techniques. While AFB culture remains a gold standard for diagnosing TB and other mycobacterial infections, its limitations include slow turnaround time, and the requirement for specialized resources and expertise. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are crucial in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation and immune reactions. We investigated the usefulness of the haematological parameters and their ratios, like the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR), for diagnosing tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively grouped 114 patients with fever into those diagnosed with TB and control groups. We obtained their haematological data and calculated their derived ratios. The ratios obtained from the two groups were compared. Their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Haematological parameters like MLR were higher in TB patients than in the control group. Although NLR was not significantly increased, MLR was significantly increased with p values <0.05. These tests had low sensitivity but high specificity. Conclusion Serum NLR and MLR emerge as valuable tools in TB diagnosis. Their simplicity and cost-effectiveness render them particularly suitable for screening and recurrence monitoring in rural and remote settings, thereby mitigating loss to follow-up.

                Aging is inevitable. While healthy aging is the goal, old age is frequently accompanied by disheartening effects on physical function, cognition, and overall well-being. Additionally, while the causes of disease are multifactorial and dizzyingly complex, they tend to converge on a single, common, major risk factor: old age. As such, targeting aging itself (as opposed to only targeting disease pathophysiology once it emerges) should help delay the onset and progression of many disease states, including neurodegenerative diseases.

                Calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2) and CIB3 bind to transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) and TMC2, the pore-forming subunits of the inner-ear mechano-electrical transduction (MET) apparatus. These interactions have been proposed to be functionally relevant across mechanosensory organs and vertebrate species. Here, we show that both CIB2 and CIB3 can form heteromeric complexes with TMC1 and TMC2 and are integral for MET function in mouse cochlea and vestibular end organs as well as in zebrafish inner ear and lateral line. Our AlphaFold 2 models suggest that vertebrate CIB proteins can simultaneously interact with at least two cytoplasmic domains of TMC1 and TMC2 as validated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of TMC1 fragments interacting with CIB2 and CIB3. Molecular dynamics simulations of TMC1/2 complexes with CIB2/3 predict that TMCs are structurally stabilized by CIB proteins to form cation channels. Overall, our work demonstrates that intact CIB2/3 and TMC1/2 complexes are integral to hair-cell MET function in vertebrate mechanosensory epithelia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98661">Interneuron FGF13 regulates seizure susceptibility via a sodium channel-independent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a class of devastating neurological disorders characterized by recurrent seizures and exacerbated by disruptions to excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, are commonly caused by mutations in ion channels. Disruption of, or variants in, <i>FGF13</i> were implicated as causal for a set of DEEs, but the underlying mechanisms were clouded because <i>FGF13</i> is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, <i>FGF13</i> undergoes extensive alternative splicing producing multiple isoforms with distinct functions, and the overall roles of FGF13 in neurons are incompletely cataloged. To overcome these challenges, we generated a set of novel cell-type-specific conditional knockout mice. Interneuron-targeted deletion of <i>Fgf13</i> led to perinatal mortality associated with extensive seizures and impaired the hippocampal inhibitory/excitatory balance while excitatory neuron-targeted deletion of <i>Fgf13</i> caused no detectable seizures and no survival deficits. While best studied as a voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>) regulator, we observed no effect of <i>Fgf13</i> ablation in interneurons on Na<sub>v</sub>s but rather a marked reduction in K<sup>+</sup> channel currents. Re-expressing different <i>Fgf13</i> splice isoforms could partially rescue deficits in interneuron excitability and restore K<sup>+</sup> channel current amplitude. These results enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of <i>Fgf13-</i>related seizures and expand our understanding of FGF13 functions in different neuron subsets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99904">Wavenumber-dependent transmission of subthreshold waves on electrical synapses network model of Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental studies showed that electrically coupled neural networks like in mammalian inferior olive nucleus generate synchronized rhythmic activity by the subthreshold sinusoidal-like oscillations of the membrane voltage. Understanding the basic mechanism and its implication of such phenomena in the nervous system bears fundamental importance and requires preemptively the connectome information of a given nervous system. Inspired by these necessities of developing a theoretical and computational model to this end and, however, in the absence of connectome information for the inferior olive nucleus, here we investigated interference phenomena of the subthreshold oscillations in the reference system <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> for which the structural anatomical connectome was completely known recently. We evaluated how strongly the sinusoidal wave was transmitted between arbitrary two cells in the model network. The region of cell-pairs that are good at transmitting waves changed according to the wavenumber of the wave, for which we named a wavenumber-dependent transmission map. Also, we unraveled that (1) the transmission of all cell-pairs disappeared beyond a threshold wavenumber, (2) long distance and regular patterned transmission existed in the body-wall muscles part of the model network, and (3) major hub cell-pairs of the transmission were identified for many wavenumber conditions. A theoretical and computational model presented in this study provided fundamental insight for understanding how the multi-path constructive/destructive interference of the subthreshold oscillations propagating on electrically coupled neural networks could generate wavenumber-dependent synchronized rhythmic activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87522">Sibling similarity can reveal key insights into genetic architecture</a></h4>

              
                The use of siblings to infer the factors influencing complex traits has been a cornerstone of quantitative genetics. Here, we utilise siblings for a novel application: the inference of genetic architecture, specifically that relating to individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. in the top 1%). Inferring the genetic architecture most relevant to this group of individuals is important because they are at the greatest risk of disease and may be more likely to harbour rare variants of large effect due to natural selection. We develop a theoretical framework that derives expected distributions of sibling trait values based on an index sibling’s trait value, estimated trait heritability, and null assumptions that include infinitesimal genetic effects and environmental factors that are either controlled for or have combined Gaussian effects. This framework is then used to develop statistical tests powered to distinguish between trait tails characterised by common polygenic architecture from those that include substantial enrichments of de novo or rare variant (Mendelian) architecture. We apply our tests to UK Biobank data here, although we note that they can be used to infer genetic architecture in any cohort or health registry that includes siblings and their trait values, since these tests do not use genetic data. We describe how our approach has the potential to help disentangle the genetic and environmental causes of extreme trait values, and to improve the design and power of future sequencing studies to detect rare variants.

                Together with obesity and type 2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing global epidemic. Activation of the complement system and infiltration of macrophages has been linked to progression of metabolic liver disease. The role of complement receptors in macrophage activation and recruitment in MASLD remains poorly understood. In human and mouse, <i>C3AR1</i> in the liver is expressed primarily in Kupffer cells, but is downregulated in humans with MASLD compared to obese controls. To test the role of complement 3a receptor (C3aR1) on macrophages and liver resident macrophages in MASLD, we generated mice deficient in C3aR1 on all macrophages (C3aR1-MφKO) or specifically in liver Kupffer cells (C3aR1-KpKO) and subjected them to a model of metabolic steatotic liver disease. We show that macrophages account for the vast majority of <i>C3ar1</i> expression in the liver. Overall, C3aR1-MφKO and C3aR1-KpKO mice have similar body weight gain without significant alterations in glucose homeostasis, hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, compared to controls on a MASLD-inducing diet. This study demonstrates that C3aR1 deletion in macrophages or Kupffer cells, the predominant liver cell type expressing <i>C3ar1</i>, has no significant effect on liver steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in a dietary MASLD model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95944">Psychological stress disturbs bone metabolism via miR-335-3p/Fos signaling in osteoclast</a></h4>

              
                It has been well validated that chronic psychological stress leads to bone loss, but the underlying mechanism remains unclarified. In this study, we established and analyzed the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice to investigate the miRNA-related pathogenic mechanism involved in psychological stress-induced osteoporosis. Our result found that these CUMS mice exhibited osteoporosis phenotype that is mainly attributed to the abnormal activities of osteoclasts. Subsequently, miRNA sequencing and other analysis showed that miR-335-3p, which is normally highly expressed in the brain, was significantly downregulated in the nucleus ambiguous, serum, and bone of the CUMS mice. Additionally, in vitro studies detected that miR-335-3p is important for osteoclast differentiation, with its direct targeting site in <i>Fos</i>. Further studies demonstrated FOS was upregulated in CUMS osteoclast, and the inhibition of FOS suppressed the accelerated osteoclastic differentiation, as well as the expression of osteoclastic genes, such as <i>Nfatc1, Acp5,</i> and <i>Mmp9</i>, in miR-335-3p-restrained osteoclasts. In conclusion, this work indicated that psychological stress may downregulate the miR-335-3p expression, which resulted in the accumulation of FOS and the upregulation of NFACT1 signaling pathway in osteoclasts, leading to its accelerated differentiation and abnormal activity. These results decipher a previously unrecognized paradigm that miRNA can act as a link between psychological stress and bone metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93413">Atlas of Fshr expression from novel reporter mice</a></h4>

              
                The FSH-FSHR pathway has been considered an essential regulator in reproductive development and fertility. But there has been emerging evidence of FSHR expression in extragonadal organs. This poses new questions and long-term debates regarding the physiological role of the FSH-FSHR, and underscores the need for reliable, in vivo analysis of FSHR expression in animal models. However, conventional methods have proven insufficient for examining FSHR expression due to several limitations. To address this challenge, we developed Fshr-ZsGreen reporter mice under the control of Fshr endogenous promoter using CRISPR-Cas9. With this novel genetic tool, we provide a reliable readout of Fshr expression at single-cell resolution level in vivo and in real time. Reporter animals were also subjected to additional analyses,to define the accurate expression profile of FSHR in gonadal and extragonadal organs/tissues. Our compelling results not only demonstrated Fshr expression in intragonadal tissues but also, strikingly, unveiled notably increased expression in Leydig cells, osteoblast lineage cells, endothelial cells in vascular structures, and epithelial cells in bronchi of the lung and renal tubes. The genetic decoding of the widespread pattern of Fshr expression highlights its physiological relevance beyond reproduction and fertility, and opens new avenues for therapeutic options for age-related disorders of the bones, lungs, kidneys, and hearts, among other tissues. Exploiting the power of the Fshr knockin reporter animals, this report provides the first comprehensive genetic record of the spatial distribution of FSHR expression, correcting a long-term misconception about Fshr expression and offering prospects for extensive exploration of FSH-FSHR biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93327">Neural evidence of functional compensation for fluid intelligence in healthy ageing</a></h4>

              
                Functional compensation is a common notion in the neuroscience of healthy ageing, whereby older adults are proposed to recruit additional brain activity to compensate for reduced cognitive function. However, whether this additional brain activity in older participants actually helps their cognitive performance remains debated. We examined brain activity and cognitive performance in a human lifespan sample (<i>N</i> = 223) while they performed a problem-solving task (based on Cattell’s test of fluid intelligence) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain univariate analysis revealed that activity in bilateral cuneal cortex for hard vs. easy problems increased both with age and with performance, even when adjusting for an estimate of age-related differences in cerebrovascular reactivity. Multivariate Bayesian decoding further demonstrated that age increased the likelihood that activation patterns in this cuneal region provided non-redundant information about the two task conditions, beyond that of the multiple demand network generally activated in this task. This constitutes some of the strongest evidence yet for functional compensation in healthy ageing, at least in this brain region during visual problem-solving.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104759">Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) genome provides new insights into convergent evolution of caffeine biosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                Yerba mate (YM, <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i>) is an economically important crop marketed for the elaboration of mate, the third-most widely consumed caffeine-containing infusion worldwide. Here, we report the first genome assembly of this species, which has a total length of 1.06 Gb and contains 53,390 protein-coding genes. Comparative analyses revealed that the large YM genome size is partly due to a whole-genome duplication (Ip-α) during the early evolutionary history of <i>Ilex</i>, in addition to the hexaploidization event (γ) shared by core eudicots. Characterization of the genome allowed us to clone the genes encoding methyltransferase enzymes that catalyse multiple reactions required for caffeine production. To our surprise, this species has converged upon a different biochemical pathway compared to that of coffee and tea. In order to gain insight into the structural basis for the convergent enzyme activities, we obtained a crystal structure for the terminal enzyme in the pathway that forms caffeine. The structure reveals that convergent solutions have evolved for substrate positioning because different amino acid residues facilitate a different substrate orientation such that efficient methylation occurs in the independently evolved enzymes in YM and coffee. While our results show phylogenomic constraint limits the genes coopted for convergence of caffeine biosynthesis, the X-ray diffraction data suggest structural constraints are minimal for the convergent evolution of individual reactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92491">High-throughput tracking enables systematic phenotyping and drug repurposing in C. elegans disease models</a></h4>

              
                There are thousands of Mendelian diseases with more being discovered weekly and the majority have no approved treatments. To address this need, we require scalable approaches that are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional drug development. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screening in model organisms provides a route for identifying candidate treatments. Success requires a screenable phenotype. However, the right phenotype and assay may not be obvious for pleiotropic neuromuscular disorders. Here, we show that high-throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping can be conducted systematically on a panel of <i>C. elegans</i> disease model strains. We used CRISPR genome-editing to create 25 worm models of human Mendelian diseases and phenotyped them using a single standardised assay. All but two strains were significantly different from wild-type controls in at least one feature. The observed phenotypes were diverse, but mutations of genes predicted to have related functions led to similar behavioural differences in worms. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a drug repurposing screen of an FDA-approved compound library, and identified two compounds that rescued the behavioural phenotype of a model of UNC80 deficiency. Our results show that a single assay to measure multiple phenotypes can be applied systematically to diverse Mendelian disease models. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping multiple strains suggest that high-throughput worm tracking could provide a scalable approach to drug repurposing commensurate with the number of Mendelian diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100856">Multi-dimensional oscillatory activity of mouse GnRH neurons in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent the key output cells of the neural network controlling mammalian fertility. We used GCaMP fiber photometry to record the population activity of the GnRH neuron distal projections in the ventral arcuate nucleus where they merge before entering the median eminence to release GnRH into the portal vasculature. Recordings in freely behaving intact male and female mice revealed abrupt ~8 min duration increases in activity that correlated perfectly with the appearance of a subsequent pulse of luteinizing hormone (LH). The GnRH neuron dendrons also exhibited a low level of unchanging clustered, rapidly fluctuating baseline activity in males and throughout the estrous cycle in females. In female mice, a gradual increase in basal activity that exhibited ~80 min oscillations began in the afternoon of proestrus and lasted for 12 hr. This was associated with the onset of the LH surge that ended several hours before the fall in the GCaMP signal. Abrupt 8 min duration episodes of GCaMP activity continued to occur on top of the rising surge baseline before ceasing in estrus. These observations provide the first description of GnRH neuron activity in freely behaving animals. They demonstrate that three distinct patterns of oscillatory activity occur in GnRH neurons. These are comprised of low-level rapid baseline activity, abrupt 8 min duration oscillations that drive pulsatile gonadotropin secretion, and, in females, a gradual and very prolonged oscillating increase in activity responsible for the preovulatory LH surge.

                The ever-increasing burden of psychiatric disorders and limitations of current treatments have fueled enormous interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Yet how psychedelics, such as psilocybin, produce lasting therapeutic effects is unclear. Using scRNA-sequencing we identify a type of deep layer near projecting neuron that is most robustly regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex of female mice 24h after psilocybin. We show that this cell-type specificity does not align with 5-HT2A receptor expression but is consistent with the integrated signaling via cell-type specific 5-HT receptor co-expression patterns. Cell-cell communication reveals that psilocybin also broadly suppresses GABAergic inhibition. Ultimately, psilocybin induces plasticity-related genes in subsets of excitatory neurons suggesting that psilocybin induces sustained increases in neuroplasticity in the mouse mPFC. Our findings point to L5/6NP neurons as a key mediator of psilocybin neuroplastic effects.

">The spinal premotor network driving scratching flexor and extensor alternation</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic motor behaviors are generated by neural networks termed central pattern generators (CPGs). Although locomotor CPGs have been extensively characterized, it remains unknown how the neuronal populations composing them interact to generate adaptive rhythms. We explored the non-linear cooperation dynamics among the three main populations of ipsilaterally projecting spinal CPG neurons - V1, V2a, V2b neurons - in scratch reflex rhythmogenesis. Ablation of all three neuronal subtypes reduced the oscillation frequency. Activation of excitatory V2a neurons enhanced the oscillation frequency, while activating inhibitory V1 neurons caused atonia. These findings required the development of a novel neuromechanical model that consists of flexor and extensor modules coupled via inhibition, in which rhythm in each module is generated by self-bursting excitatory populations and accelerated by intra-module inhibition. Inter-module inhibition coordinates the phases of flexor and extensor activity and slows the oscillations, while facilitation mechanisms in excitatory neurons explain the V2a activation-driven increase in frequency.

">Physiologically-relevant light exposure and light behaviour in Switzerland and Malaysia</a></h4>

              
                Light synchronises the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle. Keeping this alignment benefits health and prevents diseases. Quantifying light exposure is, therefore, vital for effective prevention. Since light exposure depends on photoperiod, culture, and behaviour, we investigated objective light exposure and individual light-related behaviour in Switzerland and Malaysia. In this observational field study, participants (N=39) wore a calibrated melanopic light logger at chest level for 30 consecutive days. At baseline and study end, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was assessed, and every 3 to 4 days, the Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA) was filled. Our pre-registered analyses reveal that participants in Switzerland experienced brighter days (+3.16 times the average mEDI) and spent more time (x1.9 times the duration) in daylight levels per hour of daylight, had ~1.5h later bright light exposure in the afternoon, and stayed over 1h longer in dim light conditions before bedtime. LEBA scores did not differ between Malaysia and Switzerland, and LEBA items were stable over time. LEBA items also correlated with objective light exposure variables in Switzerland but not Malaysia, with a medium effect size (range of absolute r=0.32-0.48). These results highlight cultural and geographical differences in light exposure. We showed that LEBA can be related to actual light exposure and is ecologically informative, but this varies by culture.

">Noise-induced hearing loss enhances Ca2+-dependent spontaneous bursting activity in lateralcochlear efferents</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages cochlear hair cells and triggers downstream changes in synaptic and electrical activity in multiple brain regions, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether or not noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system, a feedback pathway in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. We examined the effects of noise-induced hearing loss on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons. This spontaneous firing exhibits a characteristic burst pattern dependent on Ca2+ channels, and we therefore also examined the effects of noise-induced hearing loss on the function of these and other ion channels. The burst pattern was sustained by an interaction between inactivating Ca2+ currents contributed largely by L-type channels, and steady outward currents mediated by Ba2+-sensitive inwardly-rectifying and two-pore domain K+ channels. One week following exposure to loud broadband noise, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, likely as a result of an enhanced Ca2+ current. Additional effects of noise-induced hearing loss included alteration of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ currents and a small elevation of outward K+ currents. We propose that noise-induced hearing loss enhances efferent activity and may thus amplify the release of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (i.e., neuropeptides), potentially altering sensory coding within the damaged cochlea.

">Eye metrics are a marker of visual conscious awareness and neural processing in cerebral blindness</a></h4>

              
                Damage to the primary visual pathway can cause vision loss. Some cerebrally blind people retain degraded vision or sensations and can perform visually guided behaviors. These cases motivate investigation and debate on blind field conscious awareness and linked residual neural processing. A key challenge in this research is that subjective measures of blind field visual conscious awareness can be misleading. Alternatively, eye metrics, including pupil size and eye movements are promising objective markers of conscious awareness and brain activity. In this study, we examined stimulus-evoked changes in pupil size, blinking, and microsaccades in the sighted and blind field of cerebrally blind participants. Using standard analysis and innovative machine learning methods, our findings support that eye metrics can infer blind field conscious awareness, even when behavioral performance on a visual perception task indicated otherwise. Furthermore, these eye metrics were linked to blind field visual stimulus-evoked occipital cortical field potentials. These findings support recording eye metrics in cerebral blindness and highlight potential clinical applications, including tracking the recovery of conscious vision and visual neural processing.

                Rapid breakdown of cerebral glucose metabolism is a hallmark in stroke pathology. Metabolic activity delineates the penumbra from the infarct core, representing tissue that is potentially salvageable by therapeutic interventions. Tools to image dynamics of glucose and its spatial distribution could provide biomarkers of disease severity and of the success of therapeutic interventions. Here, we developed a new protocol to measure glucose metabolism in a rat model of stroke using chemical exchange-sensitive spin-lock (CESL) MRI of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG). We further implemented a protocol that combines 2DG-CESL-MRI with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and diffusion MRI. We found that 2DG-CESL-MRI provides a biomarker of disturbed glucose metabolism after stroke with high effect to noise ratios. This is the first study to investigate CESL MRI of 2DG in the context of metabolism imaging in rodent stroke.

">Modeling the acutely injured brain environment in vitro.</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge to study the regenerative potential of the injured brain is the limited access to this organ in vivo. To address this, we developed an innovative gliosis model that, although established in vitro, originates from a genuine injury in vivo. The model relies on reactive glia acquiring enhanced adhesion, facilitating their rapid adaptation to in vitro conditions, where it faithfully recapitulates key features of brain injury. These include degenerative responses, such as neuronal death and neuroinflammation, alongside regenerative processes, including neural stem cells proliferation, chemotactic recruitment of neural progenitors, and oligodendrocyte lineage commitment. Moreover, the exposure of adult glial cells to this culture medium recapitulates the acquisition of multipotency observed in both mouse and human injured brains. Furthermore, our approach allows studying glia-to-neuron reprogramming, a process challenging to tackle in vivo. Consequently, we present a novel tool for exploring stem cell dynamics and regenerative behaviors in CNS pathology.

">Behavioral and neural sound classification: Insights from natural and synthetic sounds</a></h4>

              
                Throughout the course of a day, human listeners encounter an immense variety of sounds in their environment. These are quickly transformed into mental representations of objects and events that guide subsequent cognition and behavior in the world. Previous studies using behavioral and temporally resolved neuroimaging methods have demonstrated the importance of certain acoustic qualities for distinguishing among different classes of sounds during the early time period following sound onset (noisiness, spectral envelope, spectrotemporal change over time, and change in fundamental frequency over time). However, this evidence is largely based on correlational studies of natural sounds. Thus, two additional behavioral (Experiment 1) and EEG (Experiment 2) studies further tested these results using a set of synthesized stimuli (interspersed among a new set of natural sounds) that explicitly manipulated previously identified acoustic dimensions. In addition to finding similar correlational results as previous work (using new natural stimuli and tasks), classification results for the synthesized acoustic feature manipulations reinforced the importance of aperiodicity, spectral envelope, spectral variability and fundamental frequency change for representations of superordinate sound-categories. Analyses of the synthesized stimuli suggest that aperiodicity is a particularly robust cue in distinguishing some categories and that speech is difficult to characterize within this framework (i.e., using these acoustic dimensions and synthetic feature manipulations). These results provide a deeper understanding of the neural and perceptual dynamics that support the recognition of behaviorally important categories of sound in the time windows soon after sound onset.

">Following the Robot's Lead: Predicting Human and Robot Movement from EEG in a Motor Learning HRI Task</a></h4>

              
                Human-robot interaction (HRI) offers unique opportunities to study the neuroscience of human motor control through controlled and reproducible sensory stimuli. In this study, we introduce an innovative neuroscience-HRI framework inspired by the Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task, that combines EEG with a task where a humanoid robot performs preprogrammed movement sequences that are mirrored by a human participant in real time. The use of a humanoid robot ensures precise and repeatable sensory-motor stimuli in the 3D peripersonal space of the participant, providing experimental conditions that may be challenging to replicate with traditional methods. Behavioral performance is assessed by measuring the temporal lag between human and robot movements, which decreases with training, reflecting motor sequence learning. Concurrently, EEG data from the human participant is analyzed to reveal neural correlates of learning and movement dynamics. Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) in theta, mu, and beta frequency bands demonstrate distinct patterns associated with rest, fixation, and movement. Furthermore, the ERSP changes over successive trials reflect the progression of sequence learning, highlighting the relationship between neural oscillations and motor learning. A Markov-Switching Linear Regression model further decodes EEG signals to predict movement parameters including both human and robot position and velocity in a time-resolved manner. Our findings highlight the potential of HRI as a robust platform for neuroscience research and underscore the value of EEG-based neural decoding in understanding motor sequence learning. This work suggests further advances for integrating robotics into neuroscience and rehabilitation research.

">Specificity Protein 1 is essential for the limb trajectory of ephrin-mediated spinal motor axons</a></h4>

              
                The precise organization of neural circuits requires highly specific axon guidance, facilitated by cell-surface guidance receptors on axonal growth cones that help neurons reach their target destinations. Despite a limited repertoire of known guidance receptors and ligands, neural systems achieve complex axonal networks, suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms exist. One proposed strategy is the co-expression of ligands and their receptors on the same axons, allowing modulation of receptor responsiveness to guidance cues. To investigate this mechanism, we studied the spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor neurons, which make a binary axon pathfinding decision toward limb targets. We hypothesized that specificity protein 1 (Sp1), a transcription factor, regulates ephrin expression in LMC neurons, thereby modulating receptor functions via cis-attenuation to ensure accurate axonal pathfinding. Our results show that Sp1 is indeed expressed in LMC neurons during critical axonal extension periods. Manipulating Sp1 activity disrupted LMC axon trajectory selection, and RNA-Seq analysis indicated that Sp1 regulates genes associated with axon guidance, including ephrins. We found that Sp1 knockdown affected ephrin/Eph cis-binding and trans-signaling, highlighting Sp1's role in controlling axonal projections through ephrin gene regulation. Additionally, coactivators p300 and CBP are essential for Sp1's regulatory function. These findings identify Sp1 as a key transcription factor in LMC neurons, essential for ephrin expression and ephrin/Eph-mediated axon guidance, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of neural circuit formation.

	<p>Background: Chronic postoperative pain (CPOP) is among the main consequences of surgical procedures, directly affecting the quality of life. Although many strategies have been used to treat this symptom, they are often ineffective. Thus, studies investigating CPOP-associated mechanisms may help to develop more effective treatment strategies. Therefore, the present study investigated the spinal participation of the transient potential receptor vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation during CPOP. Methods: In this study C57BL/6 male mice were used, and CPOP was induced by muscle retraction and incision. The nociceptive threshold was measured by the von Frey filament test. For pharmacological evaluation, TRPV1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors were administered intrathecally. TRPV1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. Results: The results showed that CPOP increased TRPV1 and mTOR protein levels, and pretreatment with the specific inhibitors alleviated CPOP. In addition, pretreatment with the TRPV1 antagonist SB-366791 attenuated mTOR protein levels. Conclusions: The results suggest that TRPV1 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are involved in CPOP at the spinal level, and TRPV1 may activate mTOR during this process.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sustaining the human brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s hippocampus from atrophy throughout ageing is critical. Exercise is proven to be effective in promoting adaptive hippocampal plasticity, and the hippocampus has a bidirectional relationship with the physical environment. Therefore, this systematic review explores the effects of walking, a simple physical activity in the environment, on hippocampal formation volume changes for lifelong brain and cognitive health. Method: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies on humans published up to November 2022 examining hippocampal volume changes and walking. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and ROBINS-I tool. A narrative synthesis explored walking factors associated with total, subregional, and hemisphere-specific hippocampal volume changes. Results: Overall, walking had positive effects on hippocampal volumes. Several studies found benefits of higher-intensity and greater amounts of walking for total hippocampal volume. The subiculum increased after low-intensity walking and nature exposure, while the parahippocampal gyrus benefited from vigorous intensity. The right hippocampus increased with spatial navigation during walking. No studies examined the effect of walking on the dentate gyrus. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights walking as a multifaceted variable that can lead to manifold adaptive hippocampal volume changes. These findings support the promotion of walking as a simple, effective strategy to enhance brain health and prevent cognitive decline, suggesting the design of physical environments with natural and biophilic characteristics and layouts with greater walkability and cognitive stimulation. Future research is encouraged to explore the hippocampal subregional changes instead of focusing on total hippocampal volume, since the hippocampal formation is multicompartmental and subfields respond differently to different walking-related variables.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: While most studies on the postoperative condition of patients with spinal cord tumors describe long-term outcomes, data are needed on immediate surgical outcomes demanding rehabilitation to make informed assessments for postoperative planning. The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting function and rehabilitative needs after intradural spinal tumor surgery. Methods: Eighty-five prospectively recruited patients underwent surgery for intradural intramedullary (ID-IM; n = 23) and extramedullary (ID-EM; n = 62) tumors. Neurological and functional status were assessed before surgery, after surgery, and at discharge using the modified McCormick scale (MMS), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale, Barthel index (BI), and the gait index (GI). Results: There were no significant predictors of early postoperative rehabilitation in the ID-IM group. In the ID-EM group, age, thoracic level, subtotal resection (STR), repeat surgery, and functional scale scores predicted the need for rehabilitation. In multivariable analysis, MMS (odds ratio (OR) 8.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.37&amp;amp;ndash;32.44) and STR (OR 13.00; 95%CI: 1.56&amp;amp;ndash;107.87) remained independent predictors of rehabilitation need (area under curve, 92%). Despite their younger age, most patients with ID-IM tumors, especially ependymomas, required rehabilitation but improved quickly (KPS, BI, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Among ID-EM tumors, meningiomas were characterized by poorer preoperative function and low gross total resection (GTR) rates, but did not deteriorate neurologically after surgery. Patients with schwannoma and ID-EM ependymomas achieved the highest GTR rate and had the best function both before and after surgery. Conclusions: These results may be useful for estimating early rehabilitation needs after intradural tumor surgery and counseling patients before surgery about the expected postoperative course.</p>

                Abstract Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when dealing with widespread metastatic disease.

                Background Better affordability of data plans and an increase in “budget” smartphones have resulted in an exponential rise in internet and smartphone users. The ease of access to sexually explicit material (SEM) coupled with adolescents’ impulsivity makes them prone to excessive SEM exposure and may affect the development of sexuality via the perceived realism of such content. This study was done to study the influence between problematic smartphone usage (PSU) and sexuality development among late adolescent boys. Methods One hundred and thirty-four adolescents aged 18-19 years, studying in a medical university, participated in this cross-sectional study. Smartphone Addiction Scale – short version (SAS-SV) to evaluate PSU and a content validated semi-structured proforma to evaluate gender identity, sexual orientation, sources of information on pubertal changes, and exposure to pornographic content was used. We expressed results as proportion and summary measures (Mean±SD), Chi-square test to find influence between PSU and adolescent sexuality development. Results We found a 45.5% prevalence of PSU. Among study participants, 88% were attracted to the opposite sex, 6% were attracted to the same-sex, and 6% were attracted to both sexes. Three per cent of participants liked wearing clothes of the opposite sex, 7.5% wanted to be members of the opposite sex, whereas 10.4% were not comfortable with their genitalia. They obtained information regarding pubertal changes from friends (85) and media (78). Many had exposure to pornographic content (90%), with the youngest being nine years old. Conclusion Nearly half of the late adolescents have PSU. Pornographic contents are accessed through Smartphones.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden shift to Emergency Remote Learning, significantly impacting students’ mental health. This study visualizes and analyses various stressors contributing to stress levels among university students during Emergency Remote Learning and explores how different factors from environmental and instructional mediums contribute to their perceived stress. Method Data was collected through a cross-sectional survey using the Modified Perceived Stress Scale and an additional set of 20 Likert scale items on Emergency Remote Learning. One-sample t-tests were performed to assess the consistency of responses across questionnaire items, and correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between different stressors. Frequency distributions were also analyzed to capture the prevalence of stress levels across demographic, environmental, and instructional variables. Conclusion The study revealed that frequent thoughts about unaccomplished tasks were associated with high stress (14.12%). Other factors include feeling nervous and stressed, feeling things that are not going their way, and difficulties piling up significantly elevated stress levels. Items specific to Emergency Remote Learning revealed that a sudden shift to Remote Learning heavily influenced students’ mental well-being. Additionally, demographic analysis showed that students aged 21 experienced the highest stress levels. Living arrangements, internet connectivity, and the impact of COVID-19 on close affinities further contributed to stress. This study underscores the complexity of stress during Emergency Remote Learning. It emphasizes the need for institutions to address psychological and instructional factors to support students better during remote learning environments.

Gathering observational data for medical decision-making often involves uncertainties arising from both type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors. In this work, we develop a statistical model to study how medical decision-making can be improved by aggregating results from repeated diagnostic and screening tests. Our approach is relevant to not only clinical settings such as medical imaging, but also to public health, as highlighted by the need for rapid, cost-effective testing methods during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our model enables the development of testing protocols with an arbitrary number of tests, which can be customized to meet requirements for type I and type II errors. This allows us to adjust sensitivity and specificity according to application-specific needs. Additionally, we derive generalized Rogan–Gladen estimates of disease prevalence that account for an arbitrary number of tests with potentially different type I and type II errors. We also provide the corresponding uncertainty quantification.

                <p>by Diego Tec-Campos, Juan D. Tibocha-Bonilla, Celina Jiang, Anurag Passi, Deepan Thiruppathy, Cristal Zuñiga, Camila Posadas, Alejandro Zepeda, Karsten Zengler</p>

The denitrifying bacterium <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T, a common member of microbial communities in wastewater treatment facilities, can produce different compounds from a range of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In these different conditions, <i>Thauera</i> modifies its metabolism to produce different compounds that influence the microbial community. In particular, <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T produces different exopolysaccharides with floc-forming properties, impacting the physical disposition of wastewater consortia and the efficiency of nutrient assimilation by the microbial community. Under N-limiting conditions, <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T decreases its growth rate and accelerates the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate-related (PHA) compounds including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which plays a fundamental role as C and energy storage in this β-proteobacterium. However, the metabolic mechanisms employed by <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T to assimilate and catabolize many of the different C and N sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions remain unknown. Systems biology approaches such as genome-scale metabolic modeling have been successfully used to unveil complex metabolic mechanisms for various microorganisms. Here, we developed a comprehensive metabolic model (M-model) for <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T (<i>i</i>Thauera861), consisting of 1,744 metabolites, 2,384 reactions, and 861 genes. We validated the model experimentally using over 70 different C and N sources under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. <i>i</i>Thauera861 achieved a prediction accuracy of 95% for growth on various C and N sources and close to 85% for assimilation of aromatic compounds under denitrifying conditions. The M-model was subsequently deployed to determine the effects of substrates, oxygen presence, and the C:N ratio on the production of PHB and exopolysaccharides (EPS), showing the highest polymer yields are achieved with nucleotides and amino acids under aerobic conditions. This comprehensive M-model will help reveal the metabolic processes by which this ubiquitous species influences communities in wastewater treatment systems and natural environments.

                <p>by Zeinab Mousavi, Marios Arvanitis, ThuyVy Duong, Jennifer A. Brody, Alexis Battle, Nona Sotoodehnia, Ali Shojaie, Dan E. Arking, Joel S. Bader</p>

Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants, usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with human traits, including disease and disease risk. These variants (or causal variants in linkage disequilibrium with them) usually affect the regulation or function of a nearby gene. A GWAS locus can span many genes, however, and prioritizing which gene or genes in a locus are most likely to be causal remains a challenge. Better prioritization and prediction of causal genes could reveal disease mechanisms and suggest interventions.
Results: We describe a new Bayesian method, termed SigNet for significance networks, that combines information both within and across loci to identify the most likely causal gene at each locus. The SigNet method builds on existing methods that focus on individual loci with evidence from gene distance and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by sharing information across loci using protein-protein and gene regulatory interaction network data. In an application to cardiac electrophysiology with 226 GWAS loci, only 46 (20%) have within-locus evidence from Mendelian genes, protein-coding changes, or colocalization with eQTL signals. At the remaining 180 loci lacking functional information, SigNet selects 56 genes other than the minimum distance gene, equal to 31% of the information-poor loci and 25% of the GWAS loci overall. Assessment by pathway enrichment demonstrates improved performance by SigNet. Review of individual loci shows literature evidence for genes selected by SigNet, including <i>PMP22</i> as a novel causal gene candidate.

                <p>by Asgeir Kobro-Flatmoen, Stig W. Omholt</p>

Numerous studies of the human brain supported by experimental results from rodent and cell models point to a central role for intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a rat model used to study AD, it was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anteriolateral entorhinal cortex expressing high levels of the glycoprotein reelin (Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons), reelin and Aβ engage in a direct protein–protein interaction. If reelin functions as a sink for intracellular Aβ and if the binding to reelin makes Aβ physiologically inert, it implies that reelin can prevent the neuron from being exposed to the harmful effects typically associated with increased levels of oligomeric Aβ. Considering that reelin expression is extraordinarily high in Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons, such a protective role appears to be very difficult to reconcile with the fact that this subset of ECLII neurons is clearly a major cradle for the onset of AD. Here, we show that this conundrum can be resolved if Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons have a higher maximum production capacity of Aβ than neurons expressing low levels of reelin, and we provide a rationale for why this difference has evolved.

Identifying the driver nodes of a network has crucial implications in biological systems from unveiling causal interactions to informing effective intervention strategies. Despite recent advances in network control theory, results remain inaccurate as the number of drivers becomes too small compared to the network size, thus limiting the concrete usability in many real-life applications. To overcome this issue, we introduced a framework that integrates principles from spectral graph theory and output controllability to project the network state into a smaller topological space formed by the Laplacian network structure. Through extensive simulations on synthetic and real networks, we showed that a relatively low number of projected components can significantly improve the control accuracy. By introducing a new low-dimensional controllability metric we experimentally validated our method on N = 6134 human connectomes obtained from the UK-biobank cohort. Results revealed previously unappreciated influential brain regions, enabled to draw directed maps between differently specialized cerebral systems, and yielded new insights into hemispheric lateralization. Taken together, our results offered a theoretically grounded solution to deal with network controllability and provided insights into the causal interactions of the human brain.

Machine learning sequence-function models for proteins could enable significant advances in protein engineering, especially when paired with state-of-the-art methods to select new sequences for property optimization and/or model improvement. Such methods (Bayesian optimization and active learning) require calibrated estimations of model uncertainty. While studies have benchmarked a variety of deep learning uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods on standard and molecular machine-learning datasets, it is not clear if these results extend to protein datasets. In this work, we implemented a panel of deep learning UQ methods on regression tasks from the Fitness Landscape Inference for Proteins (FLIP) benchmark. We compared results across different degrees of distributional shift using metrics that assess each UQ method’s accuracy, calibration, coverage, width, and rank correlation. Additionally, we compared these metrics using one-hot encoding and pretrained language model representations, and we tested the UQ methods in retrospective active learning and Bayesian optimization settings. Our results indicate that there is no single best UQ method across all datasets, splits, and metrics, and that uncertainty-based sampling is often unable to outperform greedy sampling in Bayesian optimization. These benchmarks enable us to provide recommendations for more effective design of biological sequences using machine learning.

                <p>by Glen McLachlan, Piotr Majdak, Jonas Reijniers, Michael Mihocic, Herbert Peremans</p>

Self-motion is an essential but often overlooked component of sound localisation. As the directional information of a source is implicitly contained in head-centred acoustic cues, that acoustic input needs to be continuously combined with sensorimotor information about the head orientation in order to decode to a world-centred frame of reference. When utilised, head movements significantly reduce ambiguities in the directional information provided by the incoming sound. In this work, we model human active sound localisation (considering small head rotations) as an ideal observer. In the evaluation, we compared human performance obtained in a free-field active localisation experiment with the predictions of a Bayesian model. Model noise parameters were set a-priori based on behavioural results from other studies, i.e., without any post-hoc parameter fitting to behavioural results. The model predictions showed a general agreement with actual human performance. However, a spatial analysis revealed that the ideal observer was not able to predict localisation behaviour for each source direction. A more detailed investigation into the effects of various model parameters indicated that uncertainty on head orientation significantly contributed to the observed differences. Yet, the biases and spatial distribution of the human responses remained partially unexplained by the presented ideal observer model, suggesting that human sound localisation is sub-optimal.

                <p>by Guillem Murciano-Julià, Marina Francos-Cárdenas, Clàudia Salat-Canela, Elena Hidalgo, José Ayté</p>

Fission yeast is an excellent model system that has been widely used to study the mechanism that control cell cycle progression. However, there is a lack of tools that allow to measure with high precision the duration of the different phases of the cell cycle in individual cells. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a fluorescent reporter that allows the quantification of the different phases of the cell cycle at the single-cell level in most genetic backgrounds. To prove the accuracy of this fluorescent reporter, we have tested the reporter in strains known to have a delay in the G1/S or G2/M transitions, confirming the strength and versatility of the system. An advantage of this reporter is that it eliminates the need for culture synchronization, avoiding stressing the cells. Using this reporter, we show that unperturbed cells lacking Sty1 have a standard cell cycle length and distribution and that the extended length of these cells is due to their increased cell growth rate but not to alterations in their cell cycle progression.

                Background The under-five mortality rate counted 71 deaths per 1000 live births for children under five in Sub Saharan Africa in 2022, far above the SDG under five-mortality goal of 25 deaths per live 1000 birth. Referral issues are major challenges to child health and a hypothesis is that care at lower-level facilities delays quality emergency care. This study investigates the extent of no-referral versus health centres-referrals prior to hospital admission for sick children, and with inpatient mortality associations in Malawi. Methods We conducted a cohort study of children aged 0-12 years admitted to hospitals in Mchinji district. Data-collection was done from September 2019 to April 2020 at one district-hospital and three community-hospitals. Information was collected from caregivers, patient files and ward admission registers. The primary analysis assesses the association between referral from a health centre and in-hospital outcomes using logistic regression. Inpatient mortality was the primary outcome. Result The 4926 included children demonstrated that 86.6% had gone straight to hospital without referral. The majority (67.9%) were admitted due to malaria, sepsis (21.3%) and pneumonia (13.3%). Referred children had a case fatality rate of 5.3%, while the non-referred had a case fatality rate of 2.5%. Referred children had higher odds of dying (AOR: 2.0, CI 95%: 1.3-3.0), compared to not referred children. Children with anaemia (AOR: 4.1, CI 95%: 2.7-6.3) and malnutrition (AOR: 6.3, CI 95%: 2.7-14.6) had significantly higher odds of dying, than those without these conditions. Conclusion Most children admitted to hospital were taken without a referral, and these children had better survival than those who were referred. While being referred could be a proxy for being more severely sick the mortality difference emphasises a need to better understand care-seeking pathways, including referral challenges, to direct interventions to improve timely provision of care for sick children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-39/v1?src=rss">Assessment of the level of knowledge, attitude, and preference for myopia management among patients and university students in Trinidad [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Approximately 1.6 billion people worldwide are currently affected by myopia, with estimates suggesting that by 2050, close to half of the global population may experience this condition. Additionally, the prevalence of myopia has been increasing in Trinidad, with rates ranging from 21.5% to 46%. A study has been conducted to determine better patients’ and students’ levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preferences toward the management of myopia in Trinidad. Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and preferences for myopia management among a sample of 323 participants, including patients and university students in Trinidad and Tobago, aged 18-40. Participants were randomly selected, and data were gathered using a structured questionnaire administered through telephone interviews for patients and emailed to students. Descriptive statistics and inferential analyses, including ANOVA and T-tests, were applied to identify significant associations, with a p-value threshold of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results A total of 317 participants were examined, resulting in a response rate of 98.1%. The average knowledge score of the participants was 12 out of 25. A slight difference was observed in the knowledge scores of males, with a p-value of 0.052. The results also indicated that the majority of the participants had a good attitude score (21.6 out of 30) toward myopia management. Age and gender had a negligible negative correlation (with a coefficient of -0.022 and p-value of 0.692, respectively) with management preference. Conclusion This study reveals critical gaps in knowledge and diverse attitudes toward myopia management among participants, highlighting the need for targeted educational interventions. While attitudes are generally positive, age and gender influence preferences for myopia correction, with spectacles and contact lenses being the most preferred methods. These insights can guide healthcare professionals in developing tailored approaches for myopia management in Trinidad and Tobago.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite significant advancements in achieving high recanalization rates (80%–90%) for large vessel occlusions through mechanical thrombectomy, the issue of “futile recanalization” remains a major clinical challenge. Futile recanalization occurs when over half of patients fail to experience expected symptom improvement after vessel recanalization, often resulting in severe functional impairment or death. Traditionally, this phenomenon has been attributed to inadequate blood flow and reperfusion injury. More recently, ongoing neuronal death after reperfusion, which leads to the progression of the ischemic penumbra into the core infarct, has been termed “futile reperfusion.” This review explores the complex role of autophagy mechanisms in futile reperfusion following ischemic stroke, with a focus on its relationship to neuronal survival. We also examine the regulation of autophagic activity by epigenetic mechanisms. By investigating autophagy's role in ischemic stroke, we aim to identify novel pathways for precision treatment.</p>

                Background This paper aims to examine the efficiency of Mexico’s dairy farms within its four regions of Tlaxcala Stated. Methods The Envelopment Data Analysis (DEA) applied to the variable returns to a scale model (VRS) for the year 2020. Also, Examine the statistical accuracy of efficiency estimation using bootstrap resampling techniques. The results reveal that Tlaxcala’s dairy farm efficiency, on the other hand, was adversely influenced by three inputs (costs): cost of investment in livestock, the total annual cost for feeding, reproduction, diseases and treatments, preventive medicine, sanitation, milking, fuel, and total labor. Results The efficiency distribution among farms using VRS, CRS, and FDH technologies reveals varying patterns. Under VRS and CRS, the majority of farms exhibit high efficiency within the 0 to less than 0.2 range, while FDH displays a broader distribution, with notable efficiency at 1 and across various ranges. These findings highlight the diverse landscape of efficiency levels across different technological approaches within the agricultural sector, offering valuable insights for optimization strategies and resource allocation. Conclusions The utilization of Bootstrap methodology enhances the reliability of efficiency assessments by providing robust statistical techniques that accommodate non-normal data distributions. By incorporating Bootstrap, decision-makers can obtain more accurate estimates of efficiency levels and confidence intervals, thereby making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and optimization strategies within the agricultural sector. As part of the study, provided The Policy suggestions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-38/v1?src=rss">Perceptions of communicable disease surveillance system attributes among key informants at primary healthcare centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Communicable disease surveillance systems (CDSSs) are essential for the timely identification and response to health threats, particularly in cities such as Jeddah, which serve as major gateways for international travelers and pilgrims. This study examined key informants’ perceptions of CDSS attributes at primary healthcare centers (PHCCs) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018 at 45 PHCCs. Key informants completed a validated electronic questionnaire using a seven-point Likert scale to evaluate their perceptions of CDSS attributes, including timeliness, usefulness, simplicity, acceptability, and flexibility. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of neutral responses on the findings. Results Of the 42 eligible key informants, 40 participated, yielding a 95% response rate. The CDSS was perceived as timely by 69% of participants, whereas lower proportions rated it as useful (42%), simple (36%), acceptable (24%), and flexible (27%). No substantial associations were found between perceptions and variables such as years of experience, family medicine specialization, or CDSS training. Key informants highlighted staffing gaps (85%) and the need for electronic system implementation (95%) as primary areas for improvement. Conclusion While the CDSS demonstrated relative strength in timeliness, substantial improvements are required in other attributes. The findings underscore the importance of enhanced electronic systems, adequate staffing, and effective training programs. Further quantitative assessments are needed to validate these perceptions and inform improvements at local and national levels.

                Despite the substantial contribution of disruptions in GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission to the etiology of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders, surprisingly few drugs targeting the GABAergic system are currently available, partly due to insufficient understanding of circuit-specific GABAergic synapse biology. In addition to GABA receptors, GABAergic synapses contain an elaborate organizational protein machinery that regulates the properties of synaptic transmission. Until recently, this machinery remained largely unexplored, but key methodological advances have now led to the identification of a wealth of new GABAergic organizer proteins. Notably, many of these proteins appear to function only at specific subsets of GABAergic synapses, creating a diversity of organizer complexes that may serve as circuit-specific targets for pharmacotherapies. The present review aims to summarize the methodological developments that underlie this newfound knowledge and provide a current overview of synapse-specific GABAergic organizer complexes, as well as outlining future avenues and challenges in translating this knowledge into clinical applications.

                TEPP-46 activates PKM2 by inducing a tetramer formation, which leads to a metabolic reprogramming in macrophages, resulting in an increase in ATP and IL-10 production. Toller-Kawahisa et al. showed that this increase in IL-10 improves mitochondrial health and is due to a mechanism dependent on the ATP hydrolysis to adenosine.

Activation of the inflammasome appears to be a crucial step during the later stages of ETosis, since other early events of ETosis are independent of AIM2 activation.

These llm-DMUs can serve as methylation markers for discriminating longevity in men. They have potential to promote longevity and suppress age-related diseases by modulating gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100928">Noncanonical roles of ATG5 and membrane atg8ylation in retromer assembly and function</a></h4>

              
                ATG5 is one of the core autophagy proteins with additional functions such as noncanonical membrane atg8ylation, which among a growing number of biological outputs includes control of tuberculosis in animal models. Here, we show that ATG5 associates with retromer’s core components VPS26, VPS29, and VPS35 and modulates retromer function. Knockout of ATG5 blocked trafficking of a key glucose transporter sorted by the retromer, GLUT1, to the plasma membrane. Knockouts of other genes essential for membrane atg8ylation, of which ATG5 is a component, affected GLUT1 sorting, indicating that membrane atg8ylation as a process affects retromer function and endosomal sorting. The contribution of membrane atg8ylation to retromer function in GLUT1 sorting was independent of canonical autophagy. These findings expand the scope of membrane atg8ylation to specific sorting processes in the cell dependent on the retromer and its known interactors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94825">Partial rejuvenation of the spermatogonial stem cell niche after gender-affirming hormone therapy in trans women</a></h4>

              
                Although the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on spermatogenesis in trans women has already been studied, data on its precise effects on the testicular environment is poor. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize, through histological and transcriptomic analysis, the spermatogonial stem cell niche of 106 trans women who underwent standardized GAHT, comprising estrogens and cyproterone acetate. A partial dedifferentiation of Sertoli cells was observed, marked by the co-expression of androgen receptor and anti-Müllerian hormone which mirrors the situation in peripubertal boys. The Leydig cells also exhibited a distribution analogous to peripubertal tissue, accompanied by a reduced insulin-like factor 3 expression. Although most peritubular myoid cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin 2, the expression pattern was disturbed. Besides this, fibrosis was particularly evident in the tubular wall and the lumen was collapsing in most participants. A spermatogenic arrest was also observed in all participants. The transcriptomic profile of transgender tissue confirmed a loss of mature characteristics - a partial rejuvenation - of the spermatogonial stem cell niche and, in addition, detected inflammation processes occurring in the samples. The present study shows that GAHT changes the spermatogonial stem cell niche by partially rejuvenating the somatic cells and inducing fibrotic processes. These findings are important to further understand how estrogens and testosterone suppression affect the testis environment, and in the case of orchidectomized testes as medical waste material, their potential use in research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89690">Binding of LncDACH1 to dystrophin impairs the membrane trafficking of Nav1.5 protein and increases ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Dystrophin is a critical interacting protein of Nav1.5 that determines its membrane anchoring in cardiomyocytes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of cardiac ion channels, while their influence on sodium channels remains unexplored. Our preliminary data showed that lncRNA-<i>Dachshund</i> homolog 1 (<i>lncDach1</i>) can bind to dystrophin, which drove us to investigate if <i>lncDach1</i> can regulate sodium channels by interfering with dystrophin. Western blot and immunofluorescent staining showed that cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of <i>lncDach1</i> (<i>lncDach1</i>-TG) reduced the membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, peak <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub> was reduced in the hearts of <i>lncDach1</i>-TG mice than wild-type (WT) controls. The opposite data of western blot, immunofluorescent staining and patch clamp were collected from <i>lncDach1</i> cardiomyocyte conditional knockout (<i>lncDach1</i>-cKO) mice. Moreover, increased ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility was observed in <i>lncDach1</i>-TG mice in vivo and ex vivo. The conservative fragment of <i>lncDach1</i> inhibited membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5, and promoted the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmia. Strikingly, activation of <i>Dystrophin</i> transcription by dCas9-SAM system in <i>lncDach1</i>-TG mice rescued the impaired membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5, and prevented the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, <i>lncDach1</i> was increased in transaortic constriction (TAC) induced failing hearts, which promoted the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmia. And the expression of <i>lncDach1</i> is regulated by hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase subunit beta (hadhb), which binds to <i>lncDach1</i> and decreases its stability. The human homologue of <i>lncDACH1</i> inhibited the membrane distribution of Nav1.5 in human iPS-differentiated cardiomyocytes. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of Nav1.5 membrane targeting and the development of ventricular arrhythmias.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98992">The phytoplasma SAP54 effector acts as a molecular matchmaker for leafhopper vectors by targeting plant MADS-box factor SVP</a></h4>

              
                Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed <i>svp null</i> mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91168">Recognition and cleavage of human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease</a></h4>

              
                The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup> or Nsp5) is critical for production of viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, also targets host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 is recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. TRMT1 installs the <i>N</i><sup>2</sup>,<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes cellular protein synthesis and redox homeostasis. We find that M<sup>pro</sup> can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain. Evolutionary analysis shows the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 is likely resistant to cleavage. TRMT1 proteolysis results in reduced tRNA binding and elimination of tRNA methyltransferase activity. We also determined the structure of an M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 peptide complex that shows how TRMT1 engages the M<sup>pro</sup> active site in an uncommon substrate binding conformation. Finally, enzymology and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated proteolysis following substrate binding. Together, these data provide new insights into substrate recognition by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> that could help guide future antiviral therapeutic development and show how proteolysis of TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs both TRMT1 tRNA binding and tRNA modification activity to disrupt host translation and potentially impact COVID-19 pathogenesis or phenotypes.

                Daily choices are determined by prior direct or indirect associations between low-salience cues and reinforcers. In this study, we used a mouse odor-taste sensory preconditioning task combined with genetic, intersectional and chemogenetic approaches to identify a novel brain circuit involved in mediated learning. We found that neuronal projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex to the basolateral amygdala are engaged during low-salience stimuli associations, which is essential for mediated learning formation.

">A stress-activated mid-insula to BNST pathway regulates susceptibility to abstinence-induced negative affect in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Stress is central to many neuropsychiatric conditions, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Stress influences the initiation and continued use of alcohol, the progression to AUD, and relapse. Identifying the neurocircuits activated during stress, and individual variability in these responses is critical for developing new treatment targets for AUD, particularly to mitigate stress-induced relapse. Using a longitudinal approach, this study examined the relationship between sub-chronic stress exposure and negative affect during protracted abstinence following chronic ethanol exposure. Sub-chronic restraint stress heightened negative affect-like behavior in protracted abstinence. Interestingly, this was driven by a subset of stress-susceptible female mice. We examined the mid-insula, a hub in the salience network, as a driver of this effect, given its role in emotional regulation and links to alcohol craving, consumption, and abstinence-induced negative affect. Mid-insula GCaMP fiber photometry revealed that GCaMP activity during stress exposure was positively correlated with activity during the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) two weeks into abstinence. A distinct subset of mice exhibited increasing activity during the consummatory phase, implicating the mid-insula as a neural basis for heightened negative affect in abstinence. Chemogenetic inhibition of mid-insula neurons projecting to the dorsal BNST during stress disrupted the emergence of stress susceptibility, highlighting this circuit as a key determinant of susceptibility to abstinence-induced negative affect. These outcomes were female-specific, addressing a critical gap in understanding AUD risk in women. Furthermore, female mice exhibited higher struggling behavior during stress than males. However, this effect was blocked in mice that had inhibition of the insula-BNST pathway during stress. By linking pre-alcohol stress response with abstinence outcomes, this work positions the insula-BNST pathway as a potential AUD circuit activity biomarker and therapeutic target.

">Human cortical dynamics reflect graded contributions of local geometry and network topography</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a physically embedded and heavily interconnected system that expresses neural rhythms across multiple time scales. While these dynamics result from the complex interplay of local and inter-regional factors, the relative contribution of such mechanisms across the cortex remains unclear. Our study explored geometric, microstructural, and connectome-level constraints on cortex-wide neural activity. We leveraged intracranial electroencephalography recordings to derive an intrinsic coordinate system of human cortical dynamics. Using multimodal neuroimaging, we could then demonstrate that these patterns were largely explainable by geometric properties indexed by inter-regional distance. However, dynamics in transmodal association regions were additionally explainable by incorporation of inter-regional microstructural similarity and connectivity information. Our findings were consistent when cross-referencing electroencephalography and imaging data from large-scale atlases and when using data obtained in the same individuals, suggesting subject-specificity and population-level generalizability. Together, our results support gradual shifts in the balance of local and macroscale constraints on cortical dynamics and highlight a key role of transmodal networks in inter-regional cortical coordination.

">Nucleus accumbens dopamine encodes the trace period during appetitive Pavlovian conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian conditioning tasks have been used to identify the neural systems involved with learning cue-outcome relationships. In delay conditioning, the presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) overlaps or co-terminates with the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US). Prior studies demonstrate that behavioral responding during delay conditioning is regulated by dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In particular, the dopamine response to the CS reflects the relative value of the upcoming reward in these tasks. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning involves a trace period that separates the end of the CS and the delivery of the US. While dopamine has been implicated in trace conditioning, no studies to date have examined how NAc dopamine responds to reward-related stimuli in these tasks. To address this, we developed a within-subject trace conditioning task where distinct audio CSs signaled either a short trace period (5s) or a long trace period (55s) prior to the delivery of a food reward. Male rats exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding and a faster latency to respond to the Short Trace CS relative to the Long Trace CS. Voltammetry recordings in the NAc found that dopamine levels to the CS increased on Short Trace trials but decreased on Long Trace trials. Conversely, US-evoked dopamine responses were greater on Long Trace trials relative to Short Trace trials. We found that the CS dopamine response correlated with the latency to respond and not to the level of conditioned responding. Furthermore, the relationship between CS dopamine and latency was best explained by an exponential function. Taken together, our results illustrate how CS-evoked dopamine signals in the NAc relate to behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, we find that trace period is encoded by the bidirectional NAc dopamine response to the CS during Pavlovian conditioning.

">Locally induced traveling waves generate globally observable traveling waves</a></h4>

              
                Cortical traveling waves have been proposed as a fundamental mechanism for neural communication and computation. Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of non-invasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor-array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (N=19, m/f) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, non-invasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.

">Human sleep spindles track experimentally excited brain circuits</a></h4>

              
                Spindles are hallmark oscillations during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. Together with slow oscillations (SOs), they are thought to play a mechanistic role in the consolidation of learned information. The quantity and spatial distribution of spindles has been linked to brain activity during learning before sleep and to memory performance after sleep. If spindles are drawn to cortical areas excited through pre-sleep learning tasks, this begs the question whether the spatial distribution of spindles is flexible, and whether their regional expression can also be manipulated with experimental brain stimulation. We used excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the left and right motor cortex in a repeated-measures experimental design. After stimulation, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep to test how local stimulation modulated the regional expression of sleep spindles. Indeed, we show that excitatory tDCS of local cortical sites before sleep biases the expression of spindles to the excited locations during subsequent sleep. No effects of localised tDCS excitation were seen for SOs. These results demonstrate that the spatial topography of sleep spindles is neither hard-wired nor random, with spindles being flexibly directed to exogenously excited cortical circuits.

">Intuitive sensorimotor decisions under risk take Newtonian physics into account</a></h4>

              
                The success of our interactions with objects in natural tasks depends on generating motor actions, which are subject to sensorimotor variability, the objects' physical properties, which are governed by the laws of kinematics, and the costs and benefits associated with the actions' outcomes. Therefore, such interactions jointly involve sensorimotor control, intuitive physics, and decision-making under risk. Here, we devised a mixed reality experiment, which allows investigating human behavior involving the interaction of all three of these cognitive faculties. Participants slid pucks to target areas associated with monetary rewards and losses within an immersive, naturalistic virtual environment. In this task, signal-dependent variability inherent in motor control interacts non-linearly with the physical relationships governing objects' motion under friction. By systematically testing generative models of behavior incorporating different assumptions about how participants may generate the slides, we find decisive evidence that participants' decision under risk readily took their individual motor variability and Newtonian physics into account to gain monetary rewards without relying on trial by trial learning.

                Understanding how the human brain processes body movements is essential for clarifying the mechanisms underlying social cognition and interaction. This study investigates the encoding of biomechanically possible and impossible body movements in occipitotemporal cortex using ultra-high field 7Tesla fMRI. By predicting the response of single voxels to impossible/possible movements using a computational modelling approach, our findings demonstrate that a combination of postural, biomechanical, and categorical features significantly predicts neural responses in the ventral visual cortex, particularly within the extrastriate body area (EBA), underscoring the brain's sensitivity to biomechanical plausibility. Lastly, these findings highlight the functional heterogeneity of EBA, with specific regions (middle/superior occipital gyri) focusing on detailed biomechanical features and anterior regions (lateral occipital sulcus and inferior temporal gyrus) integrating more abstract, categorical information.

">Loss of Elp3 impairs the maturation tempo of brain ependymal cells</a></h4>

              
                Conditional deletion of Elp3 in the mouse forebrain leads to microcephaly at birth. In this study, we demonstrate that these mice also develop postnatal hydrocephalus, associated with an enlargement of the brain ventricles. In wild-type mice, ependymal motile cilia are properly aligned to facilitate the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles. Our findings reveal that Elp3 loss induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and upregulation of ATF4 expression in ependymal cell progenitors, which compromises Notch signaling and accelerates their maturation. This is accompanied by a disruption in the establishment of rotational and translational polarities of the motile cilia of maturing ependymal cells, resulting in disorganized cilia bundles. Collectively, these molecular abnormalities lead to the premature and abnormal development of ependymal cells, culminating in cilia beating dysfunction, impaired CSF clearance, and the development of hydrocephalus.

">Using magnetoencephalography to track the propagation of 40 Hz invisible spectral flicker</a></h4>

              
                Brain stimulation with novel 40 Hz invisible spectral flicker (ISF) has been proposed as a therapy for Alzheimer's disease, with leading hypotheses suggesting local promotion of glymphatic clearance of amyloid as the mechanism of action. Neural signals in the gamma range and their spatial propagation over the brain can be tracked using magnetoencephalography (MEG) with high temporal and good spatial detail. However, stimulation with 40 Hz ISF requires specialised hardware which causes electromagnetic interference (EMI) with MEG equipment. MEG measures the tiny magnetic fields of the brain, which are easily distorted by external magnetic fields. Using MEG to track the propagation of 40 Hz ISF requires multiple modifications to the experimental setup. These include, at least 1) an experimental design that promotes modulation of the neural signal, but not the artifact, 2) removal of all electronics not strictly necessary for light production from the stimulators, and 3) signal processing for 40 Hz EMI artifact suppression. Here, we present an MEG study on the cortical propagation of 40 Hz ISF. In two experiments, we investigate the modulation that visual and non-visual cognitive tasks have on the power and propagation of cortical activity induced by 40 Hz ISF. With the chosen experimental setup and design, the 40 Hz EMI artifact could not be entirely disentangled from the neural signal of interest, thus rendering inference on the spatial propagation of the 40 Hz signal impossible. Further improvements need to be implemented in a follow-up experimental design. We present potential solutions to allow for future investigation of 40 Hz ISF with MEG.

">Stress, Epigenetic Remodeling and FKBP51: Pathways to Chronic Pain Vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                Stress is thought to contribute to the persistence of pain and comorbid anxiety, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In our pre-clinical model, sub-chronic stress exacerbated subsequently induced inflammatory pain and accelerated the development of comorbid anxiety. DNA methylation analysis of spinal cord tissue after stress exposure revealed hypomethylation in the Fkbp5 promoter site for the canonical FKBP51 transcript and other stress-related genes. However, most epigenetic changes in key regulatory regions did not correlate with changes in gene expression assessed by RNA sequencing, suggesting that stress exposure had remodeled the epigenome without altering gene activity and primed genes for hyper-responsiveness to future challenges. FKBP51 inhibition during stress exposure reduced the exacerbation of inflammatory pain by stress and reversed several stress-induced DNA methylation changes in promoter regions of genes associated with stress and nociception, including Rtn4, Cdk5 and Nrxn1, but not Fkbp5. These results indicate that sub-chronic stress leads to the hypomethylation of Fkbp5 and increased susceptibility to chronic pain driven by FKBP51, but reversing Fkbp5 hypomethylation is not necessary to prevent chronic pain vulnerability, which is likely driven by complex epigenetic regulation of multiple stress-regulated genes.

">Identification of low copy synaptic glycine receptors in the mouse brain using single molecule localisation microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord, where they regulate motor and sensory processes. GlyRs are clustered at the post-synaptic membrane by a strong interaction of the beta subunit with the scaffold protein gephyrin. Even though GlyRbeta mRNA is highly expressed throughout the brain, the existence of synaptic GlyRs remains controversial as there is little conclusive evidence using conventional fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Here we exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the presence of GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the brain, focusing on several areas in the telencephalon, including hippocampus and striatum. Making use of a knock-in mouse model expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRbeta we identified low-copy GlyR complexes at inhibitory synapses in different hippocampal regions. Dual-colour SMLM further revealed that the sparse GlyRs are integrated within the post-synaptic gephyrin domain, pointing to a possible role in maintaining the structural integrity of inhibitory synapses. In contrast, we found functionally relevant numbers of synaptic GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the ventral striatum. Our results further highlight the strength of SMLM to detect few and sparsely distributed synaptic molecules in complex samples and to analyse their organisation with high spatial precision.

">Dynamic Transcriptomic Remodeling in Human Neural Progenitor Cells Reveals Mechanisms for Vision Preservation in Retinitis Pigmentosa Model</a></h4>

              
                Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) have shown promise in slowing down retinal degeneration in animal models and are currently being tested in clinical trials for treating retinitis pigmentosa (RP). However, the status of grafted hNPCs and their interaction with host retinal cells over time is largely unknown. Here, we investigated single-cell transcriptomic changes in grafted hNPCs and host retinal cells following injection into a rodent model for RP. Grafted hNPCs and host retinal cells undergo dynamic transcriptomic changes in the degenerative retinal environment. Grafted hNPCs protect vision through multiple mechanisms, including trophic factor support, modulation of metabolic activity, reduction of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, alongside extracellular matrix remodeling. CellChat analysis revealed a progressive decline in intercellular signaling and communication strength between hNPCs and host retinal cells over time. This study indicates that enhancing trophic factor supports and improving host retinal environment are key targets to enable long-term vision preservation.

">Intrastriatal delivery of a zinc finger protein targeting the mutant HTT gene obviates lipid phenotypes in zQ175DN HD mice</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Reducing the burden of mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) protein in brain cells is a strategy for treating Huntington's disease (HD). However, it is still unclear what pathological changes can be reproducibly reversed by mHTT lowering. We previously found that lipid changes that occur with HD progression could be prevented by attenuating HTT transcription of the mutant allele in a genetic mouse model (LacQ140) with inducible whole body lowering. Here, we tested whether intrastriatal injection of a therapeutic capable of repressing the mutant HTT allele with expanded CAG can provide similar protection against lipid changes in HD mice with a deletion of neo cassette (zQ175DN). Methods: Wild-type or zQ175DN mice were injected with AAV9 bearing a cDNA for a zinc finger protein (ZFP) which preferentially targets mutant HTT (ZFP-HTT) to repress transcription (Zeitler et al., 2019). Proteins were analyzed using western blot, capillary electrophoresis, and nitrocellulose filtration methods. Lipid analyses were conducted by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Somatic expansion index was assessed using capillary gel electrophoresis of PCR products. Conclusions: Lowering mHTT levels by 43% for 4 months prevented numerous changes in lipids of caudate-putamen in zQ175DN mice. Our data support the idea that mHTT lowering can provide meaningful benefits and support brain health. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that analyzing lipid signatures is a valuable method for evaluating potential therapies in a preclinical model of HD.

">Attentional cueing effects are reversed during locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Everyday human cognition and behaviour evolved in dynamic and ever-changing environments, but static paradigms still dominate experimental research despite concerns about generalisability of the results. In the case of attention, traditional stationary studies show that pre-orienting attention with spatial cues leads to faster, more accurate responses. However, how movement and environmental features shape such attentional processes in everyday behaviour remains unknown. Here we show that active movement through curved corridors reverses the typical spatial attention effect, with faster response times and higher accuracy for stimuli incongruent to implicit spatial cues provided by the movement direction, contradicting previous findings from static settings. We found that early (N1) and late (P3) attention-related electrophysiological responses were modulated by environmental features and motor demands. The posterior N1-component, reflecting visuo-spatial attention, showed decreasing amplitudes as turning angles and motor-control demands increased for congruent stimuli appearing on the side of the turning direction. Similarly, the P3-complex varied with motor and visual processing demands for congruent stimuli, showing decreased amplitudes as motor-control demands increased. We propose that congruent stimuli, displayed against a dynamically changing visual context, increase pulvino-cortical processing load and slowing early visual processing that affect behavioural responses. Incongruent stimuli, however, are displayed against a predictable context allowing faster target processing. These findings challenge attentional mechanisms' assumed consistency across static and dynamic settings, revealing instead their dependence on behavioural and environmental context. We advocate for naturalistic paradigms, arguing that moving beyond static experiments could reshape core views on cognition and behaviour.

">Early amyloid spine response and impaired synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in human biopsies with Alzheimer's Disease-related pathology</a></h4>

              
                Studies of neuronal functions during the pathological progression of Alzheimers disease (AD) in humans are limited due to the lack of live human brain tissue from patients with AD. To address this gap, we have established an exceptional approach to study the electrophysiological properties and cell morphologies of human neurons in acute slices obtained from cortical biopsies of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Histological examination of Broadman area 8-9 cortical biopsies from these patients have revealed that approximately 40% of the patients show signs of early AD-related pathology in the form of low to moderate, often fleecy beta-amyloid (A{beta}) deposits and additional, occasional tau in 10% of the cases. Thus, the iNPH brain biopsies, obtained during the shunt surgery to treat the patients, offer a unique window to investigate how existing AD-related pathology alters the operational properties of human cortical neurons. Here we carried out integrative analysis of human neuronal electrophysiology at single neuron and network level followed by subsequent cellular morphological reconstructions to register the primary pathological changes in neuronal functions in correlation with existing AD-related pathology. The presence of A{beta} plaques induced a decrease in basal excitatory synaptic activity in pyramidal neurons residing on supragranular layers of the cortex. These neurons received less of L1-induced inhibition and appeared hyperexcitable in response to application to NMDA in multielectrode array (MEA) recordings. Interestingly, the global spine density of supraganular pyramidal neurons was increased in biopsies with AD-related pathology. The increase in spine density was coincidental with a partial recovery of excitatory transmission (frequency but not amplitude), of L1-induced inhibition in supragranular layers pyramidal neurons and of NMDA induced supragranular firing (but not of bursting hyperexcitability) indicating a potential differential effect of tau in the presence of A{beta} on the progression of neuronal functions. Despite the partial renormalization of deficits seen in cases with A{beta} pathology only, pyramidal neurons in cases with both A{beta} and tau exhibited more consistent deficits in the intrinsic neuronal properties with increase in sodium and potassium currents and a strong propensity to bursting under NMDA stimulation. We conclude that complex mechanisms operate in response to accumulation of A{beta} and tau including re-structuring of the apparatus of synaptic transmission and consolidation of a hyperexcitable supragranular cortical network phenotype. The observed changes in spine density and synaptic activity are reminiscent of parallels seen in homeostatic plasticity and synaptic scaling and may depend on strong interactions with the local microenvironment (astrocytes and microglia). This is the first study to report the impact of AD-related pathology on single-neuron operational properties and morphology in humans.

">Mapping Early Brain Maturation: Anatomical Substrates of Cortical Connectivity Shifts in Neonates</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the early development of brain connectivities is essential for unraveling the mechanisms of brain maturation. In this study, we utilized diffusion MRI data from 242 term neonates to chart the developmental trajectory of cortical connectivities in infants. We quantified interareal connectivity variations and identified three distinct global connectopies (GCs) along the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes through gradient mapping techniques. A pivotal age-dependent shift between the dorsoventral and mediolateral GCs occurred at 40 postmenstrual weeks, which was diminished by virtual thalamic fiber lesions, underscoring the critical role of thalamic projections. Longitudinal analysis disclosed delayed structural connectivity pattern development in preterm infants who failed to exhibit the anticipated shift. This research clarifies the topographic principles that shape infant brain organization and emphasizes the influence of thalamic connectivity on early brain development. Our findings elucidate the anatomical underpinnings of early brain development, providing critical insights into the formation of cortical hierarchies and highlighting the influence of thalamic connectivity on developmental trajectories, essential for understanding typical brain growth and the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Noncanonical Short-Latency Auditory Pathway Directly Activates Deep Cortical Layers</a></h4>

              
                Auditory processing in the cerebral cortex is considered to begin with thalamocortical inputs to layer 4 (L4) of the primary auditory cortex (A1). In this canonical model, A1 L4 inputs initiate a hierarchical cascade, with higher-order cortices receiving pre-processed information for the slower integration of complex sounds. Here, we identify alternative ascending pathways in mice that bypass A1 and directly reach multiple layers of the secondary auditory cortex (A2), indicating parallel activation of these areas alongside sequential information processing. We found that L6 of both A1 and A2 receive short-latency (<10 ms) sound inputs, comparable in speed to the canonical A1 L4 input but transmitted through higher-order thalamic nuclei. Additionally, A2 L4 is innervated by a caudal subdivision within the traditionally defined primary thalamus, which we now identify as belonging to the non-primary system. Notably, both thalamic regions receive projections from distinct subdivisions of the higher-order inferior colliculus, which in turn are directly innervated by cochlear nucleus neurons. These findings reveal alternative ascending pathways reaching A2 at L4 and L6 via secondary subcortical structures. Thus, higher-order auditory cortex processes both slow, pre-processed information and rapid, direct sensory inputs, enabling parallel and distributed processing of fast sensory information across cortical areas.

">NMDA-dependent coplasticity in VIP interneuron-driven inhibitory circuits</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory plasticity is emerging as a key regulator of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, a fundamental determinant of brain network dynamics. While significant progress has been made in understanding inhibitory plasticity at synapses targeting excitatory principal neurons (I - E), the mechanisms and functional implications of plasticity at interneuron-interneuron (I - I) synapses remain largely unexplored. Herein, we investigated the properties and plasticity of inhibitory inputs from vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons onto stratum oriens interneurons (soINs) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Using optogenetics, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and morphological reconstructions, we characterized the kinetics, short-term plasticity, and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term plasticity at VIP[-&gt;]soIN synapses in two distinct soIN subtypes: fast-spiking (FS) and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM)/bistratified interneurons. Optogenetically evoked VIP - soIN IPSCs showed faster rise times and slower decay kinetics in FS interneurons compared to OLM/bistratified cells, although both subtypes exhibited similar short-term plasticity profiles. Brief NMDA receptor activation (1 min) induced long-term depression (iLTD) at VIP - OLM/bistratified synapses, but not at VIP - FS synapses, underscoring subtype-specific plasticity. However, prolonged NMDA exposure (2 min) elicited iLTD in both interneuron subtypes. Interestingly, excitatory inputs to soINs demonstrated NMDA-induced long-term potentiation (E - I LTP) after brief NMDA exposure, but not after prolonged application. Notably, coplasticity analysis in individual soINs revealed asymmetric co-expression of I - I LTD and E - I LTP in OLM/bistratified interneurons. In contrast, FS interneurons exhibited a duration-dependent transition between asymmetric and symmetric coplasticity. These findings reveal a target-cell-specific landscape of inhibitory I - I plasticity and its co-expression with excitatory plasticity, highlighting VIP interneurons as key modulators of E/I balance within local hippocampal circuits.

">Dorsal hippocampus mediates light-tone sensory preconditioning task in mice</a></h4>

              
                Daily choices are often influenced by environmental cues that are not directly linked to reinforcers. This process is known as higher-order conditioning and can be measured using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm requires the repeated and simultaneous presentation of two low-salience stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase where one stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The outcome is a conditioned response (i.e. freezing response) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we set up a successful light-tone sensory preconditioning task in male and female mice. Sex differences were seen on the number of conditioning sessions required to acquire mediated learning and in the behavioral responses observed in certain control experimental groups. We used in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the activity of hippocampal neurons in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus when associations between low-salience stimuli and reinforcers occur. Finally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to assess the role of these two hippocampal subregions in mediated learning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive cells mediate the encoding of low-salience stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we implemented a novel light-tone sensory preconditioning protocol in mice that allowed us to detect sex differences and to further elucidate the role of particular hippocampal subregions and cell types in regulating these complex cognitive processes.

	<p>Background: Decoding motor intentions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a critical component of motor imagery-based brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (MI&amp;amp;ndash;BCIs). In traditional EEG signal classification, effectively utilizing the valuable information contained within the electroencephalogram is crucial. Objectives: To further optimize the use of information from various domains, we propose a novel framework based on multi-domain feature rotation transformation and stacking ensemble for classifying MI tasks. Methods: Initially, we extract the features of Time Domain, Frequency domain, Time-Frequency domain, and Spatial Domain from the EEG signals, and perform feature selection for each domain to identify significant features that possess strong discriminative capacity. Subsequently, local rotation transformations are applied to the significant feature set to generate a rotated feature set, enhancing the representational capacity of the features. Next, the rotated features were fused with the original significant features from each domain to obtain composite features for each domain. Finally, we employ a stacking ensemble approach, where the prediction results of base classifiers corresponding to different domain features and the set of significant features undergo linear discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction, yielding discriminative feature integration as input for the meta-classifier for classification. Results: The proposed method achieves average classification accuracies of 92.92%, 89.13%, and 86.26% on the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV Dataset I, and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, respectively. Conclusions: Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper outperforms several existing MI classification methods, such as the Common Time-Frequency-Spatial Patterns and the Selective Extract of the Multi-View Time-Frequency Decomposed Spatial, in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains a prevalent issue among people with HIV (PWH) despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART). The pathogenesis of HIV-associated NCI is linked to chronic neuroinflammation caused by HIV, even in those with successful viral suppression. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), a protein involved in inflammatory and metabolic stress responses, has emerged as a key player and potential biomarker for various neurological conditions. This study investigates the relationship between GDF15 expression and HIV-associated NCI. Methods: PWH from the California NeuroAIDS Tissue Network (CNTN) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological exams within 12 months before death and were categorized based on cognitive performance. We examined GDF15 levels in their CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) and brain tissues using immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, double immunolabeling, and ELISA. Results: The cohort was of a similar age across HIV-associated NCI statuses (mean = 40.5), with a predominance of males (77%). The mean plasma viral load was 3.56 log10 copies/mL for Neurocognitively Unimpaired (NUI) PWH and 5.38 log10 copies/mL for people with HIV-associated NCI. GDF15 protein levels were significantly elevated in the frontal cortices of PWH with NCI compared to NUI PWH. Conclusions: The findings indicate that GDF15 may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated NCI, possibly through neuroinflammatory mechanisms. The strong association between GDF15 levels and cognitive impairment severity suggests its potential as a biomarker for the early detection and monitoring of NCI in PWH.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Based on previous data reporting the status of health professionals&amp;amp;rsquo; training about sleep clinical psychophysiology, insomnia, and its treatment in the US and Canada, this paper aims at providing a snapshot of the Italian situation, considering health professionals qualified to offer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Adding information on different countries is important, as national health systems differ significantly, and distinct evidence-based pathways for change may be proposed. Methods: Two hundred and thirteen CBT professionals (180 females; 33 males) answered a 5 min survey about their training and experience in recognizing and treating behavioral sleep disorders in their practice. The questionnaire was diffused through the mailing list of the Italian Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy Society (Societ&amp;amp;agrave; Italiana di Terapia Comportamentale e Cognitiva, SITCC) throughout December 2023 and January 2024. Results: A total of 213 participants completed the survey. Only a minor proportion of respondents (37.1%) reported having received training for diagnosis and treatment of insomnia or other behavioral sleep disorders. Familiarity with psychological therapeutics for sleep was mainly associated with knowledge of sleep hygiene rules, relaxation, and mindfulness techniques, but not with core CBT strategies for insomnia (i.e., sleep restriction and stimulus control) and sleep regulation. The less familiar therapeutics were those for pediatric insomnia. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight scarce knowledge and consideration of sleep problems in CBT practice in Italy. As insomnia is prevalent, an independent mental disorder, and a predictor for mental and somatic comorbid conditions, these findings underscore an urgency to enlarge and strengthen CBT professionals&amp;amp;rsquo; training on sleep psychophysiology, sleep clinical psychology, insomnia, behavioral sleep problems, and their treatment.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Clarity AD phase III trial showed that lecanemab reduced amyloid markers in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and resulted in less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo. Herein, we aimed to characterize amyloid-β (Aβ) protofibril (PF) captured by lecanemab in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living participants with different stages in AD, which enable an enhanced understanding of the dynamic changes of lecanemab-associated Aβ-PF (Lec-PF) in vivo.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We newly developed a unique and highly sensitive immunoassay method using lecanemab that selectively captures Lec-PF. The CSF level of Lec-PF, Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau 217, total tau, and neurogranin were measured in Japanese participants (n = 163). The participants in this study consisted of 48 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-negative (CU–), 8 cognitively impaired diagnosed as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, 9 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-positive (CU+), 34 Aβ-positive with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 64 Aβ-positive with AD dementia (AD+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The CSF Lec-PF levels significantly increased in the groups of MCI+ and AD+ compared with CU– group. Notably, CSF Lec-PF showed modest correlation with plaque-associated biomarkers in Aβ-positive participants and stronger correlation with neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as CSF total tau and neurogranin, suggesting that CSF Lec-PF levels proximally reflect neurodegeneration as well as the amount of senile amyloid plaques.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first report describing Aβ-PF species captured by lecanemab in human CSF and supporting that Lec-PF is correlated with neurodegeneration in AD and may explain the mechanism of the clinical effect of lecanemab. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Cuprizone (CPZ) is a widely used toxin that induces demyelinating diseases in animal models, producing multiple sclerosis (MS)-like pathology in rodents. CPZ is one of the few toxins that triggers demyelination and subsequent remyelination following the cessation of its application. This study examines the functional consequences of CPZ-induced demyelination and the subsequent recovery of neural communication within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with a particular focus on interhemispheric connectivity via the corpus callosum (CC). By employing wide-field, high-speed, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we were able to provide real-time mapping of neural activity in the ACC of CPZ-fed mice. Although we could not record physiological signals from the CC, the results demonstrated a notable impairment in interhemispheric connections within the ACC via the CC, with the most pronounced loss observed in a specific coronal slice among a series of slices examined. Notably, the latency of neural signal propagation remained largely unaltered despite connectivity loss, indicating that demyelination affects the extent, rather than the temporal dynamics, of neural communication. It is noteworthy that while functional connectivity appeared to recover fully after the cessation of CPZ, histological analysis revealed only partial recovery of myelination, indicating a discrepancy between functional and structural recovery. These findings enhance our understanding of how demyelination affects the ACC's role in orchestrating neural activity, particularly in light of the slice-specific nature of interhemispheric communication impairments. These findings offer new insights into MS pathology, particularly regarding the role of the CC in interhemispheric communication and potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.

                Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intradialytic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension are the common complications. The study aimed to collect and assess intradialytic Blood Pressure (BP) complications and their association with BP medications. Methods This was a prospective observational study, conducted at the hemodialysis center in a teaching hospital in the UAE, that provide a specialist’s care for the patients receiving ongoing hemodialysis. Patient demographics, medications used, lab data and the peridialytic BP (pre-, intra-, and post-) dialytic BP were collected for a period of 6 months. SPSS Version 29, Armonk, NY was used for statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test and Fischer’s Exact test were used to compare the association between categorical variables to intradialytic hypertension and hypotension. Binary logistic regression was used to find the effect of predictive variables to the presence or absence of intradialytic complications. Results Blood pressure data was collected from 47 hemodialysis patients for a total of 2616 hemodialysis sessions during the 6 months study period. Non-dialysable antihypertensives were predominantly used. Beta-blockers (68%) and calcium channel blockers (66%) were the commonly used drug classes. Intradialytic hypertension events were diagnosed in 49 (1.9%) hemodialysis sessions and intradialytic hypotension was diagnosed in 23 (0.9%) hemodialysis sessions. Chi-square test showed association of antihypertensive medication use to the occurrence of intradialytic hypertension; especially ARBs, and alpha-1 blockers. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use were associated with decreased number of intradialytic hypertension events (p-value <0.05). Regression showed broad confidence intervals. On the other hand, antihypertensive medication use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions Even though antihypertensive medications showed varying occurance of intradialytic hypertension, the results are inconclusive due to large confidence intervals that could be due to the presence of colliniarity between the variables. Future studies are required in larger populations.

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment is a strategy commonly employed by indoor/vertical farms to improve crop yields. Artificially elevating the CO2 concentration within an enclosed growth space results in improved photosynthetic efficiency, and therefore improved crop growth rates and flavor profiles. Alcohol fermentation provides a steady stream of CO2 that is typically emitted to the atmosphere as a by-product. To evaluate the feasibility of using fermentation off-gas as a source for indoor CO2 enrichment, spinach plants were randomly assigned to 2 growth chambers. The control chamber was maintained under ambient CO2 concentrations, while the treatment chamber was piped onto a flow control system capable of delivering CO2 from a beer fermentation vessel to the growth chamber to maintain CO2 levels at a setpoint of 1200 parts-per-million (ppm). CO2 flow was diverted to the growth chamber when levels were below 1200 ppm, and to an external exhaust when chamber levels were above 1200 ppm, with the flow control device measuring internal CO2 concentrations and responding accordingly every 6 seconds. Standardized batches of beer were used to replenish the fermentation source to maintain continuous fermentation and CO2 off-gas production. The CO2 flow control device successfully maintained a strong oscillation of CO2 around the 1200 ppm setpoint within the treatment growth chamber for the duration of the 50-day growth period. Spinach plants grown in the treatment chamber produced significantly more fresh biomass (5.456 g vs. 2.888 g), dry biomass (0.5711 g vs. 0.271 g), and significantly longer leaf lengths (231.0 mm vs. 159.9 mm) than their control chamber counterparts, respectively. This represents an 89% increase in fresh spinach crop yield within a controlled indoor growth environment.

                Background The successful execution of Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policies is crucial for developing a strong Regional Innovation System (RIS) in Ethiopia, which is essential for promoting economic growth and enhancing competitiveness. Methods This study utilized a document review approach to critically analyze Ethiopia’s current STI policies and legal frameworks within the context of the Regional Innovation System (RIS). Results The findings indicate potential solutions to strengthen Ethiopia’s regional innovation system, including increasing funding for research and development (R&D), fostering better collaboration between universities and industries, and cultivating an entrepreneurial culture. The analysis reveals that Ethiopia possesses significant opportunities to enhance its STI capabilities due to its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and growing governmental and non-governmental support. However, it also highlights critical implementation gaps in STI policies, such as inadequate infrastructure, poor coordination among stakeholders, weak university-industry partnerships, and limited R&D investment. Conclusion Ethiopia’s STI policies and legal frameworks are essential for driving economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness by fostering an environment that encourages collaboration and technology transfer. Nevertheless, the country faces challenges in effectively implementing these comprehensive policies due to existing barriers like policy gaps and insufficient institutional support. To strengthen its National Innovation System and promote sustainable economic development, Ethiopia must assess current opportunities, address these obstacles, and explore alternative policies that can enhance its STI capabilities.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of specific covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a tertiary care hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Invasive sino-orbital fungal infection is an uncommon, yet severe condition that is rare among immunocompetent individuals, with most cases typically occurring in those with compromised immune systems. In this study, we report the case of a 5-month-old immunocompetent infant who exhibited persistent dacryocystitis despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, the patient developed ethmoiditis, orbital subperiosteal abscess, and ulceration of the hard palate. Mycological and histological samples were collected from the affected area. The combination of microscopy and PCR amplification allowed for the identification of the fungal agent Candida tropicalis. The patient underwent sinus surgery and surgical debridement, along with antifungal therapy. The treatment was successful, and the follow-up was uneventful for up to 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of invasive sino-orbital candidiasis in an immunocompetent infant with dacryocystitis as the entry point. This study explores the clinical features, management approaches, and outcomes of this potentially fatal disease.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and web-based platforms were widely used to promote medicinal substances. To assess community perspectives on drug promotions on social media, we conducted qualitative research using three workshops. The workshops aimed to highlight the public understanding of drug advertising focusing on community perceptions of social media drug promotions, their risks and benefits. Discussions were conducted on the importance of adhering to national drug regulation policies and the World Health Organisation ethical criteria for promotion, advertisement, and publicity of medicines. Methods Participants for the workshops were purposively sampled from local community youth groups and healthcare facilities. Two workshops included ten young adults aged 18-35, while the third workshop involved three healthcare professionals and one traditional healer. Results The study participants’ highlighted the value of honesty and trust in the drug promotions.

                Background This article introduces the concept of fuzzy pseudo-TM subalgebra (FPTMSA) of pseudo-TM algebra (PTMA). This study explores the relationship between FPTMSAs and their level sets within the context of PTMA. It further investigates the homomorphic behavior of FPTMSAs under various algebraic operations, thereby providing a foundation for further exploration of the algebraic structure of fuzzy pseudo-ideals within PTMAs. Methods The concept of level sets for FPTMSAs is defined and examined, highlighting their role in characterizing these subalgebras within a PTMA. This study explores the behavior of FPTMSAs under homomorphisms, considering both homomorphic images (HI) and inverse images (II) of FPTMSAs in PTMAs. In addition, the composition of epimorphic images and inverse images of FPTMSAs is discussed. The study also considers the properties of FPTMSAs under Cartesian products (CPs), demonstrating that the Cartesian product of two FPTMSAs remains an FPTMSA. Results This study establishes several key properties of FPTMSAs in PTMAs, particularly focusing on their behavior under homomorphisms, epimorphisms, and Cartesian products. Specifically, this study demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two FPTMSAs results in another FPTMSA. Additionally, this study examines the relationships between the homomorphic image and inverse image of FPTMSAs and presents further algebraic results related to these concepts. Conclusions The article concludes by highlighting the significant role of FPTMSAs in the structure of PTMAs, particularly in their interaction with homomorphisms, epimorphisms, and Cartesian products. The results suggest that the FPTMSAs are robust under various algebraic operations. Future work will extend these concepts to intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo-TM subalgebra within PTMAs with the goal of uncovering new algebraic insights and results.

                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Although the involvement of this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells has been documented, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74, and 78, we observed NOTCH1 mRNA expression in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 locus was accompanied by transitions in its mRNA expression. Importantly, chromatin accessibility in the region upstream of NOTCH1 depended on the differentiated cell types. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulation may exist.

                Abstract* Isthmocele, or uterine niche, is a defect in the anterior wall of the uterine isthmus, often following a cesarean section. It can lead to complications such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, and pregnancy risks. This case report describes a successful live pregnancy after isthmocele repair and embryo transfer. A 28-year-old woman (para 1, living 1) presented with prolonged periods, dysmenorrhea, and secondary infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a large isthmocele and intra-cavitary uterine fluid. The patient underwent ovarian stimulation using an antagonist protocol twice, retrieving oocytes and freezing nine embryos. She later had laparoscopic isthmocele repair at another facility. Upon returning for frozen embryo transfer, irregular bleeding and dysmenorrhea persisted. Repeat ultrasound showed a small cesarean defect (4x3 mm), fluid in the endometrial cavity, and hyperechoic endometrium. Fluid aspiration was performed, followed by the transfer of a grade AA embryo. Although conception occurred, it was a biochemical pregnancy with a βhCG level of 12.43 mIU/ml. Due to a persistent scar defect and endometrial cavity fluid, the patient underwent hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and minimal resection of the defect. Three months later, a frozen embryo transfer of a grade AB embryo was performed. This resulted in a viable pregnancy, confirmed by a βhCG level of 364 mIU/ml. The pregnancy progressed without complications, and at 36+3 weeks, the patient delivered a healthy baby via planned cesarean section. This case underscores the importance of diagnosing and managing isthmocele in infertility patients. Surgical repair can restore normal uterine anatomy and enhance the success of assisted reproductive techniques like embryo transfer.

                Introduction Burnout is a syndrome resulting from unsuccessful stress management in the workplace, and is characterized by three dimensions: energy depletion, reduced professional efficacy, and feelings of negativism. Background Studies have confirmed that burnout causes deterioration in teamwork and job satisfaction and negatively impacts and compromises services. Many studies have examined the impact of burnout on health. Aim This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the rate of burnout among hospital pharmacists working in Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. Method The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals was used to assess burnout. The survey measured three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement. In addition, pharmacists were asked questions regarding their demographic years of practice and qualifications. The surveys were distributed to inpatients, discharge/emergency, outpatients, and clinical pharmacies. The data were collected over two weeks and analyzed. Results Sixty-eight of the 90 pharmacists participated in this study. The response rate was 75.5%. Seventeen pharmacists were considered to have high burnout as they had both high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization scores. Two pharmacists were considered to have moderate burnout, as they had moderate emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement. Only 17 pharmacists reported a low level of burnout. Conclusion The study revealed that 25% of the pharmacists had high burnout rates. Although statistically insignificant (P > 0.05), all pharmacists with high burnout were female and working in different pharmacy settings. Moreover, an additional 25% experienced low burnout, and 3% had moderate burnout levels. The remaining items were difficult to classify because they did not fit the Maslach definition of high, moderate, or low burnout. Further investigation is needed to identify the levels and causes of burnout among Sheikh Khalifa Medical City pharmacists.

                Background Telekyanmar (Telehealth), one of the telemedicine services in Myanmar, was initiated a few months after the military coup and amidst the onset of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The program aims to address the urgent requirement for accessible medical services for Myanmar’s vulnerable population. Given the critical importance of both clients’ and providers’ satisfaction in the success of telemedicine services, this study aims to evaluate clients’ and providers’ satisfaction regarding the telehealth services offered by the Telekyanmar project in Myanmar. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2023 to September 2023 by utilizing a quantitative research method. Data were collected online through a structured questionnaire. The clients who have received health care services and clinicians who are working at Telekyanmar clinics during the study period were included in the study. Data management and analysis were done by using R software (https://www.r-project.org/). Results A total of 306 clients and 79 clinicians were included in the assessment. The mean age of the clients and clinicians were 33.2±13.6 years and 35.6±6.8 years, respectively. Over 85% of the clients and 58.2% of clinicians were residing inside the country. Clients’ satisfaction on various aspects of Telekyanmar services were assessed, with the question regarding “health staff respect for privacy” receiving the highest proportion of “good” and “excellent” responses at 96.1%. Regarding overall treatment experience, 96.7% of clients reported being “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the Telekyanmar services. Overall satisfaction was reported by 88.6% of clinicians. Specifically, over 87% of clinicians reported their satisfaction on “communication with patients”, 79.7% satisfied with “quality of clinical consultation”, and 78.5% satisfied with “treatment prescription”. Conclusions The findings indicated that majority of the clients and clinicians expressed their satisfaction with the Telekyanmar services, which was established to address the healthcare needs of people in Myanmar after the military coup.

                <p>by Chuanmei Bi, Yong Shi, Junfeng Xia, Zhen Liang, Zhiqiang Wu, Kai Xu, Na Cheng</p>

Synonymous mutations, once considered neutral, are now understood to have significant implications for a variety of diseases, particularly cancer. It is indispensable to identify these driver synonymous mutations in human cancers, yet current methods are constrained by data limitations. In this study, we initially investigate the impact of sequence-based features, including DNA shape, physicochemical properties and one-hot encoding of nucleotides, and deep learning-derived features from pre-trained chemical molecule language models based on BERT. Subsequently, we propose EPEL, an effect predictor for synonymous mutations employing ensemble learning. EPEL combines five tree-based models and optimizes feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy. Notably, the incorporation of DNA shape features and deep learning-derived features from chemical molecule represents a pioneering effect in assessing the impact of synonymous mutations in cancer. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, EPEL demonstrates superior performance on independent test datasets. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a significant correlation between effect scores and patient outcomes across various cancer types. Interestingly, while deep learning methods have shown promise in other fields, their DNA sequence representations do not significantly enhance the identification of driver synonymous mutations in this study. Overall, we anticipate that EPEL will facilitate researchers to more precisely target driver synonymous mutations. EPEL is designed with flexibility, allowing users to retrain the prediction model and generate effect scores for synonymous mutations in human cancers. A user-friendly web server for EPEL is available at http://ahmu.EPEL.bio/.

T cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with peptides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.

                <p>by Francisco Páscoa dos Santos, Paul F. M. J. Verschure</p>

Although the primary function of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis is the maintenance of mean firing rates, the conjugation of multiple homeostatic mechanisms is thought to be pivotal to ensuring edge-of-bifurcation dynamics in cortical circuits. However, computational studies on E-I homeostasis have focused solely on the plasticity of inhibition, neglecting the impact of different modes of E-I homeostasis on cortical dynamics. Therefore, we investigate how the diverse mechanisms of E-I homeostasis employed by cortical networks shape oscillations and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics. Using the Wilson-Cowan model, we explore how distinct modes of E-I homeostasis maintain stable firing rates in models with varying levels of input and how it affects circuit dynamics. Our results confirm that E-I homeostasis can be leveraged to control edge-of-bifurcation dynamics and that some modes of homeostasis maintain mean firing rates under higher levels of input by modulating the distance to the bifurcation. Additionally, relying on multiple modes of homeostasis ensures stable activity while keeping oscillation frequencies within a physiological range. Our findings tie relevant features of cortical networks, such as E-I balance, the generation of gamma oscillations, and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics, under the framework of firing-rate homeostasis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity in the distance to the bifurcation found across cortical areas. In addition, we reveal the functional benefits of relying upon different homeostatic mechanisms, providing a robust method to regulate network dynamics with minimal perturbation to the generation of gamma rhythms and explaining the correlation between inhibition and gamma frequencies found in cortical networks.

                <p>by Alice Bruel, Lina Bacha, Emma Boehly, Constance De Trogoff, Luca Represa, Gregoire Courtine, Auke Ijspeert</p>

Humans can perform movements in various physical environments and positions (corresponding to different experienced gravity), requiring the interaction of the musculoskeletal system, the neural system and the external environment. The neural system is itself comprised of several interactive components, from the brain mainly conducting motor planning, to the spinal cord (SC) implementing its own motor control centres through sensory reflexes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar movements in various environmental dynamics necessitate adapting modulation at the brain level, correcting modulation at the spinal level, or both. Here, we addressed this question by focusing on upper limb motor control in various gravity conditions (magnitudes and directions) and using neuromusculoskeletal simulation tools. We integrated supraspinal sinusoidal commands with a modular SC model controlling a musculoskeletal model to reproduce various recorded arm trajectories (kinematics and EMGs) in different contexts. We first studied the role of various spinal pathways (such as stretch reflexes) in movement smoothness and robustness against perturbation. Then, we optimised the supraspinal sinusoidal commands without and with a fixed SC model including stretch reflexes to reproduce a target trajectory in various gravity conditions. Inversely, we fixed the supraspinal commands and optimised the spinal synaptic strengths in the different environments. In the first optimisation context, the presence of SC resulted in easier optimisation of the supraspinal commands (faster convergence, better performance). The main supraspinal commands modulation was found in the flexor sinusoid’s amplitude, resp. frequency, to adapt to different gravity magnitudes, resp. directions. In the second optimisation context, the modulation of the spinal synaptic strengths also remarkably reproduced the target trajectory for the mild gravity changes. We highlighted that both strategies of modulation of the supraspinal commands or spinal stretch pathways can be used to control movements in different gravity environments. Our results thus support that the SC can assist gravity compensation.

Sumoylation is a posttranslational modification essential for multiple cellular functions in eukaryotes. ULP-2 is a conserved SUMO protease required for embryonic development in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here, we revealed that ULP-2 controls germline development by regulating the PHD-SET domain protein, SET-26. Specifically, loss of ULP-2 results in sterility and a progressive elevation of global protein sumoylation. In the germline of <i>ulp-2</i> null mutant, meiosis is arrested at the diplotene stage and the cells in the proximal germline acquire a somatic fate. Germline RNAseq analysis revealed the down-regulation of numerous germline genes in <i>ulp-2</i> mutants, whereas somatic gene expression is up-regulated. To determine the key factors that are regulated by ULP-2, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the histone methylation reader, SET-26 as a ULP-2 interacting protein. Loss of SET-26 enhanced the sterility of <i>ulp-2</i> mutant animals. Consistently, SET-26 is sumoylated and its sumoylation levels are regulated by ULP-2. Moreover, we detected a reduction in H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) histone levels bound to SET-26 in the <i>ulp-2</i> mutant background suggesting a dependence of this histone reader on balanced sumoylation. Finally, a comparative proteomics screen between WT and <i>ulp-2</i> loss of activity identified the predicted methyltransferase SET-27 as a ULP-2-dependent SET-26-associated protein. SET-27 knockout genetically interacts with ULP-2 in the germline, but not with SET-26. Taken together, we revealed a SUMO protease/H3K4me3 histone reader axis which is required for the maintenance and regulation of germline development.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002979">Functional analysis of conserved C. elegans bHLH family members uncovers lifespan control by a peptidergic hub neuron</a></h4>

Throughout the animal kingdom, several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family act as proneural genes during early steps of nervous system development. Roles of bHLH genes in specifying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons have been less extensively studied. We analyze here the function of 5 <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> bHLH genes, falling into 3 phylogenetically conserved subfamilies, which are continuously expressed in a very small number of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. We show (a) that 2 orthologs of the vertebrate <i>bHLHe22/e23</i> genes, called <i>hlh-17</i> and <i>hlh-32</i>, function redundantly to specify the identity of a single head interneuron class (AUA), as well as an individual motor neuron (VB2); (b) that the <i>PTF1a</i> ortholog <i>hlh-13</i> acts as a terminal selector to control terminal differentiation and function of the sole octopaminergic neuron class in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, RIC; and (c) that the <i>NHLH1/2</i> ortholog <i>hlh-15</i> controls terminal differentiation and function of the peptidergic AVK head interneuron class, a known neuropeptidergic signaling hub in the animal. Strikingly, through null mutant analysis and cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that loss of <i>hlh-15/NHLH</i> in the peptidergic AVK neurons and the resulting abrogation of neuropeptide secretion from these neurons causes a substantially extended lifespan of the animal, which we propose to be akin to hypothalamic control of lifespan in vertebrates. Our functional analysis reveals themes of bHLH gene function during terminal differentiation that are complementary to the earlier lineage specification roles of other bHLH family members. However, such late functions are much more sparsely employed by members of the bHLH transcription factor family, compared to the function of the much more broadly employed homeodomain transcription factor family.
