              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06606">The tardigrade as an emerging model organism for systems neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the case for developing the tardigrade (Hypsibius exemplaris) into a model organism for systems neuroscience. These microscopic, transparent animals (~300-500 microns) are among the smallest known to possess both limbs (eight) and eyes (two), with a nervous system of only a few hundred neurons organized into a multi-lobed brain, ventral nerve cord, and a series of ganglia along the body. Despite their neuroanatomical simplicity, tardigrades exhibit complex behaviors, including multi-limbed walking gaits, individual limb grasping, phototaxis, and transitions between active and dormant states. These behaviors position tardigrades as a uniquely powerful system for addressing certain fundamental questions in systems neuroscience, such as: How do nervous systems coordinate multi-limbed behaviors? How are top-down and bottom-up motor control systems integrated? How is stereovision-guided navigation implemented? What mechanisms underlie neural resilience and recovery during environmental stress? We review current knowledge of tardigrade neuroanatomy, behavior, and genomics, and we identify opportunities and challenges for leveraging their unique biology. We propose developing essential neuroscientific tools for tardigrades, including genetic engineering and live neuroimaging, alongside behavioral assays linking neural activity to outputs. Leveraging their evolutionary ties to Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, we can adapt existing toolkits to accelerate tardigrade research - providing a bridge between simpler invertebrate systems and more complex neural architectures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07440">Attention when you need</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being attentive to task-relevant features can improve task performance, but paying attention comes with its own metabolic cost. Therefore, strategic allocation of attention is crucial in performing the task efficiently. This work aims to understand this strategy. Recently, de Gee et al. conducted experiments involving mice performing an auditory sustained attention-value task. This task required the mice to exert attention to identify whether a high-order acoustic feature was present amid the noise. By varying the trial duration and reward magnitude, the task allows us to investigate how an agent should strategically deploy their attention to maximize their benefits and minimize their costs. In our work, we develop a reinforcement learning-based normative model of the mice to understand how it balances attention cost against its benefits. The model is such that at each moment the mice can choose between two levels of attention and decide when to take costly actions that could obtain rewards. Our model suggests that efficient use of attentional resources involves alternating blocks of high attention with blocks of low attention. In the extreme case where the agent disregards sensory input during low attention states, we see that high attention is used rhythmically. Our model provides evidence about how one should deploy attention as a function of task utility, signal statistics, and how attention affects sensory evidence.

                arXiv:2501.06698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In virtual reality applications, users often navigate through virtual environments, but the issue of physiological responses, such as cybersickness, fatigue, and cognitive workload, can disrupt or even halt these activities. Despite its impact, the underlying mechanisms of how the sensory system encodes information in VR remain unclear. In this study, we compare three sensory encoding models, Bayesian Efficient Coding, Fitness Maximizing Coding, and the Linear Nonlinear Poisson model, regarding their ability to simulate human navigation behavior in VR. By incorporating the factor of physiological responses into the models, we find that the Bayesian Efficient Coding model generally outperforms the others. Furthermore, the Fitness Maximizing Code framework provides more accurate estimates when the error penalty is small. Our results suggest that the Bayesian Efficient Coding framework offers superior predictions in most scenarios, providing a better understanding of human navigation behavior in VR environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03330">Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.03330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.

                arXiv:2409.08303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motor dysfunction is a common sign of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but may be difficult to detect, especially in the early stages. In this work, we examine the behavior of a wide array of explainable metrics extracted from the handwriting signals of 113 subjects performing multiple tasks on a digital tablet, as part of the Neurological Signals dataset. The aim is to measure their effectiveness in characterizing NDs, including AD and PD. To this end, task-agnostic and task-specific metrics are extracted from 14 distinct tasks. Subsequently, through statistical analysis and a series of classification experiments, we investigate which metrics provide greater discriminative power between NDs and healthy controls and amongst different NDs. Preliminary results indicate that the tasks at hand can all be effectively leveraged to distinguish between the considered set of NDs, specifically by measuring the stability, the speed of writing, the time spent not writing, and the pressure variations between groups from our handcrafted explainable metrics, which shows p-values lower than 0.0001 for multiple tasks. Using various binary classification algorithms on the computed metrics, we obtain up to 87 % accuracy for the discrimination between AD and healthy controls (CTL), and up to 69 % for the discrimination between PD and CTL.

                arXiv:2412.07783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain development in the first few months of human life is a critical phase characterized by rapid structural growth and functional organization. Accurately predicting developmental outcomes during this time is crucial for identifying delays and enabling timely interventions. This study introduces the SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer) model, designed to predict Bayley-III composite scores using neonatal fMRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). To enhance predictive accuracy, we apply dimensionality reduction via group independent component analysis (ICA) and pretrain SwiFT on large adult fMRI datasets to address the challenges of limited neonatal data. Our analysis shows that SwiFT significantly outperforms baseline models in predicting cognitive, motor, and language outcomes, leveraging both single-label and multi-label prediction strategies. The model's attention-based architecture processes spatiotemporal data end-to-end, delivering superior predictive performance. Additionally, we use Integrated Gradients with Smoothgrad sQuare (IG-SQ) to interpret predictions, identifying neural spatial representations linked to early cognitive and behavioral development. These findings underscore the potential of Transformer models to advance neurodevelopmental research and clinical practice.

Abstract: How do the synthetic neurons in language models create "thought categories" to segment and analyze their informational environment? What are the cognitive characteristics, at the very level of formal neurons, of this artificial categorical thought? Based on the mathematical nature of algebraic operations inherent to neuronal aggregation functions, we attempt to identify mathematico-cognitive factors that genetically shape the categorical reconstruction of the informational world faced by artificial cognition. This study explores these concepts through the notions of priming, attention, and categorical phasing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06762">Improving the adaptive and continuous learning capabilities of artificial neural networks: Lessons from multi-neuromodulatory dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.06762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous, adaptive learning-the ability to adapt to the environment and improve performance-is a hallmark of both natural and artificial intelligence. Biological organisms excel in acquiring, transferring, and retaining knowledge while adapting to dynamic environments, making them a rich source of inspiration for artificial neural networks (ANNs). This study explores how neuromodulation, a fundamental feature of biological learning systems, can help address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and enhance the robustness of ANNs in continuous learning scenarios. Driven by neuromodulators including dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA), neuromodulatory processes in the brain operate at multiple scales, facilitating dynamic responses to environmental changes through mechanisms ranging from local synaptic plasticity to global network-wide adaptability. Importantly, the relationship between neuromodulators, and their interplay in the modulation of sensory and cognitive processes are more complex than expected, demonstrating a "many-to-one" neuromodulator-to-task mapping. To inspire the design of novel neuromodulation-aware learning rules, we highlight (i) how multi-neuromodulatory interactions enrich single-neuromodulator-driven learning, (ii) the impact of neuromodulators at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and correspondingly, (iii) strategies to integrate neuromodulated learning into or approximate it in ANNs. To illustrate these principles, we present a case study to demonstrate how neuromodulation-inspired mechanisms, such as DA-driven reward processing and NA-based cognitive flexibility, can enhance ANN performance in a Go/No-Go task. By integrating multi-scale neuromodulation, we aim to bridge the gap between biological learning and artificial systems, paving the way for ANNs with greater flexibility, robustness, and adaptability.

                arXiv:2501.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of computation and neuroscience, much is still unknown about the underlying computations that enable key cognitive functions including learning, memory, abstraction and behavior. This paper proposes a mathematical and computational model of learning and memory based on a small set of bio-plausible functions that include coincidence detection, signal modulation, and reward/penalty mechanisms. Our theoretical approach proposes that these basic functions are sufficient to establish and modulate an information space over which computation can be carried out, generating signal gradients usable for inference and behavior. The computational method used to test this is a structurally dynamic cellular automaton with continuous-valued cell states and a series of recursive steps propagating over an undirected graph with the memory function embedded entirely in the creation and modulation of graph edges. The experimental results show: that the toy model can make near-optimal choices to re-discover a reward state after a single training run; that it can avoid complex penalty configurations; that signal modulation and network plasticity can generate exploratory behaviors in sparse reward environments; that the model generates context-dependent memory representations; and that it exhibits high computational efficiency because of its minimal, single-pass training requirements combined with flexible and contextual memory representation.

Abstract: Brains have evolved diverse neurons with varying morphologies and dynamics that impact temporal information processing. In contrast, most neural network models use homogeneous units that vary only in spatial parameters (weights and biases). To explore the importance of temporal parameters, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks with varying temporal complexity, holding different parameter subsets constant. We found that adapting conduction delays is crucial for solving all test conditions under tight resource constraints. Remarkably, these tasks can be solved using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with constant weights. In more complex spatio-temporal tasks, an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. Overall, allowing adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters enhances network robustness to noise, a vital feature for biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. Our findings suggest that rich and adaptable dynamics may be the key for solving temporally structured tasks efficiently in evolving organisms, which would help explain the diverse physiological properties of biological neurons.

                arXiv:2501.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This review examines PINNs for the first time in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are the gradient-free methods of neuroevolution for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and neuroevolution for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple conflicting terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Yet another exciting track is to cast neuroevolution as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models.

                arXiv:2501.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subset selection is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization, which has a wide range of applications such as influence maximization and sparse regression. The goal is to select a subset of limited size from a ground set in order to maximize a given objective function. However, the evaluation of the objective function in real-world scenarios is often noisy. Previous algorithms, including the greedy algorithm and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms POSS and PONSS, either struggle in noisy environments or consume excessive computational resources. In this paper, we focus on the noisy subset selection problem with a cardinality constraint, where the evaluation of a subset is noisy. We propose a novel approach based on Pareto Optimization with Robust Evaluation for noisy subset selection (PORE), which maximizes a robust evaluation function and minimizes the subset size simultaneously. PORE can efficiently identify well-structured solutions and handle computational resources, addressing the limitations observed in PONSS. Our experiments, conducted on real-world datasets for influence maximization and sparse regression, demonstrate that PORE significantly outperforms previous methods, including the classical greedy algorithm, POSS, and PONSS. Further validation through ablation studies confirms the effectiveness of our robust evaluation function.

                arXiv:2501.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. Its current research mainly focuses on specific algorithms for simplified problems due to the challenge posed by fluctuating fitness values. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to estimate the fitness trend of population during iterations. The proposed model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is the approach to estimate the running time of evolutionary algorithms for numerical optimization. The improvement yields novel results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including a briefer proof for the time complexity upper bound in the case of (1+1) EA for the Onemax problem, two tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of (1+$\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights and a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of (1+$\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems. The results indicate that the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that the multiple-gain model is more general for running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization than state-of-the-art methods.

                arXiv:2501.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks. Spiking neurons are stateful and intrinsically recurrent, making them well-suited for spatio-temporal tasks. However, this intrinsic memory is limited by synaptic and membrane time constants. A powerful additional mechanism are delays. In this paper, we propose a novel event-based training method for SNNs with delays, grounded in the EventProp formalism and enabling the calculation of exact gradients with respect to weights and delays. Our method supports multiple spikes per neuron and, to our best knowledge, is the first delay learning method applicable to recurrent connections. We evaluate our method on a simple sequence detection task, and the Yin-Yang, Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can optimize delays from suboptimal initial conditions and enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. Finally, we show that our approach uses less than half the memory of the current state-of-the-art delay-learning method and is up to 26x faster.

                arXiv:2501.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coverage optimization generally involves deploying a set of facilities (e.g., sensors) to best satisfy the demands of specified points, with wide applications in fields such as location science and sensor networks. In practical applications, coverage optimization focuses on target coverage, which is typically formulated as Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems (MVOPs) due to complex real-world constraints. Meanwhile, high-fidelity discretization and visibility analysis may bring additional calculations, which significantly increases the computational cost. These factors pose significant challenges for fitness evaluations (FEs) in canonical Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), and evolve the coverage problem into an Expensive Mixed-Variable Optimization Problem (EMVOP). To address these issues, we propose the RankNet-Inspired Surrogate-assisted Hybrid Metaheuristic (RI-SHM), an extension of our previous work. RI-SHM integrates three key components: (1) a RankNet-based pairwise global surrogate that innovatively predicts rankings between pairs of individuals, bypassing the challenges of fitness estimation in discontinuous solution space; (2) a surrogate-assisted local Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that enhances local exploitation and helps escape from local optima; and (3) a fitness diversity-driven switching strategy that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively handle large-scale coverage optimization tasks of up to 300 dimensions and more than 1,800 targets within desirable runtime. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for EMVOPs, RI-SHM consistently outperforms them by up to 56.5$\%$ across all tested instances.

Abstract: Evolutionary and bioinspired computation are crucial for efficiently addressing complex optimization problems across diverse application domains. By mimicking processes observed in nature, like evolution itself, these algorithms offer innovative solutions beyond the reach of traditional optimization methods. They excel at finding near-optimal solutions in large, complex search spaces, making them invaluable in numerous fields. However, both areas are plagued by challenges at their core, including inadequate benchmarking, problem-specific overfitting, insufficient theoretical grounding, and superfluous proposals justified only by their biological metaphor. This overview recapitulates and analyzes in depth the criticisms concerning the lack of innovation and rigor in experimental studies within the field. To this end, we examine the judgmental positions of the existing literature in an informed attempt to guide the research community toward directions of solid contribution and advancement in these areas. We summarize guidelines for the design of evolutionary and bioinspired optimizers, the development of experimental comparisons, and the derivation of novel proposals that take a step further in the field. We provide a brief note on automating the process of creating these algorithms, which may help align metaheuristic optimization research with its primary objective (solving real-world problems), provided that our identified pathways are followed. Our conclusions underscore the need for a sustained push towards innovation and the enforcement of methodological rigor in prospective studies to fully realize the potential of these advanced computational techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in classifying metal surface defects. Specifically, steel surfaces are analyzed to detect defects such as cracks, inclusions, patches, pitted surfaces, and scratches. Drawing on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, KAN provides a novel approach compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), facilitating more efficient function approximation by utilizing spline functions. The results show that KAN networks can achieve better accuracy than convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fewer parameters, resulting in faster convergence and improved performance in image classification.

                arXiv:2501.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE), driven by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft, has revolutionized fields such as transportation, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. In the upcoming six-generation (6G) era, UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is particularly crucial in challenging environments such as mountainous or disaster-stricken areas. The computation task offloading problem is one of the key issues in UAV-assisted MEC, primarily addressing the trade-off between minimizing the task delay and the energy consumption of the UAV. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted MEC system where the UAV carries the edge servers to facilitate task offloading for ground devices (GDs), and formulate a calculation delay and energy consumption multi-objective optimization problem (CDECMOP) to simultaneously improve the performance and reduce the cost of the system. Then, by modeling the formulated problem as a multi-objective Markov decision process (MOMDP), we propose a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm within an evolutionary framework to dynamically adjust the weights and obtain non-dominated policies. Moreover, to ensure stable convergence and improve performance, we incorporate a target distribution learning (TDL) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can better balance multiple optimization objectives and obtain superior non-dominated solutions compared to other methods.

                arXiv:2405.01305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programming recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) to robustly perform multi-timescale computation remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we describe a single-shot weight learning scheme to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs, by exploiting the properties of high-dimensional distributed representations. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms, which are each formed by the vector binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly nonideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work introduces a scalable approach to embed robust symbolic computation through recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. Moreover, it demonstrates that distributed symbolic representations serve as a highly capable representation-invariant language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.

Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) is typically used to solve nonlinear model predictive control's optimization problem. However, the size of the search space in which the GA searches for the optimal control inputs is crucial for its applicability to fast-response systems. This paper proposes accelerating the genetic optimization of NMPC by learning optimal search space size. The approach trains a multivariate regression model to adaptively predict the best smallest size of the search space in every control cycle. The proposed approach reduces the GA's computational time, improves the chance of convergence to better control inputs, and provides a stable and feasible solution. The proposed approach was evaluated on three nonlinear systems and compared to four other evolutionary algorithms implemented in a processor-in-the-loop fashion. The results show that the proposed approach provides a 17-45\% reduction in computational time and increases the convergence rate by 35-47\%. The source code is available on GitHub.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15141">Improving the Performance of Echo State Networks Through State Feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2312.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing, using nonlinear dynamical systems, offers a cost-effective alternative to neural networks for complex tasks involving processing of sequential data, time series modeling, and system identification. Echo state networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computer, mirror neural networks but simplify training. They apply fixed, random linear transformations to the internal state, followed by nonlinear changes. This process, guided by input signals and linear regression, adapts the system to match target characteristics, reducing computational demands. A potential drawback of ESNs is that the fixed reservoir may not offer the complexity needed for specific problems. While directly altering (training) the internal ESN would reintroduce the computational burden, an indirect modification can be achieved by redirecting some output as input. This feedback can influence the internal reservoir state, yielding ESNs with enhanced complexity suitable for broader challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that by feeding some component of the reservoir state back into the network through the input, we can drastically improve upon the performance of a given ESN. We rigorously prove that, for any given ESN, feedback will almost always improve the accuracy of the output. For a set of three tasks, each representing different problem classes, we find that with feedback the average error measures are reduced by $30\%-60\%$. Remarkably, feedback provides at least an equivalent performance boost to doubling the initial number of computational nodes, a computationally expensive and technologically challenging alternative. These results demonstrate the broad applicability and substantial usefulness of this feedback scheme.

                <p>Mammalian parenting is an unusually demanding commitment. How has the reward system been co-opted to ensure parental care? Previous work has implicated the lateral habenula (LHb), an epithalamic nucleus, as a potential intersection of parenting behavior and reward. Here, we examine the role of the LHb in the maternal behavior of naturally parturient primiparous mouse dams. We show that kainic acid lesions of the LHb induced a severe maternal neglect phenotype in dams toward their biological pups. Next, we demonstrate that chronic chemogenetic inactivation of the LHb using inhibitory DREADDs impaired acquisition and performance of various maternal behaviors, such as pup retrieval and nesting. We present a random intercept model suggesting LHb inactivation prevents the acquisition of pup retrieval, a novel maternal behavior in primiparous mouse dams, and decreases nest building performance, an already-established behavior, in primiparous mouse dams. Lastly, we examine the spatial histology of kainic acid-treated dams with a random intercept model, which suggests the role of LHb in maternal behavior may be preferentially localized at the posterior aspect of this structure. Together, these findings serve to establish the LHb as required for maternal behavior in the mouse dam, thereby complementing previous findings implicating the LHb in parental behavior using pup-sensitized virgin female mice.</p>

                Background The objective of this study was to determine the conditioning factors for scientific research productivity in university students of health sciences. Scientific productivity, in addition to making visible the generation of new knowledge, contributes to the well-being of the population and provides feedback to the scientific community in terms of methodologies, perspectives and results that help to break down barriers that delimit productivity in scientific research. Methods A cross-sectional analytical observational study was conducted. The study population was 4104 students enrolled during the 2021-I semester in the Faculty of Health Sciences of a private Peruvian university. A sample size of 400 students was determined and a stratified probability sampling was used. The variables were measured through surveys. The dependent variable was scientific research productivity, and the independent variables were institutional culture, knowledge management and technological capital. Summary measures are reported according to the type of variable. The chi-square test with a significance level of p<0.05 was applied to assess the association between the variables of interest. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the Stepwise method. Prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results From the total of 400 students, 74.5% were male, 57.25% were aged between 18 and 27 years, 17% belonged to the school of human medicine and 72% were in their sixth year of studies. Scientific research productivity was associated with management commitment (PR=1.493; 95%CI: 1.077–2.068, p=0.015), sense of personal growth (PR=1.632; 95%CI: 1.041–2.558; p=0.024), recognition by the university (PR=1.385; 95%CI: 1.012–1.896; p=0.043), strategic alliances (PR=1.422; 95%CI: 1.032–1.959; p=0. 03), having research proposals (PR=1.522; 95%CI: 1.114–2.08; p=0.009), dissemination of results obtained (PR=1.542; 95%CI: 1.12–2.122; p=0.01), availability of human resources (PR=1.591; 95%CI: 1.165–2.173; p=0.004), access to equipment and software (PR=1.482; 95%CI: 1.061–2.069; p=0.018) and to laboratories (PR=1.438; 95%CI: 1.047–1.974; p=0.024). Conclusion It is concluded that the research productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences is low. It is imperative to strengthen the university research culture that empowers students as agents of change and strengthens faculty participation in scientific networks and communities.

                Background Age-related central auditory processing disorder and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be concomitant in older adults, making it difficult to communicate, especially in challenging listening conditions. This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of auditory-based cognitive training on the auditory processing abilities and cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. Methods In this randomized controlled trial twenty-two older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=11) or a control group (n=11). The experimental group received 15 cognitive training sessions through tasks involving the auditory domain. The outcome measures of this study included auditory resolution (Temporal gap detection, frequency discrimination, and modulation detection) and cognitive measures (Trail making tests and digit recall), which were administered at three-time points (before training, post-training, and follow-up). The linear mixed model computed the effects of training on the outcome measures. Results A significant improvement was observed in the modulation detection threshold between baseline and follow-up and between post-training and follow-up sessions. However, GDT and FD thresholds did not reveal any statistically significant difference. In the trail making test, Part B showed consistent significance across the time points, whereas Part A and the delayed recall task showed no significant difference. Conclusion Auditory-based cognitive training may improve auditory processing and executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

                Background PMS-algebras are a specific algebraic structure that generalizes a propositional algebra called BCK-algebra. This paper delves into the intricate group structure of these algebras and the concept of derivations within this framework. Methods We employ rigorous mathematical techniques to analyze the properties of derivations in P MS-algebras. This involves examining various characteristics of derivations and investigating their behavior in specific subcategories, such as torsion-free P MS-algebras. Results Our research reveals several key findings. Firstly, we establish that the set of all derivations associated with the binary operation defined on a P MS-algebra constitutes a semigroup. Secondly, we provide a comprehensive analysis of generalized derivations, d-invariant ideals, fixed sets, and torsion-free P MS-algebras within the context of P MS-algebras. Conclusions This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the algebraic structure of P MS-algebras and the role of derivations within this context. The findings presented here have implications for further research in abstract algebra and related fields.

                Abstract* The processes of industrialization and overconsumption of natural resources have resulted in significant environmental changes and degradation. Furthermore, the discrepancy between social and economic classes has resulted in the emergence of inequality among social groups. These issues have been further exacerbated by the advent of the global pandemic, with the greatest impact being observed in some nations, which has served to further widen the social and economic gaps. Consequently, world leaders are keen to take action to mitigate these impacts and disparities among different social groups, given that environmental degradation and climate change have a significant impact on human and planetary health. Furthermore, these factors impede the ability of individuals in disadvantaged social groups to exercise their right to food sovereignty. The objective of this article is to identify perspectives on food sovereignty in the context of climate change impacts through a bibliometric analysis. The analysis reveals that climate change research is an emerging field, with the United States playing a significant role in its development. The principal conclusion is that developed countries are primarily concerned with addressing the challenges posed by climate change to food sovereignty. Furthermore, a correlation was identified between regional CO₂ emissions and malnutrition rates, indicating a potential link between environmental degradation and food security.

                Background Phacoemulsification is still considered the most performed surgery in the field of cataract extraction, boasting one of the highest successes of all surgical procedures. However, complications of posterior capsular rupture (PCR) and increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) bear the potential for great risk, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes or advanced age. Methods A retrospective analysis of 31 cases regarding patients undergoing phacoemulsification in a private ophthalmology clinic in Baghdad was done by noting intraoperative and postoperative complications. A systematic review is also carried out so that findings could be contextualized; studies have been sourced from both PubMed and Scopus databases. Our review covered studies that researched complications such as PCR, increased IOP, and corneal edema, chronicling developments in surgical techniques and patient management. Results The case series resulted in a postoperative best-corrected visual acuity of 6/6 in 35.5% of the patients in the right eye and 29% in the left eye. This series was associated with PCR and raised IOP; however, appropriate management ensured good improvement in vision for the majority of cases. The systematic review supports these findings, pointing out that contemporary surgical procedures and personalized attention can reduce complications substantially, even among high-risk patients. Conclusion Case series and systematic review bring forth the importance of meticulous surgical techniques combined with early recognition of risk factors and personalized postoperative management in attempting to minimize complications. These findings point to the implication of an ideal strategy in handling complications from phacoemulsification, but also have shown that continuing improvement in the surgical and postoperative protocols could further improve patient outcomes, especially those very highly at-risk.

                Background The opioid crisis is a public health challenge in the United States, significantly impacting mortality rates. This has been further exacerbated by COVID-19, contributing to a surge in substance use and overdose deaths. Methods Data from the CDC Wonder Database was used to identify opioid use-related deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2023. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were calculated across different geographic and demographic groups. Temporal trends in mortality were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression Program. Annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) in mortality rates were calculated. Results Opioid-related mortality surged during the COVID-19 period, with significant regional, racial, and state-level disparities. The Midwest region exhibited the highest AAPC from 1999 to 2023. State-specific analyses showed that West Virginia experienced the highest increase in AAMR from 1999 to 2023. Among racial groups, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives had the highest AAPC from 1999 to 2023. Gender-specific analyses revealed that males had a higher AAPC from 1999 to 2023 than females. Conclusion The United States opioid crisis continued to escalate during the COVID-19 period, with significant increases in mortality across the regions. The highest AAPCs were seen in the Midwest and among non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to account for trends in racial and regional disparities in opioid-related mortality that have increased during and post-COVID-19.

                Background PMS algebras are a type of algebraic structure that has been studied extensively in recent years. They are a generalization of several other algebraic structures, such as Boolean algebras and MV-algebras. Methods In this paper, we introduce the concept of t-derivations on PMS algebras.

Finally, we prove that the set of all t-derivations on a PMS-algebra forms a semigroup. Conclusions This paper provides a comprehensive study of t-derivations on PMS algebras. We have established several new results and characterized the properties of t-derivations in detail.

                Very little research has been conducted to rigorously study the application of geometry for qualitative analysis in the field of disaster management. The present work aims to examine how to enhance qualitative analysis in the field by applying geometry. Descriptive qualitative analysis was used as the main methodology with the support of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist and flow chart to describe not only the nature of qualitative analysis but also how the method can be enhanced by geometric application. The principal finding was that the field supplements qualitative analysis with geometry to improve the quality of research, considering the scratch programming language, machine-oriented learning, geometric effects, and the issue of awareness. This study provides a comprehensive approach to the topic by specifically addressing pluralism and flexibility.

Intracellular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids is a fundamental mechanism by which cells compartmentalize their components and perform essential biological functions. Molecular simulations play a crucial role in providing microscopic insights into the physicochemical processes driving this phenomenon. In this study, we systematically compare six state-of-the-art sequence-dependent residue-resolution models to evaluate their performance in reproducing the phase behaviour and material properties of condensates formed by seven variants of the low-complexity domain (LCD) of the hnRNPA1 protein (A1-LCD)—a protein implicated in the pathological liquid-to-solid transition of stress granules. Specifically, we assess the HPS, HPS-cation–<i>π</i>, HPS-Urry, CALVADOS2, Mpipi, and Mpipi-Recharged models in their predictions of the condensate saturation concentration, critical solution temperature, and condensate viscosity of the A1-LCD variants. Our analyses demonstrate that, among the tested models, Mpipi, Mpipi-Recharged, and CALVADOS2 provide accurate descriptions of the critical solution temperatures and saturation concentrations for the multiple A1-LCD variants tested. Regarding the prediction of material properties for condensates of A1-LCD and its variants, Mpipi-Recharged stands out as the most reliable model. Overall, this study benchmarks a range of residue-resolution coarse-grained models for the study of the thermodynamic stability and material properties of condensates and establishes a direct link between their performance and the ranking of intermolecular interactions these models consider.

                <p>by Obaï Bin Ka’b Ali, Alexandre Vidal, Christophe Grova, Habib Benali</p>

Astrocytes critically shape whole-brain structure and function by forming extensive gap junctional networks that intimately and actively interact with neurons. Despite their importance, existing computational models of whole-brain activity ignore the roles of astrocytes while primarily focusing on neurons. Addressing this oversight, we introduce a biophysical neural mass network model, designed to capture the dynamic interplay between astrocytes and neurons via glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission pathways. This network model proposes that neural dynamics are constrained by a two-layered structural network interconnecting both astrocytic and neuronal populations, allowing us to investigate astrocytes’ modulatory influences on whole-brain activity and emerging functional connectivity patterns. By developing a simulation methodology, informed by bifurcation and multilayer network theories, we demonstrate that the dialogue between astrocytic and neuronal networks manifests over fast–slow fluctuation mechanisms as well as through phase–amplitude connectivity processes. The findings from our research represent a significant leap forward in the modeling of glial-neuronal collaboration, promising deeper insights into their collaborative roles across health and disease states.

Respiratory diseases represent a significant healthcare burden, as evidenced by the devastating impact of COVID-19. Biophysical models offer the possibility to anticipate system behavior and provide insights into physiological functions, advancements which are comparatively and notably nascent when it comes to pulmonary mechanics research. In this context, an Inverse Finite Element Analysis (IFEA) pipeline is developed to construct the first continuously ventilated three-dimensional structurally representative pulmonary model informed by both organ- and tissue-level breathing experiments from a cadaveric human lung. Here we construct a generalizable computational framework directly validated by pressure, volume, and strain measurements using a novel inflating apparatus interfaced with adapted, lung-specific, digital image correlation techniques. The parenchyma, pleura, and airways are represented with a poroelastic formulation to simulate pressure flows within the lung lobes, calibrating the model’s material properties with the global pressure-volume response and local tissue deformations strains. The optimization yielded the following shear moduli: parenchyma (2.8 kPa), airways (0.2 kPa), and pleura (1.7 Pa). The proposed complex multi-material model with multi-experimental inputs was successfully developed using human lung data, and reproduced the shape of the inflating pressure-volume curve and strain distribution values associated with pulmonary deformation. This advancement marks a significant step towards creating a generalizable human lung model for broad applications across animal models, such as porcine, mouse, and rat lungs to reproduce pathological states and improve performance investigations regarding medical therapeutics and intervention.

                <p>by Evan Gorstein, Rosa Aghdam, Claudia Solís-Lemus</p>

High-dimensional mixed-effects models are an increasingly important form of regression in which the number of covariates rivals or exceeds the number of samples, which are collected in groups or clusters. The penalized likelihood approach to fitting these models relies on a coordinate descent algorithm that lacks guarantees of convergence to a global optimum. Here, we empirically study the behavior of this algorithm on simulated and real examples of three types of data that are common in modern biology: transcriptome, genome-wide association, and microbiome data. Our simulations provide new insights into the algorithm’s behavior in these settings, and, comparing the performance of two popular penalties, we demonstrate that the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty consistently outperforms the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty in terms of both variable selection and estimation accuracy across omics data. To empower researchers in biology and other fields to fit models with the SCAD penalty, we implement the algorithm in a Julia package, HighDimMixedModels.jl.

                <p>by Sarah M. Tashjian, Joseph Cussen, Wenning Deng, Bo Zhang, Dean Mobbs</p>

Pivotal to self-preservation is the ability to identify when we are safe and when we are in danger. Previous studies have focused on safety estimations based on the features of external threats and do not consider how the brain integrates other key factors, including estimates about our ability to protect ourselves. Here, we examine the neural systems underlying the online dynamic encoding of safety. The current preregistered study used 2 novel tasks to test 4 facets of safety estimation: <i>Safety Prediction</i>, <i>Meta-representation</i>, <i>Recognition</i>, and <i>Value Updating</i>. We experimentally manipulated safety estimation changing both levels of external threats and self-protection. Data were collected in 2 independent samples (behavioral <i>N</i> = 100; MRI <i>N</i> = 30). We found consistent evidence of subjective changes in the sensitivity to safety conferred through protection. Neural responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracked increases in safety during all safety estimation facets, with specific tuning to protection. Further, informational connectivity analyses revealed distinct hubs of safety coding in the posterior and anterior vmPFC for external threats and protection, respectively. These findings reveal a central role of the vmPFC for coding safety.

                Background Biomarkers are essential tools in modern medicine, allowing stratification and monitoring of clinical care and treatment response. While systemic blood biomarkers, typically collected from the antecubital vein (AV), are widely used, their sensitivity for joint-specific pathologies such as osteoarthritis (OA) may be limited due to systemic dilution. At present, no serum biomarker reliably reflects the microenvironment of an affected joint in clinical practice. Although synovial fluid (SF) assessment can provide insights into localised pathology and are clinically used for diagnosis in crystal arthropathies and joint infections, their collection is invasive, painful, and carries risks, including infection, making repeated sampling impractical, limiting utility for monitoring treatment responses. This study introduces a novel ultrasound-guided venous sampling technique targeting the saphenous vein (SV) proximal to the knee joint as a less invasive alternative to SF aspiration, hypothesising that it may better reflect the joint-specific microenvironment. Methods A standardised gel model was used to train medically qualified researchers in ultrasound-guided venepuncture of vescles around 2-15 mm in diameter. Subsequently, 32 participants consented to blood sampling from the SV above the knee, with a proximally applied tourniquet to dilate vein diameter for easier venepuncture collection. Results The technique achieved serum collection in over 80% of consented individuals with minimal adverse effects (including n=2 minor bruising and n=1 transient nerve irritation). Key procedural insights included optimal site selection, appropriate pressure application, and effective tourniquet use. Discussion This method demonstrates feasibility, acceptability, and the potential for more localised sample collection, advancing biomarker research. Further validation, including paired SF comparisons, is required to confirm diagnostic utility and develop therapeutic strategies for joint-specific conditions.

                Introduction Globally, oral cancer is the 15th deadliest cancer among humans. Diverse health education interventions have played a very significant role in the prevention of oral cancer. Of these interventions, digital interventions, especially mhealth-driven interventions, have been largely underutilized. So far, only two known educative mobile health applications (MHAs) for oral cancer exits; unfortunately, these two applications are not comprehensive and not inclusive for diverse populations. There is a need for a comprehensive and more inclusive MHA that can be used to educate the public about oral cancer. Objectives To co-develop, co-create, and test a comprehensive and inclusive MHA that can be used to educate the public about oral cancer. Methods The proposed study will be conducted and reported using the PRODUCES (PRoblem, Objective, Design, (end-) Users, Co-creators, Evaluation, Scalability) framework—this framework provides a novel approach which can be used to develop mhealth interventions through participatory action research methodologies. This study will have three parts. The first part will co-develop an eight-sectioned lay educational content on oral cancer through three-round Delphi consultations with thirty subject matter experts in the field of oral cancer and public health. Using the co-developed educational content, the second part of this study will co-create an educative MHA prototype on oral cancer through three-round Delphi consultations with twenty digital communication experts and persons at risk of oral cancer. Lastly, the third part will, through a three-arm, parallel, open-label randomized control trial, test and compare, among seventy-five young adults, the effectiveness, usability, uptake, and acceptability of the co-created MHA prototype on oral cancer against a web-based educational resource on oral cancer. Conclusion The outcomes of this study will co-produce and test an inclusive and comprehensive MHA prototype that can be used to educate diverse populations across the world about oral cancer.

                Background Understanding the epidemiology of soccer injuries during specific international competitions is essential for customizing preventive strategies. Several studies have reported outcomes related to international competitions but, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the injury patterns during any African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments. This study aimed to analyse the incidence and the characteristics of soccer injuries during the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which took place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022. Methods A video-based analysis covering 52 matches was conducted by two independent consultant physicians. They reviewed injury replays to determine incidence and characteristics ( i.e. ; mechanisms, body location, match moment, player substitution, absence in the next match, and referee decisions). Results The tournament involved 519 male players, comprising 275 African (ALP) and 244 Non-African (NALP) league players. Eighty-seven injuries occurred, with incidences of 1.7 and 48.8 injuries per match and per 1000 match hours, respectively. Injury incidence rose with competition stages, particularly contact mechanism injuries. Non-contact injuries (23/87) predominantly occurred after 60 minutes of play (19/23), with the thigh being the most frequently affected body part (18/87). Older age and playing time significantly correlated with injury occurrence (p=0.032 and p<0.001, respectively). NALP midfielders and forwards were notably injured by contact mechanisms (36/45) in the attacking zone. Although non-contact mechanisms were more common in ALP than NALP (13/42 vs. 9/45), the difference lacked statistical significance (p=0.240), with a higher rate of muscle injuries (13/42 vs. 10/45, p=0.001). Conclusion Muscle injuries prevailed among professional soccer players in the 2021 AFCON, with older age and playing time identified as key associated factors. Muscle injuries were more prevalent in ALP compared to NALP.

This work also uncovers how ssDNA binding reshapes the protein’s energy landscape, coupling folding dynamics with ligand interactions.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014413.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

                Yue et al. investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying nociceptive-evoked gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) in human and rodent models. Nociceptive-evoked GBOs preferentially encoding pain intensity are causally generated by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex. These findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pain therapies aimed at modulating GBOs.

Neurobiologically, microarousals support the roles of noradrenergic infraslow fluctuations in healthy mouse sleep.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92683">AI-driven automated discovery tools reveal diverse behavioral competencies of biological networks</a></h4>

              
                Many applications in biomedicine and synthetic bioengineering rely on understanding, mapping, predicting, and controlling the complex behavior of chemical and genetic networks. The emerging field of diverse intelligence investigates the problem-solving capacities of unconventional agents. However, few quantitative tools exist for exploring the competencies of non-conventional systems. Here, we view gene regulatory networks (GRNs) as agents navigating a problem space and develop automated tools to map the robust goal states GRNs can reach despite perturbations. Our contributions include: (1) Adapting curiosity-driven exploration algorithms from AI to discover the range of reachable goal states of GRNs, and (2) Proposing empirical tests inspired by behaviorist approaches to assess their navigation competencies. Our data shows that models inferred from biological data can reach a wide spectrum of steady states, exhibiting various competencies in physiological network dynamics without requiring structural changes in network properties or connectivity. We also explore the applicability of these ‘behavioral catalogs’ for comparing evolved competencies across biological networks, for designing drug interventions in biomedical contexts and synthetic gene networks for bioengineering. These tools and the emphasis on behavior-shaping open new paths for efficiently exploring the complex behavior of biological networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101727">Assessing the balance between excitation and inhibition in chronic pain through the aperiodic component of EEG</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating condition whose neural mechanisms are incompletely understood. An imbalance of cerebral excitation and inhibition (E/I), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is believed to represent a crucial mechanism in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Thus, identifying a non-invasive, scalable marker of E/I could provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of chronic pain and aid in developing clinically useful biomarkers. Recently, the aperiodic component of the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum has been proposed to represent a non-invasive proxy for E/I. We, therefore, assessed the aperiodic component in the mPFC of resting-state EEG recordings in 149 people with chronic pain and 115 healthy participants. We found robust evidence against differences in the aperiodic component in the mPFC between people with chronic pain and healthy participants, and no correlation between the aperiodic component and pain intensity. These findings were consistent across different subtypes of chronic pain and were similarly found in a whole-brain analysis. Their robustness was supported by preregistration and multiverse analyses across many different methodological choices. Together, our results suggest that the EEG aperiodic component does not differentiate between people with chronic pain and healthy individuals. These findings and the rigorous methodological approach can guide future studies investigating non-invasive, scalable markers of cerebral dysfunction in people with chronic pain and beyond.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96303">Geometry and dynamics of representations in a precisely balanced memory network related to olfactory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Biological memory networks are thought to store information by experience-dependent changes in the synaptic connectivity between assemblies of neurons. Recent models suggest that these assemblies contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I assemblies), resulting in co-tuning and precise balance of excitation and inhibition. To understand computational consequences of E/I assemblies under biologically realistic constraints we built a spiking network model based on experimental data from telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, a precisely balanced recurrent network homologous to piriform cortex. We found that E/I assemblies stabilized firing rate distributions compared to networks with excitatory assemblies and global inhibition. Unlike classical memory models, networks with E/I assemblies did not show discrete attractor dynamics. Rather, responses to learned inputs were locally constrained onto manifolds that ‘focused’ activity into neuronal subspaces. The covariance structure of these manifolds supported pattern classification when information was retrieved from selected neuronal subsets. Networks with E/I assemblies therefore transformed the geometry of neuronal coding space, resulting in continuous representations that reflected both relatedness of inputs and an individual’s experience. Such continuous representations enable fast pattern classification, can support continual learning, and may provide a basis for higher-order learning and cognitive computations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97981">Robust single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals depot-specific cell population dynamics in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity</a></h4>

              
                Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), an alternative to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), encounters technical challenges in obtaining high-quality nuclei and RNA, persistently hindering its applications. Here, we present a robust technique for isolating nuclei across various tissue types, remarkably enhancing snRNA-seq data quality. Employing this approach, we comprehensively characterize the depot-dependent cellular dynamics of various cell types underlying mouse adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq from adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we identify distinct adipocyte subpopulations categorized by size and functionality. These subpopulations follow two divergent trajectories, adaptive and pathological, with their prevalence varying by depot. Specifically, we identify a key molecular feature of dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes, a global shutdown in gene expression, along with elevated stress and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our differential gene expression analysis reveals distinct contributions of adipocyte subpopulations to the overall pathophysiology of adipose tissue. Our study establishes a robust snRNA-seq method, providing novel insights into the biological processes involved in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity, with broader applicability across diverse biological systems.

">Spinal Cord Ultrasound Stimulation Modulates Corticospinal Excitability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) offers superior tissue penetration and enables precise neuromodulation of cortical and subcortical circuits. However, its effects on neural activity in the human spinal cord remain largely unexplored. Objective: To investigate the effects of LIFU on spinal cord neuromodulation under varying conditions of intensity (spatial-peak pulse-average intensity, ISPPA), duty cycle (DC), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Methods: Thirty-six healthy human volunteers participated in the study. A 500 kHz ultrasound transducer with a focal depth exceeding 100 mm was used to target the C8 spinal cord. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) hotspot corresponding to the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, innervated by the C8 nerve. A 500 ms-duration LIFU was delivered to the C8 spinal cord 400 ms prior to single-pulse TMS over the FDI hotspot. Spinal cord ultrasound stimulation (SCUS) was administered with varying acoustic parameters: intensities (ISPPA: 2.5 and 10 W/cm2), DCs (10% and 30%), and PRFs (500 and 1000 Hz). Changes in corticospinal excitability were assessed by comparing TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) between active and sham SCUS conditions. Results: SCUS with an ISPPA of 10 W/cm2, a DC of 30%, and a PRF of 1000 Hz significantly reduced MEP amplitudes compared to sham stimulation. However, at the high intensity (ISPPA of 10 W/cm2), varying the DC between 10% and 30% did not affect MEP amplitudes. Additionally, while a PRF of 1000 Hz decreased MEP amplitudes at 10 W/cm2, a PRF of 500 Hz did not produce significant changes. Conclusions: The results indicate that ultrasound stimulation of the spinal cord can suppress corticospinal drive to muscles, especially when utilizing high intensity and high PRF parameters. This suggests that ultrasound stimulation may provide a novel method for modulating human spinal neural activity.

">EEG-Informed fMRI Analysis Reveals Neurovascular Coupling in Motor Execution and Imagery</a></h4>

              
                The complementary strengths of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have driven extensive research into integrating these two noninvasive modalities to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. However, the precise neural patterns associated with motor functions, especially imagined movements, remain unclear. Specifically, the correlations between electrophysiological responses and hemodynamic activations during executed and imagined movements have not been fully elucidated at a whole-brain level. In this study, we employed an EEG-informed fMRI approach on concurrent EEG-fMRI data to map hemodynamic changes associated with dynamic EEG temporal features during motor-related brain activities. We localized and differentiated the hemodynamic activations corresponding to continuous EEG temporal dynamics across multiple motor execution and imagery tasks. Validation against conventional block fMRI analysis demonstrated high precision in identifying regions specific to motor activities, underscoring the accuracy of the EEG-driven model. Beyond the expected sensorimotor activations, the integrated analysis revealed supplementary coactivated regions showing significant negative covariation between blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activities and sensorimotor EEG alpha power, including the cerebellum and insular cortex. These findings confirmed both the colocalization of EEG and fMRI activities in sensorimotor regions and a negative covariation between EEG alpha band power and BOLD changes. Moreover, the results provide novel insights into neurovascular coupling during motor execution and imagery on a brain-wide scale, advancing our understanding of the neural dynamics underlying motor functions.

">Self-supervision deep learning models are better models of human high-level visual cortex: The roles of multi-modality and dataset training size</a></h4>

              
                With the rapid development of Artificial Neural Network based visual models, many studies have shown that these models show unprecedented potence in predicting neural responses to images in visual cortex. Lately, advances in computer vision have introduced self-supervised models, where a model is trained using supervision from natural properties of the training set. This has led to examination of their neural prediction performance, which revealed better prediction of self-supervised than supervised models for models trained with language supervision or with image-only supervision. In this work, we delve deeper into the models ability to explain neural representations of object categories. We compare models that differed in their training objectives to examine where they diverge in their ability to predict fMRI and MEG recordings while participants are presented with images of different object categories. Results from both fMRI and MEG show that self-supervision was advantageous in comparison to classification training. In addition, language supervision is a better predictor for later stages of visual perception, while image-only supervision shows a consistent advantage over a longer duration, beginning from 80ms after exposure. Examination of the effect of data size training revealed that large dataset did not necessarily improve neural predictions, in particular in visual self-supervised models. Finally, examination of the correspondence of the hierarchy of each model to visual cortex showed that image-only self-supervision led to better correspondence than image only models. We conclude that while self-supervision shows consistently better prediction of fMRI and MEG recordings, each type of supervision reveals a different property of neural activity, with language-supervision explaining later onsets, while image-only self-supervision explains long and very early latencies of the neural response, with the model hierarchy naturally sharing corresponding hierarchical structure as the brain.

">Prolyl isomerase FKBP12 reduces axon growth and negatively regulates microtubule polymerization by inhibiting CRMP2A</a></h4>

              
                Prolyl isomerases are enzymes catalyzing conformational change of the peptide bond between proline and the preceding amino acid, regulating the function and stability of their substrates. We have previously identified CRMP2A - the longer isoform of a microtubule-associated protein Collapsin response mediator protein 2 - as a substrate of the phospho-specific prolyl isomerase Pin1. CRMP2A is negatively regulated and destabilized by CDK5 phosphorylation in the distal axons and growth cones. Pin1 specifically binds to phosphorylated CRMP2A and stabilizes it by inducing conformational changes. However, the conformational regulation of unphosphorylated CRMP2 remains unknown. Here, we show that the prolyl isomerase FKBP12 specifically binds to unphosphorylated CRMP2A and regulates its activity. Using in vitro microtubule polymerization assays we demonstrate that CRMP2A promotes microtubule growth and that this function is inhibited by FKBP12. Next, using GFP-EB3 microtubule plus-end tracking assay, we demonstrate that FKBP12 inhibits CRMP2A-mediated microtubule polymerization also in cells. Furthermore, we show that FKBP12 co-localizes with unphosphorylated CRMP2A in growth cones and that expression of FKBP12 reduces axon growth in microfluidic chambers, while FKBP12 knockdown enhances it. Together, we demonstrate that FKBP12 is a negative regulator of microtubule dynamics and axon growth. Moreover, we show that two prolyl isomerases can differentially (positively or negatively) regulate activity of a common substrate depending on its phosphorylation. This provides an additional layer of phosphorylation-dependent or -independent control of protein activity, microtubule dynamics, and neuronal growth. Given the broad substrate specificity of FKBP12 and Pin1, this regulatory mechanism likely contributes to the modulation of diverse proteins and cellular processes in the nervous system and beyond.

">A common neuronal basis for Pavlovian and instrumental learning in amygdala circuits</a></h4>

              
                Reward-predictive Pavlovian cues can selectively invigorate instrumental behaviors. Accumulating evidence pinpoints the basolateral amygdala (BLA) as a key brain structure to assign outcome-specific motivational significance to Pavlovian cues or Instrumental actions. However, whether neuronal representations of Pavlovian and Instrumental learnings are processed in different BLA circuits and how the resulting memories interact is unknown. Here, we used calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation of the BLA neurons in mice that acquired and expressed Pavlovian and Instrumental behaviors in a multi-phase behavioral task called specific Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (sPIT). We first confirmed that Pavlovian cues selectively invigorate instrumental actions and showed that this effect, referred as the sPIT effect, depends on BLA activity. Then, by tracking the activity of single BLA neurons across days, we found that BLA neurons integrate common reward-anticipation information relevant for Pavlovian and instrumental learning. Interestingly, this reward-anticipation information re-emerged during subsequent memory transfer and covaried with sPIT effect. These findings reveal that the BLA encodes an outcome-specific motivational state that generalizes across Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors to promote and guide reward-seeking behavior.

">In vivo Quantification of White Matter Pathways in the Human Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a key structure in cognition. Although much research has focused on defining the functions of its anatomically distinct subfields, the communication among these subfields within the hippocampal circuit, supported by white matter pathways, is theoretically key to emergent cognitive function. Yet, hippocampal white matter connections in humans have not been fully explored in vivo. By leveraging diffusion weighted imaging and a large healthy sample (N=831), we developed a processing pipeline for in vivo quantification of human hippocampal pathways. We provided evidence for monosynaptic and trisynaptic pathway-related connections in humans, supporting the described hippocampal circuit in ex vivo and animal studies. In addition to hemispheric and sex differences, the individual variability in hippocampal pathways was linked to cognitive abilities. Thus, in vivo characterization of human hippocampal pathways highlights the individual differences within these structures and paves the way for their implications in cognition, aging, and diseases.

">Smooth pursuit eye movements contribute to long-latency reflex modulation in the lower extremity</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory mediated reactions play a fundamental role in adapting to environmental changes, particularly through long-latency responses (LLRs). We investigated how smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), which are slow eye movements used to track moving objects, influence LLRs of the upper and lower limb during mechanical interactions with moving objects. Seventeen participants stabilized their limb in anticipation of a collision with a virtual object approaching at 25 cm/s while standing. This task occurred while subjects either visually pursued the object or fixated a central location. Mechanical perturbations were applied at two time points: approximately 200ms and 60ms before the anticipated collision. On a random subset of trials, the robot applied a mechanical perturbation either 200ms (early) or 60ms (late) before the anticipated collision. As in previous studies LLRs were observed in leg muscles to upper limb displacement. Moreover, the leg LLRs were modulated by gaze, being larger during pursuit than fixation but only during late perturbations. This timing-specific modulation aligns with previous reports of policy transitions in feedback control roughly 60ms before impact. Upper limb LLRs were not impacted by gaze indicating a prioritization on postural control circuits. This work extends our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration and highlights the sophisticated nature of the human motor control system in coordinating eye movements with whole-body postural responses.

">BDNF in Ventrolateral Orbitofrontal Cortex to Dorsolateral Striatum Circuit Moderates Alcohol Consumption and Gates Alcohol Habit</a></h4>

              
                BDNF plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of neurons. BDNF signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is part of an endogenous pathway that protects against the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Dysregulation of BDNF levels in the cortex or dysfunction of BDNF/TrkB signaling in the DLS results in the escalation of alcohol drinking and compulsive alcohol use. The major source of BDNF in the striatum is the prefrontal cortex. We identified a small ensemble of BDNF-positive neurons in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cor-tex (vlOFC), a region involved in AUD, that extend axonal projections to the DLS. We speculated that BDNF in vlOFC-to-DLS circuit may play a role in limiting alcohol drinking and that heavy alcohol use disrupts this protec-tive pathway. We found that BDNF expression is reduced in the vlOFC of male but not female mice after long-term cycles of binge alcohol drinking and withdrawal. We discovered that overexpression of BDNF in vlOFC-to-DLS but not in vlOFC-to-dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or M2 motor cortex-to-DLS circuit reduces alcohol but not sucrose intake and preference. The DLS plays a major role in habitual behaviors. We hypothesized that BDNF in vlOFC-to-DLS circuitry controls alcohol intake by gating habitual alcohol seeking. We found that BDNF over-expression in vlOFC-to-DLS circuit and systemic administration of BDNF receptor TrkB agonist, LM22A-4, bi-ases habitually trained mice towards goal-directed alcohol seeking. Together, our data suggest that BDNF in a small ensemble of vlOFC-to-DLS neurons gates alcohol intake by attenuating habitual alcohol seeking.

">dlmoR: An open-source R package for the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) hockey-stick method</a></h4>

              
                The dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) is a commonly used circadian phase marker indicating the start time of evening melatonin synthesis in humans. Several quantitative techniques have been developed to determine DLMO from melatonin time-series, including fixed- or variable-threshold techniques and the hockey-stick method developed by Danilenko and colleagues (2014). Here, we introduce dlmoR, an open-source implementation of the hockey-stick method implemented in the R programming language and licensed under the permissive MIT License. Our clean-room implementation followed the algorithm description from the original article, supported by iterative validation against the existing binary executable software. We benchmark our implementation using a total of 112 melatonin time-series data sets from two different studies (Blume et al, 2024; Heinrichs and Spitschan, 2024), and find high agreement between our implementation and the reference implementation. The mean DLMO point discrepancy between implementations was -2.1 +/- 11.1 minutes for the Blume et al. (2024) dataset and -1.482 +/- 21.7 for the Heinrichs and Spitschan (2024) dataset. Circular correlation coefficients were 0.986 and 0.964, respectively, and paired t-tests (p > 0.05) were not significant, suggesting no systematic difference or bias between the methods. dlmoR allows for the programmatic and batchable analysis of evening melatonin concentration data, enabling transparency and reproducibility of analytic techniques.

">Title: Cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of TRIM72 on ALS disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of RNA-binding proteins, including TDP-43 and FUS, has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we reported that a neuronal upregulation of TRIM72 (Tripartite Motif Containing 72) in FUS mutation knockin ALS models slows disease progression. TRIM72 interacts with Commander, a protein complex for recycling of membrane proteins, facilitating membrane repair and antioxidation. Exosomal TRIM72 is detected in ALS patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extracellular application of exosomal TRIM72 protects cell from membrane damage. In a sporadic ALS cohort, CSF TRIM72 level associates ALS disease progression. AAV-mediated neuronal expression of TRIM72 slows down the disease progressions in ALS models and in an ALS patient without adverse effects over a year treatment course. Taken together, our results suggest a universal neuronal protection of a TRIM family protein in cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners in ALS.

">Selective Targeting of Pathogenic Tau Seeds via a Novel VHH</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, progressive pathology has been linked to prion mechanisms, whereby ordered tau assemblies, or ''seeds,'' form in one cell and transit to neighboring or connected cells where they serve as templates for their own replication. Despite intensive efforts to develop early diagnosis and effective treatment, none has emerged. This is due partly to the structural heterogeneity of tau seeds and limitations in selectively targeting their pathogenic conformations. Here we report the discovery of a camelid variable heavy domain of heavy chain (VHH) that preferentially binds tau seeds of AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and PS19 tauopathy mouse brains. From a published synthetic VHH yeast display library, we identified VHH clones that bound 2N4R tau monomer. After counter-screening for immunoprecipitation of seeding from human brain, we identified two seed-selective anti-tau VHH--VHH(510) and VHH(50)--that preferentially bound pathological tau. We enhanced the stability of these VHHs through framework mutations without affecting their seed-binding characteristics. We characterized VHH(510) in detail, determining that it binds the carboxy terminus of tau, maintains robust seed avidity even in the presence of competing monomer, and stains pathological tau inclusions in mouse and human AD tissues. These results highlight the power of seed-selective VHH to bind pathogenic tau, paving the way for future therapeutic and diagnostic applications across a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders.

">Characterization of auditory responsive neurons in the mouse superior colliculus to naturalistic sounds</a></h4>

              
                Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that neurons use high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences (ILDs) to compute spatially restricted receptive fields (RFs), and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have rich spectral components; however, these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to naturalistic sounds and, in turn, compute a spatially restricted RF. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup calls and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to pup calls with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60 degrees in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal receptive field patterns and demonstrated that there are at least 4 distinct subtypes of auditory responsive SC neurons.

">Acoustic features of and behavioral responses to emotionally intense mouse vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Social vocalizations contain cues that reflect the motivational state of a vocalizing animal. Once perceived, these cues may in turn affect the internal state and behavioral responses of listening animals. Using the CBA/CAJ mouse model of acoustic communication, this study examined acoustic cues that signal intensity in male-female interactions, then compared behavioral responses to intense mating vocal sequences with those from another intense behavioral context, restraint. Experiment I in this study examined behaviors and vocalizations associated with male-female social interactions. Based on several behaviors, we distinguished more general, courtship-type interactions from mating interactions involving mounting or attempted mounting behaviors. We then compared vocalizations between courtship and mating. The increase in behavioral intensity from courtship to mating was associated with altered syllable composition, more harmonic structure, lower minimum frequency, longer duration, reduced inter-syllable interval, and increased sound intensity. We then used these features to construct highly salient playback stimuli associated with mating. In Experiment II, we compared behavioral responses to playback of these mating sequences with responses to playback of aversive vocal sequences produced by restrained mice, described in previous studies. Subjects were females in estrus and males. We observed a range of behavioral responses. Some (e.g., Attending and Stretch-Attend) showed similar responses across playback type and sex, while others were context dependent (e.g., Flinching, Locomotion). Still other behaviors showed either an effect of sex (e.g., Self-Grooming, Still-and-Alert) or an interaction between playback type and sex (Escape). These results demonstrate both state-dependent features of mouse vocalizations and their effectiveness in evoking a range of behavioral responses, independent of contextual cues provided by other sensory stimuli or behavioral interactions.

                Coastal organisms express daily and tidal rhythms of physiology and behaviour to adapt to their intertidal environments. Although the molecular-genetic basis of the circadian clocks driving daily rhythms is well understood, the nature and mechanism of circatidal clocks remain a mystery. Using fluorescent in situ hybridisation, we mapped discrete clusters of putative clock cells co-expressing canonical circadian clock genes across the brains of the intertidal crustaceans Eurydice pulchra and Parhyale hawaiensis. Tidally rhythmic, field-collected E. pulchra exhibited ~12-hour and ~24-hours rhythms of gene expression in discrete cell groups. Laboratory-reared P. hawaiensis entrained to 24-hour light:dark cycles (LD) and exhibiting daily behaviour exhibited robust 24-hour rhythms of gene expression in several cell groups. In P. hawaiensis showing circatidal behaviour following tidal entrainment by agitation cycles under LD, circadian gene expression was evident in some of the daily rhythmic cell groups, but cells in the dorsal-lateral cluster exhibited robust ~12-hour, i.e., circatidal, transcriptional rhythms. This oscillation was phased to the prior tidal agitation, not to LD. These brain networks of cell groups with circadian or circatidal periodicities tracking LD or tidal agitation, respectively, reveal a neural substrate for the interactive generation of rhythms appropriate to complex intertidal habitats.

                Given the same external input, one's understanding of that input can differ based on internal contextual knowledge. Where and how does the brain represent latent belief frameworks that interact with incoming sensory information to shape subjective interpretations? In this study, participants listened to the same auditory narrative twice, with a plot twist in the middle that dramatically shifted their interpretations of the story. Using a robust within-subject whole-brain approach, we leveraged shifts in neural activity between the two listens to identify where latent interpretations are represented in the brain. We considered the narrative in terms of its hierarchical structure, examining how global situation models and their subcomponents-namely, episodes and characters-are represented, finding that they rely on partially distinct sets of brain regions. Results suggest that our brains represent narratives hierarchically, with individual narrative elements being distinct and dynamically updated as a part of changing interpretations of incoming information.

There is initial evidence that the cerebellum contributes to fear extinction learning, i.e., the ability to learn that certain stimuli are no longer associated with an aversive outcome. So far, however, knowledge of the cerebellum's role in extinction is scarce. In the present study, 6 Hz cerebellar transcranial alternating current stimulation (ctACS) was used to modulate cerebellar function during extinction learning in young and healthy human participants in an MRI study. A two-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used with acquisition and extinction training being performed on day 1, and fear extinction recall being tested on day 2. 6 Hz ctACS reduced spontaneous recovery of the initial fear association during recall, stabilizing extinction effects compared to sham ctACS. fMRI data during recall revealed significantly reduced activation in cortical areas involved in initial fear acquisition, such as the anterior cingulate and insula, in the verum ctACS group compared to the sham group. During extinction training, on the other hand, the verum group exhibited more widespread cerebral activation compared to the sham group. Group differences were significant in occipital cortical areas. Although direct stimulation effects cannot be excluded, increased activation in the visual cortex may reflect enhanced encoding and processing of visual information during fear extinction learning. The findings suggest that theta-range oscillatory interactions between the cerebellum and cortical areas support extinction processes and provide causal evidence of the cerebellar role in the human fear extinction network.

">Deciphering Brain Organoids Heterogeneity by Identifying Key Quality Determinants</a></h4>

              
                Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold immense potential for modeling neurodevelopmental processes and disorders. However, undefined organoid selection criteria for analysis and their variability hinder reproducibility. As part of the Bavarian ForInter consortium, we generated 72 brain organoids from distinct hPSC lines. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of their morphological and cellular characteristics at an early stage of their development. In our assessment, the Feret diameter emerged as a reliable, single parameter that characterizes brain organoid quality. Transcriptomic analysis further confirmed the reliability of this marker and identified a negative impact of mesenchymal cells on the abundance of organoid formation. High-quality organoids consistently displayed a lower mesenchymal cell presence. These findings offer a framework for enhancing brain organoid standardization and reproducibility, underscoring the need for morphological quality controls and the consideration of mesenchymal cell influence on organoid-based modeling.

">Risk preferences causally rely on parietal magnitude representations: Evidence from combined TMS-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Risk preferences have traditionally been considered as stable traits that reflect subjective-valuation processes in prefrontal areas. More recently, however, it has been suggested that risk preferences may also be shaped by how choice problems are perceived and processed in perceptual brain regions. Specifically, the acuity of the parietal approximate number system (ANS), which encodes payoff magnitudes for different choice options, has been shown to correlate with both risk preferences and choice consistency. However, this correlational relationship leaves open the question whether parietal magnitude representations in fact causally underlie choice. Here, we provide direct evidence for such a key causal role of parietal magnitude representations in economic choice, using continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS), combined with functional MRI (fMRI) and numerical population receptive field (nPRF) modeling. Our stimulation protocol targeted numerosity-tuned regions in the right parietal cortex, identified through nPRF modeling of individual fMRI data (n=35; within-subject design). The stimulation successfully perturbed neural processing, as evidenced by decreased amplitude of numerical magnitude-tuned responses and less accurate multivariate decoding of presented magnitudes from unseen data that were not used for model fitting. In line with a perceptual account of risky choice, the reduction in neural information capacity was also reflected in noisier behavioral responses. Moreover, a computational cognitive model fitted to choice behavior revealed that perturbing the ANS specifically increased the noisiness of small-magnitude representations. This perturbation made small magnitudes to be perceived as larger than they actually are, leading to more risk-seeking behavior. Finally, individual estimates of the cTBS effect on cognitive noise correlated with the corresponding decrease in amplitude of numerical magnitude-tuned fMRI responses, further solidifying the role of the parietal ANS in economic choice. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the precision of parietal magnitude representations causally influences economic decision-making, with noisier encoding promoting biased risk-taking as formalized in recent perceptual models of risky choice.

">Integrated Multi-Omics Analyses of Synaptosomes Revealed Synapse-Centered Novel Targets in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimers disease (AD) caused by various factors such as Amyloid beta, p-tau, inflammation, and aging. However, the exact molecular mechanism of synapse dysfunction in AD is largely unknown. To understand this, we comprehensively analyzed the synaptosome fraction in postmortem brain samples from AD patients and cognitively normal individuals. We conducted high-throughput transcriptomic analyses to identify changes in microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA levels in synaptosomes extracted from the brains of both unaffected individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of synaptosomal proteins in the same sample group. These analyses revealed significant differences in the levels of miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins between the groups. To further understand the pathways or molecules involved, we used an integrated omics approach and studied the molecular interactions of deregulated synapse miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins in the samples from individuals with AD and the control group, which demonstrated the impact of deregulated miRNAs on their target mRNAs and proteins. Furthermore, the DIABLO analysis highlighted complex relationships between mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins that could be key in understanding the pathophysiology of AD. Our study identified synapse-centered novel candidates that could be critical in restoring synapse dysfunction in AD.

">Characterizing Oligodendrocyte-Lineage Cells and Myelination in the Basolateral Amygdala: Insights from a Novel Methodology in Postmortem Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders and trauma, yet oligodendrocyte-lineage cells and myelin in this brain region remain understudied in humans. This might be due, at least in part, to the lack of a cost-effective, antibody-based method to isolate oligodendrocytes (OL) and OL precursor cells (OPC) from postmortem brain tissue that is compatible with molecular biology applications. This study aimed to: 1) create and validate a method for isolating OPC and OL nuclei from frozen postmortem grey matter; 2) compare OPC and OL gene expression in the BLA between subjects having died with depression and matched controls; and 3) provide histological characterizations of OPC, OL, and myelin in the BLA. Frozen left-hemisphere BLA samples were obtained from brain donors with well-characterized phenotypic information. Immunolabeled nuclei were sorted into OPC (SOX10+/CRYAB-) and OL (SOX10+/CRYAB+) populations, and RNA was measured using a custom Nanostring codeset. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to determine OPC (PDGFR+) and OL (MYRF+) densities, and immunofluorescence was used to label axons (NF-H) and myelin (MBP) for myelin area fraction. The method successfully isolated OPC and OL nuclei with correct transcriptomic profiles. While no significant group differences were observed in gene expression, cell densities, or myelin coverage, we did observe significant age-related patterns. Moreover, a strong significant correlation between OL density and myelin area fraction was identified. This study provides a novel sorting method and a comprehensive characterization of OL-lineage gene expression, cell densities, and myelin in the human BLA.

">Dynamic face-related eye movement representations in the human ventral pathway</a></h4>

              
                Multiple brain areas along the ventral pathway have been known to represent face images. Here, in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment, we show dynamic representations of face-related eye movements in the ventral pathway in the absence of image perception. Participants followed a dot presented on a uniform background, the movement of which represented gaze tracks acquired previously during their free-viewing of face and house pictures. We found a dominant role of the ventral stream in representing face-related gaze tracks, starting from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and extending to the medial temporal and ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Our findings show that the ventral pathway represents the gaze tracks used to explore faces, by which top-down prediction of face category in OFC and ATL may guide, via the medial temporal cortex or directly, face perception in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex.

">Noise Correlations in Balanced Networks with Unreliable Synapses</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic physiology is highly stochastic in the neocortex: immediately following an action potential, individual synapses release neurotransmitter unreliably, sometimes even failing to release any vesicles. However, theoretical models of neuronal networks typically neglect this well-established feature of biology, especially recurrent networks. In this work, to better understand the effects of synaptic unreliability in recurrent networks, we describe neuronal variability in a balanced network model of non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons incorporating a simple Bernoulli model of synaptic release. For arbitrary network size, synaptic unreliability contributes non-negligibly to spike count variability. Most notably, this additional noise is overshadowed by effects on noise correlations. In particular, we find that feedforward and recurrent synaptic reliability have opposite influences on noise correlations: while increased reliability of synaptic input from neurons outside of the network increase correlations, reliability of recurrent synapses de-correlates population activity. We explain this dichotomy by examining the average input currents to cell pairs, and verify this effect with simulations of exponential integrate-and-fire neurons with adaptation and conductance-based synapses. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of synaptic unreliability in the study of noise correlations.

">EEG correlates of active removal from working memory</a></h4>

              
                The removal of no-longer-relevant information from visual working memory (WM) is important for the functioning of WM, given its severe capacity limitation. Previously, with an "ABC-retrocuing" WM task, we have shown that removing information can be accomplished in different ways: by simply withdrawing attention from the newly irrelevant memory item (IMI; i.e., via "passive removal"); or by or "actively" removing the IMI from WM (Shan and Postle, 2022). Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms behind active removal, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from human subjects (both sexes) performing the ABC-retrocuing task. Specifically, we tested the hijacked adaptation model, which posits that active removal is accomplished by a top-down-triggered down-modulation of the gain of perceptual circuits, such that sensory channels tuned to the to-be-removed information become less sensitive. Behaviorally, analyses revealed that, relative to passive removal, active removal produced a decline in the familiarity landscape centered on the IMI. Neurally, we focused on two epochs of the task, corresponding to the triggering, and to the consequence, of active removal. With regard to triggering, we observed a stronger anterior-to-posterior traveling wave for active versus passive removal. With regard to the consequence(s) of removal, the response to a task-irrelevant "ping" was reduced for active removal, as assessed with ERP and with posterior-to-anterior traveling waves, suggesting that active removal led to decreased excitability in perceptual circuits centered on the IMI.

">Astrocyte and mitochondrial footprints in brain-derived extracellular vesicles predict tau pathology</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal tau aggregation, with primary 3R (e.g., Picks disease, PiD) and 4R (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP) variants posing a significant diagnostic challenge. Here, we examined brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BD-EVs) isolated from the prefrontal cortex of PiD (3R), PSP (4R), and non-demented controls (CTRL) to determine if these vesicles reflect disease-specific proteomic signatures. We found that while tau pathology does not substantially alter BD-EV concentration or the enrichment of core vesicular markers, it does influence their size distribution and protein cargo. BD-EV samples from PiD patients exhibited a greater abundance of small vesicles and distinct protein profiles when compared to PSP and CTRL. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified four key protein modules to account for variance between patient groups Endoplasmic Reticulum, Mitochondria, Microtubules, and Trivalent Inorganic Cation Transport. In PiD, astrocyte-derived mitochondrial proteins were significantly elevated, whereas neuronal microtubule-related proteins were diminished relative to both PSP and CTRL. Notably, changes in the mitochondrion and microtubule modules enhanced the detection of PiD pathology. Cellular origin annotation revealed a marked shift in BD-EV composition: PiD samples exhibited an increased astrocytic signature, while both PiD and PSP showed a reduction in neuronal proteins compared to CTRL. Crucially, the enrichment of astrocytic mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum proteins, alongside reduced neuronal proteins, correlated strongly with the severity of tau pathology (AT8-stained aggregates) in patient brains. These findings demonstrate that BD-EVs capture tau isoform-specific cellular and molecular alterations, offering a window into disease mechanisms at the neuron-glia interface. By linking distinct protein signatures and their cellular origins to tau pathology severity, our results highlight the potential of BD-EV profiling as a biomarker strategy for distinguishing between and monitoring the progression of 3R and 4R tauopathies.

">Peripheral alcohol metabolism dictates ethanol consumption and drinking microstructure in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ethanol metabolism is intimately linked with the physiological and behavioral aspects of ethanol consumption. Ethanol is mainly oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to acetaldehyde and further to acetate via aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). Understanding how ethanol and its metabolites work together to initiate and drive continued ethanol consumption is crucial for identifying interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Therefore, the goal of our study was to determine how ADH1, which is mainly peripherally-expressed and metabolizes >90% of ingested ethanol, modulates ethanol metabolite distribution and downstream behaviors. Methods: Ethanol consumption in drinking-in-the-dark (DID) and two-bottle choice (2BC) drinking paradigms, ethanol metabolite concentrations, and lickometry were assessed after ADH1 inhibition and/or in Adh1-knockout (Adh1 KO) mice. Results: We found that Adh1 KO mice of both sexes exhibited decreased ethanol consumption and preference compared to wild-type (WT) mice in DID and 2BC. ADH1 inhibitor fomepizole (4-MP) also significantly decreased normal and sweetened ethanol consumption in DID studies. Measurement of ethanol and its metabolites revealed that ethanol was increased at 1h but not 15 min, peripheral acetaldehyde was slightly decreased at both time points, and ethanol-induced increases in acetate were abolished after ethanol administration in Adh1 KO mice compared to controls. Similarly, ethanol accumulation as a function of consumption was 2-fold higher in Adh1 KO or 4-MP treated mice compared to controls. We then used lickometry to determine how this perturbation in ethanol metabolism affects drinking microstructure. Adh1 KO mice consume most of their ethanol in the first 30 min like WT mice but display altered temporal shifts in drinking behaviors and do not form normal bout structures, resulting in lower ethanol consumption. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that ADH1-mediated ethanol metabolism is a key determinant of ethanol consumption, highlighting a fundamental knowledge gap around how ethanol and its metabolites drive ethanol consumption.

By using a fluorescent dye loading assay, whole cell patch clamp recordings and real time measurement of ATP release via GRABATP we have demonstrated that Cx43 hemichannels open in a highly CO2 sensitive manner over the range 20 to 70 mmHg. Mutational analysis confirms that the equivalent residues to those in Cx26 that have been shown to be involved in mediating the effects of CO2 on gating of hemichannels and gap junction channels, also mediate Cx43 hemichannel gating. Our data predicts that Cx43 will be partially open and able to release ATP at resting physiological levels of PCO2. We have tested this prediction in acute hippocampal slices, by showing that CO2-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission can be blocked by the Cx43-selective mimetic peptide Gap26. Our data resolves an inconsistency in the literature between in vivo studies suggesting that Cx43 hemichannels are at least partially open at rest, and in vitro studies, performed in the absence of HCO3-/CO2 buffering that show Cx43 hemichannels are shut. Our evidence suggests that the ancestral gene that duplicated to give the alpha and beta connexin clades must have possessed the carbamylation motif. CO2 sensitivity is thus a fundamental ancient characteristic of several connexins that has been lost in more recently derived members of this gene family.

">Glucocerebrosidase Deficiency Dysregulates Human Astrocyte Lipid Metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, is the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the consequence of reduced enzyme activity within neural cell sub-types remains ambiguous. Thus, the purpose of this study was to define the effect of GCase deficiency specifically in human astrocytes and test their non-cell autonomous influence upon dopaminergic neurons in a midbrain organoid model of PD. Methods: Wild-type (GBA+/+), N370S mutant (GBA+/N370), and GBA1 knockout (GBA-/-) astrocytes were rapidly and directly induced from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) via transcription factor-based differentiation. These astrocytes were extensively characterized for GCase-dependent phenotypes using immunocytochemistry, organoid coculture, enzymatic assays, lipid tracers, transcriptomics, and lipidomics. Results: hPSC lines were rapidly induced into astrocytes and enzymatic assays confirmed that GBA-/- astrocytes completely lacked GCase activity, while GBA+/N370 preserved partial activity. GBA-/-, but not GBA+/N370S, exhibited lysosomal alterations, with enlarged lysosomes and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) accumulation. GCase deficiency also exacerbated TNF-alpha-induced secretion of the inflammatory biomarker, CCL2. In midbrain organoids, GCase activity did not modulate the ability of astrocytes to support dopamine neuron production and survival. Lipidomics revealed a GBA-/--specific increase in sphingomyelin, and a decrease of triglycerides. Direct rescue of GCase activity with GBA1 mRNA treatment reduced GlcCer accumulation. Astrocytes exhibited a relatively high uptake and storage of fatty acid analogs as lipid droplets, in comparison to neurons, and this process was impaired in GBA-/- astrocytes. Lastly, GBA-/- astrocytes accumulate neuronal membrane-derived GlcCer. These findings highlight the critical role of astrocytic GCase in lipid metabolism and its neuronal influence. Conclusion: GCase deficiency does not inhibit human astrocyte differentiation nor cause a non-cell autonomous neurotoxic effect upon dopaminergic neurons within midbrain organoids. However, it does elicit enhanced inflammatory reactivity, accumulation of GlcCer, and a distinct lipidomic profile, indicating impaired lipid metabolism in astrocytes that can dysregulate neuron-astrocyte intercellular signaling. Overall, these insights underscore dysfunctional astrocyte lipid metabolism as a high priority therapeutic target in Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.

">Eyes-closed resting state EEG reveals clearer and more stable group differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals than eyes-open resting state EEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: Resting-state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) has been widely used to explore neural dynamics in Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). However, inconsistencies in findings across studies remain a challenge, partly due to variations in brain state, such as eye conditions (eyes-open vs. eyes-closed). This study aims to examine rs-EEG differences between ASC and neurotypical (NT) participants, focusing on the influence of eye condition. Methods: A total of 300 participants (126 ASC) were included. Rs-EEG data were analysed across eyes-open, eyes-closed, and difference between eye conditions, with 726 variables assessed per participant. Linear regression and effect size (partial2 ) were used to identify group differences, complemented by cluster-based permutation testing and bootstrapped split-half validation for reliability. Results: Group differences were most pronounced in the eyes-closed condition, particularly for relative power and multiscale entropy (MSE). Compared to neurotypical participants, ASC participants exhibited reduced frontal coarse-scale MSE, increased delta power, and decreased alpha power, suggesting altered local-global neural dynamics. Cross-validation revealed greater reliability of effects in the eyes-closed condition compared to eyes-open or difference between eye conditions. Conclusions: Eye condition plays a critical role in detecting rs-EEG differences between ASC and NT groups, with the eyes-closed condition yielding more consistent and pronounced effects. These findings highlight the importance of controlling brain state in rs-EEG studies and suggest that integrating eye condition effects with other biomarkers may improve identification of neural differences associated with ASC.

">Constructing Biologically Constrained RNNs via Dale's Backprop and Topologically-Informed Pruning</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have emerged as a prominent tool for modeling cortical function, and yet their conventional architecture is lacking in physiological and anatomical fidelity. In particular, these models often fail to incorporate two crucial biological constraints: i) Dale's law, i.e., sign constraints that preserve the "type" of projections from individual neurons, and ii) Structured connectivity motifs, i.e., highly sparse yet defined connections amongst various neuronal populations. Both constraints are known to impair learning performance in artificial neural networks, especially when trained to perform complicated tasks; but as modern experimental methodologies allow us to record from diverse neuronal populations spanning multiple brain regions, using RNN models to study neuronal interactions without incorporating these fundamental biological properties raises questions regarding the validity of the insights gleaned from them. To address these concerns, our work develops methods that let us train RNNs which respect Dale's law whilst simultaneously maintaining a specific sparse connectivity pattern across the entire network. We provide mathematical grounding and guarantees for our approaches incorporating both types of constraints, and show empirically that our models match the performance of RNNs trained without any constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our methods for inferring multi-regional interactions by training RNN models of the cortical network to reconstruct 2-photon calcium imaging data during visual behaviour in mice, whilst enforcing data-driven, cell-type specific connectivity constraints between various neuronal populations spread across multiple cortical layers and brain areas. In doing so, we find that the interactions inferred by our model corroborate experimental findings in agreement with the theory of predictive coding, thus validating the applicability of our methods.

">MicroRNA-502-3p modulates the GABA A subunits, synaptic proteins and mitochondrial morphology in hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNA-502-3p (MiR-502-3p), a synapse enriched miRNA is considerably implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD). Our previous study found the high expression level of miR-502-3p in AD synapses relative to controls. Further, miR-502-3p was found to modulate the GABAergic synapse function via modulating the GABA A receptor subunit -1 (GABRA1) protein. The current study is attempted to examine the impact of miR-502-3p on other GABA subunit proteins, synaptic proteins, mitochondrial morphology and other hippocampal neuron genes. Mouse hippocampal neuronal (HT22) cells were transfected with miR-502-3p overexpression (OE) vector, miR-502-3p sponge (suppression) vector and scramble control vector. MiR-502-3p vectors transfection was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. MiR-502-3p expression and GABRA1 expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR and miRNAScope in-situ hybridization. GABA A subunit and synaptic proteins were studied by immunoblotting analysis and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Further, Affymetrix gene array analysis was conducted in miR-502-3p overexpressed and suppressed cells. Our results observed that elevated miR-502-3p, negatively modulates the GABRA1 level. The levels of GABA A subunit and synaptic proteins were reduced by ectopic expression of miR-502-3p and increase by miR-502-3p suppression. The mitochondrial morphology was found to be improved in-terms of their number and length in miR-502-3p suppressed cells. Further, Gene array analysis unveiled the deregulation of several genes by miR-502-3p, which are associated with oxidative stress, immune response and synaptic function. These results provide new insights and an update to understand the biological roles of miR-502-3p in regulation of neuron function and synaptic activity.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Objective memory decline is associated with poor quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD, but it is unclear what role perception of memory (metamemory) plays. The Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) measures metamemory and is proposed to have a three-factor structure, but the factor structure of the MMQ in PD has not been explored. The current study examined (i) the factor structure of the MMQ in PD and (ii) the relationship between the metamemory and QOL in PD. Methods: This longitudinal, observational study involved 149 participants with PD (98 males, M age = 65.78 years, SD = 9.25). Participants completed the MMQ and the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (disease severity) at baseline, and the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire-39 (QOL) two years later. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed both the three-factor and four-factor models were inadequate. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a four-factor solution. The contentment and ability subscales from the original factor structure remained, while the strategies subscale was divided into external strategies and internal strategies. Disease severity, ability, and internal strategies uniquely predicted QOL. Individuals who reported low subjective memory ability and high use of internal strategies reported worse QOL two years later. Conclusions: These findings indicate that metamemory predicts QOL in PD and suggest that improved perceived memory ability and strategy use could offer avenues for improved QOL.</p>

	<p>Background: This study examined the prevalence of mental health issues among Paraguayan researchers and their relationships with emotional regulation and psychosocial factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 235 researchers was conducted using validated instruments: the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21); the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ); and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Sociodemographic, academic, and behavioral variables were also analyzed. Results: Findings revealed significant rates of depression (26.4%), anxiety (30.6%), and stress (32.3%), with female researchers reporting nearly twice the rates of anxiety and stress compared to males. Researchers with doctoral degrees exhibited lower anxiety levels, emphasizing the protective role of advanced academic qualifications. Conversely, younger and early-career researchers were more vulnerable to psychological distress. High job demands and emotional dysregulation were strongly associated with poorer mental health outcomes, while hazardous alcohol consumption and low physical activity further exacerbated risks. Conclusions: These findings highlight the urgent need for institutional reforms to prioritize mental health and well-being in academic environments. By advancing the understanding of occupational health in resource-limited settings, this study provides actionable recommendations to improve the working conditions and mental health of researchers in Paraguay and beyond.</p>

     alt="Neurological and Cognitive Effects of Hypothyroidism in Patients With Epilepsy: A Study on Anti-Seizure Medicines Therapy"/>
<p>The study's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of neurological disorders and cognitive pathologies in hypothyroidism and epilepsy patients undergoing anti-seizure medicines therapy. The study findings underscore the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate therapy in managing cognitive and neurological impairments in patients with hypothyroidism and epilepsy. To enhance clinical practice, specific measures that could be implemented include integrating routine cognitive assessments into the standard care of patients with thyroid dysfunction and personalizing treatment protocols based on individual risk factors such as hormone levels, family history, and stress indicators.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to examine neurological disorders and cognitive impairments in patients with secondary hypothyroidism and epilepsy undergoing treatment with antiepileptic medications. The study included 184 patients divided into three groups: Group 1 (subclinical hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 60), Group 2 (manifest hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 64), and Group 3 (control, <i>n</i> = 60). Patients in Group 2 received levothyroxine therapy (initial dose of 25 μg/day, titrated to 50–100 μg/day), while Groups 1 and 2 were treated with anti-seizure medications (valproic acid, 40 mg/kg/day).

     alt="Ultrastructural Localization of Glutamate Delta Receptor 1 in the Rodent and Primate Lateral Habenula"/>
<p>In this study, we used immunoelectron microscopic methods combined with tract-tracing approaches to demonstrate that GluD1 is primarily expressed in the core of symmetric synapses formed by GABAergic terminals that originate from the lateral hypothalamus and entopeduncular nucleus in the rodent and primate lateral habenula.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamate delta receptor 1 (GluD1) is a unique synaptogenic molecule expressed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure that regulates negative reward prediction error and major monoaminergic systems, is enriched in GluD1. LHb dysfunction has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, both of which are associated with <i>GRID1</i>, the gene that encodes GluD1. Thus, disruption in GluD1 synaptic signaling may contribute to LHb dysfunction and the pathophysiology of LHb-associated disorders. Despite its strong cellular expression, little is known about the subsynaptic and subcellular localization of GluD1 in LHb neurons. Given that GluD1 is involved in the development and/or regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in various brain regions, a detailed map of GluD1 synaptic localization is essential to elucidate its role in the LHb. To address this issue, we used immunoelectron microscopy methods in rodents and monkeys. In both species, GluD1 immunoreactivity was primarily expressed in dendritic profiles, with lower expression in somata, spines, and glial elements. Pre- and post-embedding immunogold experiments revealed strong GluD1 expression in the core of symmetric GABAergic synapses. Albeit less frequent, GluD1 was also found at the edges (i.e., perisynaptic) of asymmetric, putative glutamatergic synapses. Through the combination of anterograde tracing with immunogold labeling in rats, we showed that axon terminals from the entopeduncular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus express postsynaptic GluD1 immunolabeling in the LHb. Our findings suggest that GluD1 may play a critical role in modulating GABAergic transmission in the rodent and primate LHb.</p>

	<p>Background: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most dreaded complication after reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57&amp;amp;ndash;1.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78&amp;amp;ndash;1.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80&amp;amp;ndash;2.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27&amp;amp;ndash;24.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90&amp;amp;ndash;1.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;2.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes. Concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis and the use of MT in the extended therapeutic window do not raise the risk of sICH.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have shown that multiple post-traumatic irradiations of the cochlea with near-infrared light (NIR) can significantly reduce noise-induced hearing loss. However, a single NIR pre-treatment was shown to have the same effect. Extending the pre-treatment time did not result in any further reduction in hearing loss. The present study investigated whether a combined NIR pre- and post-treatment had an increased effect on hearing preservation. Methods: Frequency-specific auditory brainstem potential thresholds (ABR) were determined in young adult mice. One group (n = 8) underwent NIR irradiation (808 nm, 120 mW, 15 min) of the cochlea, followed by a 30 min noise exposure (5&amp;amp;ndash;20 kHz, 115 dB SPL). A post-NIR treatment was administered for 30 min immediately following the noise trauma. After 14 days, hearing loss was determined by ABR measurements. The results were compared with a trauma-only group (n = 8) and an untreated control group (n = 5). Subsequently, the spiral ganglion neuron density was investigated. Results: A peri-traumatic NIR treatment resulted in a significantly lower hearing loss compared to the trauma-only group. Hearing protection in these animals significantly exceeded the effect of an exclusive pre- or post-treatment across all frequencies. A loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the trauma-only group was observed, which was significantly rescued by the peri-traumatic NIR treatment. Conclusions: A single peri-traumatic NIR treatment seems to be the more effective approach for the preservation of hearing thresholds after noise trauma compared to an isolated pre- or post-treatment. One target of the protective effect seems to be the spiral ganglion.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by cardinal motor features and a multitude of non-motor manifestations. Among them, cognitive impairment in PD has been recognised as a defined clinical entity, and it might lead to an increased risk of developing dementia. Consequently, the present review aimed to ascertain the available interventions for the training of cognitive abilities in persons with PD (PwPD). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to select studies in the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers conducted the different phases of the review, and a third expert was called in to address any doubts/conflicts. Randomised controlled trials and randomised clinical trials concerning cognitive training with cognitive outcomes in PwPD were selected. Results: A total of 28 articles were included. The considered studies applied various experimental interventions for the training of cognitive functions in PwPD: computer-based platforms, exergames, paper-and-pencil programmes, dual-task or treadmill training with action observation therapy, motor imagery, and virtual reality components, interventions targeting precise cognitive domain, tele-rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation, structured cognitive training, and multimodal treatments. Cognitive functions were assessed employing neuropsychological tests, self-report questionnaires, and computerised batteries. Conclusions: Overall, the review reported better performances in the experimental groups compared to the control groups, in several cognitive domains. Structured cognitive training emerged as the most effective strategy to enhance cognitive functioning in PwPD. However, further studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate and useful training and to develop interventions that also consider patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life.</p>

	<p>Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data pose significant challenges due to their inherently noisy and complex nature, making traditional statistical models less effective in capturing predictive features. While deep learning models offer superior performance through their non-linear capabilities, they often lack transparency, reducing trust in their predictions. This study introduces the Time Reversal (TR) pretraining method to address these challenges. TR aims to learn temporal dependencies in data, leveraging large datasets for pretraining and applying this knowledge to improve schizophrenia classification on smaller datasets. Methods: We pretrained an LSTM-based model with attention using the TR approach, focusing on learning the direction of time in fMRI data, achieving over 98 % accuracy on HCP and UK Biobank datasets. For downstream schizophrenia classification, TR-pretrained weights were transferred to models evaluated on FBIRN, COBRE, and B-SNIP datasets. Saliency maps were generated using Integrated Gradients (IG) to provide post hoc explanations for pretraining, while Earth Mover&amp;amp;rsquo;s Distance (EMD) quantified the temporal dynamics of salient features in the downstream tasks. Results: TR pretraining significantly improved schizophrenia classification performance across all datasets: median AUC scores increased from 0.7958 to 0.8359 (FBIRN), 0.6825 to 0.7778 (COBRE), and 0.6341 to 0.7224 (B-SNIP). The saliency maps revealed more concentrated and biologically meaningful salient features along the time axis, aligning with the episodic nature of schizophrenia. TR consistently outperformed baseline pretraining methods, including OCP and PCL, in terms of AUC, balanced accuracy, and robustness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the dual benefits of the TR method: enhanced predictive performance and improved interpretability. By aligning model predictions with meaningful temporal patterns in brain activity, TR bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical relevance. These findings emphasize the potential of explainable AI tools for aiding clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in conditions characterized by disrupted temporal dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0418-24.2024?rss=1">Functional Regrowth of Norepinephrine Axons in the Adult Mouse Brain Following Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin <I>N</I>-(2-chloroethyl)-<I>N</I>-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons or NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3&ndash;5&nbsp;weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0419-24.2024?rss=1">Interaction between Facial Expression and Color in Modulating ERP P3</a></h4>

              
                <p>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence selective attention and brain activity contributed to selective attention remains unclear. For example, reddish angry faces increase emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether brain activity and selective attention are similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, facial expression or facial color had no significant main effect or interaction effect on P1 amplitudes for the target, and facial expression had significant main effects only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the interaction between facial expression and color modulates the P3 associated with selective attention. Moreover, the response enhancement resulting from this interaction appears to occur at a cognitive processing stage that follows the processing stage associated with facial color or expression alone. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                Introduction Recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improvements in clinical trial design have reinvigorated the potential for agents developed in preclinical studies to be translated into new therapeutic agents, as well as highlighting the need for improved and effective means of measuring neuropathy in preclinical and clinical research. A systematic review of the literature on the methods of measuring the severity of DPN and the association of the results of each method with diabetic retinopathy would contribute positively to the above developments. Methods The intended scoping review will be aligned, in combination, with the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and the framework proposed by Peters et al. in 2015. The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases will be searched, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. The search strategy will include the following sequence of Boolean terms and operators: (“retinopathy” OR “eye disease” OR “eye disease” OR “maculopathy” OR “retinal” OR “macular”) AND “neuropathy” and for the title/abstract or abstract only “severity” AND (“diabetes” OR “diabetic”). The yielded publications will be screened according to criteria. This will be followed by data extraction, synthesis and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. Discussion The different ways of measuring the severity of peripheral neuropathy identified in the previous literature will be discussed, as well as the association of neuropathy and/or its severity with retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The main aim of the discussion will be to elucidate the role of different methods of measuring the severity of DPN and its association with retinopathy. Registration The protocol has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-65/v1?src=rss">Work Alienation and Whistleblowing Intention: The Mediating and Moderating Role of Religious Political Orientation and Social Value Orientation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background This study investigates how perceived work alienation influences whistleblowing intention, with religious political orientation as a mediator and social value orientation as a moderator. Previous research has shown work alienation negatively correlates with prosocial behavior and activism while positively correlating with knowledge hiding. The study proposes that work alienation negatively predicts whistleblowing intention, with both religious political orientation and social value orientation playing influential roles in this relationship. Methods Predictive correlational design with a mediation and moderation analysis was used in this study. The participants of this study were 263 Indonesians (131 males, 132 females; M age = 25.91 years old; SD age = 5.47 years). Results The findings confirm that higher work alienation leads to lower whistleblowing intention. While religious political orientation did not significantly mediate the relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention as hypothesized, the study revealed that prosocial-type social value orientation weakens the negative relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention. The individualistic type showed no significant moderating effect. Conclusion The research demonstrates that work alienation significantly predicts whistleblowing intention, with prosocial social value orientation serving as a buffer against the negative effects of work alienation on whistleblowing intention. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological factors influencing whistleblowing behavior in corruption prevention and eradication efforts.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers especially in the Indian population considering its varied ethnicity and lifestyle practices. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers therefore demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health in the Indian population. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices. By promoting collaborative care approaches, these educational resources can contribute to better preventive practices, potentially reducing the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations in individuals with diabetes.

                Background The deductive system of BCL-algebra has not been thoroughly explored, and its fuzzification remains undefined. This study aims to the association of this gap by introducing a fuzzy extension of the deductive system of BCL-algebra using Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Methods We define a Pythagorean fuzzy set as a pair of membership and non-membership functions, where the sum of their squares lies between 0 and 1. These functions are used to extend the classical deductive system of BCL-algebra, allowing for reasoning based on fuzzy degrees. The system incorporates fuzzy operations such as union, intersection, and complement, while maintaining the structure of BCL-algebra. We also introduce key components such as the accuracy function, score function, degree of indeterminacy, and square deviation to measure the certainty, truth, uncertainty, and deviation of fuzzy sets. Results We prove that the intersection of two Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems remains a valid Pythagorean fuzzy deductive system within BCL-algebra. However, we show that the union of such systems does not necessarily form a valid fuzzy deductive system. The study also provides detailed proofs using induction, logical derivations, and algebraic techniques. Conclusion The results disclose that while the intersection of Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems preserves the system's structure, the union does not, offering new insights into the behavior and limitations of fuzzy systems in BCL-algebra.

                Introduction Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2methods: manuel on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results 25patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods(p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age(>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. Conclusion TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.

                <p>by Ahmed Daoud, Asa Ben-Hur</p>

Complex deep learning models trained on very large datasets have become key enabling tools for current research in natural language processing and computer vision. By providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific applications, they enable researchers to create accurate models with minimal effort and computational resources. Large scale genomics deep learning models come in two flavors: the first are large language models of DNA sequences trained in a self-supervised fashion, similar to the corresponding natural language models; the second are supervised learning models that leverage large scale genomics datasets from ENCODE and other sources. We argue that these models are the equivalent of foundation models in natural language processing in their utility, as they encode within them chromatin state in its different aspects, providing useful representations that allow quick deployment of accurate models of gene regulation. We demonstrate this premise by leveraging the recently created Sei model to develop simple, interpretable models of intron retention, and demonstrate their advantage over models based on the DNA language model DNABERT-2. Our work also demonstrates the impact of chromatin state on the regulation of intron retention. Using representations learned by Sei, our model is able to discover the involvement of transcription factors and chromatin marks in regulating intron retention, providing better accuracy than a recently published custom model developed for this purpose.

Transfer learning aims to integrate useful information from multi-source datasets to improve the learning performance of target data. This can be effectively applied in genomics when we learn the gene associations in a target tissue, and data from other tissues can be integrated. However, heavy-tail distribution and outliers are common in genomics data, which poses challenges to the effectiveness of current transfer learning approaches. In this paper, we study the transfer learning problem under high-dimensional linear models with t-distributed error (Trans-PtLR), which aims to improve the estimation and prediction of target data by borrowing information from useful source data and offering robustness to accommodate complex data with heavy tails and outliers. In the oracle case with known transferable source datasets, a transfer learning algorithm based on penalized maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization algorithm is established. To avoid including non-informative sources, we propose to select the transferable sources based on cross-validation. Extensive simulation experiments as well as an application demonstrate that Trans-PtLR demonstrates robustness and better performance of estimation and prediction when heavy-tail and outliers exist compared to transfer learning for linear regression model with normal error distribution.

Computational models are complex scientific constructs that have become essential for us to better understand the world. Many models are valuable for peers within and beyond disciplinary boundaries. However, there are no widely agreed-upon standards for sharing models. This paper suggests 10 simple rules for you to both (i) ensure you share models in a way that is at least “good enough,” and (ii) enable others to lead the change towards better model-sharing practices.

                <p>by Julien Laussu, Deborah Michel, Léa Magne, Stephane Segonds, Steven Marguet, Dimitri Hamel, Muriel Quaranta-Nicaise, Frederick Barreau, Emmanuel Mas, Vincent Velay, Florian Bugarin, Audrey Ferrand</p>

Understanding the interplay between biology and mechanics in tissue architecture is challenging, particularly in terms of 3D tissue organization. Addressing this challenge requires a biological model enabling observations at multiple levels from cell to tissue, as well as theoretical and computational approaches enabling the generation of a synthetic model that is relevant to the biological model and allowing for investigation of the mechanical stresses experienced by the tissue. Using a monolayer human colon epithelium organoid as a biological model, freely available tools (Fiji, Cellpose, Napari, Morphonet, or Tyssue library), and the commercially available Abaqus FEM solver, we combined vertex and FEM approaches to generate a comprehensive viscoelastic finite element model of the human colon organoid and demonstrated its flexibility. We imaged human colon organoid development for 120 hours, following the evolution of the organoids from an immature to a mature morphology. According to the extracted architectural/geometric parameters of human colon organoids at various stages of tissue architecture establishment, we generated organoid active vertex models. However, this approach did not consider the mechanical aspects involved in the organoids’ morphological evolution. Therefore, we applied a finite element method considering mechanical loads mimicking osmotic pressure, external solicitation, or active contraction in the vertex model by using the Abaqus FEM solver. Integration of finite element analysis (FEA) into the vertex model achieved a better fit with the biological model. Therefore, the FEM model provides a basis for depicting cell shape, tissue deformation, and cellular-level strain due to imposed stresses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a combination of vertex and FEM approaches, combining geometrical and mechanical parameters, improves modeling of alterations in organoid morphology over time and enables better assessment of the mechanical cues involved in establishing the architecture of the human colon epithelium.

                <p>by Steffen N. Lindner, Markus Ralser</p>

The structure of the early metabolic network is unknown. Here, we report that when considered together, pentose utilization pathways form all life-essential precursors. We speculate that the chemistry preserved in pentose metabolism could therefore have been a central structural element in early metabolism.

                This study explored the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce across Nigeria and selected developing countries, applying a holistic health perspective through a structured review and quantitative synthesis of available research published between 2006 and 2022. Following PRISMA standards, a pre-specified protocol for the review was designed and documented in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42024521833). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases yielded 12 eligible studies. Data were extracted using standardized protocols, and pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model. The overall prevalence was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3-10.8%), with higher contamination in West Africa (10.5%) compared to Southeast Asia (5.2%). Leafy vegetables exhibited the highest contamination (12.1%). Molecular detection via PCR had higher detecting sensitivity (11.6%) compared to traditional culture methods (7.3%). The analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 97.79%, p < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in the reported prevalence of Listeria spp. Environmental factors, such as temperature and poor agricultural practices, contributed to contamination. These findings underscore the need for robust hygiene controls and monitoring to mitigate L. monocytogenes risks in fresh produce.

                Ayurveda is one of the oldest holistic healthcare approaches in the world, underpinning the interdependency of mind, body, and spirit in encouraging harmony and preventing disease. The safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda were explored systematically through this review in various global contexts, including its historical development, current practice, and epidemiological trends. This study assesses the integration of Ayurveda into healthcare systems by analyzing experiences in India, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East and its potential to contribute to global health challenges. As Ayurveda’s originator, India has established a robust regulatory framework, extensive clinical research, and government policy support for its integration into mainstream medicine. Evidence supports the efficacy of Ayurvedic therapies, such as Panchakarma and herbal formulations, for treating chronic diseases with minimal side effects. Ayurveda has entered the fold of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States and Germany. Ayurveda treatments have been shown to be effective in various conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis, although regulatory inconsistencies and quality assurance remain significant barriers. There is a cultural affinity towards traditional medicine in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, leading to a growing adoption supported by collaborative initiatives and research. Despite the globally relevant Ayurveda, the non-uniform nature of regulatory standards, lack of large-scale clinical trials, and standardization of formulations form barriers to its more general acceptance. Recommendations for the future include fostering interdisciplinary research, harmonizing regulation, and leveraging digital health in furthering personalized medicine. This study underscores Ayurveda’s transformative potential in global healthcare, advocating sustainable, patient-centered solutions to address chronic and emerging health issues.

                Background Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Epidemiological data have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as an exogenous risk factor for ALS; however, the mechanisms by which TBI may worsen SOD1 ALS remain largely undefined.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We sought to determine whether repetitive TBI (rTBI) accelerates disease onset and progression in the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse ALS model, and whether loss of the primary regulator of axonal degeneration sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (<i>Sarm1</i>) mitigates the histological and behavioral pathophysiology. We subjected wild-type (n = 23), <i>Sarm1</i> knockout (KO; n = 17), SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 19), and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>xSarm1<sup>KO</sup> (n = 26) mice of both sexes to rTBI or sham surgery at age 64 days (62–68 days). Body weight and ALS-deficit score were serially assessed up to 17 weeks after surgery and histopathology assessed in layer V of the primary motor cortex at the study end point.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In sham injured SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, genetic ablation of <i>Sarm1</i> did not attenuate axonal loss, improve neurological deficits, or survival. The rTBI accelerated onset of G93A-SOD1 ALS, as indicated by accentuated body weight loss, earlier onset of hindlimb tremor, and shortened survival. The rTBI also triggered TDP-43 mislocalization, enhanced axonal and neuronal loss, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. Loss of <i>Sarm1</i> significantly diminished the impact of rTBI on disease progression and rescued rTBI-associated neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SARM1-mediated axonal death pathway promotes pathogenesis after TBI in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice suggesting that anti-SARM1 therapeutics are a viable approach to preserve neurological function in injury-accelerated G93A-SOD1 ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-59/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Surgical and cultural approaches to managing hematocolpos in adolescents: A Tunisian case report with video insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hematocolpos is a gynecological disorder characterized by the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina due to anatomical obstruction, often resulting from an imperforate hymen (IH), the most common etiology in approximately 90% of cases. This condition can remain undiagnosed until adolescence, when menarche triggers clinical symptoms such as cyclical lower abdominal pain, primary amenorrhea, and in severe cases, a rapidly enlarging pelvic mass. Complications may include urinary retention, constipation, and infection if not promptly treated. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term consequences such as endometriosis, retrograde menstruation, and infertility. In Tunisia, the hymen holds significant cultural and social value, symbolizing virginity and moral purity, complicating the surgical management of hematocolpos. This case report discusses the surgical and cultural considerations involved in the treatment of a 13-year-old Tunisian girl diagnosed with hematocolpos. A hymen-sparing hymenotomy was selected, preserving the hymenal ring while creating an adequate orifice for menstrual flow, ensuring a balance between medical treatment and cultural sensitivities. The procedure, which included drainage of 600 ml of retained blood and meticulous suturing to maintain the hymen’s appearance, was successful. The patient experienced regular menstrual cycles and expressed satisfaction with the outcome 12 months postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of providing culturally sensitive care in regions where the hymen holds symbolic value. Virginity-sparing surgical techniques offer a suitable approach that addresses both medical and social concerns, ensuring patient well-being while respecting cultural beliefs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-58/v1?src=rss">Social pain: A systematic review on interventions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Social pain is emotional distress caused harm or threat to social connections that results in social exclusion, rejection, or loss. Social Pain is also a potentiator of physical pain. Supportive social relationships are widely recognized for their impact on maintaining health and well-being. The Passion of Jesus Christ serves as a quintessential example of social pain (i.e., desertion, betrayal, denial) potentiating physical pain (i.e., beatings, Crown of Thorns, crucifixion). Christ opts to forgive. Although forgiveness is one solution to reduce social pain, other interventions exist. This review seeks to identify and summarize interventions associated with reducing social pain. We conducted a systematic review using Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify relevant articles. Results: The database searches produced 548 articles. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. Acetaminophen, both deceptive and open-label placebos, mindfulness training, and psilocybin were found to reduce social pain. Of note, the combination of acetaminophen and forgiveness yielded superior results compared to either acetaminophen or forgiveness alone. Pharmacological interventions operate on the premise that the neural pathways responsible for physical pain also play a role in social pain. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for reducing social pain.

Structure-activity relationship analysis reveals the action mechanisms of different structural sterols on SSD-containing proteins (SCAP) and ACSL1. Moreover, 25-HC and ES synergistically enhance lipid-lowering effects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83973">Sensory experience controls dendritic structure and behavior by distinct pathways involving degenerins</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans'</i> arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101523">Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulate active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neuron during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amyplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101980">Valence and salience encoding in the central amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an important brain region for regulating both negative (fear and anxiety) and positive (reward) affective behaviors. The CeA has been proposed to encode affective information in the form of valence (whether the stimulus is good or bad) or salience (how significant is the stimulus), but the extent to which these two types of stimulus representation occur in the CeA is not known. Here, we used single cell calcium imaging in mice during appetitive and aversive conditioning and found that majority of CeA neurons (~65%) encode the valence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) with a smaller subset of cells (~15%) encoding the salience of the US. Valence and salience encoding of the conditioned stimulus (CS) was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings show that the CeA is a site of convergence for encoding oppositely valenced US information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97731">Mapping patterns of thought onto brain activity during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Movie-watching is a central aspect of our lives and an important paradigm for understanding the brain mechanisms behind cognition as it occurs in daily life. Contemporary views of ongoing thought argue that the ability to make sense of events in the ‘here and now’ depend on the neural processing of incoming sensory information by auditory and visual cortex, which are kept in check by systems in association cortex. However, we currently lack an understanding of how patterns of ongoing thoughts map onto the different brain systems when we watch a film, partly because methods of sampling experience disrupt the dynamics of brain activity and the experience of movie-watching. Our study established a novel method for mapping thought patterns onto the brain activity that occurs at different moments of a film, which does not disrupt the time course of brain activity or the movie-watching experience. We found moments when experience sampling highlighted engagement with multi-sensory features of the film or highlighted thoughts with episodic features, regions of sensory cortex were more active and subsequent memory for events in the movie was better—on the other hand, periods of intrusive distraction emerged when activity in regions of association cortex within the frontoparietal system was reduced. These results highlight the critical role sensory systems play in the multi-modal experience of movie-watching and provide evidence for the role of association cortex in reducing distraction when we watch films.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95135">The NeuroML ecosystem for standardized multi-scale modeling in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96600">The protective roles of eugenol on type 1 diabetes mellitus through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress pathway</a></h4>

              
                Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from damage to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to multi-organ involvement and a poor prognosis. The progression of T1DM is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and apoptosis. The natural compound eugenol (EUG) possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model in vivo and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to investigate the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to elucidate its potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention of EUG could effectively induce the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), leading to an up-regulation in the expressions of downstream proteins NQO1 and HMOX1, which are regulated by NRF2. Moreover, this intervention exhibited a significant amelioration in pancreatic β cell damage associated with T1DM, accompanied by an elevation in insulin secretion and a reduction in the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related markers. Furthermore, ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, reversed these effects of EUG. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/75393">Oversized cells activate global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to maintain cell size homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Proliferating animal cells maintain a stable size distribution over generations despite fluctuations in cell growth and division size. Previously, we showed that cell size control involves both cell size checkpoints, which delay cell cycle progression in small cells, and size-dependent regulation of mass accumulation rates (Ginzberg et al., 2018). While we previously identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a key regulator of the mammalian cell size checkpoint (S. Liu et al., 2018), the mechanism of size-dependent growth rate regulation has remained elusive. Here, we quantified global rates of protein synthesis and degradation in cells of varying sizes, both under unperturbed conditions and in response to perturbations that trigger size-dependent compensatory growth slowdown. We found that protein synthesis rates scale proportionally with cell size across cell cycle stages and experimental conditions. In contrast, oversized cells that undergo compensatory growth slowdown exhibit a superlinear increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, with accelerated protein turnover per unit mass, suggesting activation of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Both nascent and long-lived proteins contribute to the elevated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with long-lived proteins playing a crucial role at the G1/S transition. Notably, large G1/S cells exhibit particularly high efficiency in protein degradation, surpassing that of similarly sized or larger cells in S and G2, coinciding with the timing of the most stringent size control in animal cells. These results collectively suggest that oversized cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to promote cell size homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92979">Surprising features of nuclear receptor interaction networks revealed by live-cell single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) require heterodimerization with a common partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), to bind cognate DNA recognition sites in chromatin. Based on previous biochemical and overexpression studies, binding of T2NRs to chromatin is proposed to be regulated by competition for a limiting pool of the core RXR subunit. However, this mechanism has not yet been tested for endogenous proteins in live cells. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT) and proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), we monitored interactions between endogenously tagged RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in live cells. Unexpectedly, we find that higher expression of RAR, but not RXR, increases heterodimerization and chromatin binding in U2OS cells. This surprising finding indicates the limiting factor is not RXR but likely its cadre of obligate dimer binding partners. SMT and PAPA thus provide a direct way to probe which components are functionally limiting within a complex TF interaction network providing new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo with implications for drug development targeting nuclear receptors.

	<p>Backgrounds and Objectives: Obesity presents a significant global public health challenge and is associated with declines in both general and food-related inhibitory control, crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity progression. An increasing body of research suggests that acute aerobic exercise may improve inhibitory function. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of acute aerobic exercise on both general and food-related inhibition in obese adults remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential impacts and underlying neuroelectronic mechanisms of a single session of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on general and food-related inhibitory functions among young adult males with obesity. Design: A within-subject design comprising three sessions (control, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise) &amp;amp;times; three picture types (high-calorie food, low-calorie food, neutral picture) was employed. Methods: Eighteen young adult males with obesity [body mass index (BMI): 34.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.21 kg/m2, aged 24.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.13 years (Mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD)] were recruited. They participated in three intervention sessions: acute aerobic exercise at low [40&amp;amp;ndash;50% maximal Heart Rate (HRmax)], moderate (65&amp;amp;ndash;70% HRmax), and a control session (sitting rest), separated by five-day intervals in a counterbalanced order. Following each session, participants performed a food-related Go/No-go task, and EEG recordings (N2 and P3 components) were conducted within 15 min. Results: Moderate-intensity exercise elicited larger N2 amplitudes compared to the control session across different picture types and task conditions. However, there was no significant effect on behavioral indicators or P3 amplitude across sessions. Additionally, food stimuli (both high- and low-calorie) resulted in lower No-go accuracy and smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli. Conclusions: Acute moderate-intensity exercise might influence general and food-related inhibitory function in obese individuals at the neuroelectric stage, potentially by enhancing attentional resources for managing cognitive control and conflict detection. Moreover, reduced N2 amplitudes and No-go accuracy in response to food stimuli compared to non-food stimuli indicate a diminished ability to allocate attentional and neural resources to manage food-related conflicts. However, due to the relatively small sample size, caution is advised when generalizing these findings to the broader population. The pilot test indicated that obese participants had difficulty sustaining high-intensity exercise at 80&amp;amp;ndash;90% of their maximum heart rate for a continuous or 20 min period, highlighting potential challenges in exercise adherence at high intensities within this population. Future research is needed to utilize interdisciplinary approaches and multimodal technologies to clarify how exercise influences food-related cognition, appetite regulation, and brain mechanisms in obesity, aiming to better contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) often requires surgical intervention, such as craniotomy, to relieve mass lesions and pressure. The extent of hematoma evacuation significantly impacts patient outcomes. This study utilizes 3D Slicer software to analyse post-craniotomy hematoma volume changes and evaluate their prognostic significance in aSDH patients. Methods: Among 178 adult patients diagnosed with aSDH from January 2015 to December 2022, 64 underwent hematoma evacuation via craniotomy. Initial scans were performed within 24 h of trauma, followed by routine postoperative scans to assess residual hematoma. We conducted radiomic analysis of preoperative and postoperative volumes, surface area, Feret diameter, sphericity, flatness, and elongation. Clinical parameters, including SOFA score, APACHE score, pupillary response, comorbidities, age, anticoagulation status, and preoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, were also evaluated. Results: Changes in &amp;amp;Delta; surface area significantly correlated with 30-day outcomes (p = 0.03) and showed moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.65). Patients with a &amp;amp;Delta; surface area &amp;amp;gt; 30,090 mm2 experienced poorer outcomes (OR = 6.66, p = 0.02). Significant features included preoperative surface area (p = 0.009), Feret diameter (p = 0.0012). In multivariate analysis, only the Feret diameter remained significant (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Postoperative &amp;amp;Delta; surface area is, among other variables, a strong predictor of 30-day outcomes, while in multivariate analysis, preoperative Feret diameter remains the only independent predictor. Radiomic analysis with 3D Slicer may enhance prognostic accuracy and inform tailored therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The study examined the relationships between specific Theory-of-Mind (ToM) dimensions, cognitive planning, and sleep duration in aging adults. Methods: The sample included 179 participants, comprising 46 cognitively healthy individuals, 75 diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and 58 with non-amnestic (naMCI). The mean age of the participants was 70.23 years (SD = 4.74), with a mean educational attainment of 12.35 years (SD = 3.22) and gender distribution of 53 men and 126 women. ToM assessment included tasks measuring the understanding and interpretation of non-literal speech, proverbs and metaphors, as well as an emotion-recognition test. For cognitive planning, a Tower Test was utilized. Sleep duration was measured using actigraphy. Results: We identified significant differences in various ToM tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; performance between the groups, particularly in non-literal speech tasks and third-order ToM stories. The HC group consistently outperformed both MCI groups in these tasks, with aMCI showing higher performance than naMCI. Mediation analysis applied to examine potential direct and indirect effects of sleep duration on ToM tasks indicated that total sleep time had significant indirect effects through cognitive planning&amp;amp;mdash;mainly as rule violation total score&amp;amp;mdash;on specific ToM aspects. Hence, besides the effects of MCI pathologies and especially of naMCI, sleep duration seems also to be associated with ToM performance in aging via specific executive functioning decrements. Conclusions: The findings underscore the social implications of ToM deficits due to MCI and/or sleep duration decrease, particularly in naMCI older adults, as they can seriously impair their social interactions. Targeted interventions could improve emotional understanding, communication, and overall quality of life.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize people by their faces. Developmental prosopagnosia is the hereditary or congenital variant of the condition. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the assessment of developmental prosopagnosia in a clinical context, using a combination of commercially available clinical assessment tools and experimental tools described in the research literature. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of a man with Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient (ON) had experienced difficulties with face identity recognition throughout his life but believed they were caused by a lack of interest in others. Results: The neuropsychological assessment revealed varying degrees of difficulties primarily related to executive functions, attention, reaction time, and memory processes, as expected in a person with Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome and ADHD. In addition, ON reported severe problems with face recognition on a prosopagnosia questionnaire and demonstrated severely impaired performance on tests of face memory and face perception commonly used to diagnose prosopagnosia. Interestingly, he reported familial face recognition problems on the maternal side of the family, while tics and ADHD symptoms occurred on the paternal side. This suggests that, in this case, the conditions were likely inherited through different genetic pathways. Conclusions: Proper assessment of face recognition problems, which includes a broad spectrum of clinical assessment tools, could help patients develop awareness and acceptance of themselves and their difficulties, and could serve as a basis for the development of clinical interventions. While ON&amp;amp;rsquo;s DP, Tourette syndrome, and ADHD may have distinct genetic origins, impairment in face identity recognition has been observed across several neurodevelopmental conditions and is likely more common than currently thought.</p>

                <p>The full complement of ion channels which influence insect auditory mechanotransduction and the mechanisms by which their influence is exerted remain unclear. <I>Shal</I> (K<SUB>v</SUB>4), a <I>Shaker</I> family member encoding voltage-gated potassium channels in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, has been shown to localize to dendrites in some neuron types, suggesting the potential role of <I>Shal</I> in <I>Drosophila</I> hearing, including mechanotransduction. A GFP trap was used to visualize the localization of the <I>Shal</I> channel in Johnston's organ neurons responsible for hearing in the antenna. <I>Shal</I> protein was localized strongly to the cell body and inner dendritic segment of sensory neurons. It was also detectable in the sensory cilium, suggesting its involvement not only in general auditory function but specifically in mechanotransduction. Electrophysiological recordings to assess neural responses to auditory stimuli in mutant <I>Shal</I> flies revealed significant decreases in auditory responses. Laser Doppler vibrometer recordings indicated abnormal antennal free fluctuation frequencies in mutant lines, indicating an effect on active antennal tuning, and thus active transduction mechanisms. This suggests that <I>Shal</I> participates in coordinating energy-dependent antennal movements in <I>Drosophila</I> that are essential for tuning the antenna to courtship song frequencies.</p>

                <p>The social environment has long been recognized to play an important role in substance use, which is often modeled in rodents using operant conditioning. However, most operant chambers only accommodate one rodent at a time. We present PeerPub&mdash;a unique social operant chamber. PeerPub employs touch sensors to track the licking behavior on drinking spouts. When the number of licks meets a set reinforcement schedule, it dispenses a drop of solution with a fixed volume as a reward at the tip of the spout. A radio frequency identification (RFID) chip implanted in each rat&rsquo;s skull identifies it throughout the experiment. The system is managed by a Raspberry Pi computer. We evaluated PeerPub using Sprague Dawley rats in daily 1&nbsp;h sessions, where supersac (a glucose and saccharin solution) was provided under a fixed-ratio five schedule. We discovered that male rats consumed more supersac in dual rat conditions compared with single rat conditions. These findings illustrate PeerPub&rsquo;s effectiveness in modeling the interaction between motivated behavior and social context. We expect devices like PeerPub will help highlight the role of social environments in substance use disorder phenotypes. All computer code, 3D design, and build instructions for PeerPub can be found at <A HREF="http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub">http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub</A>.</p>

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, this research protocol depicts our proposed study assessing the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In the planned comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the planned comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among children and adolescents is crucial for the prevention of HPV-related diseases later in life. However, HPV vaccination uptake remains suboptimal in this population. This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting parents and parent-adolescent dyads in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the impact of parent-directed and parent-adolescent dyad interventions on HPV vaccination uptake in children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Specific objectives include reviewing existing literature on parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions, assessing vaccination uptake, identifying influencing factors, and providing evidence-based recommendations for intervention development and implementation. Methods A systematic review will be conducted, encompassing literature published up to the present day. Various databases will be searched for relevant studies on parent-focused and parent-adolescent dyad interventions aimed at improving HPV vaccination uptake. Data extraction and analysis will be performed to assess the proportion of children and adolescents receiving HPV vaccination following interventions, factors influencing vaccination uptake, and completion rates of the recommended vaccine series. Results The review findings will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect size of interventions. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the results. Conclusion This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents. The findings will inform the development and implementation of targeted interventions to address barriers and improve vaccination coverage, ultimately reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases.

                Background Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients has gained significant attention; however, its impact on long-term survival and recurrence rates remains under investigation. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of NAC on metastasis, recurrence rates, and overall survival in BC patients. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to assess differences between groups. Methods In this retrospective study, 46 Sudanese patients with locally advanced BC were consecutively collected attending Alsharif Specialized Hospital during the period from 2015 to 2016, comprising 28 patients who received NAC (case group) and 18 patients who underwent upfront surgery (control group). Data regarding demographics, histological types, treatment regimens, prognostic markers, survival, recurrence and metastasis were collected Results Most of patients in both groups were > 40 years old. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the predominant histological type observed. Notably, the metastasis rate was lower in the case group than in the control group (n=6; 21.4% vs. n=9; 50%, P = 0.043). However, the recurrence rates and overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.353 and P = 0.454, respectively). The estimated mean survival time was 74.1 months for the case group compared to 82.0 months for the control group, but without significant difference (log-rank P = 0.973). Conclusion While NAC appears to reduce metastasis rates in breast cancer patients, it does not significantly impact recurrence rates or overall survival. These results underscore the need for further research to explore additional factors that influence long-term outcomes of breast cancer management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-54/v1?src=rss">Applications of MR Finger printing derived T1 and T2 values in Adult brain: A Systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for brain imaging, but conventional methods rely on qualitative contrast, are time-intensive, and prone to variability. Magnetic resonance finger printing (MRF) addresses these limitations by enabling fast, simultaneous mapping of multiple tissue properties like T1, T2. Using dynamic acquisition parameters and a precomputed signal dictionary, MRF provides robust, qualitative maps, improving diagnostic precision and expanding clinical and research applications in brain imaging. Methods Database searches were performed through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of science to identify relevant articles focusing on the application of MR finger printing in the adult brain. We utilized the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines to extract data from the selected studies. Results Nine articles were included in the final review, with a total sample size of 332 participants. In healthy brains, notable regional, sex, age, and hemispheric variations were identified, particularly in the corpus callosum and thalamus. MRF effectively differentiated meningioma subtypes, glioma grades, and IDH mutation status, with T2 values providing particularly predictive for glioma classification. In brain metastases, significant relaxometry differences were noted between normal and lesional tissues. For multiple sclerosis, MRF values correlated with clinical and disability measures, distinguishing relapsing-remitting secondary progressive forms. In traumatic brain injury, longitudinal T1 changes strongly correlated with clinical recovery, surpassing T2 values. Conclusions The systematic review highlighted MRD as a groundbreaking technique that enhances neurological diagnosis by simultaneously quantifying T1 and T2 relaxation times. With reduced acquisition times, MRF outperforms conventional MRI in detecting subtle pathologies, distinguishing properties, and providing reliable biomarkers.

                Background Good animal welfare is important ethically but also to ensure animals provide valid scientific models. Despite thousands of amphibians in research laboratories there is minimal quantitative evidence pertaining to their management and welfare. This study validated methods to non-invasively measure corticosterone, the amphibian ‘stress’ hormone, from tank water to provide a robust and reliable welfare assessment tool. Methods We report experiments (A) that evaluate parameters linked to the performance of our biochemical extraction methods for waterborne corticosterone and, importantly, associated sampling procedures. We evaluate appropriate sampling water type, sampling vessel, filtration methods, potential degradation of waterborne corticosterone over time and the impact of sampling procedures on animal corticosterone levels. We wanted to determine sampling parameters that yielded the least background corticosterone and had minimum negative impact on the animals. The second series of experiments (B) evaluated parameters linked to the biology of Xenopus, including the influence of circadian rhythm, sex and snout-vent length on waterborne corticosterone levels, since fundamental knowledge of a species’ biology is essential for designing robust experiments and in the interpretation of the results. Results We propose collecting corticosterone samples in deionised water in either plastic or glass containers. The filtering process does not impact the amount of corticosterone measured in the water sample. Levels of corticosterone collected in the water change over a 48-hr period so we advocate standardising time from hormone collection to storage at - 20 °C. Repeated transfer of frogs to sampling containers does not increase corticosterone, suggesting our methods are not cumulatively stressful. Corticosterone levels were not impacted by circadian phase, sex or snout-vent length. Conclusion We have developed and validated robust methods to quantify waterborne corticosterone. We hope they provide a template for researchers wishing to develop methods to measure waterborne corticosterone in aquatic amphibians.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1–2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>by Xiaoyi Wang, Zhen Jin</p>

Human mobility between different regions is a major factor in large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. Deep learning models incorporating infectious disease transmission dynamics for predicting the spread of multi-regional outbreaks due to human mobility have become a hot research topic. In this study, we incorporate the Graph Transformer Neural Network and graph learning mechanisms into a metapopulation SIR model to build a hybrid framework, Metapopulation Graph Transformer Neural Network (M-Graphormer), for high-dimensional parameter estimation and multi-regional epidemic prediction. The framework effectively solves the problem that existing models may lose some hidden spatial dependencies in the data when dealing with the dynamic graph structure of the network due to human mobility. We performed multi-wave infectious disease prediction in multiple regions based on real epidemic data. The results show that the framework is capable of performing high-dimensional parameter estimation and accurately predicting epidemic transmission dynamics in multiple regions even with low data quality. In addition, we retrospectively extrapolate the temporal evolution patterns of contact rate under different interventions implemented in different regions, reflecting the dynamics of intervention intensity and the need for flexibility in adjusting interventions in different regions. To provide early warning of infectious disease transmission, we retrospectively predicted the arrival time of infectious diseases using data from the early stages of outbreaks.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

Machine learning has become a powerful tool for computational analysis in the biomedical sciences, with its effectiveness significantly enhanced by integrating domain-specific knowledge. This integration has give rise to informed machine learning, in contrast to studies that lack domain knowledge and treat all variables equally (uninformed machine learning). While the application of informed machine learning to bioinformatics and health informatics datasets has become more seamless, the likelihood of errors has also increased. To address this drawback, we present eight guidelines outlining best practices for employing informed machine learning methods in biomedical sciences. These quick tips offer recommendations on various aspects of informed machine learning analysis, aiming to assist researchers in generating more robust, explainable, and dependable results. Even if we originally crafted these eight simple suggestions for novices, we believe they are deemed relevant for expert computational researchers as well.

                <p>by Amrit Bagchi, Bapi Sarker, Jialiang Zhang, Marcus Foston, Amit Pathak</p>

Cell collectives, like other motile entities, generate and use forces to move forward. Here, we ask whether environmental configurations alter this proportional force-speed relationship, since aligned extracellular matrix fibers are known to cause directed migration. We show that aligned fibers serve as active conduits for spatial propagation of cellular mechanotransduction through matrix exoskeleton, leading to efficient directed collective cell migration. Epithelial (MCF10A) cell clusters adhered to <i>soft</i> substrates with aligned collagen fibers (AF) migrate faster with much lesser traction forces, compared to random fibers (RF). Fiber alignment causes higher motility waves and transmission of normal stresses deeper into cell monolayer while minimizing shear stresses and increased cell-division based fluidization. By contrast, fiber randomization induces cellular jamming due to breakage in motility waves, disrupted transmission of normal stresses, and heightened shear driven flow. Using a novel motor-clutch model, we explain that such ‘force-effective’ fast migration phenotype occurs due to rapid stabilization of contractile forces at the migrating front, enabled by higher frictional forces arising from simultaneous compressive loading of parallel fiber-substrate connections. We also model ‘<i>haptotaxis</i>’ to show that increasing ligand connectivity (but not continuity) increases migration efficiency. According to our model, increased rate of front stabilization via higher resistance to substrate deformation is sufficient to capture ‘<i>durotaxis’</i>. Thus, our findings reveal a new paradigm wherein the rate of leading-edge stabilization determines the efficiency of supracellular collective cell migration.

                <p>by Kwang Su Kim, Masashi Iwamoto, Kosaku Kitagawa, Hyeongki Park, Sanae Hayashi, Senko Tsukuda, Takeshi Matsui, Masanori Atsukawa, Kentaro Matsuura, Natthaya Chuaypen, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Lena Allweiss, Takara Nishiyama, Naotoshi Nakamura, Yasuhisa Fujita, Eiryo Kawakami, Shinji Nakaoka, Masamichi Muramatsu, Kazuyuki Aihara, Takaji Wakita, Alan S.

Quantification of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a key for evaluating an elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in infected patients. However, quantifying cccDNA requires invasive methods such as a liver biopsy, which makes it impractical to access the dynamics of cccDNA in patients. Although HBV RNA and HBV core-related antigens (HBcrAg) have been proposed as surrogate markers for evaluating cccDNA activity, they do not necessarily estimate the amount of cccDNA. Here, we employed a recently developed multiscale mathematical model describing intra- and intercellular viral propagation and applied it in HBV-infected patients under treatment. We developed a model that can predict intracellular HBV dynamics by use of extracellular viral markers, including HBsAg, HBV DNA, and HBcrAg in peripheral blood. Importantly, the model prediction of the amount of cccDNA in patients over time was confirmed to be well correlated with the data for quantified cccDNA by paired liver biopsy. Thus, our method combining classic and emerging surrogate markers enables us to predict the decay dynamics of cccDNA in patients undergoing treatment.

<p>Fossils work well for reconstructing the evolutionary history of brain shape and size but are mute to the evolution of subcortical structures. Leveraging the use of scaling attributes, simulation and 3D mapping we predict subcortical anatomy for fossil Carnivora. These data help to expand the search space for paleoneurological study.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Paleoneurology reconstructs the evolutionary history of nervous systems through direct observations from the fossil record and comparative data from extant species. Although this approach can provide direct evidence of phylogenetic links among species, it is constrained by the availability and quality of data that can be gleaned from the fossil record. Here, we sought to translate brain component relationships in a sample of extant Carnivora to make inferences about brain structure in fossil species. Using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging on extant canids and felids and 3D laser scanning on fossil Carnivora, spanning some 40 million years of evolution, we derived measurements for select brain components. From these primary data, predictive equations of cortical (gray matter mass, cortical thickness, and gyrification index) and subcortical structures (caudate nucleus, putamen, and external globus pallidus mass) were used to derive estimates for select fossil Carnivora. We found that regression equations based on both extant and simulation samples provided moderate to high predictability of subcortical masses for fossil Carnivora. We also found that using exploratory probabilistic mapping of subcortical structures in extant Carnivora, a reasonable prediction could be made of the 3D subcortical morphospace of fossil endocasts. These results identify allometric departures and establish adult species ranges in brain component size for fossil species. The integrative approach taken in this study may serve as a model to promote further dialog between neurobiologists working on extant Carnivora models and paleoneurologists describing the nervous system of fossils from this understudied group of mammals.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.

                Background Glaucoma, the primary cause of irreversible blindness globally, mainly presents as primary open-angle glaucoma and is more common in sub-Saharan Africa. This chronic disease of the optic nerve often goes undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic early stages. Increased awareness and regular eye exams can help in early detection and management. Purpose/Objectives This study aims to comprehensively identify the existing literature on screening programs or interventions for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at the primary healthcare level. Additionally, the study aims to outline the characteristics of these screening programs/interventions and emphasize the most successful programs that have been implemented at the primary healthcare level. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al. (2010) methodological enhancement for conducting a scoping review project. The search will cover peer-reviewed articles published in English between the inception and May 2024 from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and the WHO Global Database. The search on the EBSCOhost platform will include databases such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycInfo, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE with full text, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analyzed using QualCoder 1.9 version. The study findings will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and a checklist will be completed to ensure adherence to reporting guidelines. Conclusion This review will help identify research gaps in primary healthcare POAG screening programs and recommend effective interventions.
