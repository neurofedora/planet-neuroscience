	<p>Background: The number of elderly diabetic patients has been increasing recently, and these patients have a higher morbidity of dementia than those without diabetes. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for the development of dementia in elderly individuals, which is a serious health problem. Objectives: The primary aim was to examine whether diabetes is a risk factor for dementia among elderly individuals. The secondary aim was to apply grey theory to integrate the results and how they relate to cognitive impairments in elderly diabetic patients and to predict which participants are at high risk of developing dementia. Methods: Two hundred and twenty patients aged 50 years or older who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were recruited. Information on demographics, disease characteristics, activities of daily living, Mini Mental State Examination, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life was collected via questionnaires. The grey relational analysis approach was applied to evaluate the relationship between the results and health outcomes. Results: A total of 13.6% of participants had cognitive disturbances, of whom 1.4% had severe cognitive dysfunction. However, with regard to sleep disorders, 56.4% had sleep disturbances of varying degrees from light to severe. Further investigation is needed to address this problem. A higher prevalence of sleep disturbances among diabetic patients translates to a higher degree of depressive symptoms and a worse physical and mental health-related quality of life. Furthermore, based on the grey relational analysis, the grey relation coefficient varies from 0.6217~0.7540. Among the subjects, Participant 101 had the highest value, suggesting a need for immediate medical care. In this study, we observed that 20% of the total participants, for whom the grey relation coefficient was 0.6730, needed further and immediate medical care.</p>

	<p>Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL; Haberland syndrome, #613001) is an extremely rare congenital disorder that is manifested by the involvement of the skin, eyes and central nervous system (CNS). We report two cases of children with ECCL diagnosis. First was an 8-year-old girl who presented with symptomatic epilepsy, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. In 2020, she was admitted to the hospital due to the exacerbation of paresis and intensified prolonged epileptic seizures, provoked by infection of the middle ear. Diagnostic imaging revealed radiological changes suggestive of ECCL, providing a reason for the diagnosis, despite the lack of skin and eye anomalies. The second child, a 14-year-old girl, was consulted for subtle clinical signs and epilepsy suspicion. Diagnostic imaging findings were similar, though less pronounced. Based on neuroradiological abnormalities typical for Haberland syndrome, the authors discuss possible ECCL diagnosis.</p>

<p>The morphology of the pretectum and associated tegmentum was investigated in crocodilians. These findings are compared with similar structures in other reptiles and birds. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In all vertebrates, the pretectum and associated tegmentum arise from prosomere 1, but the adult derivatives of these embryonic regions are not well defined in reptiles—especially in crocodiles, the reptilian group most closely related to birds. Despite its importance in vision and visuomotor behavior, descriptions of the pretectum in crocodiles are brief and photographs are lacking. To fill this gap in knowledge, the pretectum and associated tegmentum were examined in two crocodilians, <i>Caiman crocodilus</i> and <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, using a variety of histological stains in all three traditional planes of section. These observations were compared with similar studies in other reptiles and birds. These comparisons were hampered by differences in nomenclature and limited data. Nevertheless, pretectal nuclei in receipt of retinal input in crocodiles, other reptiles, and birds were the most easily identified when compared with the present analysis. Despite identifying the traditional nuclei comprising the pretectum of crocodiles, other areas remain to be characterized. Nevertheless, knowledge gained from this description will aid further investigations of this brain region in crocodiles and other reptiles as well as provide a reference for developmental studies in crocodiles.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Developmental Progression of Eight Opsin Spectral Signals Recorded from the Zebrafish Retinal Cone Layer Is Altered by the Timing and Cell Type Expression of Thyroxin Receptor {beta}2 (tr{beta}2) Gain-Of-Function Transgenes</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Zebrafish retinal cone signals shift in spectral shape through larval, juvenile, and adult development as expression patterns of eight cone-opsin genes change. An algorithm extracting signal amplitudes for the component cone spectral types is developed and tested on two thyroxin receptor &beta;2 (tr&beta;2) gain-of-function lines <I>crx:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> and <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I>, allowing correlation between opsin signaling and opsin immunoreactivity in lines with different developmental timing and cell-type expression of this red-opsin-promoting transgene. Both adult transgenics became complete, or nearly complete, "red-cone dichromats," with disproportionately large long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS)1 opsin amplitudes as compared with controls, where LWS1 and LWS2 amplitudes were about equal, and significant signals from SWS1, SWS2, and Rh2 opsins were detected. But in transgenic larvae and juveniles of both lines it was LWS2 amplitudes that increased, with LWS1 cone signals rarely encountered. In <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> embryos at 5 d postfertilization (dpf), red-opsin immunoreactive cone density doubled, but red-opsin amplitudes (LWS2) increased &lt;10%, and green-opsin, blue-opsin, and UV-opsin signals were unchanged, despite co-expressed red opsins, and the finding that an <I>sws1</I> UV-opsin reporter gene was shut down by the <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> transgene. By contrast both LWS2 red-cone amplitudes and the density of red-cone immunoreactivity more than doubled in 5-dpf <I>crx:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> embryos, while UV-cone amplitudes were reduced 90%. Embryonic cones with tr&beta;2 gain-of-function transgenes were morphologically distinct from control red, blue or UV cones, with wider inner segments and shorter axons than red cones, suggesting cone spectral specification, opsin immunoreactivity and shape are influenced by the abundance and developmental timing of tr&beta;2 expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Noninvasive Method for Monitoring Breathing Patterns in Nonhuman Primates Using a Nasal Thermosensor</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Respiration is strongly linked to internal states such as arousal, emotion, and even cognitive processes and provides objective biological information to estimate these states in humans and animals. However, the measurement of respiration has not been established in macaque monkeys, which have been widely used as model animals for understanding various higher brain functions. In the present study, we developed a method to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys. We first measured the temperature of their nasal breathing, which changes between inspiration and expiration phases, in an anesthetized condition and estimated the respiration pattern. We compared the estimated pattern with that obtained by a conventional chest band method that has been used in humans and applied to anesthetized, but not behaving, monkeys. These respiration patterns matched well, suggesting that the measurement of nasal air temperature can be used to monitor the respiration of monkeys. Furthermore, we confirmed that the respiration frequency in behaving monkeys monitored by the measurement of nasal air temperature was not affected by the orofacial movement of licking to obtain the liquid reward. We next examined the frequency of respiration when they listened to music or white noise. The respiratory frequency was higher when the monkeys listened to music than the noise. This result is consistent with a phenomenon in humans and indicates the accuracy of our monitoring method. These data suggest that the measurement of nasal air temperature enables us to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys and thereby estimate their internal states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Fast Synaptically Activated Calcium and Sodium Kinetics in Hippocampal Pyramidal Neuron Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>An accurate assessment of the time course, components, and magnitude of postsynaptic currents is important for a quantitative understanding of synaptic integration and signaling in dendritic spines. These parameters have been studied in some detail in previous experiments, primarily using two-photon imaging of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes and two-photon uncaging of glutamate. However, even with these revolutionary techniques, there are some missing pieces in our current understanding, particularly related to the time courses of synaptically evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes. In new experiments, we used low-affinity, linear Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, laser fluorescence stimulation, and a sensitive camera-based detection system, combined with electrical stimulation and two-photon glutamate uncaging, to extend measurements of these spine parameters. We found that (1) almost all synaptically activated Na<sup>+</sup> currents in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron spines in slices from mice of either sex are through AMPA receptors with little Na<sup>+</sup> entry through voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) or NMDA receptor channels; (2) a spectrum of sodium transient decay times was observed, suggesting a spectrum of spine neck resistances, even on the same dendrite; (3) synaptically activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes are very fast and are almost entirely because of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through NMDA receptors at the time when the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block is relieved by the fast AMPA-mediated EPSP; (4) the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes evoked by uncaging glutamate are slower than the changes evoked by synaptic release, suggesting that the relative contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through NMDA receptors at rest following uncaging is higher than following electrical stimulation.</p>

                Background: Psychosocial research in humanitarian settings has been historically dominated by a focus on distress and disorder. As such, there is a need to establish the validity of instruments for a broad range of psychosocial outcomes, particularly among highly affected and under-represented populations. The current study describes the adaptation and testing of multiple psychosocial instruments among displaced Rohingya mothers in Bangladesh.  Methods: We used baseline data from 600 mothers of malnourished children aged 2 and under enrolled in an intervention study in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Instruments assessed distress (International Depression Symptom Scale [IDSS] and Kessler-6 [K-6]); functional impairment (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]); subjective wellbeing (global Satisfaction With Life [SWL] and Personal Wellbeing Index [PWI];  and, coping (Brief COPE and locally developed coping items). Instruments were piloted and refined, then used for data collection by Bangladeshi-Rohingya interviewer pairs. We conducted exploratory factor analysis, evaluated internal consistency, examined construct validity through correlation with other scales, and used regression models to explore demographic factors associated with psychosocial health.  Results: Both the WHODAS and coping items fit 2-factor models; other scales were unidimensional. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .76 to .90 for the refined scales. With the exception of coping, scale correlations supported construct validity; separate measures of the same construct were highly correlated, distress and impairment were moderately correlated, and both were inversely correlated with wellbeing. Correlates of poorer psychosocial health included relative socioeconomic disadvantage, current pregnancy, and being unmarried.   Conclusions: Most of the standard psychosocial assessment tools performed adequately, but they did not appear to fully capture local experiences and included items of little local relevance. Findings highlight the need for further mixed methods research to develop a rich battery of instruments with cross-cultural validity, particularly for positive outcomes such as coping which was particularly challenging to assess.

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in third world countries; identification of causative agents of diarrhea is essential to apply measures to prevent and control this disease. In addition, scant data are available regarding childhood diarrhea in Sudan. Our research aimed to determine the incidence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entameobia histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and Gardia lambelia) among the young (aged less than five years) in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a parasitological cross-sectional survey, and stool samples from 437 patients were examined for E. histolytica, C.  parvum, and G. lambelia using a multiplex real-time PCR method. Results Of the 437 stool samples tested, infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was identified in 16 (3.7%) cases. G. lambelia (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8 %) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.5%). The highest and lowest rates of parasitic infections were seen in the less than two years age group (32.7%), and in the 2–4-year-old group (2.7%), the male children showed higher rates of infections (23.7%) compared to females (11.7%). The incidence of protozoan infection was higher (37.7%) in the rainy season (August to December) (32.7%) in contrast with that (2.7%) in the dry season (April to June). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of G. lambelia and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in Khartoum State and the multiplex real-time technique's usefulness in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                A sound analysis of DNA sequencing data is important to extract meaningful information and infer quantities of interest. Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil- ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Developing dispute resolution policy for conflicts settlement in public-private partnership (PPP) projects in educational institutions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) advocates a 15-20% allocation of the developing nations’ annual budget to educational development, but the available resources are not adequate to support the sector in the global south. Thus, University Hostel Development and Management (UHDM) policy was selected to attract private investors for the provision of educational facilities in Nigerian public universities. The policy considered a public-private partnership (PPP) model to ameliorate the menace of dilapidated infrastructures. Initially, there was massive investors’ participation until contractual disputes started to undermine the success recorded. Therefore, incessant disputes without resourceful resolutions motivate the need to examine this policy and spot the gaps for necessary improvement. Policy: The National Universities Commission (NUC) augments the provision of infrastructure in Nigerian public universities through the UHDM initiative in 2004. Conflicts owing to the multiplicity of stakeholders’ contrasting interests overwhelmed the initiative. Many value-added projects were terminated. The poor condition of facilities lingers to serve as a basic factor for half-baked graduates, low employee productivity and declined socio-economic values of the nation. This brief focuses on the role of formal dispute resolution mechanisms (DRMs) for conflict management in PPP arrangements. By observation, stakeholders rarely envisage potential conflicts, thus, no contemplation of specific DRMs adoption despite the inevitability of contractual disputes. Recommendations: This brief recommends the inclusion of the dispute resolution policy in the PPP Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Recommendations are hereby generated from the analysis of the stakeholders’ opinions on the causes of the dispute, conflict prevention strategies, and the relevant dispute resolution mechanisms peculiar to the PPP contracts in educational institutions. Also, ambiguities in the policy that bordered on an inexplicit institutional framework, lack of PPP experts’ involvement, imperfect contract agreement, and deficiency of feasibility study, are resolved by the recommendations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sampling effects and measurement overlap can bias the inference of neuronal avalanches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joao Pinheiro Neto, F. Paul Spitzner, Viola Priesemann</p>

To date, it is still impossible to sample the entire mammalian brain with single-neuron precision. This forces one to either use spikes (focusing on few neurons) or to use coarse-sampled activity (averaging over many neurons, e.g. LFP). Naturally, the sampling technique impacts inference about collective properties. Here, we emulate both sampling techniques on a simple spiking model to quantify how they alter observed correlations and signatures of criticality. We describe a general effect: when the inter-electrode distance is small, electrodes sample overlapping regions in space, which increases the correlation between the signals. For coarse-sampled activity, this can produce power-law distributions even for non-critical systems. In contrast, spike recordings do not suffer this particular bias and underlying dynamics can be identified. This may resolve why coarse measures and spikes have produced contradicting results in the past.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Small predators dominate fish predation in coral reef communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michalis Mihalitsis, Renato A. Morais, David R. Bellwood</p>

Ecosystem processes are challenging to quantify at a community level, particularly within complex ecosystems (e.g., rainforests, coral reefs). Predation is one of the most important types of species interactions, determining several ecosystem processes. However, while it is widely recognised, it is rarely quantified, especially in aquatic systems. To address these issues, we model predation on fish by fish, in a hyperdiverse coral reef community. We show that body sizes previously examined in fish–fish predation studies (based on a metanalysis), only represent about 5% of likely predation events. The average fish predator on coral reefs is just 3.65 cm; the average fish prey just 1.5 cm. These results call for a shift in the way we view fish predation and its ability to shape the species or functional composition of coral reef fish communities. Considered from a functional group approach, we found general agreement in the distribution of simulated and observed predation events, among both predator and prey functional groups. Predation on coral reefs is a process driven by small fish, most of which are neither seen nor quantified.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Bats expand their vocal range by recruiting different laryngeal structures for echolocation and social communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonas Håkansson, Cathrine Mikkelsen, Lasse Jakobsen, Coen P. H. Elemans</p>

Echolocating bats produce very diverse vocal signals for echolocation and social communication that span an impressive frequency range of 1 to 120 kHz or 7 octaves. This tremendous vocal range is unparalleled in mammalian sound production and thought to be produced by specialized laryngeal vocal membranes on top of vocal folds. However, their function in vocal production remains untested. By filming vocal membranes in excised bat larynges (<i>Myotis daubentonii</i>) in vitro with ultra-high-speed video (up to 250,000 fps) and using deep learning networks to extract their motion, we provide the first direct observations that vocal membranes exhibit flow-induced self-sustained vibrations to produce 10 to 95 kHz echolocation and social communication calls in bats. The vocal membranes achieve the highest fundamental frequencies (<i>f</i><sub>o</sub><i>’s</i>) of any mammal, but their vocal range is with 3 to 4 octaves comparable to most mammals. We evaluate the currently outstanding hypotheses for vocal membrane function and propose that most laryngeal adaptations in echolocating bats result from selection for producing high-frequency, rapid echolocation calls to catch fast-moving prey. Furthermore, we show that bats extend their lower vocal range by recruiting their ventricular folds—as in death metal growls—that vibrate at distinctly lower frequencies of 1 to 5 kHz for producing agonistic social calls. The different selection pressures for echolocation and social communication facilitated the evolution of separate laryngeal structures that together vastly expanded the vocal range in bats.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comparative analysis reveals the long-term coevolutionary history of parvoviruses and vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew A. Campbell, Shannon Loncar, Robert M. Kotin, Robert J. Gifford</p>

Parvoviruses (family <i>Parvoviridae</i>) are small DNA viruses that cause numerous diseases of medical, veterinary, and agricultural significance and have important applications in gene and anticancer therapy. DNA sequences derived from ancient parvoviruses are common in animal genomes and analysis of these <i>endogenous parvoviral elements</i> (EPVs) has demonstrated that the family, which includes twelve vertebrate-specific genera, arose in the distant evolutionary past. So far, however, such “paleovirological” analysis has only provided glimpses into the biology of ancient parvoviruses and their long-term evolutionary interactions with hosts. Here, we comprehensively map EPV diversity in 752 published vertebrate genomes, revealing defining aspects of ecology and evolution within individual parvovirus genera. We identify 364 distinct EPV sequences and show these represent approximately 200 unique germline incorporation events, involving at least five distinct parvovirus genera, which took place at points throughout the Cenozoic Era. We use the spatiotemporal and host range calibrations provided by these sequences to infer defining aspects of long-term evolution within individual parvovirus genera, including mammalian vicariance for genus <i>Protoparvovirus</i>, and interclass transmission for genus <i>Dependoparvovirus</i>. Moreover, our findings support a model of virus evolution in which the long-term cocirculation of multiple parvovirus genera in vertebrates reflects the adaptation of each viral genus to fill a distinct ecological niche. Our findings show that efforts to develop parvoviruses as therapeutic tools can be approached from a rational foundation based on comparative evolutionary analysis. To support this, we published our data in the form of an open, extensible, and cross-platform database designed to facilitate the wider utilisation of evolution-related domain knowledge in parvovirus research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Increasing plant group productivity through latent genetic variation for cooperation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel E. Wuest, Nuno D. Pires, Shan Luo, Francois Vasseur, Julie Messier, Ueli Grossniklaus, Pascal A. Niklaus</p>

Historic yield advances in the major crops have, to a large extent, been achieved by selection for improved productivity of groups of plant individuals such as high-density stands. Research suggests that such improved group productivity depends on “cooperative” traits (e.g., erect leaves, short stems) that—while beneficial to the group—decrease individual fitness under competition. This poses a problem for some traditional breeding approaches, especially when selection occurs at the level of individuals, because “selfish” traits will be selected for and reduce yield in high-density monocultures. One approach, therefore, has been to select individuals based on ideotypes with traits expected to promote group productivity. However, this approach is limited to architectural and physiological traits whose effects on growth and competition are relatively easy to anticipate. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation in plant stands. Our method is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation benefit the monoculture group but are disadvantageous to the individual when facing noncooperative neighbors. Testing the approach using the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we found a major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased cooperation and productivity in high-density stands. The allele likely affects a pleiotropic gene, since we find that it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher resistance against disease. Thus, even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable except under special circumstances, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might maintain latent genetic variation for cooperation in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could rapidly be leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.

                Background: Healthcare personnel providing COVID-19 care are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Understanding the factors associated with the transmission of infection among healthcare workers provides input for the development of prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were to study the adherence to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures followed between different categories of healthcare workers, to estimate seroconversion rate based on the type of exposure with COVID-19 patients, and to study the association between seroconversion and IPC practices. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021 among the healthcare workers in two tertiary healthcare institutes selected by purposive sampling. All Healthcare workers (HCWs) participating in the clinical management or having any exposure to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case were included. A total of 817 subjects were enrolled in the study. At baseline, details on IPC training and adherence along with details of the type of exposure with the COVID-19 patient were collected. The end-line visit was scheduled at 22-31 (preferably 28 days) days from the first visit for the collection of the symptom diary and end-line form.  Results: Hand hygiene practices were found to be best among paramedics (98.0%), followed by doctors (84.5%) and nurses (90.1%). Maximum HCWs (99.5%; 99.8%; 97.1%) reported using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appropriately and regular availability of PPE in the hospital setting. Among the various categories of HCWs, nurses had the highest proportion (28.7%) of untrained personnel. Conclusion: The HCWs who had contact with the surroundings of an infected patient showed higher odds of seroconversion although not statistically significant. Further, analyzing the types of PPE used, we found that the use of masks and gloves was protective in preventing infection. Strengthening IPC training through refresher training and demonstrating the correct use of PPE can enhance adherence to IPC measures.

                Background: E-government is an initiative taken by governments worldwide to align the administration of their countries. Governments have utilized the internet as part of a transition into a globalized economy. This helps reduce red tape and procedures in dealing with people in government agencies. This study aims to develop an e-government model as an anti-corruption strategy by applying the Penta-helix model and religiosity as the moderating variable. Methods: The data was gathered from government officials, representatives in business, media, academia, and NGOs, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2021. Online questionnaires were distributed to 240 respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, SPSS v.25 and SEM AMOS v.25 were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the Penta-helix elements and religiosity could help to reduce corruption in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Malaysia must increase its human resource competency and embed the religiosity element as a tool to reduce corruption. Conclusion: Penta-helix and religious factors should be incorporated by organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia as part of their strategy in combating corruption.

                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of red yeast rice on delayed union fracture in animal model: a molecular study of IL-6, BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-OC in fracture healing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background As serious fracture complications, delayed union and non-union are parts of complications from fracture healing. Growth factors such as BMP-2, VEGF, proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and bone formation BALP, N-Mid-OC are important regulators of the fracture healing process. Red yeast rice (RYR), produced by fermenting Monascus purpureus rice, monacolin K, which is the main ingredient in RYR, was found to play a major role in the anti-inflammatory process and increasing the proliferation of osteoblast in osteoporosis cases. This study aims to examine the effect of RYR in the fracture healing process in delayed union rats through molecular studies of levels of IL-6, BMP- 2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-OC. Methods This study was experimental research that used male rats (Rattus novergicus) which were divided into a control and 3 treatment groups using a random sampling method. Group 1 was given orally 25 mg/kg, Group 2 was 50 mg/kg, Group 3 was 100 mg/kg, and the control group was given a placebo. The rats were then subjected to a delayed union fracture model. Observations were made for two periods on the 14th and 28th days. Results There were no significant differences in serology examination between days 0 and 14 between groups. However, there were significant differences between groups on day 28. IL-6, BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-OC on day 28 between groups (p<0.001). The group with 100 mg/kg RYR extract was found to be the most influencing serology marker level. RYR 100 mg/kg significantly decreased IL-6, and increased BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-Osteocalcin, thus enhancing the fracture healing process in the delayed union rats model. Conclusion A red yeast rice dose of 100 mg/KgBW significantly reduced IL-6, increased BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, N-Mid-OC, and RUST Score so as to improve the fracture healing process in delayed union rats.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Pathogen and antibody identification in children with encephalitis in Myanmar</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prospective studies of encephalitis are rare in regions where encephalitis is prevalent, such as low middle income Southeast Asian countries. We compared the diagnostic yield of local and advanced tests in cases of pediatric encephalitis in Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Children with suspected subacute or acute encephalitis at Yangon Children's Hospital were prospectively recruited from 2016-2018. Cohort 1 (n = 65) had locally available diagnostic testing, while cohort 2 (n = 38) had advanced tests for autoantibodies (i.e., cell-based assays, tissue immunostaining, studies with cultured neurons) and infections (i.e., BioFire FilmArray multiplex Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) multiplex PCR panel, metagenomic sequencing, and pan-viral serologic testing (VirScan) of cerebrospinal fluid).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty cases (13 in cohort 1 and 7 in cohort 2) were found to have illnesses other than encephalitis. Of the 52 remaining cases in cohort 1, 43 (83%) had presumed infectious encephalitis (PIE) of which 2 cases (4%) had a confirmed infectious etiology (CIE). Nine cases (17%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis (PAE). Of the 31 cases in cohort 2, 23 (74%) had PIE of which one (3%) had CIE using local tests only, while 8 (26%) had PAE. Advanced tests confirmed an additional 10 (32%) infections, 4 (13%) possible infections and 5 (16%) cases of NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pediatric encephalitis is prevalent in Myanmar, and advanced technologies increase identification of treatable infectious and autoimmune causes. Developing affordable advanced tests to use globally represents a high clinical and research priority to improve diagnosis and prognosis of encephalitis.</p>

                Parikh et al. use single-cell RNA-seq to characterize the malignant and stromal cells in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Myoepithelial cells express Notch ligands, while luminal cells show Notch signaling, consistent with a paracrine mechanism and the biphasic nature of ACC. Recurrent ACC is more luminal, with increased Notch signaling.

                The mechanisms governing distant metastasis formation in colorectal cancer are incompletely understood. Laoukili et al. show that the BRAFV600E oncogene increases the capacity of disseminated tumor cells to withstand metastasis-associated oxidative stress by stimulating glutathione synthesis. This pathway promotes the formation of liver and lung metastases but not peritoneal metastases.

                Cholesterol metabolism is closely related to antiviral response. Tim-4 is a key molecule that regulates macrophage homeostasis. Wang et al. demonstrate that Tim-4 disturbs the Insig1-SCAP interaction and facilitates SREBP2 translocation, eventually leading to the upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in macrophages, which limits the antiviral type I IFN response.

                Noise plays a major role in cellular processes and in the development of tissues and organs. Several studies have examined the origin, the integration or the accommodation of noise in gene expression, cell growth and elaboration of organ shape. By contrast, much less is known about variability in cell division plane positioning, its origin and links with cell geometry, and its impact on tissue organization. Taking advantage of the first-stereotyped-then-variable division patterns in the embryo of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we combined 3D imaging and quantitative cell shape and cell lineage analysis together with mathematical and computer modeling to perform a large-scale, systematic analysis of variability in division plane orientation. Our results reveal that, paradoxically, variability in cell division patterns of <i>Arabidopsis</i> embryos is accompanied by a progressive reduction of heterogeneity in cell shape topology. The paradox is solved by showing that variability operates within a reduced repertoire of possible division plane orientations that is related to cell geometry. We show that in several domains of the embryo, a recently proposed geometrical division rule recapitulates observed variable patterns, suggesting that variable patterns emerge from deterministic principles operating in a variable geometrical context. Our work highlights the importance of emerging patterns in the plant embryo under iterated division principles, but also reveal domains where deviations between rule predictions and experimental observations point to additional regulatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Latent functional diversity may accelerate microbial community responses to temperature fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                How complex microbial communities respond to climatic fluctuations remains an open question. Due to their relatively short generation times and high functional diversity, microbial populations harbor great potential to respond as a community through a combination of strain-level phenotypic plasticity, adaptation, and species sorting. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unclear. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the degree to which bacterial communities can respond to changes in environmental temperature through a combination of phenotypic plasticity and species sorting alone. We grew replicate soil communities from a single location at six temperatures between 4°C and 50°C. We found that phylogenetically and functionally distinct communities emerge at each of these temperatures, with <i>K</i>-strategist taxa favored under cooler conditions and <i>r</i>-strategist taxa under warmer conditions. We show that this dynamic emergence of distinct communities across a wide range of temperatures (in essence, community-level adaptation) is driven by the resuscitation of latent functional diversity: the parent community harbors multiple strains pre-adapted to different temperatures that are able to ‘switch on’ at their preferred temperature without immigration or adaptation. Our findings suggest that microbial community function in nature is likely to respond rapidly to climatic temperature fluctuations through shifts in species composition by resuscitation of latent functional diversity.

                Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity. While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity, our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited. Here, we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity, and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested. Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity, tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity, we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation.

                A causal relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of neurodegenerative diseases remains controversial. Here, we focused on Seipinopathy, a dominant motor neuron disease, based on the finding that its causal gene product, Seipin, is a protein that spans the ER membrane twice. Gain-of-function mutations of Seipin produce non-glycosylated Seipin (ngSeipin), which was previously shown to induce ER stress and apoptosis at both cell and mouse levels albeit with no clarified mechanism. We found that aggregation-prone ngSeipin dominantly inactivated SERCA2b, the major calcium pump in the ER, and decreased the calcium concentration in the ER, leading to ER stress and apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma-derived cells (HCT116). This inactivation required oligomerization of ngSeipin and direct interaction of the C-terminus of ngSeipin with SERCA2b, and was observed in Seipin-deficient neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells expressing ngSeipin at an endogenous protein level. Our results thus provide a new direction to the controversy noted above.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mother cells control daughter cell proliferation in intestinal organoids to minimize proliferation fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                During renewal of the intestine, cells are continuously generated by proliferation. Proliferation and differentiation must be tightly balanced, as any bias toward proliferation results in uncontrolled exponential growth. Yet, the inherently stochastic nature of cells raises the question how such fluctuations are limited. We used time-lapse microscopy to track all cells in crypts of growing mouse intestinal organoids for multiple generations, allowing full reconstruction of the underlying lineage dynamics in space and time. Proliferative behavior was highly symmetric between sister cells, with both sisters either jointly ceasing or continuing proliferation. Simulations revealed that such symmetric proliferative behavior minimizes cell number fluctuations, explaining our observation that proliferating cell number remained constant even as crypts increased in size considerably. Proliferative symmetry did not reflect positional symmetry but rather lineage control through the mother cell. Our results indicate a concrete mechanism to balance proliferation and differentiation with minimal fluctuations that may be broadly relevant for other tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular reprogramming with ATOH1, GFI1, and POU4F3 implicate epigenetic changes and cell-cell signaling as obstacles to hair cell regeneration in mature mammals</a></h4>

              
                Reprogramming of the cochlea with hair-cell-specific transcription factors such as ATOH1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for hearing loss. ATOH1 expression in the developing cochlea can efficiently induce hair cell regeneration but the efficiency of hair cell reprogramming declines rapidly as the cochlea matures. We developed Cre-inducible mice to compare hair cell reprogramming with ATOH1 alone or in combination with two other hair cell transcription factors, GFI1 and POU4F3. In newborn mice, all transcription factor combinations tested produced large numbers of cells with the morphology of hair cells and rudimentary mechanotransduction properties. However, 1 week later, only a combination of ATOH1, GFI1 and POU4F3 could reprogram non-sensory cells of the cochlea to a hair cell fate, and these new cells were less mature than cells generated by reprogramming 1 week earlier. We used scRNA-seq and combined scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq to suggest at least two impediments to hair cell reprogramming in older animals. First, hair cell gene loci become less epigenetically accessible in non-sensory cells of the cochlea with increasing age. Second, signaling from hair cells to supporting cells, including Notch signaling, can prevent reprogramming of many supporting cells to hair cells, even with three hair cell transcription factors. Our results shed light on the molecular barriers that must be overcome to promote hair cell regeneration in the adult cochlea.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conservation of oocyte development in germline cysts from Drosophila to mouse</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies show that pre-follicular mouse oogenesis takes place in germline cysts, highly conserved groups of oogonial cells connected by intercellular bridges that develop as nurse cells as well as an oocyte. Long studied in <i>Drosophila</i> and insect gametogenesis, female germline cysts acquire cytoskeletal polarity and traffic centrosomes and organelles between nurse cells and the oocyte to form the Balbiani body, a conserved marker of polarity. Mouse oocyte development and nurse cell dumping are supported by dynamic, cell-specific programs of germline gene expression. High levels of perinatal germ cell death in this species primarily result from programmed nurse cell turnover after transfer rather than defective oocyte production. The striking evolutionary conservation of early oogenesis mechanisms between distant animal groups strongly suggests that gametogenesis and early embryonic development in vertebrates and invertebrates share even more in common than currently believed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systemic racial disparities in funding rates at the National Science Foundation</a></h4>

              
                Concerns about systemic racism at academic and research institutions have increased over the past decade. Here, we investigate data from the National Science Foundation (NSF), a major funder of research in the United States, and find evidence for pervasive racial disparities. In particular, white principal investigators (PIs) are consistently funded at higher rates than most non-white PIs. Funding rates for white PIs have also been increasing relative to annual overall rates with time. Moreover, disparities occur across all disciplinary directorates within the NSF and are greater for research proposals. The distributions of average external review scores also exhibit systematic offsets based on PI race. Similar patterns have been described in other research funding bodies, suggesting that racial disparities are widespread. The prevalence and persistence of these racial disparities in funding have cascading impacts that perpetuate a cumulative advantage to white PIs across all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental morphing enables informed dispersal of the dandelion diaspore</a></h4>

              
                Animal migration is highly sensitised to environmental cues, but plant dispersal is considered largely passive. The common dandelion, <i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, bears an intricate haired pappus facilitating flight. The pappus enables the formation of a separated vortex ring during flight; however, the pappus structure is not static but reversibly changes shape by closing in response to moisture. We hypothesised that this leads to changed dispersal properties in response to environmental conditions. Using wind tunnel experiments for flow visualisation, particle image velocimetry, and flight tests we characterised the fluid mechanics effects of the pappus morphing. We also modelled dispersal to understand the impact of pappus morphing on diaspore distribution. Pappus morphing dramatically alters the fluid mechanics of diaspore flight. We found that when the pappus closes in moist conditions, the drag coefficient decreases and thus the falling velocity is greatly increased. Detachment of diaspores from the parent plant also substantially decreases. The change in detachment when the pappus closes increases dispersal distances by reducing diaspore release when wind speeds are low. We propose that moisture-dependent pappus-morphing is a form of informed dispersal allowing rapid responses to changing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fixation can change the appearance of phase separation in living cells</a></h4>

              
                Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde (PFA) is an essential step in numerous biological techniques as it is thought to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells. Fixed cell imaging techniques such as immunofluorescence have been widely used to detect liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we compared images, before and after fixation, of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to undergo LLPS. Surprisingly, we found that PFA fixation can both enhance and diminish putative LLPS behaviors. For specific proteins, fixation can even cause their droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells that do not have any detectable puncta in the live condition. Fixing cells in the presence of glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse the fixation effect from enhancing to diminishing LLPS appearance. We further established a kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein-protein interactions. Simulations based on the model suggest that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and notably, the difference between fixation rates of different proteins. Consistent with simulations, live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments showed that a fast overall rate of fixation relative to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation artifacts. Our work reveals that PFA fixation changes the appearance of LLPS from living cells, presents a caveat in studying LLPS using fixation-based methods, and suggests a mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Improving the accuracy of single-trial fMRI response estimates using GLMsingle</a></h4>

              
                Advances in artificial intelligence have inspired a paradigm shift in human neuroscience, yielding large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets that provide high-resolution brain responses to thousands of naturalistic visual stimuli. Because such experiments necessarily involve brief stimulus durations and few repetitions of each stimulus, achieving sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can be a major challenge. We address this challenge by introducing <i>GLMsingle</i>, a scalable, user-friendly toolbox available in MATLAB and Python that enables accurate estimation of single-trial fMRI responses (<a href="https://glmsingle.org/">glmsingle.org</a>). Requiring only fMRI time-series data and a design matrix as inputs, GLMsingle integrates three techniques for improving the accuracy of trial-wise general linear model (GLM) beta estimates. First, for each voxel, a custom hemodynamic response function (HRF) is identified from a library of candidate functions. Second, cross-validation is used to derive a set of noise regressors from voxels unrelated to the experiment. Third, to improve the stability of beta estimates for closely spaced trials, betas are regularized on a voxel-wise basis using ridge regression. Applying GLMsingle to the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000, we find that GLMsingle substantially improves the reliability of beta estimates across visually-responsive cortex in all subjects. Comparable improvements in reliability are also observed in a smaller-scale auditory dataset from the StudyForrest experiment. These improvements translate into tangible benefits for higher-level analyses relevant to systems and cognitive neuroscience. We demonstrate that GLMsingle: (i) helps decorrelate response estimates between trials nearby in time; (ii) enhances representational similarity between subjects within and across datasets; and (iii) boosts one-versus-many decoding of visual stimuli. GLMsingle is a publicly available tool that can significantly improve the quality of past, present, and future neuroimaging datasets sampling brain activity across many experimental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High spatial resolution analysis using automated indentation mapping differentiates biomechanical properties of normal vs. degenerated articular cartilage in mice</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage is crucial to understanding processes of tissue homeostasis vs. degeneration. In mouse models, however, limitations are imposed by their small joint size and thin cartilage surfaces. Here we present a 3D automated surface mapping system and methodology that allows for mechanical characterization of mouse cartilage with high spatial resolution. We performed repeated indentation mappings, followed by cartilage thickness measurement via needle probing, at 31 predefined positions distributed over the medial and lateral femoral condyles of healthy mice. High-resolution 3D x-ray microscopy (XRM) imaging was used to validate tissue thickness measurements. The automated indentation mapping was reproducible, and needle probing yielded cartilage thicknesses comparable to XRM imaging. When comparing healthy vs. degenerated cartilage, topographical variations in biomechanics were identified, with altered thickness and stiffness (instantaneous modulus) across condyles and within anteroposterior sub-regions. This quantitative technique comprehensively characterized cartilage function in mice femoral condyle cartilage. Hence, it has the potential to improve our understanding of tissue structure-function interplay in mouse models of repair and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional connectivity subtypes associate robustly with ASD diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the changes in functional brain organization in autism is hampered by the extensive heterogeneity that characterizes this neurodevelopmental disorder. Data driven clustering offers a straightforward way to decompose autism heterogeneity into subtypes of connectivity and promises an unbiased framework to investigate behavioral symptoms and causative genetic factors. Yet, the robustness and generalizability of functional connectivity subtypes is unknown. Here, we show that a simple hierarchical cluster analysis can robustly relate a given individual and brain network to a connectivity subtype, but that continuous assignments are more robust than discrete ones. We also found that functional connectivity subtypes are moderately associated with the clinical diagnosis of autism, and these associations generalize to independent replication data. We explored systematically 18 different brain networks as we expected them to associate with different behavioral profiles as well as different key regions. Contrary to this prediction, autism functional connectivity subtypes converged on a common topography across different networks, consistent with a compression of the primary gradient of functional brain organization, as previously reported in the literature. Our results support the use of data driven clustering as a reliable data dimensionality reduction technique, where any given dimension only associates moderately with clinical manifestations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coordinated multiplexing of information about separate objects in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory receptive fields are large enough that they can contain more than one perceptible stimulus. How, then, can the brain encode information about <i>each</i> of the stimuli that may be present at a given moment? We recently showed that when more than one stimulus is present, single neurons can fluctuate between coding one vs. the other(s) across some time period, suggesting a form of neural multiplexing of different stimuli (Caruso et al., 2018). Here, we investigate (a) whether such coding fluctuations occur in early visual cortical areas; (b) how coding fluctuations are coordinated across the neural population; and (c) how coordinated coding fluctuations depend on the parsing of stimuli into separate vs. fused objects. We found coding fluctuations do occur in macaque V1 but only when the two stimuli form separate objects. Such separate objects evoked a novel pattern of V1 spike count (‘noise’) correlations involving distinct distributions of positive and negative values. This bimodal correlation pattern was most pronounced among pairs of neurons showing the strongest evidence for coding fluctuations or multiplexing. Whether a given pair of neurons exhibited positive or negative correlations depended on whether the two neurons both responded better to the same object or had different object preferences. Distinct distributions of spike count correlations based on stimulus preferences were also seen in V4 for separate objects but not when two stimuli fused to form one object. These findings suggest multiple objects evoke different response dynamics than those evoked by single stimuli, lending support to the multiplexing hypothesis and suggesting a means by which information about multiple objects can be preserved despite the apparent coarseness of sensory coding.

                Our current understanding of focal epilepsy is evolving as increasing evidence suggests that tissue abnormalities may extend beyond the focus. In adults, widespread structural changes remote from the epileptic focus have been demonstrated with MRI, predominantly using morphological markers. However, the underlying pathophysiology of these changes is unclear, and it is not known whether these result from ongoing disease processes or treatment-related side-effects, or whether they emerge earlier. Few studies have focused on children, who typically have shorter disease duration. Fewer still have utilised quantitative MRI, which may provide a more sensitive and interpretable measure of tissue microstructural changes. In this study, we aimed to determine if there were common spatial modes of changes in cortical architecture in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and secondarily if changes were related to disease severity. To assess cortical microstructure, quantitative T1 and T2 relaxometry (qT1 and qT2) was measured in 89 children - 43 with drug-resistant focal epilepsy [age-range=4-18 years] and 46 healthy controls [age-range=2-18 years]. We assessed depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 values across the cortex, as well as their gradient of change across cortical depths. As a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether global changes seen in group analyses were driven by focal pathologies in individual patients. Finally, we trained a classifier using qT1 and qT2 gradient maps from patients with radiologically-defined abnormalities (MRI-positive) and healthy controls, and tested if this could classify patients without reported radiological abnormalities (MRI-negative). We detected depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 increases in widespread cortical areas, likely representing loss of structure such as altered cortical stratification, gliosis, myelin and iron alterations, oedema-associated increases in free-water, or a combination of these. Changes did not correlate with disease severity measures, suggesting they may appear during cerebral development and represent antecedent neurobiological alterations. Using a classifier trained with MRI-positive patients and controls, sensitivity was 62% at 100% specificity on held-out MRI-negative patients and controls. Our findings suggest the presence of a potential imaging endophenotype of focal epilepsy, detectable irrespective of radiologically-identified abnormalities, and possibly evident at a pre-symptomatic disease stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute effect of antiseizure drugs on background oscillations in Scn1aA1783V Dravet syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Dravet syndrome (Dravet) is a rare and severe form of developmental epileptic encephalopathy. First-line treatment for DS patients includes valproic acid (VA) or clobazam with or without stiripentol (CLB+STP), while sodium channel blockers like carbamazepine (CBZ) or lamotrigine (LTG) are contraindicated. As patients are rarely seizure-free, drug therapy focuses on reducing the seizure burden, as reported by caregivers. In addition to their effect on epileptic phenotypes, antiseizure medications (ASMs) were shown to modify the properties of background neuronal activity. Nevertheless, little is known about these background properties alternations in Dravet. Methods: Utilizing Dravet mice (DS, Scn1aA1783V/WT), we tested the acute effect of several ASMs on background electrocorticography (ECoG) activity and frequency of interictal spikes. Results: Compared to wild-type mice, background ECoG activity in DS had lower power and reduced phase coherence, which was not corrected by any of the tested ASMs. However, acute administration of Dravet-recommended drugs, including VA or a combination of CLB+STP, caused, in most mice, a reduction of frequency of interictal spikes, alongside an increase in the relative contribution of the beta frequency band. Conversely, CBZ and LTG increased the frequency of interictal spikes with no effect on background spectral properties. Moreover, we uncovered a correlation between the reduction in interictal spike frequency, the drug-induced effect on the power of background activity, and a spectral shift toward higher frequency bands. Significance: These data provide a comprehensive analysis of the effect of selected ASMs on the properties of background neuronal oscillations and highlight a possible correlation between their effect on epilepsy and background activity. Thus, examining these properties, following an acute administration, may be used as an additional tool for rapid evaluation of the therapeutic potential of ASMs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic and Signaling Determinants of Blood-Brain Barrier-Regulatory Genetic Networks</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the molecular movement into the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation, whereas adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes during BBB formation and maintenance. Here we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator's histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevented Wnt/{beta}-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. We showed that low Wnt signaling during development can modify BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clustering and temporal organization of sleep spindles underlie motor memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep benefits motor memory consolidation, which is mediated by sleep spindle activity and associated memory reactivations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, the particular role of NREM2 and NREM3 sleep spindles and the mechanisms triggering this memory consolidation process remain controversial. Here, simultaneous electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEGfMRI) recordings were collected during night-time sleep following the learning of a motor sequence task. Adopting a time-based clustering approach, we provide evidence that spindles iteratively occur within clustered and temporally organized patterns during both NREM2 and NREM3 sleep. However, the clustering of spindles in trains is related to motor memory consolidation during NREM2 sleep only. Altogether, our findings suggest that the clustering and rhythmic occurrence of spindles during NREM2 sleep may serve as an intrinsic rhythmic sleep mechanism for the timed reactivation and subsequent consolidation of motor memories, through synchronized oscillatory activity within a subcortical-cortical network involved during learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance modulations phase-locked to action depend on internal state</a></h4>

              
                Several studies have probed perceptual performance at different times after a self-paced motor action and found frequency-specific modulations of perceptual performance phase-locked to the action. Such action-related modulation has been reported for various frequencies and modulation strengths. In an attempt to establish a basic effect at the population level, we had a relatively large number of participants (n=50) perform a self-paced button press followed by a detection task at threshold, and we applied both fixed- and random-effects tests. The combined data of all trials and participants surprisingly did not show any significant action-related modulation. However, based on previous studies, we explored the possibility that such modulation depends on the participant's internal state. Indeed, when we split trials based on performance in neighboring trials, then trials in periods of low performance showed an action-related modulation at approximately 17 Hz. When we split trials based on the performance in the preceding trial, we found that trials following a ''miss'' showed an action-related modulation at approximately 17 Hz. Finally, when we split participants based on their false-alarm rate, we found that participants with no false alarms showed an action-related modulation at approximately 17 Hz. All these effects were significant in random-effects tests, supporting an inference on the population. Together, these findings indicate that action-related modulations are not always detectable. However, the results suggest that specific internal states such as lower attentional engagement and/or higher decision criterion are characterized by a modulation in the beta-frequency range.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Compression supports low-dimensional representations of behavior across neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                Dimensionality reduction, a form of compression, can simplify representations of information to increase efficiency and reveal general patterns. Yet, this simplification also forfeits information, thereby reducing representational capacity. Hence, the brain may benefit from generating both compressed and uncompressed activity, and may do so in a heterogeneous manner across diverse neural circuits that represent low-level (sensory) or high-level (cognitive) stimuli. However, precisely how compression and representational capacity differ across the cortex remains unknown. Here we predict different levels of compression across regional circuits by using random walks on networks to model activity flow and to formulate rate-distortion functions, which are the basis of lossy compression. Using a large sample of youth (n=1,040), we test predictions in two ways: by measuring the dimensionality of spontaneous activity from sensorimotor to association cortex, and by assessing the representational capacity for 24 behaviors in neural circuits and 20 cognitive variables in recurrent neural networks. Our network theory of compression predicts the dimensionality of activity (t=12.13, p<0.001) and the representational capacity of biological (r=0.53, p=0.016) and artificial (r=0.61, p<0.001) networks. The model suggests how a basic form of compression is an emergent property of activity flow between distributed circuits that communicate with the rest of the network.

                The molecular pathway associated with Multiple sclerosis (MS) is complex and symptomatic treatments are only available right now. Early diagnosis of MS creates a window for healthcare providers to manage the disease more efficiently. Blood-based biomarker study has been done in the past to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes but in this present study, a novel approach has been taken for identifying genes associated with the disease. In this present study, hub genes are identified and the top ten hub genes were used to identify drugs associated with them. Upregulated genes were identified using the dataset GSE21942 (which contains information related to genes identified in the blood of multiple sclerosis patients) and datasets GSE17846 and GSE61741(which contains information related to microRNAs taken from multiple sclerosis patients). Genes associated with microRNAs were identified using miRWalk. Common genes from both miRWalk and the dataset GSE21942 were identified and were subjected to STRINGdb for the creation of a protein-protein interaction network and this network was then imported to Cytoscape for identifying the top ten hub genes. The top ten hub genes were subjected to EnrichR for enrichment analysis of genes. In our study, it was found that CTNNB1 is the gene with the highest degree (116).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigations into an overlooked early component of painful nociceptive withdrawal reflex responses in humans</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The role of pain as a warning system necessitates a rapid transmission of information from the periphery for the execution of appropriate motor responses. The nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) is a physiological response to protect the limb from a painful stimulus and is often considered an objective measure of spinal nociceptive excitability. The NWR is commonly defined by its latency in the presumed Adelta-fiber range consistent with the canonical view that fast pain is signaled by Adelta nociceptors. We recently demonstrated that human skin is equipped with ultrafast (A beta range) nociceptors. Here, we investigated the short-latency component of the reflex and explored the relationship between reflex latency and pain perception. Methods: We revisited our earlier work on NWR measurements in which, following convention, only those reflex responses were selected that were in the presumed Adelta range (taken to be latencies greater than or equal to 90 ms in that study). In our current analysis, we expanded the time window to search for shorter latency responses and compared those with pain ratings. Results: In both cohorts, we found an abundance of recordings with short-latency reflex responses. In nearly 90% of successful recordings, only single reflex responses (not dual) were seen which allowed us to compare pain ratings to reflex latencies. We found that shorter latency reflexes were just as painful as those in the conventional latency range. Discussion: We found a preponderance of short-latency painful reflex responses. Based on this finding, we suggest that short-latency responses must be considered in future studies. We predict these might be signaled by the ultrafast nociceptors, warranting further investigation.

                Biological neuronal networks have the propensity to oscillate. However, it is unclear whether these oscillations are a mere byproduct of neuronal interactions or serve computational purposes. Therefore, we implemented hallmark features of the cerebral cortex in recurrent neuronal networks (RNNs) simulated in silico and examined their performance on common pattern recognition tasks after training with a gradient-based learning rule. We find that by configuring network nodes as damped harmonic oscillators (DHOs), performance is substantially improved over non-oscillating architectures and that the introduction of heterogeneous nodes, conduction delays, and network modularity further improved performance. We furthermore provide a proof of concept of how unsupervised Hebbian learning can work in such networks. Analyses of network activity illustrate how the nonlinear dynamics of coupled DHOs drive performance, and provide plausible a posteriori explanations for a number of physiological phenomena whose function so far has been elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuo-proprioceptive recalibration and the sensorimotor map</a></h4>

              
                Spatial perception of our hand is closely linked to our ability to move the hand accurately. We might therefore expect that reach planning would take into account any changes in perceived hand position; in other words, that perception and action relating to the hand should depend on a common sensorimotor map. However, there is evidence to suggest that changes in perceived hand position affect a body representation that functions separately from the body representation used to control movement. Here we examined target-directed reaching before and after participants either did (Mismatch group) or did not (Veridical group) experience a cue conflict known to elicit recalibration in perceived hand position. For the reaching task, participants grasped a robotic manipulandum that positioned their unseen hand for each trial. Participants then briskly moved the handle straight ahead to a visual target, receiving no performance feedback. For the perceptual calibration task, participants estimated the locations of visual, proprioceptive, or combined cues about their unseen hand. The Mismatch group experienced a gradual 70 mm forward mismatch between visual and proprioceptive cues, resulting in forward proprioceptive recalibration. Participants made significantly shorter reaches after this manipulation, consistent with feeling their hand to be further forward than it was, but reaching performance returned to baseline levels after only 10 reaches. The Veridical group, after exposure to veridically-aligned visual and proprioceptive cues about the hand, showed no change in reach distance. These results are not fully consistent with a single common sensorimotor map, but could suggest multiple, interacting body representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrostatic regulation of the cis- and trans-membrane interactions of synaptotagmin-1</a></h4>

              
                Synaptotagmin-1 is a vesicular protein and Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Ca2+ induces synaptotagmin-1 binding to its own vesicle membrane, called the cis-interaction, thus preventing the trans-interaction of synaptotagmin-1 to the plasma membrane. However, the electrostatic regulation of the cis- and trans-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 was poorly understood in different Ca2+-buffering conditions. Here we provide an assay to monitor the cis- and trans-membrane interactions of synaptotagmin-1 by using native purified vesicles and the plasma membrane-mimicking liposomes (PM-liposomes). Both ATP and EGTA similarly reverse the cis-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 in free [Ca2+] of 10 to 100 uM. High PIP2 concentrations in the PM-liposomes reduce the Hill coefficient of vesicle fusion and synaptotagmin-1 membrane binding; this observation suggests that local PIP2 concentrations control the Ca2+-cooperativity of synaptotagmin-1. Our data provide evidence that Ca2+ chelators, including EGTA and polyphosphate anions such as ATP, ADP, and AMP, electrostatically reverse the cis-interaction of synaptotagmin-1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing end-tidal CO2, respiration volume per time (RVT), and average gray matter signal for mapping cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude and delay with breath-hold task BOLD fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), defined as the cerebral blood flow response to a vasoactive stimulus, is an imaging biomarker with demonstrated utility in a range of diseases and in typical development and aging processes. A robust and widely implemented method to map CVR involves using a breath-hold task during a BOLD fMRI scan. Recording end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) changes during the breath-hold task is recommended to be used as a reference signal for modeling CVR amplitude in standard units (%BOLD/mmHg) and CVR delay in seconds. However, obtaining reliable PETCO2 recordings requires equipment and task compliance that may not be achievable in all settings. To address this challenge, we investigated two alternative reference signals to map CVR amplitude and delay in a lagged general linear model (lagged-GLM) framework: respiration volume per time (RVT) and average gray matter BOLD response (GM-BOLD). In 8 healthy adults with multiple scan sessions, we compare spatial agreement of CVR maps from RVT and GM-BOLD to those generated with PETCO2. We define a threshold to determine whether a PETCO2 recording has ''sufficient'' quality for CVR mapping and perform these comparisons in 16 datasets with sufficient PETCO2 and in 6 datasets with insufficient PETCO2. When PETCO2 quality is sufficient, both RVT and GM-BOLD produce CVR amplitude maps that are nearly identical to those from PETCO2 (after accounting for differences in scale), with the caveat they are not in standard units to facilitate between-group comparisons. CVR delays are comparable to PETCO2 with an RVT regressor but may be underestimated with the average GM-BOLD regressor. Importantly, when PETCO2 quality is insufficient, RVT and GM-BOLD CVR recover reasonable CVR amplitude and delay maps, provided the participant attempted the breath-hold task. Therefore, our framework offers a solution for achieving high quality CVR maps in both retrospective and prospective studies where sufficient PETCO2 recordings are not available and especially in populations where obtaining reliable measurements is a known challenge (e.g., children). Our results have the potential to improve the accessibility of CVR mapping and to increase the prevalence of this promising metric of vascular health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ApoE isoforms differentially regulate neuronal membrane proteasomes to shift the threshold for pathological aggregation of endogenous Tau</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal membrane proteasomes (NMPs) are a functionally transmembrane subset of 20S proteasomes that degrade newly synthesized proteins. To date, the molecular composition of NMPs is undefined, and moreover, whether NMPs can influence any aspect of protein aggregation with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. Using a Cre-dependent conditional knock-in mouse line to endogenously tag the proteasome, we find that NMPs co-purify with ApoE. We discover that NMP membrane localization is differentially modulated by ApoE isoforms (E4 less than E3 less than E2) in vitro, in vivo, and in human postmortem samples. This isoform-dependent change in NMP localization inversely correlates with the risk that ApoE isoforms pose for Alzheimers Disease. ApoE4-dependent reduction of NMP localization is strongest in brain regions selectively vulnerable to neurodegeneration. We synthesized selective NMP-specific inhibitors and discovered that NMP inhibition induces aggregation of endogenous and newly synthesized mouse and human Tau isoforms, without the need for seeding or pathogenic mutations. We posit that newly synthesized Tau is exceptionally susceptible to aggregation due to NMP dysfunction. Stereotactic injection of NMP inhibitors in vivo induces aggregation, phosphorylation, somatodendritic mislocalization and pathology of endogenous newly synthesized Tau. Finally, using ApoE-KI/hTau-KI crosses, we find that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the aggregation threshold for Tau. Overall, our data define NMPs as a pivotal proteostasis mechanism underlying the formation of endogenous Tau aggregates, which is directly regulated by the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers Disease.

                High-throughput analysis of behaviour is a pivotal instrument in modern neuroscience, allowing researchers to combine modern genetics breakthrough to unbiased, objective, reproducible experimental approaches. To this extent, we recently created an open-source hardware platform (ethoscope) that allows for inexpensive, accessible, high-throughput analysis of behaviour in Drosophila or other animal models. Here we equip ethoscopes with a Python framework for data analysis, ethoscopy, designed to be a user-friendly yet powerful platform, meeting the requirements of researchers with limited coding expertise as well as experienced datascientists. Ethoscopy is best consumed in a prebaked Jupyter-based docker container, ethoscope-lab, to improve accessibility and to encourage the use of notebook as the natural platform to share post-publication data analysis. Availability and implementation: Ethoscopy is a Python package available on GitHub and PyPi. Ethoscope-lab is a docker container available on DockerHub. A landing page aggregating all the code and documentation is available at https://lab.gilest.ro/ethoscopy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience Adaptively Tunes the Timing Rules for Associative Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                A key function of the brain is to learn about the statistical relationships between events in the world. A mechanism of this learning is associative neural plasticity, controlled by the timing between neural events. Here, we show that experience can dramatically alter the timing rules governing associative plasticity to match the constraints of a particular circuit and behavior, thereby improving learning. In normal mice, the timing requirements for associative plasticity in the oculomotor cerebellum are precisely matched to the 120 ms delay for visual feedback about behavioral errors.1 This task-specific specialization of the timing rules for plasticity is acquired through experience; in dark-reared mice that had never experienced visual feedback about oculomotor errors, plasticity defaulted to a coincidence-based rule. Computational modeling suggests two broad strategies for implementing this Adaptive Tuning of the Timing Rules for Associative Plasticity (ATTRAP), which tune plasticity to different features of the statistics of neural activity. The modeling predicts a critical role of this process in optimizing the accuracy of temporal credit assignment during learning; consistent with this, behavioral experiments revealed a delay in the timing of learned eye movements in mice lacking experience-dependent tuning of the timing rules for plasticity. ATTRAP provides a powerful mechanism for matching the timing contingencies for associative plasticity to the functional requirements of a particular circuit and learning task, thereby providing a candidate neural mechanism for meta-learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bimodal stimulation for the reduction of tinnitus using vibration on the skin</a></h4>

              
                Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) affects 1 in 10 adults in the United States, often with damaging psychological consequences. Currently, there exists no cure for most forms of tinnitus. Recently, bimodal stimulation -- the pairing of sounds with haptic stimulation -- has shown efficacy in reducing the symptoms of tinnitus. Previous bimodal stimulation approaches have used electrical shocks on the tongue, a technique that requires daily in-person sessions at an audiologist's office. We here show that excellent results can be achieved wearing a wristband with multiple vibratory motors. Tones are played and the wristband correspondingly vibrates the wrist of the user at different spatial locations depending on the frequency of the tone. We compared the experimental group with a control group who listened to the tones but did not wear the wristband. The tone frequencies were centered on each user's tinnitus frequency and the tones were randomized both in frequency and duration. 45 participants with Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) scores of 25 and above were tested. Results show a significantly greater reduction in TFI scores for the experimental group compared to the control. Importantly, with higher baseline severity we find larger differences between the experimental and control groups, revealing greater symptom improvement for those with severe tinnitus. The therapeutic approach of combining sounds with spatially- and temporally-correlated vibrations on the wrist is found to be a simple, time-efficient, and effective procedure to lessen the symptoms of tinnitus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inferring Cognitive State Underlying Conflict Choices in Verbal Stroop Task Using Heterogeneous Input Discriminative-Generative Decoder Model</a></h4>

              
                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia interacts with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and shapes a control loop, specifically when the brain receives contradictory information from either different sensory systems or conflicting information from sensory inputs and prior knowledge that developed in the brain. Experimental studies demonstrated that significant increases in theta activities (2-8 Hz) in both the STN and mPFC as well as increased phase synchronization between mPFC and STN are prominent features of conflict processing. While these neural features reflect the importance of STN-mPFC circuitry in conflict processing, a low-dimensional representation of the mPFC-STN interaction referred to as a cognitive state, that links neural activities generated by these sub-regions to behavioral signals (e.g., the response time), remains to be identified. Here, we propose a new model, namely, the heterogeneous input discriminative-generative decoder (HI-DGD) model, to infer a cognitive state underlying decision-making based on neural activities (STN and mPFC) and behavioral signals (individuals' response time) recorded in 10 Parkinson's disease patients while they performed a Stroop task. PD patients may have conflict processing which is quantitatively (may be qualitative in some) different from healthy population. Using extensive synthetic and experimental data, we showed that the HI-DGD model can diffuse information from neural- and behavioral data simultaneously and estimate cognitive states underlying conflict and non-conflict trials significantly better than traditional methods. Additionally, the HI-DGD model identified which neural features made significant contributions to conflict and non-conflict choices. Interestingly, the estimated features match well with those reported in experimental studies. Finally, we highlight the capability of the HI-DGD model in estimating a cognitive state from a single trial of observation, which makes it appropriate to be utilized in closed-loop neuromodulation systems.

                Humans and other species can remember how long ago specific events happened. Based on a systematic exploration of neural coding and association schemes, we develop different hypotheses about how neural networks with Hebbian plasticity could enable an automatic reconstruction of the time of past events. We assess these hypotheses from a computational perspective and in light of the available behavioral and neurophysiological data. Existing models of how the time of past events can be remembered are special cases of our theory. We conclude that many models lead to indistinguishable behavior and future experiments with neural recordings are needed to disambiguate different models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural and functional specializations of human fast spiking neurons support fast cortical signaling</a></h4>

              
                In rodent cortical networks, fast spiking interneurons (FSINs) provide fast inhibition that synchronizes neuronal activity and is critical for cognitive function. Fast synchronization frequencies are evolutionary conserved in the expanded human neocortex, despite larger neuron-to-neuron distances that challenge fast input-output transfer functions of FSINs. Here, we test which mechanistic specializations of large human FSINs explain their fast-signaling properties in human cortex. With morphological reconstructions, multi-patch recordings, and biophysical modeling we find that despite three-fold longer dendritic path lengths, human FSINs maintain fast inhibition between connected pyramidal neurons through several mechanisms: stronger synapse strength of excitatory inputs, larger dendrite diameter with reduced complexity, faster AP initiation, and faster and larger inhibitory output, while Na+ current activation /inactivation properties are similar. These adaptations underlie short input-output delays in fast inhibition of human pyramidal neurons through FSINs, explaining how cortical synchronization frequencies are conserved despite expanded and sparse network topology of human cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signatures of electrical stimulation driven network interactions in the human limbic system</a></h4>

              
                Stimulation-evoked signals are starting to be used as biomarkers to indicate the state and health of brain networks. The human limbic network, often targeted for brain stimulation therapy, is involved in emotion and memory processing. Previous anatomical, neurophysiological, and functional studies suggest distinct subsystems within the limbic network (Rolls, 2015). Previous studies using intracranial electrical stimulation, however, have emphasized the similarities of the evoked waveforms across the limbic network. We test whether these subsystems have distinct stimulation-driven signatures. In seven patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we stimulated the limbic system with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES). Reliable cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) were measured between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the CCEP waveform in the PCC after hippocampal stimulation showed a unique and reliable morphology, which we term the limbic H-wave. This limbic H-wave was visually distinct and separately decoded from the amygdala to ACC waveform. Diffusion MRI data show that the measured endpoints in the PCC overlap with the endpoints of the parolfactory cingulum bundle rather than the parahippocampal cingulum, suggesting that the limbic H-wave may travel through the fornix, mammillary bodies, and the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT). This was further confirmed by stimulating the ANT, which evoked the same limbic H-wave but with a shorter latency. Limbic subsystems have unique stimulation-evoked signatures that may be used in the future to help develop stimulation therapies.

                Functionally distinct information encoded by the two main divisions of the entorhinal cortex (EC), the lateral EC (LEC) and the medial EC (MEC), is thought to be first integrated at the level of the hippocampus. Here we examine a circuit connecting MEC to LEC that supports functional interplay at the level of the two entorhinal domains. Using a combination of anatomical, in vitro electrophysiological and behavioral experiments in the mouse, we report that axons from MEC somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons densely distribute in layer I of LEC, where they drive strong and near selective inhibition of principal neurons in layer IIa. This inhibitory pathway is accompanied by MEC glutamatergic axons that innervate multiple layers of LEC and preferentially synapse onto principal neurons in layers IIb and III. Our findings indicate that excitatory and inhibitory projections from MEC may separately regulate the activity of different populations of hippocampal-projecting principal neurons in LEC.

However, CNNs typically use smaller kernel sizes (e.g., 3 &amp;amp;times; 3) for feature extraction in visual encoding models. Although the receptive field size of CNN can be enlarged by increasing the network depth or subsampling, it is limited by the small size of the convolution kernel, leading to an insufficient receptive field size. In biological research, the size of the neuronal population receptive field of high-level visual encoding regions is usually three to four times that of low-level visual encoding regions. Thus, CNNs with a larger receptive field size align with the biological findings. The RepLKNet model directly expands the convolution kernel size to obtain a larger-scale receptive field. Therefore, this paper proposes a mixed model to replace CNN for feature extraction in visual encoding models. The proposed model mixes RepLKNet and VGG so that the mixed model has a receptive field of different sizes to extract more feature information from the image. The experimental results indicate that the mixed model achieves better encoding performance in multiple regions of the visual cortex than the traditional convolutional model. Also, a larger-scale receptive field should be considered in building visual encoding models so that the convolution network can play a more significant role in visual representations.</p>

	<p>Transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) is a rare cause of acute amnestic syndromes (AAS), often misdiagnosed as transient global amnesia (TGA). We proposed a scoring system&amp;amp;mdash;the EPIlepsy AMNEsia (EPIAMNE) score&amp;amp;mdash;using quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis to obtain a tool for differentiating TEA from TGA. We retrospectively reviewed clinical information and standard EEGs (stEEG) of 19 patients with TEA and 21 with TGA. We computed and compared Power Spectral Density, demonstrating an increased relative theta power in TGA. We subsequently incorporated qEEG features in EPIAMNE score, together with clinical and stEEG features. ROC curve models and pairwise ROC curve comparison were used to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy for TEA detection of EPIAMNE score, presence of symptoms atypical for TGA (pSymAT) and identification of anomalies (interictal epileptiform or temporal focal spiky transients) at stEEG (PosEEG). Area Under the Curve (AUC) of EPIAMNE score revealed to be higher than PosEEG and pSymAT (AUCEPIAMNE = 0.95, AUCpSymAT = 0.85, AUCPosEEG = 0.67) and this superiority proved to be statistically significant (p-valueEPIAMNE-PosEEG and p-valueEPIAMNE-pSymAT &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, EPIAMNE score classified TEA with higher accuracy than PosEEG and pSymAT. This approach could become a promising tool for the differential diagnosis of AAS, especially for early TEA detection.</p>

	<p>Multiple studies support the relationship between ADHD and overweight/obesity in youth. Different mechanisms may be involved, such as temperamental and psychopathological factors. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that specific temperamental and psychopathological dimensions could mediate the relationship between ADHD and obesity. The sample included 100 children and adolescents (78 males and 22 females; age range 6 to 18 years; mean age 9.90 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 years). The assessment procedure included Conners&amp;amp;rsquo; Parent Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Long (CPRS-R:L) as the inclusion criterion for ADHD diagnosis, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a dimensional measure for psychopathology, and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory, which describes four temperamental dimensions: novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P). While in the whole ADHD sample, the highest scores were found in NS and the lowest in P, ADHD with overweight/obesity, compared to ADHD with normal weight, showed higher HA and RD, lower NS, and higher CBCL Internalizing scores. These findings suggest that ADHD youth with overweight/obesity present specific temperamental and psychopathological features compared to those without overweight/obesity. If confirmed in larger samples, using a control group without ADHD, these temperamental and psychological features may be helpful for an earlier recognition of ADHD patients at higher risk for obesity, and may represent possible targets for temperament-based preventive interventions and tailored treatment programs. These features should be included in the routine assessment of children and adolescents with ADHD and/or are overweight/obese.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) frequently face pragmatic impairments which may result in learning, socialization, and mental health difficulties, therefore early intervention is crucial. In Portugal, the Pragmatic Intervention Programme (PICP) has been recently developed and validated, but its effects are unknown. This study aims to determine the effects of the PICP on preschool-age children with ASD or DLD with pragmatic impairments. Methods: A non-randomized controlled trial has been conducted. The children (n = 20) were assigned to the intervention (n = 11) or the control group (waiting list) (n = 9). Each child attended 24 PICP-based intervention sessions provided by a Speech and Language Therapist in kindergarten. The primary outcome measure was a Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) rated by parents and kindergarten teachers. Secondary outcomes include parent/teacher-reported communication skills (Escala de Avalia&amp;amp;ccedil;&amp;amp;atilde;o de Compet&amp;amp;ecirc;ncias Comunicativas) and an assessment of the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s general language ability (Teste de Linguagem&amp;amp;mdash;Avalia&amp;amp;ccedil;&amp;amp;atilde;o da Linguagem Pr&amp;amp;eacute;-Escolar). Results: GAS results show that all the children in the intervention group made progress. Statistically significant differences between pre- and post-intervention assessments were found for all secondary outcomes. Conclusions: The main findings suggest that the PICP improves language in preschool-age children with ASD and DLD with pragmatic difficulties. Further research is needed to analyse the effects of the PICP for each neurodevelopmental disorder individually. These results are crucial and will contribute to future research and evidence-based practice.</p>

	<p>Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a major mediator of Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways in various cell types throughout the body. Its neuronal isoform CaMKIIa (alpha) centrally integrates physiological but also pathological glutamate signals directly downstream of glutamate receptors and has thus emerged as a target for ischemic stroke. Previous studies provided evidence for the involvement of CaMKII activity in ischemic cell death by showing that CaMKII inhibition affords substantial neuroprotection. However, broad inhibition of this central kinase is challenging because various essential physiological processes like synaptic plasticity rely on intact CaMKII regulation. Thus, specific strategies for targeting CaMKII after ischemia are warranted which would ideally only interfere with pathological activity of CaMKII. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of how ischemia affects CaMKII and how pathospecific pharmacological targeting of CaMKII signaling could be achieved. Specifically, we discuss direct targeting of CaMKII kinase activity with peptide inhibitors versus indirect targeting of the association (hub) domain of CaMKIIa with analogues of g-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) as a potential way to achieve more specific pharmacological modulation of CaMKII activity after ischemia.</p>

	<p>The aim of this selective review paper is to clarify potential confusion when referring to the term proactive inhibitory control. Illustrated by a concise overview of the literature, we propose defining reactive inhibition as the mechanism underlying stopping an action. On a stop trial, the stop signal initiates the stopping process that races against the ongoing action-related process that is triggered by the go signal. Whichever processes finishes first determines the behavioral outcome of the race. That is, stopping is either successful or unsuccessful in that trial. Conversely, we propose using the term proactive inhibition to explicitly indicate preparatory processes engaged to bias the outcome of the race between stopping and going. More specifically, these proactive processes include either pre-amping the reactive inhibition system (biasing the efficiency of the stopping process) or presetting the action system (biasing the efficiency of the go process). We believe that this distinction helps meaningful comparisons between various outcome measures of proactive inhibitory control that are reported in the literature and extends to experimental research paradigms other than the stop task.</p>

	<p>Peripheral sensory nerve electrical stimulation (PES) excites the primary motor cortex and is expected to improve motor dysfunction post-stroke. However, previous studies have reported a variety of stimulus frequencies and stimulus duration settings, and the effects of these different combinations on primary motor cortex excitability are not clear. We aimed to clarify the effects of different combinations of stimulus frequency and stimulus duration of PES on the excitation of primary motor cortex. Twenty-one healthy individuals (aged &amp;amp;gt; 18 years, right-handed, and without a history of neurological or orthopedic disorders) were included. Each participant experienced three different stimulation frequencies (1, 10, and 50 Hz) and durations (20, 40, and 60 min). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded pre- and post-PES. The outcome measure was the change in primary motor cortex excitability using the MEP ratio. We used a D-optimal design of experiments and response surface analysis to define the optimal combination within nine different settings inducing more satisfying responses. The combination of stimulation frequency and stimulation time that maximized the desirability value was 10 Hz and 40 min, respectively. The results of this study may provide fundamental data for more minimally invasive and effective implementation of PES in patients with stroke.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the limit between the cognitive changes of aging and early dementia; thus, discriminating between participants with and without MCI is important. In the present study, we aimed to examine the differences in the cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal between individuals with and without MCI. The cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal was measured when the participants (young and elderly controls as well as patients with MCI) performed category fluency, finger tapping, and dual tasks using head-mounted near-infrared spectroscopy; the results were compared between the groups. The cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal trended toward the highest values during the category fluency task in young participants and during the finger-tapping task in elderly participants regardless of the MCI status. The area under the curve was approximately 0.5, indicating a low discrimination ability between elderly participants with and without MCI. The measurement of the blood flow in the prefrontal cortex may not accurately quantify cognitive and motor performance to detect MCI. Finger tapping may increase cerebral blood flow in individuals with and without MCI during the task.</p>

	<p>Objective: The virtual reality (VR)-based path integration task shows substantial promise in predicting dementia risk. However, the reliability and validity in healthy populations need further exploration. The present study investigates the relationship between task indicators and brain structures in a healthy population using a VR-based navigation task, particularly the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus. Methods: Sixty healthy adults were randomly recruited to perform a VR-based path integration task, the digit span task (DST), and an MRI scan. The indicators of the VR-based path integration task were calculated, including the absolute distance error (ADE), degree of angle deviation (DAD), degree of path deviation (DPD), and return time (Time). The reliability of the above indicators was then estimated using the split-half method and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha. Correlation and regression analyses were then performed to examine the associations between these indicators and age, general cognitive ability (DST), and brain structural measures. Results: ADE, DAD, and DPD showed reasonable split-half reliability estimates (0.84, 0.81, and 0.72) and nice Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha estimates (0.90, 0.86, and 0.96). All indicators correlated with age and DST. ADE and DAD were sensitive predictors of hippocampal volume, and return time was a predictor of EC thickness. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the VR-based path integration task exhibits good reliability and validity in the healthy population. The task indicators are age-sensitive, can capture working memory capacity, and are closely related to the integrity of individual EC and hippocampal structures.</p>

	<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetics have been shown to have a role in the severity of alcohol&amp;amp;rsquo;s teratogenic effects on the developing brain. We previously identified recombinant inbred BXD mouse strains that show high (HCD) or low cell death (LCD) in the hippocampus following ethanol exposure. The present study aimed to identify gene networks that influence this susceptibility. On postnatal day 7 (3rd-trimester-equivalent), male and female neonates were treated with ethanol (5.0 g/kg) or saline, and hippocampi were collected 7hrs later. Using the Affymetrix microarray platform, ethanol-induced gene expression changes were identified in all strains with divergent expression sets found between sexes. Genes, such as Bcl2l11, Jun, and Tgfb3, showed significant strain-by-treatment interactions and were involved in many apoptosis pathways. Comparison of HCD versus LCD showed twice as many ethanol-induced genes changes in the HCD. Interestingly, these changes were regulated in the same direction suggesting (1) more perturbed effects in HCD compared to LCD and (2) limited gene expression changes that confer resistance to ethanol-induced cell death in LCD. These results demonstrate that genetic background and sex are important factors that affect differential cell death pathways after alcohol exposure during development that could have long-term consequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine among health care practitioners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health crisis worldwide. In less than 12 months since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, several different COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and deployed mostly in developed countries since January 2021. However, hesitancy to accept the newly developed vaccines is a well-known public health challenge that needs to be addressed. The aim of this study was to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among health care practitioners' (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online self-reported survey was conducted among HCPs in Saudi Arabia between April 4th to April 25th 2021 using snowball sampling. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the possible factors affecting HCPs’ willingness and hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines.   Results: Out of 776 participants who started the survey, 505 (65%) completed it and were included in the results. Among all HCPs, 47 (9.3%) either said “no” to receive the vaccine [20 (4%)] or were hesitant to receive it [27 (5.3%)]. Of the total number of the HCPs, 376 (74.5%) already received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 48 (9.50%) were registered to receive it. The main reason of agreement to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was “wanting to protect self and others from getting the infection” (24%).   Conclusion: Our findings have shown that hesitancy toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs in Saudi Arabia is limited and therefore may not be a serious issue. The outcomes of this study may help to understand factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy in Saudi Arabia and help public health authorities to design targeted health education interventions aiming to increase uptake of these vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains in a tertiary care center [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Urinary tract infection(UTI) is one of the commonly prevalent bacterial infection in humans.The uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) expresses a range of virulence factors that contribute to their pathogenicity. The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated UTI is increasing.This study monitors the distribution of virulence factors among UPEC strains to note the antibiogram, outcome and type of associated UTI. Methods:A prospective cross-sectional time-bound study of six months was done on clinically significant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. Detection of haemolysin production and serum resistance was done by phenotypic methods. Genotypic characterization of the virulence genes (papC, iutA, hlyA, cnf1) was done by multiplex PCR. Demographic data, clinical history, antibiogram and type of UTI was collected from clinical case records. Results:75 E.coli isolates from patients with suspected UTIs were included. Females had a higher preponderance of UTI (66.7%). 93% of patients were adults and the remaining 7% were from paediatrics.  24 (32%) isolates showed haemolysis by plate haemolysis and all isolates were serum-resistant. Out of 75 isolates, 65 were positive for at least one of four targeted genes, while remaining ten isolates were negative for all four genes.Multidrug resistance was found in 40 (53.3%) isolates. 97.4% of the UTI cases had a favourable clinical outcome at discharge. Mortality due to urosepsis was 2.6%. Conclusion:Association of hemolysin production with resistance to imipenem and norfloxacin in UPEC strains was significant.Presence of hlyA gene is positively associated with ceftazidime resistance. Nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and cefaperazone sulbactam are possible candidates for empirical therapy of UTIs. Drugs like aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fosfomycin may be used as reserve drugs in the treatment of MDR-UTI.However, inappropriate usage can increase antibiotic resistance. Hence proper selection of antibiotics in hospitals taking into account the local antibiogram is needed to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PhenoApp: A mobile tool for plant phenotyping to record field and greenhouse observations [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms are emerging for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still widely used and is a time- and money-consuming step. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards the efficient use of genetic resources and are demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open-source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and in greenhouses. It is a versatile tool that offers the possibility to fully customize the descriptors/scales for any possible scenario, also in accordance with international information standards such as MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Furthermore, PhenoApp enables the use of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. The simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). PhenoApp is therefore a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in genebank management but also contributes to breeding and breeding research by accelerating the labour intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">De Novo Brain-Computer Interfacing Deforms Manifold of Populational Neural Activity Patterns in Human Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human brains are capable of modulating innate activities to adapt to novel environments and tasks; for sensorimotor neural system this means acquisition of a rich repertoire of activity patterns that improve behavioral performance. To directly map the process of acquiring the neural repertoire during tasks onto performance improvement, we analyzed net neural populational activity during the learning of its voluntary modulation by brain-computer interface (BCI) operation in female and male humans. The recorded whole-head high-density scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) were subjected to dimensionality reduction algorithm to capture changes in cortical activity patterns represented by the synchronization of neuronal oscillations during adaptation. Although the preserved variance of targeted features in the reduced dimensions was 20%, we found systematic interactions between the activity patterns and BCI classifiers that detected motor attempt; the neural manifold derived in the embedded space was stretched along with motor-related features of EEG by model-based fixed classifiers but not with adaptive classifiers that were constantly recalibrated to user activity. Moreover, the manifold was deformed to be orthogonal to the boundary by <I>de novo</I> classifiers with a fixed decision boundary based on biologically unnatural features. Collectively, the flexibility of human cortical signaling patterns (i.e., neural plasticity) is only induced by operation of a BCI whose classifier required fixed activities, and the adaptation could be induced even the requirement is not consistent with biologically natural responses. These principles of neural adaptation at a macroscopic level may underlie the ability of humans to learn wide-ranging behavioral repertoires and adapt to novel environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Angular Tuning Properties of Low Threshold Mechanoreceptors in Isolated Rat Whisker Hair Follicles</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Angular tuning is preferential sensory response to a directional stimulus and is observed in the whisker tactile system. In whisker hair follicles, there are at least three types of low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs): rapidly adapting (RA), slowly adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly adapting type 2 (SA2). These LTMRs display angular tuning but their properties remain incompletely studied. Here, we used isolated rat whisker hair follicles and pressure-clamped single-fiber recordings to study angular tuning of these LTMRs. Angular tuning was determined with impulses elicited by ramp-and-hold deflection of whisker hair in 24 directions each at 15&deg; for a total of 360&deg;. We show that RA display impulses during ramp-up, both ramp-up and ramp-down, or ramp-down dynamic phases. Both SA1 and SA2 respond to angular stimuli with slowly adapting impulses in most angles. However, SA1 and SA2 show rapidly adapting responses in other angles. All the three types of LTMRs display strong angular tuning, and there is no significant difference in angular tuning index among them. Population wise, the majority of SA1 are tuned in the caudal direction, a large part of SA2 is tuned in the rostral direction, and RAs are tuned in multiple directions. In the angles showing strong tuning, the three LTMRs respond to increased stimulation amplitudes with increased impulse numbers in a hyperbola relationship, and the responsiveness based on impulse numbers is SA2 &gt; SA1 &gt; RA. Our findings provide new information on angular tuning properties of LTMRs in whisker hair follicles and help to understand directional encoding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Model for the Propagation of Seizure Activity in Normal Brain Tissue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Epilepsies are characterized by paroxysmal electrophysiological events and seizures, which can propagate across the brain. One of the main unsolved questions in epilepsy is how epileptic activity can invade normal tissue and thus propagate across the brain. To investigate this question, we consider three computational models at the neural network scale to study the underlying dynamics of seizure propagation, understand which specific features play a role, and relate them to clinical or experimental observations. We consider both the internal connectivity structure between neurons and the input properties in our characterization. We show that a paroxysmal input is sometimes controlled by the network while in other instances, it can lead the network activity to itself produce paroxysmal activity, and thus will further propagate to efferent networks. We further show how the details of the network architecture are essential to determine this switch to a seizure-like regime. We investigated the nature of the instability involved and in particular found a central role for the inhibitory connectivity. We propose a probabilistic approach to the propagative/non-propagative scenarios, which may serve as a guide to control the seizure by using appropriate stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro apical microleakage evaluation for different endodontic sealers by spectrophotometric analysis: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It has been established that several filling techniques can affect apical leakage, which is responsible for 59% of endodontic failures. The primary goal of endodontic therapy is to create a tight seal that aids in repairing the periapical tissues, prevents apical periodontitis, and shields against root canal infection. The study aims to compare the apical sealing ability of epoxy resin based sealer  (AH plus), which is an epoxy-resin-based root canal sealer, GuttaFlow 2, which is a silicone-based root canal sealer, GuttaFlow bioseal is a bioactive glass-based root canal sealer, TotalFill HiFlow bioceramic (BC) sealer is a silicate-based root canal sealer (bioceramic sealer) using a single cone technique by spectrophotometric analysis.  Methods: This study chose 64 maxillary first molars with a straight palatal root. Following palatal roots sectioning to 11 mm from the root apex, the canals were instrumented up to size X4 using Protaper Next. They were separated into  four experimental groups (n = 15) per each group based on the kind of sealer utilized, Group I: AH plus, Group II: GuttaFlow 2, Group III: GuttaFlow bioseal, Group IV: TotalFill BC HiFlow, and two control groups (n =2 for each).  After completing obturation, the dye extraction technique was used to evaluate apical leakage. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical density of the solution after all the dyes were liberated from the interfacial regions. Result: A statistically non-significant difference between the investigated root canal sealers in apical microleakage P > 0.05 was noted. The highest mean values were observed in group IV (0.08046), group I(0.07731), and group II(0.06209), while the lowest mean value in group III (0.05719) Conclusions: All types of sealers used in this investigation showed various amounts of microleakage. None of the sealants could completely close the apical foramen to provide a fluid-tight seal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anticancer and antiretroviral activities of methanolic extract from Theobroma cacao L pod husk: focusing on the ethyl acetate partition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many researchers have paid attention to Theobroma cocoa pod husk for its bioactive phytoconstituents which have several medicinal benefits. Herein, we aim to evaluate the methanolic extract from T. cocoa pod husk and its partitions for their anticancer and antiretroviral activities. Methods: The T. cocoa pod husk was macerated using methanol, and then sequentially partitioned with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. MCF-7 and HeLa cells were used to assess the anticancer activities, while the simian retrovirus-2 (SRV-2)-infected A549 cells were used for antiretroviral study. The ethyl acetate partition (TCEA) was then fractionated and screened for in-vitro antioxidant and cytotoxicity. The most active fraction was sub-fractionated and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Results: The results suggested that TCEA had moderate and weak activities against MCF-7 (IC50=53.91 μg/mL) and HeLa cells (IC50=120.71 μg/mL), respectively. TCEA 125 μg/mL had higher anti-SRV-2 activity in comparison with lamivudine 25 μg/mL after 1—7 days of incubation. The GC-MS analysis of the polyphenol-predominated sub-fraction from the most active fraction revealed the presence of lupeol, syringaresinol, catechol, and squalene. Conclusions: TCEA derived from the methanolic extract of T. cacao pod husk had moderate activity against MCF-7 cells and weak activity against HeLa cells. Antiretroviral study suggests that TCEA 125 μg/mL had higher inhibitory activity against SRV-2 replication as compared to lamivudine 25 μg/mL.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dynamic geographical accessibility assessments to improve health equity: protocol for a test case in Cali, Colombia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This protocol proposes an approach to assessing the place of residence as a spatial determinant of health in cities where traffic congestion might impact health services accessibility. The study provides dynamic travel times presenting data in ways that help shape decisions and spur action by diverse stakeholders and sectors.    Equity assessments in geographical accessibility to health services typically rely on static metrics, such as distance or average travel times. This new approach uses dynamic spatial accessibility measures providing travel times from the place of residence to the health service with the shortest journey time. It will show the interplay between traffic congestion, accessibility, and health equity and should be used to inform urban and health services monitoring and planning.   Available digitised data enable efficient and accurate accessibility measurements for urban areas using publicly available sources and provide disaggregated sociodemographic information and an equity perspective.   Test cases are done for urgent and frequent care (i.e., repeated ambulatory care). Situational analyses will be done with cross-sectional urban assessments; estimated potential improvements will be made for one or two new services, and findings will inform recommendations and future studies.   This study will use visualisations and descriptive statistics to allow non-specialized stakeholders to understand the effects of accessibility on populations and health equity. This includes “time-to-destination” metrics or the proportion of the people that can reach a service by car within a given travel time threshold from the place of residence.   The study is part of the AMORE Collaborative Project, in which a diverse group of stakeholders seeks to address equity for accessibility to essential health services, including health service users and providers, authorities, and community members, including academia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Demographical domains and clinico-radiological characteristics of study cohorts with spontaneous simultaneous multiple intracerebral hemorrhages in a tertiary neurosurgical center in Nepal: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 ap</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous simultaneous multiple intra-cerebral hemorrhages (SMICHs) and its occurrences in different territories of arterial disposition has been viewed as uncommon clinical occurrences, since the pathophysiological and predisposing factors as mechanisms aren’t vividly defined. This research primarily aims for demographic stratification and dichotomization pertaining to risk factors, etiological classifications, anatomical distributions and outcome analysis by focusing on management strategies and pertinent stroke care. Methods: 40 patients presenting to the College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal in the last two years were included in the study. The patients with two or more spontaneous SMICHs with affected arterial territories with similar tomographic density based profiling were chosen as samples. Regression analysis was chosen to test three hypotheses. Results: Among our study cohorts, cortical and cortical territory (60%) was the major anatomical patterns of involvement. A conservative approach was undertaken in nine patients (22.5%), whereas surgical intervention was needed in five others (12.5%). A total of 14(35%) patients leaving against medical advice and a further seven (17.5%) patients were referred for adjuvant oncologic care. Mortality was observed among five (12.5%) patients. Hypertension was seen as a significant variable in its pathogenesis. Male patients were more affected. Age groups comprising 36-45years and 56-65 years were involved in 32.5% and 30% of cases respectively. Conclusion: This study proves the need for a national stroke data bank pertaining to spontaneous SMICHs. This will help foster effective patient education during preoperative counseling; as well as formatting a management algorithm combating them.

                Background: Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has rendered it ineffective in the vast majority of cases. Combination therapy has grown in popularity over the last decade; this study aims to analyze A.baumannii growth kinetics after exposure to meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam compared with meropenem and amikacin antibiotic combinations in clinically relevant concentrations.  Methods: This experimental laboratory study was conducted on the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 isolate and three clinical isolates that were intermediate or resistant to tested antibiotics. Meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam, as well as meropenem and amikacin, were tested at four different concentrations against isolates. Turbidity measurements were taken at predetermined time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours following exposure; bacterial concentration was enumerated using the agar plate method, with the results plotted in a time-kill curve.   Results: A bactericidal effect was achieved in isolates that were intermediate to ampicillin-sulbactam and resistant to meropenem after the administration of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam combination with a concentration of 4 µg/ml and 16/8 µg/ml, respectively. The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against isolates that were resistant to both antibiotics. Isolates treated with resistant antibiotics showed an increased growth rate compared to the growth control.  Conclusion: The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam could be a promising combination therapy in treating CRAB infections. The mechanism and degree of antibiotic resistance in the isolates affect the efficacy of antibiotic combinations; further research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of an mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management of persons with hypertension in a coastal taluk of Udupi district: A study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a major cause of death and disability globally. There is increasing evidence that demonstrates clinically relevant benefits from self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure. Evidence suggests a reduction of systolic BP by 3.2 mm/hg through self-monitoring. The use of mHealth applications in health care monitoring and self-management can help in the timely delivery of health information. Around 33% of Indians use mHealth applications in their daily life. However, well-designed, user complied mHealth applications are essential to reach the masses and to be effective. A previously conducted study in India demonstrated that applications are not customized according to users' needs and expectations and lacked usability assessment by patients. Therefore, we aimed to develop and test a novel mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management in hypertension. Methods: The study will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will be an in-depth interview to identify the required parameters to develop a customized mHealth android-based application to monitor hypertension. The second phase is to develop the customized application through the Agile development design using the android studio platform. In the third phase, a community-based cluster randomized trial will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention on the remote monitoring and self-management of people with hypertension. A sample of 236 people from 12 villages will be randomized and the mHealth application will be delivered to the intervention group and the standard regimen will be continued in the control group. Results: In the proposed study if the intervention is found to be helpful, then hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to install the mHealth application. This application, if found effective can improve the health status, knowledge, and self-care approach among hypertensive patients. Registration: CTR India (CTRI/2022/03/041544).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient inference and identifiability analysis for differential equation models with random parameters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander P. Browning, Christopher Drovandi, Ian W. Turner, Adrianne L. Jenner, Matthew J. Simpson</p>

Heterogeneity is a dominant factor in the behaviour of many biological processes. Despite this, it is common for mathematical and statistical analyses to ignore biological heterogeneity as a source of variability in experimental data. Therefore, methods for exploring the identifiability of models that explicitly incorporate heterogeneity through variability in model parameters are relatively underdeveloped. We develop a new likelihood-based framework, based on moment matching, for inference and identifiability analysis of differential equation models that capture biological heterogeneity through parameters that vary according to probability distributions. As our novel method is based on an approximate likelihood function, it is highly flexible; we demonstrate identifiability analysis using both a frequentist approach based on profile likelihood, and a Bayesian approach based on Markov-chain Monte Carlo. Through three case studies, we demonstrate our method by providing a didactic guide to inference and identifiability analysis of hyperparameters that relate to the statistical moments of model parameters from independent observed data. Our approach has a computational cost comparable to analysis of models that neglect heterogeneity, a significant improvement over many existing alternatives. We demonstrate how analysis of random parameter models can aid better understanding of the sources of heterogeneity from biological data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of path information in visual perception of joint stiffness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by A. Michael West Jr., Meghan E. Huber, Neville Hogan</p>

Humans have an astonishing ability to extract hidden information from the movement of others. In previous work, subjects observed the motion of a simulated stick-figure, two-link planar arm and estimated its stiffness. Fundamentally, stiffness is the relation between force and displacement. Given that subjects were unable to physically interact with the simulated arm, they were forced to make their estimates solely based on observed kinematic information. Remarkably, subjects were able to correctly correlate their stiffness estimates with changes in the simulated stiffness, despite the lack of force information. We hypothesized that subjects were only able to do this because the controller used to produce the simulated arm’s movement, composed of oscillatory motions driving mechanical impedances, resembled the controller humans use to produce their own movement. However, it is still unknown what motion features subjects used to estimate stiffness. Human motion exhibits systematic velocity-curvature patterns, and it has previously been shown that these patterns play an important role in perceiving and interpreting motion. Thus, we hypothesized that manipulating the velocity profile should affect subjects’ ability to estimate stiffness. To test this, we changed the velocity profile of the simulated two-link planar arm while keeping the simulated joint paths the same. Even with manipulated velocity signals, subjects were still able to estimate changes in simulated joint stiffness. However, when subjects were shown the same simulated path with different velocity profiles, they perceived motions that followed a veridical velocity profile to be less stiff than that of a non-veridical profile. These results suggest that path information (displacement) predominates over temporal information (velocity) when humans use visual observation to estimate stiffness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference of B cell clonal families using heavy/light chain pairing information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Duncan K. Ralph, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

Next generation sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires has become a ubiquitous tool for understanding the antibody-mediated immune response: it is now common to have large volumes of sequence data coding for both the heavy and light chain subunits of the BCR. However, until the recent development of high throughput methods of preserving heavy/light chain pairing information, these samples contained no explicit information on which heavy chain sequence pairs with which light chain sequence. One of the first steps in analyzing such BCR repertoire samples is grouping sequences into clonally related families, where each stems from a single rearrangement event. Many methods of accomplishing this have been developed, however, none so far has taken full advantage of the newly-available pairing information. This information can dramatically improve clustering performance, especially for the light chain. The light chain has traditionally been challenging for clonal family inference because of its low diversity and consequent abundance of non-clonal families with indistinguishable naive rearrangements. Here we present a method of incorporating this pairing information into the clustering process in order to arrive at a more accurate partition of the data into clonally related families. We also demonstrate two methods of fixing imperfect pairing information, which may allow for simplified sample preparation and increased sequencing depth. Finally, we describe several other improvements to the <i>partis</i> software package.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The geometry of representational drift in natural and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kyle Aitken, Marina Garrett, Shawn Olsen, Stefan Mihalas</p>

Neurons in sensory areas encode/represent stimuli. Surprisingly, recent studies have suggested that, even during persistent performance, these representations are not stable and change over the course of days and weeks. We examine stimulus representations from fluorescence recordings across hundreds of neurons in the visual cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and we corroborate previous studies finding that such representations change as experimental trials are repeated across days. This phenomenon has been termed “representational drift”. In this study we geometrically characterize the properties of representational drift in the primary visual cortex of mice in two open datasets from the Allen Institute and propose a potential mechanism behind such drift. We observe representational drift both for passively presented stimuli, as well as for stimuli which are behaviorally relevant. Across experiments, the drift differs from in-session variance and most often occurs along directions that have the most in-class variance, leading to a significant turnover in the neurons used for a given representation. Interestingly, despite this significant change due to drift, linear classifiers trained to distinguish neuronal representations show little to no degradation in performance across days. The features we observe in the neural data are similar to properties of artificial neural networks where representations are updated by continual learning in the presence of dropout, i.e. a random masking of nodes/weights, but not other types of noise. Therefore, we conclude that a potential reason for the representational drift in biological networks is driven by an underlying dropout-like noise while continuously learning and that such a mechanism may be computational advantageous for the brain in the same way it is for artificial neural networks, e.g. preventing overfitting.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experimental validation of computerised models of clustering of platelet glycoprotein receptors that signal via tandem SH2 domain proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zahra Maqsood, Joanne C. Clark, Eleyna M. Martin, Yam Fung Hilaire Cheung, Luis A. Morán, Sean E. T. Watson, Jeremy A. Pike, Ying Di, Natalie S.

The clustering of platelet glycoprotein receptors with cytosolic YxxL and YxxM motifs, including GPVI, CLEC-2 and PEAR1, triggers activation via phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residues and recruitment of the tandem SH2 (Src homology 2) domain effector proteins, Syk and PI 3-kinase. We have modelled the clustering of these receptors with monovalent, divalent and tetravalent soluble ligands and with transmembrane ligands based on the law of mass action using ordinary differential equations and agent-based modelling. The models were experimentally evaluated in platelets and transfected cell lines using monovalent and multivalent ligands, including novel nanobody-based divalent and tetravalent ligands, by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Ligand valency, receptor number, receptor dimerisation, receptor phosphorylation and a cytosolic tandem SH2 domain protein act in synergy to drive receptor clustering. Threshold concentrations of a CLEC-2-blocking antibody and Syk inhibitor act in synergy to block platelet aggregation. This offers a strategy for countering the effect of avidity of multivalent ligands and in limiting off-target effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational modeling approach for predicting multicell spheroid patterns based on signaling-induced differential adhesion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nikita Sivakumar, Helen V. Warner, Shayn M. Peirce, Matthew J. Lazzara</p>

Physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis and tumorigenesis rely on the ability of individual cells to work collectively to form multicell patterns. In these heterogeneous multicell systems, cell-cell signaling induces differential adhesion between cells that leads to tissue-level patterning. However, the sensitivity of pattern formation to changes in the strengths of signaling or cell adhesion processes is not well understood. Prior work has explored these issues using synthetically engineered heterogeneous multicell spheroid systems, in which cell subpopulations engage in bidirectional intercellular signaling to regulate the expression of different cadherins. While engineered cell systems provide excellent experimental tools to observe pattern formation in cell populations, computational models of these systems may be leveraged to explore more systematically how specific combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters can drive the emergence of unique patterns. We developed and validated two- and three-dimensional agent-based models (ABMs) of spheroid patterning for previously described cells engineered with a bidirectional signaling circuit that regulates N- and P-cadherin expression. Systematic exploration of model predictions, some of which were experimentally validated, revealed how cell seeding parameters, the order of signaling events, probabilities of induced cadherin expression, and homotypic adhesion strengths affect pattern formation. Unsupervised clustering was also used to map combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters to these unique spheroid patterns predicted by the ABM. Finally, we demonstrated how the model may be deployed to design new synthetic cell signaling circuits based on a desired final multicell pattern.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attentional enhancement predicts individual differences in visual working memory under go/no-go search conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Tay, John J. McDonald</p>

Attention-control processes transfer relevant information to visual working memory (WM) and prevent irrelevant information from consuming WM resources. Although event-related potentials (ERPs) have revealed attention-control processes associated with enhancement of relevant stimuli (targets) and suppression of irrelevant stimuli (distractors), only the suppressive processes have been found to predict WM capacity. We hypothesised a link between target-enhancement processes and WM capacity would be revealed in a task that requires more control than the conventional visual search paradigms used to study target selection. Here, participants searched for a pop-out target on Go trials and withheld responses on an equal number of randomly intermixed No-Go trials, depending on the colour of the stimulus array. Magnitudes of ERP indices associated with target enhancement (the singleton detection positivity (SDP) and N2pc) were positively correlated with individual differences in WM capacity. These relationships vanished when participants searched for the pop-out target on every trial, regardless of stimulus-array colour. Inhibitory processes associated with suppressing distractors (P<sub>D</sub>) and withholding responses (no-go P3) on No-Go trials did not predict WM capacity. These findings indicate that target-enhancement mechanisms control access to WM in search tasks that require dynamic control and disconfirm the view that the gateway to WM is entirely inhibitory by nature.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE15/PPE20 complex transports calcium across the outer membrane</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vishant Boradia, Andrew Frando, Christoph Grundner</p>

The mechanisms by which nutrients traverse the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) outer membrane remain mostly unknown and, in the absence of classical porins, likely involve specialized transport systems. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are an important nutrient and serve as a second messenger in eukaryotes, but whether bacteria have similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling systems is not well understood. To understand the basis for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport and signaling in <i>Mtb</i>, we determined <i>Mtb’s</i> transcriptional response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Overall, only few genes changed expression, suggesting a limited role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a transcriptional regulator. However, 2 of the most strongly down-regulated genes were the <i>pe15</i> and <i>ppe20</i> genes that code for members of a large family of proteins that localize to the outer membrane and comprise many intrinsically disordered proteins. PE15 and PPE20 formed a complex and PPE20 directly bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-associated phenotypes such as increased ATP consumption and biofilm formation were reversed in a <i>pe15/ppe20</i> knockout (KO) strain, suggesting a direct role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. To test whether the PE15/PPE20 complex has a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport across the outer membrane, we created a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter strain. A <i>pe15/ppe20</i> KO in the FRET background showed a specific and selective loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that was dependent on the presence of an intact outer cell wall. These data show that PE15/PPE20 form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein complex that selectively imports Ca<sup>2+</sup>, show a distinct transport function for an intrinsically disordered protein, and support the emerging idea of a general family-wide role of PE/PPE proteins as idiosyncratic transporters across the outer membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Posteromedial thalamic nucleus activity significantly contributes to perceptual discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jia Qi, Changquan Ye, Shovan Naskar, Ana R. Inácio, Soohyun Lee</p>

Higher-order sensory thalamic nuclei are densely connected with multiple cortical and subcortical areas, yet the role of these nuclei remains elusive. The posteromedial (POm) thalamic nucleus, the higher-order thalamic nucleus in the rodent somatosensory system, is an anatomical hub broadly connected with multiple sensory and motor brain areas yet weakly responds to passive sensory stimulation and whisker movements. To understand the role of POm in sensory perception, we developed a self-initiated, two-alternative forced-choice task in freely moving mice during active sensing. Using optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation, we show that POm thalamic nucleus plays a significant role in sensory perception and the projection from the primary somatosensory cortex to POm is critical for the contribution of POm in sensory perception during active sensing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Whole-genome scanning reveals environmental selection mechanisms that shape diversity in populations of the epipelagic diatom Chaetoceros</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charlotte Nef, Mohammed-Amin Madoui, Éric Pelletier, Chris Bowler</p>

Diatoms form a diverse and abundant group of photosynthetic protists that are essential players in marine ecosystems. However, the microevolutionary structure of their populations remains poorly understood, particularly in polar regions. Exploring how closely related diatoms adapt to different environments is essential given their short generation times, which may allow rapid adaptations, and their prevalence in marine regions dramatically impacted by climate change, such as the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Here, we address genetic diversity patterns in <i>Chaetoceros</i>, the most abundant diatom genus and one of the most diverse, using 11 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) reconstructed from <i>Tara</i> Oceans metagenomes. Genome-resolved metagenomics on these MAGs confirmed a prevalent distribution of <i>Chaetoceros</i> in the Arctic Ocean with lower dispersal in the Pacific and Southern Oceans as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. Single-nucleotide variants identified within the different MAG populations allowed us to draw a landscape of <i>Chaetoceros</i> genetic diversity and revealed an elevated genetic structure in some Arctic Ocean populations. Gene flow patterns of closely related <i>Chaetoceros</i> populations seemed to correlate with distinct abiotic factors rather than with geographic distance. We found clear positive selection of genes involved in nutrient availability responses, in particular for iron (e.g., ISIP2a, flavodoxin), silicate, and phosphate (e.g., polyamine synthase), that were further supported by analysis of <i>Chaetoceros</i> transcriptomes. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of environmental selection in shaping diatom diversity patterns and provide new insights into their metapopulation genomics through the integration of metagenomic and environmental data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A single N6-methyladenosine site regulates lncRNA HOTAIR function in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Allison M. Porman, Justin T. Roberts, Emily D. Duncan, Madeline L. Chrupcala, Ariel A. Levine, Michelle A. Kennedy, Michelle M. Williams, Jennifer K. Richer, Aaron M. Johnson</p>

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA regulates normal and cancer biology, but knowledge of its function on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains limited. Here, we reveal that m6A regulates the breast cancer-associated human lncRNA HOTAIR. Mapping m6A in breast cancer cell lines, we identify multiple m6A sites on HOTAIR, with 1 single consistently methylated site (A783) that is critical for HOTAIR-driven proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Methylated A783 interacts with the m6A “reader” YTHDC1, promoting chromatin association of HOTAIR, proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells, and gene repression. A783U mutant HOTAIR induces a unique antitumor gene expression profile and displays loss-of-function and antimorph behaviors by impairing and, in some cases, causing opposite gene expression changes induced by wild-type (WT) HOTAIR. Our work demonstrates how modification of 1 base in an lncRNA can elicit a distinct gene regulation mechanism and drive cancer-associated phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The dynamics and determinants of specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in three adult cohorts in the Ecuadorian Andes: a study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: There are limited longitudinal data on the systemic and mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 from Latin America, a region severely affected by COVID-19, and where vaccine strategies have been implemented during the evolving pandemic. Objective: To evaluate determinants of seroprevalence and changes in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies longitudinally in adults with different levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (defined a priori as low, medium, and high based on presumed occupational risk), in two Andean cities in Ecuador. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study of 1,000 adults aged 18 years and older with questionnaire data and sample collection done at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months during the period 2020-2023. Observations collected included WHO-ISARIC questionnaire and peripheral blood and saliva samples for measurement of IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively.  Planned analyses are tailored to the longitudinal nature of the outcomes defined by participants’ antibody levels and aim at estimating their average trends with time since infection in each of the occupational groups, adjusted for demographics and calendar-time levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population. The latter reflect the impact of the national control measures such as vaccinations and movement restrictions. Importance: Understanding the duration and the dynamics of waning immunity to SARS-CoV-2, in the context of exposures to emerging virus variants and immunization, will inform the implementation of targeted public health strategies in the Latin American region. Ethics and Dissemination: This study will observe the bioethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent will be obtained. Samples from participants will be stored for up to three years after which they will be destroyed. The study protocol was approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health Ethics Committee for COVID-19 Research. Antibody results will be provided to participants and participating institutions and to the national health authorities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Novel Neural Network Biomarker of Botulinum Toxin Efficacy in Isolated Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated dystonia is characterized by abnormal, often painful, postures and repetitive movements due to sustained or intermittent involuntary muscle contractions. Botulinum toxin (BoTX) injections into the affected muscles are the first line of therapy. However, there are no objective predictive markers or standardized tests of BoTX efficacy that can be utilized for appropriate candidate selection prior to treatment initiation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed a deep learning algorithm, DystoniaBoTXNet, which uses a 3D convolutional neural network architecture and raw structural brain MRI to automatically discover and test a neural network biomarker of BoTX efficacy in 284 patients with four different forms of focal dystonia, including laryngeal dystonia, blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, and writer's cramp.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DystoniaBoTXNet identified clusters in superior parietal, inferior/middle frontal, middle orbital gyrus, inferior temporal cortices, corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and anterior thalamic radiation as components of the treatment biomarker. These regions are known to contribute to both dystonia pathophysiology across a broad clinical spectrum of disorder and the central effects of botulinum toxin treatment. Based on its biomarker, DystoniaBoTXNet achieved an overall accuracy of 96.3%, with 100% sensitivity and 86.1% specificity, in predicting BoTX efficacy in patients with isolated dystonia. The algorithmic decision was computed in 19.2 sec per case.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DystoniaBoTXNet and its treatment biomarker have a high translational potential as an objective, accurate, generalizable, fast, and cost-effective algorithmic platform for enhancing clinical decision-making for BoTX treatment in patients with isolated dystonia.</p>

<p>The moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain were observed and we produced the density atlas map of CB1 receptor for the first time in the human brain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We aimed to integrate genomic mapping from brain mRNA atlas with the protein expression from positron emission tomography (PET) scans of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor and to compare the predictive power of CB1 receptor with those of other neuroreceptor/transporters using a meta-analysis. Volume of distribution (<i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub>) from F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans, CNR1 gene (Cannabinoid receptor 1) expression, and H3-CP55940 binding were calculated and correlation analysis was performed. Between <i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub> of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA expression, moderate strength of correlation was observed (<i>rho</i> = .5067, <i>p</i> = .0337). Strong positive correlation was also found between CNR1 mRNA expression and H3-CP55940 binding (<i>r</i> = .6336, <i>p</i> = .0364), validating the finding between F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA. The correlation between <i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub> of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and H3-CP55940 binding was marginally significant (<i>r</i> = .5025, <i>p</i> = .0563). From the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient between mRNA expression and protein expressions ranged from −.10 to .99, with a pooled effect of .76. In conclusion, we observed the moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain, which was validated by autoradiography. We combined the autoradiographic finding with PET of CB1 receptor, producing the density atlas map of CB1 receptor. From the meta-analysis, the moderate to strong correlation was observed between mRNA expression and protein expressions across multiple genes. Further study is needed to investigate the relationship between multiple genes and in vivo proteins to improve and accelerate drug development.</p>

                Dysregulation of the imprinted <i>H19/IGF2</i> locus can lead to Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) in humans. However, the mechanism of how abnormal <i>H19/IGF2</i> expression contributes to various SRS phenotypes remains unclear, largely due to incomplete understanding of the developmental functions of these two genes. We previously generated a mouse model with humanized <i>H19/IGF2</i> imprinting control region (<i>hIC1</i>) on the paternal allele that exhibited <i>H19/Igf2</i> dysregulation together with SRS-like growth restriction and perinatal lethality. Here, we dissect the role of <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i> in cardiac and placental development utilizing multiple mouse models with varying levels of <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i>. We report severe cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects and thinned myocardium, placental anomalies including thrombosis and vascular malformations, together with growth restriction in mouse embryos that correlated with the extent of <i>H19/Igf2</i> dysregulation. Transcriptomic analysis using cardiac endothelial cells of these mouse models shows that <i>H19/Igf2</i> dysregulation disrupts pathways related to extracellular matrix and proliferation of endothelial cells. Our work links the heart and placenta through regulation by <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i>, demonstrating that accurate dosage of both <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i> is critical for normal embryonic development, especially related to the cardiac-placental axis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutamine synthetase mRNA releases sRNA from its 3´UTR to regulate carbon/nitrogen metabolic balance in Enterobacteriaceae</a></h4>

              
                Glutamine synthetase (GS) is the key enzyme of nitrogen assimilation induced under nitrogen limiting conditions. The carbon skeleton of glutamate and glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, is supplied from the TCA cycle, but how this metabolic flow is controlled in response to nitrogen availability remains unknown. We show that the expression of the E1o component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, SucA, is repressed under nitrogen limitation in <i>Salmonella</i> <i>enterica</i> and <i>E coli</i>. The repression is exerted at the post-transcriptional level by an Hfq-dependent sRNA GlnZ generated from the 3´UTR of the GS-encoding <i>glnA</i> mRNA. Enterobacterial GlnZ variants contain a conserved seed sequence and primarily regulate <i>sucA</i> through base-pairing far upstream of the translation initiation region. During growth on glutamine as the nitrogen source, the <i>glnA</i> 3´UTR deletion mutants expressed SucA at higher levels than the <i>S. enterica</i> and<i> E. coli</i> wild-type strains, respectively. In <i>E. coli</i>, the transcriptional regulator Nac also participates in the repression of <i>sucA</i>. Lastly, this study clarifies that the release of GlnZ from the <i>glnA</i> mRNA by RNase E is essential for the post-transcriptional regulation of <i>sucA</i>. Thus the mRNA coordinates the two independent functions to balance the supply and demand of the fundamental metabolites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attentional modulation is orthogonal to disinhibition by VIP interneurons in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Attentional modulation of sensory processing is a key feature of cognition, yet its neural circuit basis is poorly understood. A candidate mechanism is the disinhibition of pyramidal cells through vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SOM) positive interneurons. However, the interaction of attentional modulation and VIP-SOM disinhibition has never been directly tested. We used all-optical methods to bi-directionally manipulate VIP interneuron activity as mice performed an attention switching task. We measured the activity of VIP, SOM and parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons and pyramidal neurons identified in the same tissue and found that although activity in all cell classes was modulated by both attention and VIP manipulation, their effects were orthogonal. Attention and VIP-SOM disinhibition relied on distinct patterns of changes in activity and reorganisation of interactions between inhibitory and excitatory cells. These results reveal the remarkable ability of cortical circuits to multiplex strong yet non-interacting modulations in the same neural population.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new theoretical framework jointly explains behavioral and neural variability across subjects performing flexible decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The ability to flexibly select and accumulate relevant information to form decisions, while ignoring irrelevant information, is a fundamental component of higher cognition. Yet its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that, under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, the space of possible network mechanisms to implement this ability is spanned by the combination of three different components, each with specific behavioral and anatomical implications. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these components, suggesting that different individuals could use different component combinations. To study variations across subjects, we developed a rat task requiring context-dependent evidence accumulation, and trained many subjects on it. Our task delivers sensory evidence through pulses that have random but precisely known timing, providing high statistical power to characterize each individual's neural and behavioral responses. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analysis revealed remarkable heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. The theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. Our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, and open the door to the study of individual variability in neural computations underlying higher cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perinatal High Fat Diet Exposure Alters Oxytocin and Corticotropin Releasing Factor Inputs onto Vagal Neurocircuits Controlling Gastric Motility</a></h4>

              
                Perinatal high fat diet (pHFD) exposure is known to affect the development of vagal neurocircuits that control gastrointestinal (GI) motility and reduce stress resiliency in offspring. Descending oxytocin (OXT; prototypical, anti-stress peptide) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF; prototypical, stress peptide) inputs from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) modulate the GI stress response. However, how these descending inputs, and their associated changes to GI motility and stress responses, are altered following pHFD exposure are unknown. The present study used in vivo recordings of gastric tone and motility, in vivo assays of gastric emptying rates, in vitro electrophysiological recordings from brainstem slice preparations, and retrograde neuronal tracing experiments to investigate the hypothesis that pHFD alters descending PVN-DMV inputs, dysregulating DMV neuronal responses and subsequent gastric motility. Basal gastric emptying rates were found to be significantly delayed in pHFD rats, which also demonstrating an inability to mount an appropriate response to acute stress with a further delay in gastric emptying. Neuronal tracing experiments suggested that pHFD reduced PVNOXT neurons that project to the DMV but increased PVNCRF projections. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of DMV neurons demonstrated that, following pHFD, PVNCRF projections are tonically active, altering GABAergic inputs to DMV neurons. Lastly, blocking DMV CRF receptors in pHFD rats restored the appropriate gastric response to brainstem oxytocin application. Taken together, these results indicate that pHFD exposure leads to an upregulating of CRF inputs to the DMV, resulting in tonic CRF activation on the system and altering gastric motility. These results suggest that pHFD exposure leads gastric dysmotility, leading to a maladaptive gastric stress response and reduced stress resiliency.

                Neurobiological models of learning emphasize the importance of prediction errors (surprises) for memory formation. These effects have focused on memory for information surrounding a momentary surprising event; however, it is less clear whether surprise that unfolds across multiple events and timescales impacts memory. We asked basketball fans about their most positive and negative autobiographical memories of individual plays, games, and seasons, allowing surprise measurements spanning seconds, hours, and months. We used advanced analytics on National Basketball Association play-by-play data and betting odds spanning 17 seasons, >22K games, >5.6M plays to compute and align the estimated surprise values of each memory. We found that surprising events biased positive memories on the scale of seconds and months and negative memories across all three timescales. Critically, game and season memories could not be explained by surprise at shorter timescales, suggesting that long-term, multi-event surprise influences memory. These results expand the role of surprise in models of learning and reinforce its relevance in real-world domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retention of visuo-proprioceptive recalibration in estimating hand position</a></h4>

              
                The brain estimates hand position using visual and proprioceptive cues, which are combined to give an integrated multisensory estimate. Spatial mismatches between cues elicit recalibration, a compensatory process where each unimodal estimate is shifted closer to the other. It is unclear how well visuo-proprioceptive recalibration is retained after mismatch exposure. Here we asked whether direct vision and/or active movement of the hand can undo visuo-proprioceptive recalibration, and whether recalibration is still evident 24 hours later. 75 participants performed two blocks of visual, proprioceptive, and combination trials, with no feedback or direct vision of the hand. In Block 1, a 70 mm visuo-proprioceptive mismatch was gradually imposed, and recalibration assessed. Block 2 tested retention. Between blocks, Groups 1-4 rested or made active movements with their directly visible or unseen hand for several minutes. Group 5 had a 24-hour gap between blocks. All five groups recalibrated both vision and proprioception in Block 1, and Groups 1-4 retained most of this recalibration in Block 2. Interestingly, Group 5 showed an offline increase in proprioceptive recalibration, but retained little visual recalibration. Our results suggested that visuo-proprioceptive recalibration is robustly retained in the short-term. In the longer term, contextual factors may affect retention.

To infer these relationships in the human brain, we implemented Mendelian randomisation using single cell-type expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as genetic anchors. Expression QTLs were mapped across 8 major cell-types in brain tissue exclusively ascertained from donors with no history of brain disease. We report evidence for a causal association between the change in expression of 118 genes and one or more of 16 brain phenotypes, revealing candidate targets for risk mitigation and opportunities for shared preventative therapeutic strategies. We highlight key causal genes for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease and for each, we report its cellular context and the therapeutic directionality required for risk mitigation. Our use of control samples establishes a new resource for the causal interpretation of GWAS risk alleles for human brain phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the Neural Processes behind Narrative Engagement: An EEG Study</a></h4>

              
                Past cognitive neuroscience studies using naturalistic stimuli have considered narratives holistically and focused on cognitive processes. In this study, we incorporated the narrative structure the dramatic arc as an object of investigation, to examine how engagement levels fluctuate across a narrative-aligned dramatic arc. We explored the possibility of predicting self-reported engagement ratings from neural activity and investigated the idiosyncratic effects of each phase of the dramatic arc on brain responses as well as the relationship between engagement and brain responses. We presented a movie excerpt following the six-phase narrative arc structure to female and male participants while collecting EEG signals. We then asked this group of participants to recall the excerpt, another group to segment the video based on the dramatic arc model, and a third to rate their engagement levels while watching the movie. The results showed that the self-reported engagement ratings followed the pattern of the narrative dramatic arc. Moreover, whilst EEG amplitude could not predict group-averaged engagement ratings, other features comprising dynamic inter-subject correlation, dynamic functional connectivity patterns and graph features were able to achieve this. Furthermore, neural activity in the last two phases of the dramatic arc significantly predicted engagement patterns. This study is the first to explore the cognitive processes behind the dramatic arc and its phases. By demonstrating how neural activity predicts self-reported engagement, which itself aligns with the narrative structure, this study provides insights on the interrelationships between narrative structure, neural responses, and viewer engagement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of depth on crowding investigated with a multi-depth plane display</a></h4>

              
                Crowding occurs when highly visible objects are rendered unrecognizable in the presence of nearby features. Several studies have demonstrated that crowding can be reduced by depth differences between target and flanking features, which challenges the assumption of real-world significance because real objects typically occur at differing depths. However, most previous studies tested only small differences in depth and/or used standard stereo displays in which disparity, accommodation, and defocus blur are inconsistent with the real world. For this study we developed a multi-depth plane display consisting of three screens at different distances from the observer to test how crowding is affected by large, real differences in target-flanker depth. Overall, perceptual error decreased with increasing target-flanker spacing, but increased when the target or flankers were displayed at a different depth from fixation and one another. Our findings demonstrate that depth can increase crowding when depth differences are large. Analysis of the perceived appearance of the stimuli suggest that outside Panum's Fusional Area, crowding is increased by suppression to maintain single vision rather than by an increase in clutter because of diplopia. These findings suggest that crowding may be a more significant problem in real scenes than is estimated with 2D displays.

                BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is a major contributor to poor brain pathology across many disease conditions. Specifically, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF in the hippocampus activates its receptor TNFR1, reducing AMPA receptor trafficking to impair LTP and associated behavioral outcomes. Studies using animal models of GWI have shown both a chronic upregulation of TNF and impaired neurological function. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether selectively inhibiting only the soluble form of TNF (solTNF) that preferentially activates TNFR1 can reverse neuroinflammation to improve neuroplasticity and neurological function. METHODS: GWI was induced in rats by treating with DFP (or vehicle) for 5 consecutive days. Six months later, the rats were treated with XPro1595 (or vehicle) for 2 weeks to selectively inhibit solTNF, after which they were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests (cognition, anxiety-related, depressive-like behavior, and neuropathic pain). MRI brain scans were performed, and the animals were euthanized for brain pathological analysis. RESULTS: The hippocampus of the GWI rats had significantly increased neuroinflammatory levels, resulting in edema and reduced AMPA receptor trafficking to the post-synaptic membrane that collectively promoted impairments in memory, anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and neuropathic pain. However, treating the rats with XPro1595 in the chronic environment attenuated the neuroinflammatory response, that reduced edema and impaired AMPA receptor trafficking, allowing for improvements in all areas of neurological function. CONCLUSION: Overall findings suggest that selectively inhibiting solTNF using XPro1595 reduces neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and overall function when administered in the chronic setting of a rat model of GWI. This data supports the use of XPro1595 in Veterans with GWI.

                Comparing connectomes can help explain how neural connectivity is related to genetics, disease, development, learning, and behavior. However, making statistical inferences about the significance and nature of differences between two networks is an open problem, and such analysis has not been extensively applied to nanoscale connectomes. Here, we investigate this problem via a case study on the bilateral symmetry of a larval Drosophila brain connectome. We translate notions of "bilateral symmetry" to generative models of the network structure of the left and right hemispheres, allowing us to test and refine our understanding of symmetry. We find significant differences in connection probabilities both across the entire left and right networks and between specific cell types. By rescaling connection probabilities or removing certain edges based on weight, we also present adjusted definitions of bilateral symmetry exhibited by this connectome. This work shows how statistical inferences from networks can inform the study of connectomes, facilitating future comparisons of neural structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic weights that correlate with presynaptic selectivity increase decoding performance</a></h4>

              
                The activity of neurons in the visual cortex is often characterized by tuning curves, which are thought to be shaped by Hebbian plasticity during development and sensory experience. This leads to the prediction that neural circuits should be organized such that neurons with similar functional preference are connected with stronger weights. In support of this idea, previous experimental and theoretical work have provided evidence for a model of the visual cortex characterized by such functional subnetworks. A recent experimental study, however, have found that the postsynaptic preferred stimulus was defined by the total number of spines activated by a given stimulus and independent of their individual strength. While this result might seem to contradict previous literature, there are many factors that define how a given synaptic input influences postsynaptic selectivity. Here, we designed a computational model in which postsynaptic functional preference is defined by the number of inputs activated by a given stimulus. Using a plasticity rule where synaptic weights tend to correlate with presynaptic selectivity, and is independent of functional-similarity between pre- and postsynaptic activity, we find that this model can be used to decode presented stimuli in a manner that is comparable to maximum likelihood inference.

                Due to continuous state variations in neocortical circuits, individual SI neurons in vivo display a variety of intracellular response types to repeated presentations of the exact same tactile input pattern. The specific intracellular response obtained depends on a time-evolving combination of the specific input with the current neocortical state. To manipulate the internal cortical state, we here used brief electrical stimulation of the output region of the hippocampus, which preceded the delivery of specific tactile afferent input patterns to digit 2 of the anesthetized rat. We find that hippocampal output had a diversified and remarkably strong impact on the specific set of intracellular response types each SI neuron displays to each given tactile input pattern. The findings show that hippocampal output can profoundly impact the state-dependent interpretation of tactile inputs in SI neurons and hence influence their perception, potentially with affective and semantic components.

                To explore the neural underpinnings of (dis)honest decision making under quasi-ecological conditions, we used an fMRI adapted version of a card game in which deceptive or truthful decisions are made to an opponent, with or without the risk of getting caught by them. Dishonest decisions were associated to increased activity in a cortico-subcortical circuit including the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and right caudate. Crucially, deceptive immoral decisions under reputation risk enhanced activity of - and functional connectivity between - the bilateral ACC and left AI, suggesting the need for heightened emotional processing and cognitive control when making immoral decisions under reputation risk. Tellingly, more manipulative individuals required less involvement of the ACC during risky self-gain lies but more involvement during other-gain truths, pointing to the need of cognitive control only when going against one's own moral code.

                Background: Deficient social interactions are a hallmark of major neuropsychiatric disorders, and cumulating evidence point to altered social reward and motivation as key underlying mechanisms in these pathologies. In the present study, we aimed at assessing the role of the two striatal projecting neuronal (SPN) populations bearing either D1R or D2R dopamine receptors (D1R- and D2R-SPNs), in modulating social behavior and other behaviors often altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: We selectively ablated D1R- and D2R-SPNs using an inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-mediated cell targeting strategy and assessed social behavior as well as repetitive/perseverative behavior, motor function and anxiety levels. We tested the effects of optogenetic stimulation of D2R-SPNs in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and pharmacological compounds repressing D2R-SPN. Results: Targeted deletion of D1R-SPNs in the NAc blunted social behavior in mice, facilitated skill motor learning and increased anxiety levels. These behaviors were normalized by pharmacological inhibition of D2R-SPN, which also repressed transcription in the efferent nucleus, the ventral pallidum (VP). In contrast, ablation of D1R-SPNs in the dorsal striatum had no impact on social behavior, impaired motor skill learning, and decreased anxiety levels. Deletion of D2R-SPNs in the NAc also produced motor stereotypies but facilitated social behavior and impaired skill motor learning. We mimicked excessive D2R-SPN activity by optically stimulating D2R-SPNs in the NAc and evidenced a severe deficit in social interaction that was prevented by D2R-SPN pharmacological inhibition. Conclusions: Repressing D2R-SPN activity may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to relieve social deficit in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                We recently reported that loss of oligodendrocyte metabolic support through the lactate and pyruvate transporter Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) is well tolerated into adulthood. Only with advanced aging did we observe axonal degeneration and hypomyelination due to loss of MCT1 from oligodendroglia lineage cells. MCT1 is also expressed by other glial subtypes, such as astrocytes and endothelial cells where it has been suggested to be essential for learning and memory tasks. However, the importance of MCT1 in these cell types for long-term axonal metabolic support is still unknown. We therefore addressed whether conditional loss of MCT1 from either of these cell types would lead to widespread axonal degeneration with aging. Using a conditional null approach, similar to what was used for oligodendrocyte MCT1 depletion, we observed that conditional knockout of MCT1 from either astrocytes or endothelial cells did not cause neuronal injury. On the other hand, inducible ubiquitous depletion of MCT1 causes late-onset axonal degeneration, comparable with what was observed in our previous study using the oligodendrocyte lineage MCT1 null mice. In summary, we conclude that unlike oligodendrocyte MCT1, astrocyte MCT1 is not an essential driver of astrocyte mediated axonal energy homeostasis with aging.

                Brains contain networks of interconnected neurons, so knowing the network architecture is essential for understanding brain function. We therefore mapped the synaptic-resolution connectome of an insect brain (Drosophila larva) with rich behavior, including learning, value-computation, and action-selection, comprising 3,013 neurons and 544,000 synapses. We characterized neuron-types, hubs, feedforward and feedback pathways, and cross-hemisphere and brain-nerve cord interactions. We found pervasive multisensory and interhemispheric integration, highly recurrent architecture, abundant feedback from descending neurons, and multiple novel circuit motifs. The brain's most recurrent circuits comprised the input and output neurons of the learning center. Some structural features, including multilayer shortcuts and nested recurrent loops, resembled powerful machine learning architectures. The identified brain architecture provides a basis for future experimental and theoretical studies of neural circuits.

                The properties of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that innervate the distal colon are poorly defined, hindering our understanding of their roles in normal physiology and gastrointestinal disease. Here, we report genetically defined subsets of colon innervating DRG neurons with diverse morphologic and physiologic properties. Four colon innervating DRG neuron populations are mechanosensitive and exhibit distinct force thresholds to colon distension. The highest threshold population, selectively labeled using Bmpr1b genetic tools, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral responses to high colon distension, which is partly mediated by the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2. This HTMR population mediates behavioral over-reactivity to colon distension caused by inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, like cutaneous mechanoreceptor populations, colon innervating DRG afferents exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties and tile force threshold space, and genetically defined colon innervating HTMRs mediate pathophysiological responses to colon distension revealing a target population for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">New SNCA mutation and structures of α-synuclein filaments from juvenile-onset synucleinopathy</a></h4>

              
                A 21-nucleotide duplication in one allele of SNCA was identified in a previously described disease with abundant -synuclein inclusions that we now call juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS). Both wild-type -synuclein and its insertion mutant containing seven additional residues (MAAAEKT) after residue 22 were present in sarkosyl-insoluble material that was extracted from frontal cortex of the individual with JOS and examined by electron cryo-microscopy. The structures of JOS filaments, comprising either a single protofilament, or a pair of protofilaments, revealed a new -synuclein fold that differs from the folds of Lewy body diseases and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The JOS fold consists of a compact core, the sequence of which (residues 36-100 of wild-type -synuclein) is unaffected by the mutation, and two disconnected density islands (A and B) of mixed sequences. There is a non-proteinaceous cofactor bound between the core and island A. The JOS fold resembles the common substructure of MSA type I and type II dimeric filaments, with its core segment approximating the C-terminal body of MSA protofilaments B and its islands mimicking the N-terminal arm of MSA protofilaments A. The partial similarity of JOS and MSA folds extends to the locations of their cofactor-binding sites. Our findings provide insight into a likely mechanism of JOS fibrillation in which mutant -synuclein of 147 amino acids forms a nucleus with the JOS fold, around which wild-type and mutant proteins assemble during elongation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction error signals in anterior cingulate cortex drive task-switching</a></h4>

              
                Task-switching is a fundamental cognitive ability which requires animals to update their knowledge of current rules, allowing flexible behaviour in a changing environment. This is often achieved through evaluating discrepancies between observed and expected events. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has a key role in processing such discrepancies, or prediction errors. However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying task-switching are largely unknown. Here we show that activity in the ACC induced by the absence of expected stimuli is necessary for rapid task-switching. Mice trained to perform a block-wise set-shifting task typically required a single experience of an expectation violation, or prediction error to accurately switch between responding to the same stimuli using distinct rules. Neurons in the ACC explicitly represented these prediction errors, and their activity was predictive of successful one-shot behavioural transitions. Prediction error signals were projection target-specific, constrained in their spatio-temporal spread across cortex, and heavily disrupted by VIP interneuron perturbation. Optogenetic silencing and single-trial un-silencing revealed that the requirement of the ACC in task-switching was restricted to the epochs when neural prediction error signals were observed. These results reveal a dedicated circuitry promoting the transition between distinct cognitive states

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Violation of the ultrastructural size principle in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex underlies working memory impairment in the aged common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)</a></h4>

              
                Working memory relies critically on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Morphology and function of the dlPFC, and corresponding working memory performance, are affected early in the aging process. However, these effects are heterogeneous, with nearly half of aged individuals spared of working memory deficits. Translationally relevant model systems are critical for investigating the neurobiological drivers of this variability and identifying why some people experience age-related working memory impairment while others do not. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is advantageous as a model in which to investigate the biological underpinnings of aging because, as a nonhuman primate, marmosets have a clearly defined dlPFC facilitating investigations of prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions, including working memory, and their short (~10 year) lifespan facilitates longitudinal studies of aging. Here, we conduct the first investigation of synaptic ultrastructure in the dlPFC of the marmoset and investigate whether there are changes to synaptic ultrastructure that are unique to aging with and without working memory impairment. To do this, we characterized working memory capacity in a cohort of marmosets that collectively covered their short lifespan, and found age-related working memory impairment. We also found a remarkable degree of heterogeneity in performance, similar to that found in humans. Utilizing three dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy, we visualized structural correlates of synaptic efficacy including boutons, mitochondria, and synapses in layer III of the dlPFC of three marmosets: one young adult (YA), one aged cognitively unimpaired (AU), and one aged cognitively impaired (AI). We find that aged marmosets have fewer synapses in dlPFC than young, and this is due to selective vulnerability of small synapses. Next, we tested the hypothesis that violation of the ultrastructural size principle underlies age-related working memory impairment. The ultrastructural size principle states that synaptic efficacy relies on coordinated scaling of synaptic components (e.g., synapses, mitochondria) with presynaptic boutons. While synapses and mitochondria scaled proportionally and were strongly correlated with presynaptic boutons in the YA and AU marmosets, the ultrastructural characteristics of the AI marmoset were alarmingly different. We found that age-related working memory impairment was associated with disproportionately large synapses compared to presynaptic boutons, specifically in those with mitochondria. Remarkably, presynaptic mitochondria and these boutons were completely decorrelated. We posit that this decorrelation results in mismatched energy supply and demand, leading to impaired synaptic transmission. This is the first report of age-related synapse loss in the marmoset, and the first demonstration that violation of the ultrastructural size principle underlies age-related working memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholecystokinin exerts a major control on corticostriatal synapse and motor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide detected and produced at high concentrations in the brain. To date it was mainly used as a neuronal marker of neuronal subtypes and its role as a neuromodulator was poorly known. However, few studies showed that it could be an essential neuromodulator in various brain structures, playing a role on synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. In order to better understand the processes by which CCK impacts plasticity, we focus our attention on the striatum, a nucleus involved in procedural learning and motor behavior, with a rich expression of CCK receptor type 2 (CCK2R). By using in-vivo and ex-vivo electrophysiological approaches, we show that CCK is involved in the corticostriatal synaptic transmission and has a key role in its plasticity. Using in-vivo optopatch-clamp of identified MSNs, we observe a decrease of corticostriatal synaptic transmission after an injection of CCK2R antagonist, leading to a reduction of evoked excitatory post synaptic potential rec-orded on both MSNs populations (direct and indirect pathways). In addition, we evaluate the impact of CCK2R antagonist on corticostriatal synaptic plasticity using Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) protocols on MSNs of acute rat brain slices. Results demonstrate that the CCK2R antagonist is able to reverse the corticostriatal synaptic plasticity (i.e. LTP protocol leads to LTD). Finally, we evaluate the effect of CCK2R antagonist on the motor behavior of juvenile rats challenged with different locomotor tests and show a sex-dependent impairment of motor behavior. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCK and its receptor CCK2R are es-sential for inputs processing encoding in the corticostriatal network with consequences on motor activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PIEZO2 in somatosensory neurons controls gastrointestinal transit</a></h4>

              
                The gastrointestinal tract is in a state of constant motion. These movements are tightly regulated by the presence of food and help digestion by mechanically breaking down and propelling gut content. Mechanical sensing in the gut is thought to be essential for regulating motility; however, the identity of the neuronal populations, the molecules involved, and the functional consequences of this sensation are unknown. Here, we show that humans lacking PIEZO2 exhibit impaired bowel sensation and motility. Piezo2 in mouse dorsal root but not nodose ganglia is required to sense gut content, and this activity slows down food transit rates in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Indeed, Piezo2 is directly required to detect colon distension in vivo. Our study unveils the mechanosensory mechanisms that regulate the transit of luminal contents throughout the gut, which is a critical process to ensure proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste removal.

	<p>Early rehabilitation with the right intensity contributes to the physical recovery of stroke survivors. In clinical practice, physicians determine whether the training intensity is suitable for rehabilitation based on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; narratives, training scores, and evaluation scales, which puts tremendous pressure on medical resources. In this study, a lightweight facial expression recognition algorithm is proposed to diagnose stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; training motivations automatically. First, the properties of convolution are introduced into the Vision Transformer&amp;amp;rsquo;s structure, allowing the model to extract both local and global features of facial expressions. Second, the pyramid-shaped feature output mode in Convolutional Neural Networks is also introduced to reduce the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s parameters and calculation costs significantly. Moreover, a classifier that can better classify facial expressions of stroke patients is designed to improve performance further. We verified the proposed algorithm on the Real-world Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), the Face Expression Recognition Plus Dataset (FER+), and a private dataset for stroke patients. Experiments show that the backbone network of the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than Pyramid Vision Transformer (PvT) and Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) with fewer parameters and Floating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPs). In addition, the algorithm reaches an 89.44% accuracy on the RAF-DB dataset, which is higher than other recent studies. In particular, it obtains an accuracy of 99.81% on the private dataset, with only 4.10M parameters.</p>

	<p>Virtual reality (VR), a rapidly evolving technology that simulates three-dimensional virtual environments for users, has been proven to activate brain functions. However, the continuous alteration pattern of the functional small-world network in response to comprehensive three-dimensional stimulation rather than realistic two-dimensional media stimuli requires further exploration. Here, we aimed to validate the effect of VR on the pathways and network parameters of a small-world organization and interpret its mechanism of action. Fourteen healthy volunteers were selected to complete missions in an immersive VR game. The changes in the functional network in six different frequency categories were analyzed using graph theory with electroencephalography data measured during the pre-, VR, and post-VR stages. The mutual information matrix revealed that interactions between the frontal and posterior areas and those within the frontal and occipital lobes were strengthened. Subsequently, the betweenness centrality (BC) analysis indicated more robust and extensive pathways among hubs. Furthermore, a specific lateralized channel (O1 or O2) increment in the BC was observed. Moreover, the network parameters improved simultaneously in local segregation, global segregation, and global integration. The overall topological improvements of small-world organizations were in high-frequency bands and exhibited some degree of sustainability.</p>

	<p>Introduction: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs playing a myriad of important roles in regulating gene expression. Of note, recent work demonstrated a critical role of miRNAs in the genesis and progression of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). Accordingly, here we examine miRNA signatures related to bAVMs and associated gene expression. In so doing we expound on the potential prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic significance of miRNAs in the clinical management of bAVMs. Methods: A PRISMA-based literature review was performed using PubMed/Medline database with the following search terms: &amp;amp;ldquo;brain arteriovenous malformations&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral arteriovenous malformations&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;microRNA&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;miRNA&amp;amp;rdquo;. All preclinical and clinical studies written in English, regardless of date, were selected. For our bioinformatic analyses, miRWalk and miRTarBase machine learning algorithms were employed; the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was quired for associated pathways/functions. Results: four studies were ultimately included in the final analyses. Sequencing data consistently revealed the decreased expression of miR-18a in bAVM-endothelial cells, resulting in increased levels of vascular endodermal growth factor (VEGF), Id-1, matrix metalloproteinase, and growth signals. Our analyses also suggest that the downregulation of miR-137 and miR-195* within vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may foster the activation of inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis, and phenotypic switching. In the peripheral blood, the overexpression of miR-7-5p, miR-629-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-200b-3p, and let-7b-5p may contribute to endothelial proliferation and nidus development. The machine learning algorithms employed confirmed associations between miRNA-related target networks, vascular rearrangement, and bAVM progression. Conclusion: miRNAs expression appears to be critical in managing bAVMs&amp;amp;rsquo; post-transcriptional signals. Targets of microRNAs regulate canonical vascular proliferation and reshaping. Although additional scientific evidence is needed, the identification of bAVM miRNA signatures may facilitate the development of novel prognostic/diagnostic tools and molecular therapies for bAVMs.</p>

	<p>The current study investigated the mental lexicon features of the Hakka-Mandarin dialect bilingual from two perspectives: the structural features of lexicons and the relations between lexicons. Experiment one used a semantic fluency task and complex-network analysis to observe the structural features of lexicons. Experiment two used a cross-language long-term repetition priming paradigm to explore the relations between lexicons, with three sub-experiments focusing on conceptual representation, lexical representation, and their relations, respectively. The results from experiment one showed that the dialect bilingual lexicons were small-world in nature, and the D2 (Mandarin) lexicon was better organized than the D1 (Hakka) lexicon. Experiment two found that D1 and D2 might have partially shared conceptual representations, separate lexical form representations, and partially shared lemma representations. Based on the findings, we tentatively proposed a two-layer activation model to simulate the lexicon features of dialect bilingual speakers.</p>

	<p>Background: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment modality for ablation of low-grade glioma (LGG) and radiation necrosis (RN). Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and survival outcomes of patients with radiographically presumed recurrent or newly diagnosed LGG and RN treated with LITT. Methods: The neuro-oncological database of a quaternary center was reviewed for all patients who underwent LITT for management of LGG between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2020. Clinical data including demographics, lesion characteristics, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were collected. Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analyses comprised overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Nine patients (7 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age 50 [16] years) were included. Patients underwent LITT at a mean (SD) of 11.6 (8.5) years after diagnosis. Two (22%) patients had new lesions on radiographic imaging without prior treatment. In the other 7 patients, all (78%) had surgical resection, 6 (67%) had intensity-modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy, respectively, and 4 (44%) had stereotactic radiosurgery. Two (22%) patients had lesions that were wild-type IDH1 status. Volumetric assessment of preoperative T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences yielded mean (SD) lesion volumes of 4.1 (6.5) cm3 and 26.7 (27.9) cm3, respectively. Three (33%) patients had evidence of radiographic progression after LITT. The pooled median (IQR) PFS for the cohort was 52 (56) months, median (IQR) OS after diagnosis was 183 (72) months, and median (IQR) OS after LITT was 52 (60) months. At the time of the study, 2 (22%) patients were deceased. Conclusions: LITT is a safe and effective treatment option for management of LGG and RN, however, there may be increased risk of permanent complications with treatment of deep-seated subcortical lesions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation/suppression balances in rat Superior Colliculus encode the visual continuity illusion</a></h4>

              
                The continuity illusion occurs when visual stimuli are presented at a sufficiently high frequency, thereby triggering a shift from the static to the dynamic vision mode. This facilitates perception of continuous and moving objects, which is key for interactions with the surrounding environment. However, how the continuity illusion is encoded along the entire visual pathway remains poorly understood, with disparate Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) measured at the retinal, cortical, and behavioural levels. Here, we combine a behavioural paradigm, functional-MRI (fMRI), and electrophysiological validation for studying the mechanisms underlying the encoding of the continuity illusion effect in the rat. Our behavioural measurements reported a Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) of 18{+/-}2 Hz. Remarkably, whole-pathway fMRI revealed marked zero-crossings from positive to negative fMRI signal regimes at the FF in the superior colliculus (SC) - an important visual saliency detector - but not in higher cortical or thalamic visual areas. Our electrophysiological recordings in SC explained the sources of these observations as arising from strong neuronal suppression when the continuity illusion is achieved. Combined, our data suggests that activation and suppression balances in SC play a critical role in encoding the continuity illusion effect.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optical measurement of glutamate release robustly reports short-term plasticity at a fast central synapse</a></h4>

              
                Recently developed fluorescent neurotransmitter indicators have enabled direct measurements of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Precise optical measurements of neurotransmitter release may be used to make inferences about presynaptic function independent of electrophysiological measurement techniques. Here, we express iGluSnFR, a genetically encoded glutamate reporter in mouse spiral ganglion neurons to compare electrophysiological and optical readouts of presynaptic function and short-term synaptic plasticity at the endbulb of Held synapse. We conclude that iGluSnFR robustly and approximately linearly reports glutamate release from the endbulb of Held during synaptic transmission and allows assessment of short-term plasticity during high-frequency train stimuli. Furthermore, we show that iGluSnFR expression slightly alters the time course of spontaneous postsynaptic currents, but is unlikely to impact measurements of evoked synchronous release of many synaptic vesicles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Timescales of adaptation to context in horizontal sound localization</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysical experiments explored how the repeated presentation of a context, consisting of an adaptor and a target, induces plasticity in the localization of an identical target presented alone on interleaved trials. The plasticity, and its time course, was examined both in a classroom and in an anechoic chamber. Adaptors and targets were 2-ms noise clicks and listeners were tasked with localizing the targets while ignoring the adaptors (when present). The context had either a fixed temporal structure, consisting of a single-click adaptor and a target, or its structure varied from trial to trial, either containing a single-click or an 8-click adaptor. The adaptor was presented either from a frontal or a lateral location, fixed within a run. The presence of context caused responses to the isolated targets to be displaced up to 14 degrees away from the adaptor location. This effect was stronger and slower if the context was variable, growing over the 5-minute duration of the runs. Additionally, the fixed-context buildup had a slower onset in the classroom. Overall, the results illustrate that sound localization is subject to slow adaptive processes that depend on the spatial and temporal structure of the context and on the level of reverberation in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parametric information about eye movements is sent to the ears</a></h4>

              
                Eye movements alter the relationship between the visual and auditory spatial scenes. Signals related to eye movements affect neural pathways from the ear through auditory cortex and beyond, but how these signals contribute to computing the locations of sounds with respect to the visual scene is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the information contained in eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs), pressure changes recorded in the ear canal that occur in conjunction with simultaneous eye movements. We show that EMREOs contain parametric information about horizontal and vertical eye displacement as well as initial/final eye position with respect to the head. The parametric information in the horizontal and vertical directions combines linearly, allowing accurate prediction of the EMREOs associated with oblique eye movements from their respective horizontal and vertical components. Target location can also be inferred from the EMREO signals recorded during eye movements to those targets. We hypothesize that the thus-far unknown mechanism underlying EMREOs could impose a two-dimensional eye-movement related transfer function on any incoming sound, permitting subsequent processing stages to compute the positions of sounds in relation to the visual scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivating Positive Personality Traits During Sleep Impacts Self-Evaluative Memories</a></h4>

              
                People tend to view themselves through rose-tinted glasses, as evidenced by preferential recall of positive personality traits. We asked whether reactivating positive personality traits during sleep could enhance peoples positive self-evaluative memories. After a baseline self-referential encoding task in which participants endorsed positive and negative traits as self-descriptive, participants were trained to give timely responses to positive traits in a cue-approach training (CAT) task. Once participants had entered slow-wave sleep during a subsequent nap, half of the trained positive traits were unobtrusively re-played to them to promote consolidation (targeted memory reactivation, TMR). Participants completed free-recall tasks about self-descriptive traits to measure their self-evaluative memories. Our findings revealed that TMR prioritized the recall of positive traits that were strongly memorized before sleep, while impairing the recall of intermediate traits. The results suggest pre-TMR self-evaluative memory strength modulated the TMR benefits. Sleep EEG analyses revealed that compared with weak/intermediate/control traits, re-playing strongly memorized traits during sleep elicited greater sigma power changes, which likely reflect preferential memory reactivation. Our results demonstrate the potential implication of wakeful cue-approach training and sleep-based memory reactivation in strengthening positive self-evaluative memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Brainstem Mechanisms Likely Compensate for Self-imposed Peripheral Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                It is well known that the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) in the brainstem, part of the efferent network, inhibits the cochlear active gain mechanism. The upstream neural influence of this peripheral inhibition is less understood. When the MOCR is activated, responses generated in the cochlea and cortex undergo putative attenuation, yet the amplitude of responses generated in the brainstem are perplexingly unaffected despite decreased input from the periphery. Based on known neural circuitry, we hypothesized that the inhibition of peripheral input is compensated for by equivalent positive feedback in the brainstem over time. We predicted that the inhibition can be captured at the brainstem with stimuli shorter (1.5 s) than previously employed long durations (4 min) where this inhibition is diminished due to compensation. Results from 18 normal hearing human listeners support our hypothesis in that when the MOCR is activated, there is a robust reduction of responses generated at the periphery, brainstem, and cortex for short stimuli and that brainstem inhibition diminishes for longer stimuli. Our methodology and findings have implications for auditory disorders such as tinnitus, evaluation of efferent function, and provides a novel non-invasive window into potential gain compensation mechanisms in the brainstem.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two differentiated brain systems micro-structurally associated with obesity</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between obesity and brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ~33,000 UK Biobank participants we test the hypothesis that obesity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal-temporal- striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics, we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9x10-4). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Independence and interaction between the control of moving and holding still in post-stroke arm paresis</a></h4>

              
                Moving and holding still have been posited to be under separate control regimes for both eye and arm movements. The paretic arm after stroke is notable for abnormalities both at rest and during movement, thus it provides an opportunity to address the relationships between control of reaching, stopping and stabilizing. Here, we asked whether independence of these behaviors is preserved in arm paresis. To address this question, we quantified resting postural abnormalities in stroke patients by measuring their biases in force production as they held their hand still in various locations in a planar workspace, and then assessed the influence of these resting force biases on active reaching in the same workspace. We found that patients had marked resting postural force biases at each location. However, these biases did not manifest during any phase of planar reaching movements in the setting of weight support: not during initial acceleration, not to mid-trajectory perturbations, and not during deceleration to a stop. Resting force biases only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings in stroke suggest that moving and holding still are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, we found that patients resting postural force biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal synergies active during movement: they markedly decreased when arm support was provided; they were higher in more distal positions which require breaking out of flexion; and they scaled with the Fugl-Meyer score for the upper extremity (a measure of intrusion of abnormal synergies during active movement). These three shared features suggest a common mechanism for resting postural biases and abnormal synergies, which appears to be a contradiction given the functional separation of moving and holding still observed in the same patients. To resolve this apparent paradox, we propose a model that predicts a breakdown in the functional separation between reaching and holding still when patients move in the absence of weight support. Thus, the model posits that synergies are the behavioral manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expected Costs of Mental Efforts are Updated When People Exert Effort, not by Prospective Information</a></h4>

              
                To understand human behaviour, it is crucial to reveal the mechanisms by which we learn and decide about effort costs and benefits in an uncertain world. Whereas the mechanisms for reward learning are well-understood, the mechanisms for effort cost learning, and especially mental effort, remain elusive. Initially, we hypothesized that cost learning follows temporal-difference learning such that brains update expected costs when informed about upcoming effort levels. However, fMRI data revealed neural correlates of a cost-prediction error of mental effort during task execution and not in response to an effort cue about upcoming effort demands. These results imply that expected costs are updated during actual effort exertion, implying that the adaptive learning of mental effort cost does not follow traditional temporal-difference learning. This study contributes to the understanding of the neural mechanism underlying unwillingness to work, suggesting that humans learn mental effort costs only when they experience effort exertion.

                Lactylation is a newly found lactate-derived post-translational modification, which is firstly reported on histone protein lysine residues to regulate gene expression. Here, we provided evidence that higher serum lactate level was possibly associated with better prognosis in ischemic stroke patients. Meanwhile, inhibition of endogenous lactate increased the infarct volume and decreased protein pan-lactylation in the affected brain tissue in cerebral ischemia mice. We further demonstrated that downregulating lactylation level of Hdac6 (Histone Deacetylase 6) in neurons exacerbated ischemic neuronal injury. The underlying mechanisms involved Hdac6 lactylation disturbing calcium homeostasis through binding BiP (Binding immunoglobulin protein), an endoplasmic reticulum-related protein. Collectively, our findings identified a new effect of lactate for neuroprotection through Hdac6 lactylation during cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury which introduced a potential therapeutic approach against ischemic stroke.

     alt="Long-term effects of prophylactic MgSO4 in maternal immune activation rodent model at adolescence and adulthood"/>
<p>Despite the putative advantages of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent, the long-term neuroprotective effect on the offspring is still unraveled. Here, we studied the long-term impact of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub> at the late gestational periods on the offspring behavior in a mouse MIA model. MgSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for preventing brain injuries can adversely affect offspring cognition behavior later in life, depending on the sex and age of the offspring.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anti-inflammatory agent in pregnant women have been investigated in the last few years. Infections can cause an inflammatory reaction involving the placenta membranes and amniotic cavity. They may have short-term effects on the mother and her fetuses, like preterm birth, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. Despite the alleged advantages of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the long-term molecular and behavioral function of MgSO<sub>4</sub> has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the long-term effect of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub>, during late gestation, on offspring's behavior focusing on cognitive function, motor activity, and social cognition in adolescence and adulthood, and explored its influence on brain gene expression (e.g., ErbB signaling, pro-inflammatory, and dopaminergic markers) in adulthood. A significant abnormal exploratory behavior of offspring of MgSO<sub>4</sub>-treated dams was found compared to the control group in both adolescence and adulthood. Furthermore, we found that adult females exposed to MgSO<sub>4</sub> under inflammation displayed working and recognition memory impairment. A reduction in IL-6 expression was detected in the prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus specimens derived from LPS–Mg-treated group. In contrast, an imbalanced expression of dopamine 1 and 2 receptors was detected only in prefrontal cortex specimens. Besides, we found that MgSO<sub>4</sub> ameliorated the overexpression of the Nrg1 and Erbb4 receptors induced by LPS in the hippocampus. Thus, MgSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for preventing brain injuries can adversely affect offspring cognition behavior later in life, depending on the sex and age of the offspring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Batten disease through different in vivo and in vitro models: A review</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Batten disease consists of a family of primarily autosomal recessive, progressive neuropediatric disorders, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). These pathologies are characterized by seizures and visual, cognitive and motor decline, and premature death. The pathophysiology of this rare disease is still unclear despite the years of trials and financial aids. This paper has reviewed advantages and limits of in vivo and in vitro models of Batten disease from murine and larger animal models to primitive unicellular models, until the most recently developed patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. For each model advantages, limits and applications were analyzed. The first prototypes investigated were murine models that due to their limits were replaced by larger animals. In vitro models gradually replaced animal models for practical, cost, and ethical reasons. Using induced pluripotent stem cells to study neurodegeneration is a new way of studying the disease, since they can be distinguished into differentiating elements like neurons, which are susceptible to neurodegeneration. In vivo and in vitro models have contributed to clarifying to some extent the pathophysiology of the disease. The collection and sharing of suitable human bio samples likely through biobanks can contribute to a better understanding, prevention, and to identify possible treatment strategies of Batten disease.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To study the comparative safety of antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy in pregnancy with respect to risk of major congenital malformations (MCM), overall and MCM subtypes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using national health register data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (1996-2020). We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was non-genetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n=8339) compared to ASM unexposed (n=4,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n=2031, aRR 2.05, 1.70-2.46) and topiramate (n=509, aRR 1.81, 1.26-2.60) which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n=2674, aRR 0.91, 0.72-1.15), oxcarbazepine (n=1313, RR 1.09, 0.83-1.44), or levetiracetam (n=1040, aRR 0.78, 0.53-1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Simplified Model of Motor Control</a></h4>

              
                In general, control of movement is considered to be either cortical, spinal, or purely biomechanical and is studied separately at these levels. To achieve this separation when studying a particular level, variations that may be introduced by the other levels are generally either ignored or restricted. This restriction misrepresents the way movements occur in realistic scenarios and limits the ability to model movements in a biologically inspired manner. In this work, we propose a heuristic model for motor control that conceptually and mathematically accounts for the entire motor process, from target to endpoint. It simulates human arm motion and is able to represent functionally different motion properties by flexibly choosing more or less complex motion paths without built-in optimization or joint constraints. With a novel implementation of hierarchical control, this model successfully overcomes the problem of degrees of freedom in robotics. It can serve as a template for neurocomputational work that currently uses control architectures that do not mirror the human motor control process. The model itself also suggests a maximum threshold for delays in position feedback for effective movement, and that the primary role of position feedback in movement is to overcome the effects of environmental perturbations at the joint level. These findings can inform future efforts to develop biologically inspired motor control techniques for prosthetic devices.

                The development and survival of dopaminergic neurons are influenced by the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Anosmin-1 (A1) is an extracellular matrix protein that acts as a major regulator of this signaling pathway, controlling FGF diffusion, and receptor interaction and shuttling. Furthermore, overexpression of A1 in vivo gives rise to higher number of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb. Here, using A1 overexpressing mice (A1-mice), we studied the effects of A1 on different populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the central (CNS) and the peripheral nervous systems (PNS). A1 overexpression increases the number of dopaminergic SNpc neurons and alters the striosome/matrix organization of the striatum. Interestingly, these numerical and morphological changes in the nigrostriatal pathway of A1-mice do not confer an altered susceptibility to experimental MPTP-parkinsonism with respect to wild type controls. Moreover, the study of the effects of A1 overexpression was extended to different dopaminergic tissues associated with the PNS, detecting a significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic chemosensitive carotid body glomus cells in A1-mice. Overall, these analyses confirm A1 as a principal regulator of the FGF pathway in the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons in different nuclei of the mammalian nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A back-translational study of descending interactions with central mechanisms of hyperalgesia induced by high frequency stimulation in rat and human</a></h4>

              
                In humans and animals, high frequency electrocutaneous stimulation (HFS) may produce an early long-term potentiation-like sensitisation. Peripheral and central modulatory processes are proposed to play a role. To explore the impact of descending inhibitory pathway activation on the development of HFS-induced hyperalgesia, we concurrently applied HFS with i) a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm during psychophysical testing in humans, or ii) a diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) paradigm during in vivo electrophysiological recording of spinal neurones in anaesthetised animals in parallel studies that utilised identical stimuli. HFS induced enhanced perceptual responses to pin-prick stimuli in cutaneous areas secondary to the area of stimulation in humans and heightened the excitability of spinal neurones in rats (which exhibited stimulus intensity dependent coded responses to pin-prick stimulation in a manner that tracked with human psychophysics), where we also observed indicators of increased central neuronal hyperexcitability. In humans, a HFS(+CPM) paradigm did not alter primary or secondary hyperalgesia, and the area and pain intensity of secondary hyperalgesia did not correlate with temporal summation of pain or CPM magnitude, while in rats application of a DNIC paradigm concurrent to HFS did not impact the development of neuronal hyperexcitability. Concordance between human and rat data supports their translational validity. Our finding that excitatory signalling exceeds inhibitory controls suggests that dampening facilitatory mechanisms may be a preferable strategy for certain chronic pain states. If facilitatory mechanisms dominate, our data could explain why enhancing activity in descending inhibitory controls is not sufficient to induce pain relief in vulnerable patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kinetic models for PET displacement studies</a></h4>

              
                The traditional design of PET target engagement studies is based on a baseline scan and one or more scans after drug administration. We here evaluate an alternative design in which the drug is administered during an on-going scan (i.e., a displacement study). This approach results both in lower radiation exposure and lower costs. Existing kinetic models assume steady state. This condition is not present during a drug displacement and consequently, our aim here was to develop kinetic models for analysing PET displacement data. We modified existing compartment models to accommodate a time-variant increase in occupancy following the pharmacological in-scan intervention. Since this implies the use of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically, we developed instead one approximate and one numerical solution. Through simulations, we show that if the occupancy is relatively high, it can be estimated without bias and with good accuracy. The models were applied to PET data from six pigs where [11C]UCB-J was displaced by intravenous brivaracetam. The dose-occupancy relationship estimated from these scans showed good agreement with occupancies calculated with Lassen plot applied to baseline-block scans of two pigs. In summary, the proposed models provide a framework to determine target occupancy from a single displacement scan.

                In the past years, machine-learning-based approaches to track animal poses with high spatial and temporal resolution have become available, but toolkits to extract, integrate, and analyze coordinate datasets in a user-friendly manner have lagged behind. Here, we introduce Fear-Mouse Tracker (FMT), a simple and open-source MATLAB-based pipeline to extract and quantitatively analyze DeepLabCut-derived coordinates of mice presented with threatening stimuli that commonly trigger innate defensive responses. This framework allows for unbiased quantitative estimations of stretch-attend posture (SAP) observed during risk assessment behaviors, as well as for measurements of the timing and extent of freezing and escape responses that follow the presentation of threatening stimuli such as a predator odor, or sweeping and looming stimuli resembling predator approaches. FMT is specially designed for users not very experienced in using programming languages, thus making it more accessible to a broader audience.

                There is increasing evidence of sex differences in underlying mechanisms causing pain in preclinical models, and in clinical populations. There are also important disconnects between clinical pain populations and the way preclinical pain studies are conducted. For instance, osteoarthritis pain more frequently affects women but most preclinical studies have been conducted using males in animal models. The most widely used painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), act on the prostaglandin pathway by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the preclinical and clinical literature on the role of prostaglandins and COX in inflammation and pain. We aimed to specifically identify studies that used both sexes and investigate whether any sex-differences in the action of prostaglandins and COX inhibition had been reported, either in clinical or preclinical studies. We conducted a PubMed search and identified 369 preclinical studies and 100 clinical studies that matched our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our analysis shows that only 17% of preclinical studies on prostaglandins used both sexes and, out of those, only 19% analyzed or reported data in a sex-aware fashion. In contrast, 79% of the clinical studies analyzed used both sexes. However, only 6% of those reported data in a sex-aware fashion. Interestingly, 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and 4 out of 5 clinical studies that analyzed data in a sex-aware fashion have identified sex-differences. This builds on the increasing evidence of sex-differences in prostaglandin signaling and the importance of sex-awareness in data analysis. The preclinical literature identifies a sex difference in prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) expression where it is higher in female than in male rodents in the nervous system. We experimentally validated that PTGDS expression is higher in female human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons recovered from organ donors. Our semi-systematic literature review reveals a need for continued inclusivity of both male and female animals in prostaglandins studies and sex-aware analysis in data analysis in preclinical and clinical studies. Our finding of sex-differences in neuronal PTGDS expression in humans exemplifies the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how the prostaglandin system functions in the DRG in rodents and humans.

                During memory retrieval, people tend to reenact the same eye movements performed when memorized items were first displayed and to gaze at similar locations. This was hypothesized to reflect the role of eye movements as retrieval cues. However, it is unknown what is it about eye movements that makes them effective retrieval cues. Here, we examine, for the first time, the individual and combined contributions of the visual and the motor components of eye movements to memory retrieval. Results (N=70) revealed a non-additive benefit of both components of eye movements to memory performance. Additionally, we found that individuals who gained from one component, were more likely to gain from the other as well. Together, these findings unravel the central role of eye movements in episodic memory; they show how the visual and motor components are integrated into a single effective memory retrieval cue and how this integration varies among individuals.

                The contraction bias has been extensively studied in psychophysics, but only recently has its origin begun to be investigated with neural activity recordings. Leveraging the fact that it is currently possible to train recurrent networks of spiking neurons to perform cognitive tasks, we investigated the causes of the contraction bias and how behavior relates to population firing activity in networks trained to discriminate temporal intervals. A novel normative model containing potential sources of the bias guided us in investigating how it emerged in the networks. Various geometric features of state-space trajectories encoded compressed representations of the durations of the first interval, which were modulated by sensory history. Furthermore, these compressions conveyed a Bayesian estimate of the durations, thus relating activity and behavior. We conjecture that this occurs in areas of the brain where information about the current and preceding stimuli converges, and that it holds generally in delayed comparison tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-Regulation of Visual Word Form Area activation with real-time fMRI neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                The Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) is a key region of the brain's reading network and its activation has been shown to be strongly associated with reading skills. Here, for the first time, we investigated whether voluntary regulation of VWFA activity is feasible using real-time fMRI neurofeedback. 40 adults with typical reading skills were instructed to either upregulate (UP group) or downregulate (DOWN group) their own VWFA activity during six neurofeedback training runs. The VWFA target region was individually defined based on a functional localizer task. Before and after training, also regulation runs without feedback ('no-feedback runs') were performed. When comparing the two groups, we found stronger activity across the whole reading network, including the VWFA, for the UP than the DOWN group. Crucially, we observed a significant interaction of group and time (pre, post) for the no-feedback runs: The two groups did not differ in their VWFA activity before neurofeedback training, but the UP group showed significantly stronger activity than the DOWN group after neurofeedback training. Our results indicate that self-regulation of the VWFA activity is feasible and that, once learned, successful self-regulation can even be performed in the absence of feedback. These results are a crucial step toward to development of a potential clinical intervention to improve reading skills in individuals with reading impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncovering 2-D toroidal representations in grid cell ensemble activity during 1-D behavior</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience is pushing toward studying the brain during naturalistic behaviors with open-ended tasks. Grid cells are a classic example, where free behavior was key to observing their characteristic spatial representations in two-dimensional environments. In contrast, it has been difficult to identify grid cells and study their computations in more restrictive experiments, such as head-fixed wheel running. Here, we challenge this view by showing that shifting the focus from single neurons to the population level changes the minimal experimental complexity required to study grid cell representations. Specifically, we combine the manifold approximation in UMAP with persistent homology to study the topology of the population activity. With these methods, we show that the population activity of grid cells covers a similar two-dimensional toroidal state space during wheel running as in open field foraging, with and without a virtual reality setup. Trajectories on the torus correspond to single trial runs in virtual reality and changes in experimental conditions are reflected in the internal representation, while the toroidal representation undergoes occasional shifts in its alignment to the environment. These findings show that our method can uncover latent topologies that go beyond the complexity of the task, allowing us to investigate internal dynamics in simple experimental settings in which the analysis of grid cells has so far remained elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural alpha oscillations and pupil size differentially index cognitive demand under competing audio-visual task conditions</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive demand is thought to modulate two often used, but rarely combined, measures: pupil size and neural alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillatory power. However, it is unclear whether these two measures capture cognitive demand in a similar way, and whether a measured cognitive demand response in pupil size or brain activity is dependent on sensory modality by which the demand is induced. Here we recorded pupil size and neural alpha power (using electroencephalography), while human participants of both sexes concurrently performed a visual multiple object-tracking task and an auditory gap-detection task. Difficulties of the two tasks were manipulated independent of each other. Participants' performance decreased in accuracy and speed with increasing cognitive demand. Pupil size increased with increasing demand for both the auditory and the visual task. Alpha power emerging from two cortical sources showed counteracting neural dynamics: Alpha power in visual cortex decreased with increasing demand in the visual task, whereas alpha power in parietal cortex increased with increasing demand in the auditory task. Furthermore, demand-related changes in pupil size and alpha power were uncorrelated, suggesting that they index different aspects of cognitive demand. Overall, the current study demonstrates that the dynamics of the neurophysiological indices of cognitive demand and associated effort are multi-faceted and potentially modality-dependent under complex audio-visual task conditions.

                While sensory representations in the brain depend on context, it remains unclear how such modulations are implemented at the biophysical level, and how processing layers further in the hierarchy can extract useful features for each possible contextual state. Here, we first demonstrate that thin dendritic branches are well suited to implementing contextual modulation of feedforward processing. Such neuron-specific modulations exploit prior knowledge, encoded in stable feedforward weights, to achieve transfer learning across contexts. In a network of biophysically realistic neuron models with context-independent feedforward weights, we show that modulatory inputs to thin dendrites can solve linearly non-separable learning problems with a Hebbian, error-modulated learning rule. Finally, we demonstrate that local prediction of whether representations originate either from different inputs, or from different contextual modulations of the same input, results in representation learning of hierarchical feedforward weights across processing layers that accommodate a multitude of contexts.

	<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is consistently associated with a host of social problems, such as victimization and difficulties in maintaining close friendships. These problems are not limited to offline relations but also manifest in the online social world, as previous research shows that ADHD is associated with problematic use of social media. Given the ubiquitous nature of social media, the goal of the current review is to understand why adolescents with ADHD demonstrate more problematic social media use than their typically developing peers. To this end, we provide a narrative review on the evidence for the link between ADHD and social media use, and consequently present an integrative framework, which encompasses neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., imbalance theory of brain development and dual pathway model of ADHD) and social mechanisms, including influences from peers and parents. We conclude that empirical work shows most consistent evidence for the link between problematic social media use and ADHD (symptoms), while intensity of social media use is also associated with several other behaviors and outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize how existing interventions for ADHD may work on the identified mechanisms and provide at-hand clinical recommendations for therapists working with adolescents with ADHD who exhibit problematic social media use.</p>

	<p>The benefits of sport activity on cognition and especially on executive function development are well-known, and in recent years, several kinds of cognitive-motor training (CMT) have been proven effective in adults and older people. Less is known about possible CMT benefits in children. This study aims to confirm the positive influence played by CMTs on specific executive functions (planning abilities and visual search) in young soccer players. Twenty-four 10-year-old athletes were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental (Exp) and control (Con) groups of 12 players. Both groups were trained for 10 weeks, twice a week (90 min per training), following standard soccer training (technical-tactical exercises). The Exp group, during the first training session of the week, in the last 22 min, performed the experimental treatment, which consisted of a psychokinetic CMT. Both groups were examined before and after the ten-week training using the Tower of London and WISC-IV cancellation tests. Results revealed that the Exp group, following treatment, reported significantly better scores than the Con group in all the cognitive measures. We concluded that the proposed CMT is more effective than motor training alone at improving planning abilities and visual search abilities, even in children.</p>

	<p>A range of professional figures are needed to preserve the quality of life of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study aimed to explore the beginning of the care process as negotiated by people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. We designed the study according to the constructivist Grounded Theory method, collecting data through open-ended, semi-structured interviews, employing theoretical sampling and constant comparison, and performing conceptual coding as data analysis. By naming the core category &amp;amp;ldquo;off-beat interfacing&amp;amp;rdquo;, we were able to show how the demands of the professionals concerned did not correspond to the ability of people with ALS and their proxies to process information, deal with requests, and be at ease in making decisions at the beginning of the shared care pathway. Three categories were generated: (i) navigating different paths, (ii) offering and experiencing a standard, non-personalized pathway, and (iii) anticipating decisions. The network of services must be organized according to guidelines, but must also contemplate a patient-family-centered approach that permits more personalized assistance.</p>

	<p>Compared to other primates, humans are late bloomers, with exceptionally long childhood and adolescence. The extensive developmental period of humans is thought to facilitate the learning processes required for the growth and maturation of the complex human brain. During the first two and a half decades of life, the human brain is a construction site, and learning processes direct its shaping through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. Formal and informal learning, which generates long-term and accessible knowledge, is mediated by neuroplasticity to create adaptive structural and functional changes in brain networks. Since experience-dependent neuroplasticity is at full force during school years, it holds a tremendous educational opportunity. In order to fulfill this developmental and learning potential, educational practices should be human-brain-friendly and &amp;amp;ldquo;ride&amp;amp;rdquo; the neuroplasticity wave. Neuroscience can inform educators about the natural learning mechanisms of the brain to support student learning. This review takes a neuroscientific lens to explore central concepts in education (e.g., mindset, motivation, meaning-making, and attention) and suggests two methods of using neuroscience as an educational tool: teaching students about their brain (content level) and considering the neuro-mechanisms of learning in educational design (design level).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characteristics and contributing factors of adverse drug reactions: an analytical study of patients with tuberculosis receiving treatment under the National TB Program of India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious threat to the public health system in India. Although the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) is providing a wide range of interventions from early diagnosis to complete treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality from TB, adverse drug reactions (ADR) remain a challenge in treatment adherence and completion. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts of Gujarat state. A total of 593 reported TB patients were recruited with an adjusted unified distribution based on the type of cases, site of diseases, and service facility through a simple random sampling method. A semi-structured questionnaire tool was used to collect socio-demographic, clinical, and ADR-related data from the TB patients. Data was analyzed for the frequency, percentage, chi-squared, and adjusted odds ratio to find the association between the variables. Results The majority of the study participants were male (87.2%), aged 15 to 60 (57.8%), daily laborers (22.4%), and married (64.2%). Over 75% of individuals had pulmonary TB, with 87% having experienced their first episode, 83% being new cases, and 44.7% having a history of addiction. ADR with mild symptoms was reported by more than a quarter (29%) of TB patients during the intensive phase (77%). The association between ADR experience and drug susceptibility was significant (p<0.005) and drug-resistant TB patients experience two times more ADRs than drug-sensitive TB patients (OR 2.04). Binomial logistic regression was carried out to describe the association between various variables and occurrence of ADRs. Conclusion The study highlighted a need to enhance health care providers’ capacity and program structure for managing ADRs among TB patients. In order to completely eliminate TB across the country, it also emphasized the attention for a holistic and all-encompassing strategy for managing TB patients at the field level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Validation of an instrument in Latin America to measure fear perception of the consequences of a large-scale war (war-effect) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Russia-Ukraine war brought immediate and delayed socio-economic consequences. In general, the repercussions caused fear all over the world. This study aims to validate an instrument for measuring fear perception caused by the consequences of a large-scale war in Latin American citizens. Methodology: An instrumental study in which 1705 residents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and other countries were surveyed through a virtual format. A literature search, expert judgment, preliminary (then exploratory and confirmatory) analysis, as well as reliability assessment were carried out. Results: The skewness and kurtosis values of the 13 questions did not exceed the range ± 1.5 and showed significant correlations (>0.30). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (0.962) and Bartlett's test (19558.5; df=78; p=0.001) had good indicators. The parallel analysis suggested a single factor, which explained 75.59% of the total variance. The confirmatory factor analysis generated an instrument with six items (χ2=47.33, df=9, p=0.001; RMR=0.010; GFI=0.990; CFI=1.00; TLI=0.990; and RMSEA=0.050), with an overall Cronbach's Alpha=0.949 (95% CI=0.94–0.95). Conclusion: A six-item instrument that measures the perception of fear caused by the consequences of a large-scale war was validated in half a dozen Latin American countries. This short and valid instrument can be administered to a broad population in Latin America.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatial association of land-use areas and disease occurred by pesticide poisoning in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Thailand is one of the Asian countries where high pesticides use is common for agriculture. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the spatial association between types of land-use areas and diseases occurred by pesticide poisoning in Thailand. Methods: This study was conducted by using the data set of average prevalence of diseases occurred by pesticide pollution and the land-use areas between 2018-2020. A Moran’s I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were used to identify the spatial autocorrelation between each type of land use areas and diseases developed due to pesticide poisoning in Thailand. Results: This present study observed that the average prevalence of disease occurred from pesticide pollution between 2018-2020 was 13.17 (95% CI: 10.83 - 15.50) per 100,000 in Thailand. The results identified the spatial global autocorrelation of each type of land used and occurrence of diseases due to pesticide pollution, including rice field areas, field crops, fruit trees and perennials, vegetables and flowers, and other agriculture with Moran’s I 0.270, 0.144, 0.606, 0.135, and 0.324 respectively. A spatial association between various factors and average prevalence of pesticide pollutions with significant LISA analysis were; rice field areas with eight high-high clusters and nine low-low clusters, field crops areas with three high-high clusters and 11 low-low clusters,  fruit trees and perennials areas with eight high-high clusters and 12 low-low clusters, and six high-high clusters and four low-low clusters vegetable and flower areas. Similarly, nine high-high clusters and nine low-low clusters of other agricultural areas had been observed with prevalence of diseases acquired by pesticide pollution. Conclusions: There was significant spatial association between land-use areas and diseases acquired by pesticide pollution in Thailand. It should be controlled by new policy recommendations for pesticides use for agriculture.,  especially, in provinces with more land-use areas for each type of plant.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Zen meditation-integrated CBT normalized the impaired brain function of a chronic low back pain patient—from the findings of brain blood flow SPECT imaging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mindfulness meditation for chronic pain is popular globally, but evidence of its efficacy is limited. Moreover, there are no established methods on the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions for chronic pain. In this study, a chronic low back pain patient was treated with traditional Japanese Buddhism meditation-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and the pre- and post-intervention brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were compared. Case: A 45-year-old man was experiencing continuous back pain after a vehicular accident and experienced insufficient improvement after drug treatment. The patient underwent a 3-month outpatient mindfulness meditation-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy program executed by a multidisciplinary team: physician visits (once a week for 30 min), multidisciplinary medical and meditation education (Zen breath counting meditation and mantra), physiotherapy interventions (twice weekly), occupational therapy interventions (twice weekly), psychiatric occupational therapy interventions (twice weekly), and nutritional interventions (twice weekly). After treatment, the patient reported a decrease in subjective pain overall, based on whether or not a pain attack occurred. Brain SPECT imaging revealed an improvement in excess blood flow from the right temporoparietal junction to the inferior parietal lobe. Conclusions: These findings indicate that Zen meditation is an effective intervention method for chronic pain and SPECT is a useful tool for measuring its effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Frontier model of the environmental inefficiency effects on livestock bioeconomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This work was focused on measuring environmental inefficiency in Mexican dairy farms, considering climate change variables related to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and planetary geomagnetic activity. Methods: The applied methodology measures the eco-efficiency of Mexican dairy farms using the empirical application of a stochastic frontier model of the bioeconomy. The productive sector of the bioeconomy studied was the eco-intensification of the livestock production system (dairies). The environmental inefficiency effect was assumed to be a distribution-independent truncation of a normal distribution with constant variance, while the mean was a linear environmental function of the observable variable. Results: The results showed that the coefficients of the frontier model were highly significant, highlighting the investment in livestock (50%). The inefficiency model had an impact on climate variation with greenhouse gas emissions CH4 (1.96%). The results of the environmental technical efficiency in geometric average were 81.28%. The producers that reached the border with a technical efficiency equal to 1 are the references for the rest, marking the relative technical efficiency. Conclusions: It was concluded that the coefficients in the model were very significant, showing the level of investment in livestock (50%). The low-performance model estimates the impact of climate change on GHG emissions CH4 (1.96%) explaining the trend of increasing GHG emissions, keeping in view that the management of food and cattle during the study period were affected by summer feeding, which allowed considering the activity of GHG emissions. According to the results, the geometric mean environmental performance of engineering is 81.28%.

                Background: Environmental problems are becoming more recurrent nowadays, which is why many countries have acted on the matter, through different forms, laws and taxes that can contribute and reduce the polluting impact of companies at the time of manufacturing their products. One of the reforms has been environmental taxes, which are not only aimed at raising money, but also at taking corrective action on the behavior of companies that damage both the environment and the health of the population. The research is intended to finding out the opinion and interest of managers of different companies in the industrial sector on environmental taxes, also known as green taxes, and whether they consider it necessary to add green taxes to the current tax system. Method: For data collection of the research, 120 managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industrial sector were questioned about whether green taxes could have an influence on ecosystem conservation and several other questions. Results: 63.3% of the managers surveyed agree that the application of an environmental tax is necessary. Conclusion: It is concluded that managers are in favor of green taxes and  approve that  such taxes should be given as part of ecosystem conservation and environmental protection for all businesses, and that they promote businesses that do not generate any side effects or transformations to the environmental balance, thus improving the quality of life of residents.
