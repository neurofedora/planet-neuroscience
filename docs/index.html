              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The optimal target and connectivity for DBS in Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, little is known about the optimal target and whether efficacy depends on connectivity of the stimulation site. Using outcome data from the ESTEL trial, we aimed to determine the optimal target and connectivity for DBS in LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>20 patients underwent bilateral DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM). Outcome was % seizure reduction from baseline after three months of DBS, defined using three measures (monthly seizure diaries, 24-hour EEG, and a novel diary-EEG composite). Probabilistic stimulation mapping identified thalamic locations associated with higher/lower efficacy. Two substitute diffusion MRI datasets (a normative dataset from healthy subjects and a “disease-matched” dataset from a separate group of LGS patients) were used to calculate structural connectivity between DBS sites and a map of areas known to express epileptic activity in LGS, derived from our previous EEG-fMRI research.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results were similar across the three outcome measures. Stimulation was most efficacious in the anterior and inferolateral “parvocellular” CM border, extending into the ventral lateral nucleus (posterior subdivision). There was a positive association between diary-EEG composite seizure reduction and connectivity to areas of <i>a priori</i> EEG-fMRI activation, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, putamen, and pontine brainstem. In contrast, outcomes were not associated with baseline clinical variables.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Efficacious CM-DBS for LGS is linked to stimulation of the parvocellular CM and the adjacent ventral lateral nucleus, and is associated with connectivity to, and thus likely modulation of, the “secondary epileptic network” underlying the shared electroclinical manifestations of LGS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Early predictors of clinical and MRI outcomes using LASSO in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify predictors in common between different clinical and MRI outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common between clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a LASSO-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6s, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 vs. 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 vs. 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 vs. 0.75 for SPMS, respectively. In contrast, 10-year MRI outcomes were more strongly influenced by initial T2LV and BPF than clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Early prognostication of MS is possible using LASSO modeling to identify a limited set of accessible clinical features. These predictive models can be clinically useable in treatment decision-making once implemented into web-based calculators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Motor progression and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The motor severity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is believed to parallel with dopaminergic terminal degeneration in the striatum although the terminal was reported to be virtually absent by 4 years post-diagnosis. Meanwhile, neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN) elucidated a variability at early stages and gradual loss with less variability 10 years post-diagnosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the correlation between motor impairments and striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration and nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss at early to advanced stages of PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety-three PD patients were divided into early and advanced subgroups based on motor symptom duration and whether motor fluctuation was present. Striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration was evaluated using a presynaptic dopamine transporter tracer, <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT. Nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron density was assessed by neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In patients with early-stage (motor symptoms for ≤8 or 10 years), motor dysfunction during the drug-off state was paralleled by a decline in <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum despite the absence of a correlation with reductions in NM-MRI signals in SN. Meanwhile, in patients with advanced-stage (motor symptoms for &gt;8 or 10 years and with fluctuation), the degree of motor deficits during the drug-off state was not correlated with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum, despite its significant negative correlation with NM-MRI signals in SN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose striatal dopaminergic terminal loss measured using <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT and nigral dopamine neuron loss assessed with NM-MRI as early-stage and advanced-stage motor impairments biomarkers, respectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Alpha blocking and 1/fβ spectral scaling in resting EEG can be accounted for by a sum of damped alpha band oscillatory processes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rick Evertz, Damien G. Hicks, David T. J. Liley</p>

The dynamical and physiological basis of alpha band activity and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise in the EEG are the subject of continued speculation. Here we conjecture, on the basis of empirical data analysis, that both of these features may be economically accounted for through a single process if the resting EEG is conceived of being the sum of multiple stochastically perturbed alpha band damped linear oscillators with a distribution of dampings (relaxation rates). The modulation of alpha-band and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise activity by changes in damping is explored in eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting state EEG. We aim to estimate the distribution of dampings by solving an inverse problem applied to EEG power spectra. The characteristics of the damping distribution are examined across subjects, sensors and recording condition (EC/EO). We find that there are robust changes in the damping distribution between EC and EO recording conditions across participants. The estimated damping distributions are found to be predominantly bimodal, with the number and position of the modes related to the sharpness of the alpha resonance and the scaling (<i>β</i>) of the power spectrum (1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup>). The results suggest that there exists an intimate relationship between resting state alpha activity and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise with changes in both governed by changes to the damping of the underlying alpha oscillatory processes. In particular, alpha-blocking is observed to be the result of the most weakly damped distribution mode becoming more heavily damped. The results suggest a novel way of characterizing resting EEG power spectra and provides new insight into the central role that damped alpha-band activity may play in characterising the spatio-temporal features of resting state EEG.

                It is well established that degradation of perforant path fibers is associated with age-related cognitive dysfunction and CA3 hyperactivity. Whether this fiber loss triggers a cascade of other functional changes within the hippocampus circuit has not been causatively established, however. Thus, the current study evaluated the effect of perforant path fiber loss on neuronal activity in CA3 and layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in relation to mnemonic similarity task performance. Expression of the immediate early gene Arc was quantified in rats that received a unilateral right hemisphere transection of the perforant path or sham surgery that cut the cortex but left the fibers intact. Behavior-related expression of Arc mRNA was measured to test the hypothesis that fiber loss leads to elevated activation of CA3 and LEC neurons, as previously observed in aged rats that were impaired on the mnemonic similarity task. Transection of perforant path fibers, which has previously been shown to lead to a decline in mnemonic similarity task performance, did not alter Arc expression. Arc expression in CA3, however, was correlated with task performance on the more difficult discrimination trials across both surgical groups. These observations further support a link between CA3 activity and mnemonic similarity task performance but suggest the reduced input from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, as observed in old age, does not causatively elevate CA3 activity.

                Brain oscillations in the theta (3-7 Hz) and alpha (7-13 Hz) bands are implicated in visual perception and attention. We show that in an attentional blink paradigm, where the task requires detecting two targets presented in rapid succession, perceptual performance varied with the rhythms at these two frequencies, which we name attentional rhythmic blink. In the absence of distractors, second target detection performance fluctuated at the theta rhythm, but the fluctuation frequency shifted toward alpha rhythm when distractors were interspersed with the targets. We further show, in magnetoencephalography experiments, that a change in the dominant frequency of ongoing neural oscillations accompanied those in perceptual performance, with the parietal theta being more pronounced in the no-distractor and the occipital alpha in the distractor conditions, respectively. We propose that perceptual rhythms may depend on the power balance between ongoing neural oscillations, determined by the task-specific demand.

                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is a mechanism that, amongst other known and latent critical functions, ensures activated brain regions are adequately supplied with oxygen and glucose. This biological phenomenon underpins non-invasive perfusion-related neuroimaging techniques and recent reports have implicated NVC impairment in several neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, much remains unknown regarding NVC in health and disease, and only recently has there been burgeoning recognition of a close interplay with brain thermodynamics. Accordingly, we developed a novel multi-modal approach to systematically modulate cortical temperature and interrogate the spatiotemporal dynamics of sensory-evoked NVC. We show that changes in cortical temperature profoundly and intricately modulate NVC, with low temperatures associated with diminished oxygen delivery, and high temperatures inducing a distinct vascular oscillation. These observations provide novel insights into the relationship between NVC and brain thermodynamics, with important implications for brain temperature related therapies, functional biomarkers of elevated brain temperature, and in-vivo methods to study neurovascular coupling.

                Pain relief by vibrotactile touch is a common human experience. Previous neurophysiological investigations focused on spinal mechanisms in anesthetized animals. However, whether and how cortex, especially the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), is involved in this process in behaving animals remains unknown. We discovered that vibrotactile reafferent signals from self-generated whisking significantly reduce facial nociception. Specific blocking of touch transmission from thalamus to barrel cortex (S1B) abolished whisking induced analgesia. In vivo imaging showed that tactile and noxious stimuli differentially activate S1B neurons. Intrinsic manifold analysis of S1B population activity revealed that whisking pushes the transition of neural state induced by noxious stimuli towards the state encoding non-nocifensive actions. Thus, S1B contains nociceptive representations and integrates tactile and painful signals to enable touch mediated pain relief.

                The impact of spontaneous movements on neuronal activity has created the need to quantify behavior. We present a versatile framework to directly capture the 3D motion of freely definable body points in a marker-free manner with high precision and reliability. Combining the tracking with neural recordings revealed multiplexing of information in the motor cortex neurons of freely moving rats. By integrating multiple behavioral variables into a model of the neural response, we derived a virtual head-fixation for which the influence of specific body movements was removed. This strategy enabled us to analyze the behavior of interest (e.g., front paw movements). Thus, we unveiled an unexpectedly large fraction of neurons in the motor cortex with tuning to the paw movements, which was previously masked by body posture tuning. Once established, our framework can be efficiently applied to large datasets while minimizing the experimental workload caused by animal training and manual labeling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Limited Evidence for a Triple Dissociation in the Medial Temporal Lobe: an fMRI Recognition Memory Replication Study</a></h4>

              
                Common research practices in neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging may produce outcomes that are difficult to replicate. Results that cannot be replicated have contributed to a replication crisis in psychology, neuroscience, and other disciplines over the years. Here we replicate two previous papers in which the authors present two analysis paths for a dataset in which participants underwent fMRI while performing a recognition memory test for old and new words. Both studies found activation in the hippocampus, with the first demonstrating a distinction in hippocampal activation corresponding to true and perceived oldness of stimuli and the second demonstrating that hippocampal activation reflects the subjective experience of the participant. We replicated the behavioral and MRI acquisition parameters reported in the two target articles (Daselaar, Fleck, & Cabeza, 2006; Daselaar, Fleck, Prince, et al., 2006) with N=53 participants. We focused fMRI analyses on regions of interest reported in the target articles examining fMRI activation for differences corresponding with true and perceived oldness and those associated with the subjective memory experiences of recollection, familiarity, and novelty. Comparisons between true and perceived oldness revealed main effects not only for true, but also perceived oldness along with significant interaction effects. We replicate the findings of recollection and familiarity signals in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe cortex, respectively, but failed to replicate a novelty signal in the anterior medial temporal lobe. These results remained when we analyzed only correct trials, indicating that the effects were not due to selectively averaging correct and incorrect trials. Taken together, we replicate the previous finding that activation in the hippocampus corresponds to the subjective experience associated with correct recognition memory retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tumor necrosis factor α modulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in a concentration-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, have been implicated in important brain functions, such as synaptic transmission and plasticity. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), which is produced and secreted by microglia, has been linked to the expression of synaptic plasticity in neurons. However, the role of TNF-mediated activation of microglia has not been addressed in this context. Here, we assessed concentration-dependent effects of TNF on the balance of synaptic excitation/inhibition and the activation of microglia using mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures. We found that low concentrations of TNF enhanced excitatory synaptic strength while not affecting inhibitory neurotransmission. At higher concentrations, TNF increased inhibitory neurotransmission without affecting excitatory synaptic strength. Both low and high concentrations of TNF induced the synaptic accumulation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors, suggesting that a high concentration of TNF exerts a homeostatic effect on excitatory neurotransmission that prevents synaptic strengthening. Consistent with this, high, but not low, concentrations of TNF activated microglia. Moreover, high concentrations of TNF enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in microglia-depleted tissue cultures. These findings extend our knowledge on the role of TNF on synaptic plasticity by demonstrating concentration-dependent effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. They reveal a TNF-mediated negative feedback mechanism on excitatory neurotransmission that is dependent on the activation of microglia, thereby emphasizing their role as gatekeepers of TNF-mediated plasticity and homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down modulation and cortical-AMG/HPC interaction in familiar face processing</a></h4>

              
                Humans can accurately recognize familiar faces in only a few hundred milliseconds, but the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we recorded intracranial electrophysiological signals from ventral temporal cortex (VTC), superior/middle temporal cortex (STC/MTC), medial parietal cortex (MPC) and amygdala/hippocampus (AMG/HPC) in 20 epilepsy patients while they viewed faces of famous people and strangers as well as common objects. In posterior VTC and MPC, familiarity-sensitive responses emerged significantly later than initial face-selective responses, suggesting that familiarity enhances face representations after they are first being extracted. Moreover, viewing famous faces increased the coupling between cortical areas and AMG/HPC in multiple frequency bands. These findings imply that the top-down modulation in local face-selective response and interactions between cortical face areas and AMG/HPC contribute to the superior recognition of familiar faces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arousal neurons that anticipate deviations in blood glucose.</a></h4>

              
                The brain needs to track body energy state to optimize physiology and behavior. Important information about current and future energy states is contained in minute-to-minute fluctuations in blood glucose. However, it is unclear whether brain glucose sensors are capable of responding to this temporal structure to extract such information. In behaving mammals, hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons (HONs) control arousal and are proposed to sense energy balance, yet recent studies show that HON activity varies rapidly (over seconds) with locomotion. It remains unknown if and how HONs reflect blood glucose fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we co-monitored HON activity and blood glucose in behaving mice, uncovering inhibition of HONs by rising blood glucose. Surprisingly, peak HON signals (population waves) anticipated peak glucose deviations by several minutes. In multivariate analysis of diverse HON activity correlates (locomotion, metabolic variables), the glucose temporal gradient (negative first derivative) emerged as prime predictor of HON population activity on the minute timescales, thereby explaining this anticipatory response. Furthermore, 2-photon imaging of >900 individual HONs revealed parallel communication of absolute blood glucose values and their derivatives in distinct HON subsets. Thus, HONs transmit multiplexed slowly and rapidly changing information, and, in the slow bandwidth, extract temporal features from blood glucose dynamics that suggest a hybrid of anticipatory and proportional logic in brain responses to blood glucose.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What the hippocampus tells the HPA axis: Hippocampal output attenuates acute stress responses via disynaptic inhibition of CRF+ PVN neurons</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus exerts inhibitory feedback on the release of glucocorticoids. Because the major hippocampal efferent projections are excitatory, it has been hypothesized that this feedback inhibition is mediated by populations of inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus or elsewhere. These regions would be excited by hippocampal efferents and project to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). A direct demonstration of the synaptic responses elicited by hippocampal outputs in PVN cells or upstream GABAergic interneurons has not been provided previously. Here, we used viral vectors to express channelrhodopsin (ChR) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) in pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus (vHip) in mice expressing tdTomato in GABA- or CRF-expressing neurons. We observed dense innervation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) by labelled vHip axons and sparse labeling within the PVN. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording in parasagittal brain slices containing the BNST and PVN, photostimulation of vHip terminals elicited monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSCs) in both CRF+ and GAD+ cells. The balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition were maintained in CRF+ cells during 20 Hz stimulus trains. Photostimulation of hippocampal afferents to the BNST and PVN in vivo inhibited the rise in blood glucocorticoid levels produced by acute restraint stress. We thus provide functional evidence that hippocampal output to the BNST results in a net inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gaining further mechanistic insights into this process using methods with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-dependent sensory modulation underlies Bayesian vocal sequence perception</a></h4>

              
                Vocal communication in both songbirds and humans relies on categorical perception of smoothly varying acoustic spaces. Vocal perception can be biased by expectation and context, but the mechanisms of this bias are not well understood. We developed a behavioral task in which songbirds, European starlings, are trained to to classify smoothly varying song syllables in the context of predictive syllable sequences. We find that syllable-sequence predictability biases perceptual categorization following a Bayesian model of probabilistic information integration. We then recorded from populations of neurons in the auditory forebrain while birds actively categorized song syllables, observing large proportions of neurons that track the smoothly varying natural feature space of syllable categories. We observe that predictive information in the syllable sequences dynamically modulates sensory neural representations. These results support a Bayesian model of perception where predictive information acts to dynamically reallocate sensory neural resources, sharpening acuity (i.e. the likelihood) in high-probability regions of stimulus space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid microglial phenotype changes modulate neuronal networks and sharp wave-ripple activity in acute slice preparations</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have long been known for their remarkable sensitivity to tissue disturbance or injury, but its implications to the interpretation of results from ex vivo models of the CNS have remained largely unclear to date. To this end, we have followed the course of microglial phenotype changes and contribution to neuronal network organisation and functioning in acute brain slices prepared from mice, widely used to study the physiology of the brain from nanoscale events to complex circuits. We found that upon acute slice preparation, microglial cell bodies dislocate and migrate towards the surface of slices, alongside with rapidly progressing morphological changes and altered interactions with neurons. This is accompanied by gradual depolarization and downregulation of P2Y12 receptors, which are instrumental for microglia-neuron communication. Quantitative post-embedding immunofluorescent labelling reveals time-dependent increase in the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses upon slice preparation in the cerebral cortex, which are markedly influenced by microglia. In line with this, the absence of microglia diminishes the incidence, amplitude and frequency of sharp wave-ripple activity in hippocampal slices. Collectively, our data suggest that microglia are not only inherent modulators of complex neuronal networks, but their specific actions on network reorganisation and functioning must be taken into account when learning lessons from ex vivo models of the CNS.

	<p>The time-sensitive GABA shift from excitatory to inhibitory is critical in early neural circuits development and depends upon developmentally regulated expression of cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2. NKCC1, encoded by the SLC12A2 gene, regulates neuronal Cl&amp;amp;minus; homeostasis by chloride import working opposite KCC2. The high NKCC1/KCC2 expression ratio decreases in early neural development contributing to GABA shift. Human SLC12A2 loss-of-function mutations were recently associated with a multisystem disorder affecting neural development. However, the multisystem phenotype of rodent Nkcc1 knockout models makes neurodevelopment challenging to study. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)-NTRK2/TrkB signalling controls KCC2 expression during neural development, but its impact on NKCC1 is still controversial. Here, we discuss recent evidence supporting BDNF-TrkB signalling controlling Nkcc1 expression and the GABA shift during hippocampal circuit formation. Namely, specific deletion of Ntrk2/Trkb from immature mouse hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) affects their integration and maturation in the hippocampal circuitry and reduces Nkcc1 expression in their target region, the CA3 principal cells, leading to premature GABA shift, ultimately influencing the establishment of functional hippocampal circuitry and animal behaviour in adulthood. Thus, immature DGCs emerge as a potential therapeutic target as GABAergic transmission is vital for specific neural progenitors generating dentate neurogenesis in early development and the mature brain.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) research has shown great outcome variability in motor performance tasks, with one possible source being sex differences. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of estrogen levels on leg muscle fatigability during a fatigue task (FT) after 4 mA tDCS over the left motor cortex (M1). Ten young, healthy eumenorrheic women received 4 mA anodal active or sham stimulation over the left M1 during periods of high and low estrogen levels. A fatigue index (FI) was calculated to quantify fatigability, and the electromyography (EMG) of the knee extensors and flexors was recorded during the FT. The findings showed that tDCS applied during high estrogen levels resulted in greater leg muscle fatigability. Furthermore, a significant increase in EMG activity of the right knee extensors was observed during periods of active stimulation, independent of estrogen level. These results suggest that estrogen levels should be considered in tDCS studies with young healthy women.</p>

	<p>A major malignant trait of gliomas is their remarkable infiltration capacity. When glioma develops, the tumor cells have already reached the distant part. Therefore, complete removal of the glioma is impossible. Recently, research on the involvement of the tumor microenvironment in glioma invasion has advanced. Local hypoxia triggers cell migration as an environmental factor. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) -1&amp;amp;alpha;, produced in tumor cells under hypoxia, promotes the transcription of various invasion related molecules. The extracellular matrix surrounding tumors is degraded by proteases secreted by tumor cells and simultaneously replaced by an extracellular matrix that promotes infiltration. Astrocytes and microglia become tumor-associated astrocytes and glioma-associated macrophages/microglia, respectively, in relation to tumor cells. These cells also promote glioma invasion. Interactions between glioma cells actively promote infiltration of each other. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy transform the microenvironment, allowing glioma cells to invade. These findings indicate that the tumor microenvironment may be a target for glioma invasion. On the other hand, because the living body actively promotes tumor infiltration in response to the tumor, it is necessary to reconsider whether the invasion itself is friend or foe to the brain.</p>

	<p>Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGGs) are heterogeneous and poorly circumscribed neoplasms with isolated tumor cells that extend beyond the margins of the lesion depicted on MRI. Efforts to demarcate the glioma core from the surrounding healthy brain led us to define an intermediate region, the so-called peritumoral zone (PTZ). Although most studies about PTZ have been conducted on high-grade gliomas, the purpose here is to review the cellular, metabolic, and radiological characteristics of PTZ in the specific context of DLGG. A better delineation of PTZ, in which glioma cells and neural tissue strongly interact, may open new therapeutic avenues to optimize both functional and oncological results. First, a connectome-based &amp;amp;ldquo;supratotal&amp;amp;rdquo; surgical resection (i.e., with the removal of PTZ in addition to the tumor core) resulted in prolonged survival by limiting the risk of malignant transformation, while improving the quality of life, thanks to a better control of seizures. Second, the timing and order of (neo)adjuvant medical treatments can be modulated according to the pattern of peritumoral infiltration. Third, the development of new drugs specifically targeting the PTZ could be considered from an oncological (such as immunotherapy) and epileptological perspective. Further multimodal investigations of PTZ are needed to maximize long-term outcomes in DLGG patients.</p>

	<p>Psychosocial interventions targeting the specific needs of people affected by younger-onset dementia are lacking. Younger-onset dementia refers to dementia where symptom onset occurs at less than 65 years old. Because of its occurrence in middle age, the impact on spouses is particularly marked and dyadic-based interventions are recommended. Music And Psychology &amp;amp;amp; Social Connections (MAPS) is a novel online intervention, informed by the theory of adaptive coping by Bannon et al. (2021) for dyads affected by younger-onset dementia. MAPS combines therapeutic songwriting, cognitive behaviour therapy, and a private social networking group that focuses on the dyads. This will be a randomised controlled trial with a waitlist control. The primary aims are to assess whether MAPS improves depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in caregivers, with secondary aims to assess whether MAPS improves depressive symptoms in people with younger-onset dementia. The trial also aims to assess dyadic social connectedness; caregiver coping skills; and neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with younger-onset dementia. We will recruit 60 dyads to participate in a group-based weekly online program for 8 weeks facilitated by a credentialed music therapist and psychologist. Sessions 1 and 8 will include both caregivers and people with younger-onset dementia and Sessions 2&amp;amp;ndash;7 will involve separate group sessions for caregivers and those with dementia. There will be focus groups for qualitative feedback. Due to its online administration, MAPS has the potential to reach many dyads affected by younger-onset dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A general framework for predicting the transcriptomic consequences of non-coding variation and small molecules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moustafa Abdalla, Mohamed Abdalla</p>

Genome wide association studies (GWASs) for complex traits have implicated thousands of genetic loci. Most GWAS-nominated variants lie in noncoding regions, complicating the systematic translation of these findings into functional understanding. Here, we leverage convolutional neural networks to assist in this challenge. Our computational framework, peaBrain, models the transcriptional machinery of a tissue as a two-stage process: first, predicting the mean tissue specific abundance of all genes and second, incorporating the transcriptomic consequences of genotype variation to predict individual abundance on a subject-by-subject basis. We demonstrate that peaBrain accounts for the majority (>50%) of variance observed in mean transcript abundance across most tissues and outperforms regularized linear models in predicting the consequences of individual genotype variation. We highlight the validity of the peaBrain model by calculating non-coding impact scores that correlate with nucleotide evolutionary constraint that are also predictive of disease-associated variation and allele-specific transcription factor binding. We further show how these tissue-specific peaBrain scores can be leveraged to pinpoint functional tissues underlying complex traits, outperforming methods that depend on colocalization of eQTL and GWAS signals. We subsequently: (a) derive continuous dense embeddings of genes for downstream applications; (b) highlight the utility of the model in predicting transcriptomic impact of small molecules and shRNA (on par with <i>in vitro</i> experimental replication of external test sets); (c) explore how peaBrain can be used to model difficult-to-study processes (such as neural induction); and (d) identify putatively functional eQTLs that are missed by high-throughput experimental approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting recurrent waves of pertussis across the boroughs of London</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arash Saeidpour, Shweta Bansal, Pejman Rohani</p>

Pertussis has resurfaced in the UK, with incidence levels not seen since the 1980s. While the fundamental causes of this resurgence remain the subject of much conjecture, the study of historical patterns of pathogen diffusion can be illuminating. Here, we examined time series of pertussis incidence in the boroughs of Greater London from 1982 to 2013 to document the spatial epidemiology of this bacterial infection and to identify the potential drivers of its percolation. The incidence of pertussis over this period is characterized by 3 distinct stages: a period exhibiting declining trends with 4-year inter-epidemic cycles from 1982 to 1994, followed by a deep trough until 2006 and the subsequent resurgence. We observed systematic temporal trends in the age distribution of cases and the fade-out profile of pertussis coincident with increasing national vaccine coverage from 1982 to 1990. To quantify the hierarchy of epidemic phases across the boroughs of London, we used the Hilbert transform. We report a consistent pattern of spatial organization from 1982 to the early 1990s, with some boroughs consistently leading epidemic waves and others routinely lagging. To determine the potential drivers of these geographic patterns, a comprehensive parallel database of borough-specific features was compiled, comprising of demographic, movement and socio-economic factors that were used in statistical analyses to predict epidemic phase relationships among boroughs. Specifically, we used a combination of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to quantify the contribution of each covariate to model predictions. Our analyses identified a number of predictors of a borough’s historical epidemic phase, specifically the age composition of households, the number of agricultural and skilled manual workers, latitude, the population of public transport commuters and high-occupancy households. Univariate regression analysis of the 2012 epidemic identified the ratio of cumulative unvaccinated children to the total population and population of Pakistan-born population to have moderate positive and negative association, respectively, with the timing of epidemic. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of contemporary pertussis transmission in a large metropolitan population, this study has identified the characteristics that determine the spatial spread of this bacterium across the boroughs of London.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Benchmarking of deep learning algorithms for 3D instance segmentation of confocal image datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anuradha Kar, Manuel Petit, Yassin Refahi, Guillaume Cerutti, Christophe Godin, Jan Traas</p>

Segmenting three-dimensional (3D) microscopy images is essential for understanding phenomena like morphogenesis, cell division, cellular growth, and genetic expression patterns. Recently, deep learning (DL) pipelines have been developed, which claim to provide high accuracy segmentation of cellular images and are increasingly considered as the state of the art for image segmentation problems. However, it remains difficult to define their relative performances as the concurrent diversity and lack of uniform evaluation strategies makes it difficult to know how their results compare. In this paper, we first made an inventory of the available DL methods for 3D cell segmentation. We next implemented and quantitatively compared a number of representative DL pipelines, alongside a highly efficient non-DL method named MARS. The DL methods were trained on a common dataset of 3D cellular confocal microscopy images. Their segmentation accuracies were also tested in the presence of different image artifacts. A specific method for segmentation quality evaluation was adopted, which isolates segmentation errors due to under- or oversegmentation. This is complemented with a 3D visualization strategy for interactive exploration of segmentation quality. Our analysis shows that the DL pipelines have different levels of accuracy. Two of them, which are end-to-end 3D and were originally designed for cell boundary detection, show high performance and offer clear advantages in terms of adaptability to new data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Biosecurity in an age of open science</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Andrew Smith, Jonas B. Sandbrink</p>

The risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of biological research is increasing as biotechnology advances. As open science becomes widespread, we must consider its impact on those risks and develop solutions that ensure security while facilitating scientific progress. Here, we examine the interaction between open science practices and biosecurity and biosafety to identify risks and opportunities for risk mitigation. Increasing the availability of computational tools, datasets, and protocols could increase risks from research with misuse potential. For instance, in the context of viral engineering, open code, data, and materials may increase the risk of release of enhanced pathogens. For this dangerous subset of research, both open science and biosecurity goals may be achieved by using access-controlled repositories or application programming interfaces. While preprints accelerate dissemination of findings, their increased use could challenge strategies for risk mitigation at the publication stage. This highlights the importance of oversight earlier in the research lifecycle. Preregistration of research, a practice promoted by the open science community, provides an opportunity for achieving biosecurity risk assessment at the conception of research. Open science and biosecurity experts have an important role to play in enabling responsible research with maximal societal benefit.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Structures of Omicron Spike complexes and implications for neutralizing antibody development</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is dominant in many countries worldwide. The high number of Spike mutations is responsible for the broad immune evasion from existing vaccines and antibody drugs. To understand this, we first present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Spike. Comparison to previous Spike-antibody structures explains how Omicron escapes these therapeutics. Secondly, we report structures of Omicron, Delta and WT Spikes bound to a patient-derived Fab antibody fragment (510A5), which provides direct evidence where antibody binding was greatly attenuated by the Omicron mutations, freeing Spike to bind ACE2.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine elicits monoclonal antibodies with potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants</a></h4>

              
                Seow et al. isolate antibodies following double vaccination with AZD1222. Isolated antibodies target epitopes overlapping with the epitopes of infection-derived antibodies and show potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. Despite low serum neutralization at 9 months post vaccine, Spike reactive B cells are detected.

                SARS-CoV-2 variants C.1.2 and B.1.621 (Mu) rapidly spread in Africa and the Americas, respectively. Arora et el. show that C.1.2 and B.1.621 spike proteins enable increased entry into certain cell lines, are resistant to neutralization by the therapeutic antibody Bamlanivimab and partially escape neutralization by infection- or vaccination-induced antibodies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Probing the segregation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission via photobleaching and recovery of a fluorescent glutamate sensor</a></h4>

              
                Synapses maintain both action potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, however, organization of these two forms of release within an individual synapse remains unclear. Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release in primary hippocampal cultures. In non-neuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of non-photobleached probes with a time constant of 10 seconds. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Measurements and simulations of microtubule growth imply strong longitudinal interactions and reveal a role for GDP on the elongating end</a></h4>

              
                Microtubule polymerization dynamics result from the biochemical interactions of αβ-tubulin with the polymer end, but a quantitative understanding has been challenging to establish. We used interference reflection microscopy to make improved measurements of microtubule growth rates and growth fluctuations in the presence and absence of GTP hydrolysis. In the absence of GTP hydrolysis, microtubules grew steadily with very low fluctuations. These data were best described by a computational model implementing slow assembly kinetics, such that the rate of microtubule elongation is primarily limited by the rate of αβ-tubulin associations. With GTPase present, microtubules displayed substantially larger growth fluctuations than expected based on the no GTPase measurements. Our modeling showed that these larger fluctuations occurred because exposure of GDP-tubulin on the microtubule end transiently 'poisoned' growth, yielding a wider range of growth rates compared to GTP only conditions. Our experiments and modeling point to slow association kinetics (strong longitudinal interactions), such that drugs and regulatory proteins that alter microtubule dynamics could do so by modulating either the association or dissociation rate of tubulin from the microtubule tip. By causing slower growth, exposure of GDP tubulin at the growing microtubule end may be an important early event determining catastrophe.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-range migration of centrioles to the apical surface of the olfactory epithelium</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in vertebrates detect odorants using multiple cilia, which protrude from the end of the dendrite and require centrioles for their formation. In mouse olfactory epithelium, the centrioles originate in progenitor cells near the basal lamina, often 50 to 100 μm from the apical surface. It is unknown how centrioles traverse this distance or mature to form cilia. Using high-resolution expansion microscopy, we found that centrioles migrate together, with multiple centrioles per group and multiple groups per OSN, during dendrite outgrowth. Centrioles were found by live imaging to migrate slowly, with a maximum rate of 0.18 µm/min. Centrioles in migrating groups were associated with microtubule nucleation factors, but acquired rootletin and appendages only in mature OSNs. The parental centriole had preexisting appendages, formed a single cilium before other centrioles, and retained its unique appendage configuration in the mature OSN. We developed an air-liquid interface explant culture system for OSNs and used it to show that centriole migration can be perturbed <i>ex vivo</i> by stabilizing microtubules. We consider these results in the context of a comprehensive model for centriole formation, migration, and maturation in this important sensory cell type.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Calsyntenin-3, an atypical cadherin, suppresses inhibitory synapses but increases excitatory parallel-fiber synapses in cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Cadherins contribute to the organization of nearly all tissues, but the functions of several evolutionarily conserved cadherins, including those of calsyntenins, remain enigmatic. Puzzlingly, two distinct, non-overlapping functions for calsyntenins were proposed: As postsynaptic neurexin ligands in synapse formation, or as presynaptic kinesin adaptors in vesicular transport. Here, we show that, surprisingly, acute CRISPR-mediated deletion of calsyntenin-3 in mouse cerebellum <i>in vivo</i> causes a large decrease in inhibitory synapse, but a robust increase in excitatory parallel-fiber synapses in Purkinje cells. As a result, inhibitory synaptic transmission was suppressed, whereas parallel-fiber synaptic transmission was enhanced in Purkinje cells by the calsyntenin-3 deletion. No changes in the dendritic architecture of Purkinje cells or in climbing-fiber synapses were detected. Sparse selective deletion of calsyntenin-3 only in Purkinje cells recapitulated the synaptic phenotype, indicating that calsyntenin-3 acts by a cell-autonomous postsynaptic mechanism in cerebellum. Thus, by promoting formation of excitatory parallel-fiber synapses and decreasing formation of inhibitory synapses in the same neuron, calsyntenin-3 functions as a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that regulates the excitatory/inhibitory balance in Purkinje cells.

                Preys use their memory - where they sensed a predatory threat and whether a safe shelter is nearby - to dynamically control their survival instinct to avoid harm and reach safety. However, it remains unknown which brain regions are involved, and how such top-down control of innate behaviour is implemented at the circuit level. Here, using adult male mice, we show that the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is best positioned to control this task as an exclusive target of the hippocampus (HPC) within the medial hypothalamic defense system. Selective optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of hippocampal inputs to the AHN revealed that the HPC→AHN pathway not only mediates the contextual memory of predator threats but also controls the goal-directed escape by transmitting information about the surrounding environment. These results reveal a new mechanism for experience-dependent, top-down control of innate defensive behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysfunctional glymphatic system with disrupted aquaporin-4 expression pattern on astrocytes causes bacterial product accumulation in the CSF during pneumococcal meningitis</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal meningitis, inflammation of the meninges due to an infection of the Central Nervous System caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), is the most common form of community-acquired bacterial meningitis globally. The brain is separated from the systemic circulation by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and meningitis triggers the host immune response increasing the BBB permeability, allowing peripheral immune cells to reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and increasing debris production. The glymphatic system is a glial-dependent clearance pathway that drives the exchange of compounds between the brain parenchyma and the CSF regulating the waste clearance away from the brain. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-water channels on astrocytic end feet regulate the solute transport of the glymphatic system. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wistar rats, either subjected to pneumococcal meningitis or to artificial-CSF (sham), received Evans blue albumin (EBA) intracisternal. Overall, the meningitis group presented a significant impairment of the glymphatic system by retaining the EBA in the brain without consistently releasing the EBA into the bloodstream compared to the sham non-infected group. Through western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis using rat CSF and brain tissue sections, an increased accumulation of pneumococci was detected over time in the CSF, and because of a loss of drainage between CSF and brain interstitial space, such bacterial accumulation was not observed in the brain parenchyma. Western blot analysis for Iba1, TMEM119 and IFN-{gamma} in rat brain homogenates and NSE in serum showed increased neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in the brain over time during pneumococcal infection. Neurological impairment upon neuronal cell damage caused by meningitis with a malfunctioning glymphatic system was also demonstrated through open-field behavioral tests comparing rats from sham and meningitis groups. Lastly, protein expression analysis of AQP4 revealed no differences in AQP4 between the brains of the rats from the meningitis group and those from the sham non-infected rats. Importantly, confocal microscopy analysis showed a detachment of the astrocytic end feet from the BBB vascular endothelium with consequent misplacement of AQP4-water channels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings clearly indicate that pneumococcal meningitis decreases the glymphatic system's functionality, increasing the neurotoxic waste debris in the brain ultimately leading to brain-wide neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Finally, our results clearly showed that during pneumococcal meningitis, the glymphatic system does not function because of a detachment of the astrocytic end feet from the BBB vascular endothelium, which leads to a misplacement of AQP4 with consequent the loss of the AQP4-water channel's functionality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward Bases: Instantaneous reward revaluation with temporal difference learning</a></h4>

              
                An influential theory posits that dopaminergic neurons in the mid-brain implement a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm based on temporal difference (TD) learning. A fundamental assumption of this model is that the reward function being optimized is fixed. However, for biological creatures the `reward function' can fluctuate substantially over time depending on the internal physiological state of the animal. For instance, food is rewarding when you are hungry, but not when you are satiated. While a variety of experiments have demonstrated that animals can instantly adapt their behaviour when their internal physiological state changes, under current thinking this requires model-based planning since the standard model of TD learning requires retraining from scratch if the reward function changes. Here, we propose a novel and simple extension to TD learning that allows for the zero-shot (instantaneous) generalization to changing reward functions. Mathematically, we show that if we assume the reward function is a linear combination of reward basis vectors, and if we learn a value function for each reward basis using TD learning, then we can recover the true value function by a linear combination of these value function bases. This representational scheme allows instant and perfect generalization to any reward function in the span of the reward basis vectors as well as possesses a straightforward implementation in neural circuitry by parallelizing the standard circuitry required for TD learning. We demonstrate that our algorithm can also reproduce behavioural data on reward revaluation tasks, predict dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens, as well as learn equally fast as successor representations while requiring much less memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute administration of a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist alters behavioral and neural parameters in adult zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is involved in numerous brain functions and behavioral processes. Alterations in this neurotransmitter system are associated with the pathogenesis of several human neurological disorders. Pharmacological agents that interact with the dopaminergic system allow the investigation of dopamine- mediated cellular and molecular responses and may elucidate the biological bases of such disorders. The zebrafish, a translationally relevant biomedical research organism, has been successfully employed in prior psychopharmacology studies. Here, we evaluate the effects of quinpirole (a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist) in adult zebrafish on behavioral parameters and neurotransmitter levels. Adult zebrafish received intraperitoneal injections of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of quinpirole or saline (control group) twice with an inter-injection interval of 48h. All tests were performed 24h after the second injection. After acute quinpirole administration, zebrafish exhibited decreased locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like behaviors and memory impairment compared to control. However, the quinpirole administration did not affect social and aggressive behavior. Quinpirole-treated fish exhibited altered swimming patterns: fish showed stereotypic swimming characterized by repetitive behavior, swimming from corner to corner at the bottom of the tank preceded and followed by episodes of immobility. Moreover, analysis of neurotransmitter levels in the brain demonstrated a significant increase in glutamate and a decrease in serotonin, while no alterations were observed in dopamine. These findings demonstrate that dopaminergic signaling altered by quinpirole administration results in significant changes in behavior and neurotransmitter levels in the central nervous system of zebrafish. Thus, we conclude that the use of quinpirole administration in adult zebrafish may be an appropriate tool for the analysis of mechanisms underlying neurological disorders related to the dopaminergic system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relation is an option for processing context information</a></h4>

              
                Attention mechanisms are one of the most frequently used architectures in the development of artificial intelligence because they can process contextual information efficiently. Various artificial intelligence mechanisms such as transformer for processing natural language, image data, etc. include the attention mechanism. Since attention is a powerful component to realize artificial intelligence, various improvements have been made to enhance its performance. The time complexity of attention depends on the square of input sequence length. Methods to improve time complexity of attention are one of the hottest topics in various studies. In this study, we have devised a mechanism called relation that can understand the context information of sequential data without using attention. Relation is very simple to implement and its time complexity depends only on the length of the sequences; a comparison of the performance of neural networks with relation and attention mechanisms on several benchmark datasets shows that relation achieved the same context processing capability as attention with less computation time. Hence, relation is an ideal option for processing context information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictable fluctuations in excitatory synaptic strength due to natural variation in presynaptic firing rate</a></h4>

              
                Many controlled, in vitro studies have demonstrated how postsynaptic responses to presynaptic spikes are not constant but depend on short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) and the detailed timing of presynaptic spikes. However, the effects of short-term plasticity (depression and facilitation) are not limited to short, sub-second timescales. The effects of STP appear on long timescales as changes in presynaptic firing rates lead to changes in steady-state synaptic transmission. Here we examine the relationship between natural variations in the presynaptic firing rates and spike transmission in vivo. Using large-scale spike recordings in awake mice from the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset, we first detect putative excitatory synaptic connections based on cross-correlations between the spike trains of millions of pairs of neurons. For the subset of pairs where a transient, excitatory effect was detected, we use a model-based approach to track fluctuations in synaptic efficacy and find that efficacy varies substantially on slow (~1 minute) timescales over the course of these recordings. For many connections, the efficacy fluctuations are correlated with fluctuations in the presynaptic firing rate. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, we then model the detailed probability of postsynaptic spiking on a millisecond timescale, including both slow changes in postsynaptic excitability and monosynaptic inputs with short-term plasticity. The detailed model reproduces the slow efficacy fluctuations observed with many putative excitatory connections, suggesting that these fluctuations can be both directly predicted based on the time-varying presynaptic firing rate and, at least partly, explained by the cumulative effects of STP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glossiness perception and its pupillary response</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have discovered that pupillary response changes depend on cognitive factors, such as subjective brightness caused by optical illusions and luminance. However, it remains unclear how the cognitive factor derived from the glossiness perception of object surfaces affects pupillary response. We investigated the relationship between glossiness perception and pupillary response through a gloss rating experiment that includes recording pupil diameter. For the stimuli, we prepared general object images (original) and randomized images (shuffled) that comprised of the same images with randomized small square regions. The image features were then controlled by matching the luminance histogram. The observers were asked to rate the perceived glossiness of the stimuli presented for 3,000 ms and changes in their pupil diameter were recorded. Consequently, if glossiness of the original images were rated as high, those of the shuffled were rated as low, and vice versa. High-gloss images constricted the pupil size more than the low-gloss ones near the pupillary light reflex. By contrast, the shuffled images dilated the pupil size more than the original image at a relatively later stage. These results suggest that local features comprising specular highlights involve the cognitive factor for pupil constriction, and this process is faster than pupil dilation derived from the inhibition of object recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Computational Neuroanatomy of Predictive Dynamics of Pain Perception</a></h4>

              
                Pain perception is an active process that regulates nociceptive inputs by descending opioidergic signals, in which the brain encodes pain-related predictive and corrective terms, after having made Bayesian-like inferences about noxious amplitudes. Offset analgesia (OA), a large reduction of tonic pain after a small nociceptive termination, is typical empirical evidence of on-line pain modulation through prediction and its correction. However, the basic computational structure underlying OA is not understood. Here, we adopted a constructive approach, formulated the inference of noxious amplitudes with a Kalman filter model, i.e., a recursive Bayesian computation, and then deduced the computational structure for OA, in which an interaction between two latent state variables was implemented. Simulation results suggested that the unidirectional interaction of the two states with two dissociable roles (an integral over time and a derivative of stimulus changes) is crucial for OA. Our results, combined with previous anatomical studies, suggest a computational basis of neural connectivity for pain. The ACC and aINS interact to compute a descending prediction to the brainstem, i.e. PAG, while ascending inputs are filtered in the thalamus and delivered to the cortices as prediction errors. Thus, we suggest dissociable, computational roles of the ACC and aINS in pain processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Third Somatomotor Representation in the Human Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Seminal neurophysiological studies in the 1940s discovered two somatomotor maps in the cerebellum - an inverted anterior lobe map and an upright posterior lobe map. Both maps have been confirmed in the human using non-invasive neuroimaging with additional hints of a third map near to the cerebellar vermis. Here we sought direct evidence for the third somatomotor map by using intensive, repeated functional MRI (fMRI) scanning of individuals performing movements across multiple body parts (tongue, hands, glutes and feet). An initial discovery sample (N=4, 4 sessions per individual including 576 separate blocks of body movements) yielded evidence for the two established cerebellar somatomotor maps, as well as evidence for a third discontinuous foot representation near to the vermis. When the left versus right foot movements were directly contrasted, the third representation could be clearly distinguished from the second representation in multiple individuals. Functional connectivity from seed regions in the third somatomotor representation confirmed anatomically-specific connectivity with the cortex, paralleling the patterns observed for the two well-established maps. All results were prospectively replicated in an independent dataset with new individuals (N=4). These collective findings provide direct support for a third somatomotor map in the vermis of the cerebellum. We discuss the relations of this candidate third map to the broader topography of the cerebellum as well as its implications for understanding the specific organization of the human cerebellar vermis where distinct zones appear functionally specialized for somatomotor and visual domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisite Test-Retest Reliability and Compatibility of Brain Metrics derived from FreeSurfer Versions 7.1, 6.0, and 5.3</a></h4>

              
                Automatic neuroimaging segmentation and parcellation tools provide convenient and systematic methods for extracting numerous features from brain MRI scans, and are becoming standard practice for large-scale coordinated studies. One such tool, FreeSurfer, provides an easy-to-use pipeline to extract metrics describing cortical and subcortical morphometry. Over the past two decades, there have been over 25 stable releases of FreeSurfer, and different versions are used across published works. Despite this, the reliability and compatibility of metrics derived from the most recent major version releases have yet to be assessed empirically. Here, we use test-retest data from three public brain MRI datasets to assess within-version reliability and between-version compatibility across 42 regional outputs from three versions of FreeSurfer: the latest, v7.1, and two previous stable releases - v5.3, and v6.0. We find v7.1 was less compatible with older versions for measuring cortical thickness. In particular, the thickness of the cingulate gyrus had low compatibility (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between 0.37 and 0.61) between versions. Temporal and frontal poles, and the medial orbitofrontal surface area metrics, also showed low to moderate compatibility with v7.1. While our work compares all three versions, our sub-comparisons between the older versions (v5.3 and v6.0) replicates earlier findings of low compatibility of pallidum and putamen volumes. Low between-version compatibility was not always indicative of low within-version reliability - all versions showed good to excellent reliability across most regional measures (ICC>0.8). Age associations, quality control metrics, and Dice coefficients in an independent sample of 106 individual scans, processed with all three versions of FreeSurfer, revealed differences in results of downstream statistical analysis. As neuroimaging studies adopt more recently released software, we provide researchers with a reference to highlight the regions and metrics that may yield findings inconsistent with published works using older FreeSurfer software. An interactive viewer for the results is provided at http://data.brainescience.org/Freesurfer_Reliability/

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overexpressing eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) proteins to promote corticospinal axon repair after injury</a></h4>

              
                Although protein synthesis is hypothesized to have a pivotal role in axonal repair after central nervous system (CNS) injury, the role of core components of the protein synthesis machinery has not been examined. Notably, some elongation factors possess non-canonical functions that may further impact axonal repair. Here, we examined whether overexpressing eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) proteins enhances the collateral sprouting of corticospinal tract (CST) neurons after unilateral pyramidotomy, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms. Compared with axonal regeneration from injured neurons, axonal sprouting from uninjured neurons occurs spontaneously after injury and may represent a more accessible form of axonal repair for clinical translation. We found that overexpressing eEF1A1, eEF1A2 or both proteins in CST neurons increased the levels of pS6, an indicator for mTOR activity, in neuronal somas. In contrast, the levels of pSTAT3 and pAKT were not increased. Strikingly, overexpressing eEF1A2 alone, but neither eEF1A1 alone nor both factors simultaneously, increased protein synthesis and actin rearrangement in CST neurons. While eEF1A1 overexpression only slightly enhanced CST sprouting across the midline into the denervated side in the cervical spinal after pyramidotomy, eEF1A2 overexpression substantially enhanced this sprouting. Surprisingly, co-overexpression of both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 led to a sprouting phenotype similar to wild-type controls, suggesting an antagonistic effect of overexpressing both proteins. These data provide the first evidence that overexpressing a core component of the translation machinery, eEF1A2, enhances CST sprouting, likely by a combination of increased protein synthesis, mTOR signaling and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.

                To better understand complex human phenotypes, large-scale studies have increasingly collected multiple data modalities across domains such as imaging, mobile health, and physical activity. The properties of each data type often differ substantially and require either separate analyses or extensive processing to obtain comparable features for a combined analysis. Multimodal data fusion enables certain analyses on matrix-valued and vector-valued data, but it generally cannot integrate modalities of different dimensions and data structures. For a single data modality, multivariate distance matrix regression provides a distance-based framework for regression accommodating a wide range of data types. However, no distance-based method exists to handle multiple complementary types of data. We propose a novel distance-based regression model, which we refer to as Similarity-based Multimodal Regression (SiMMR), that enables simultaneous regression of multiple modalities through their distance profiles. We demonstrate through simulation, imaging studies, and longitudinal mobile health analyses that our proposed method can detect associations in multimodal data of differing properties and dimensionalities, even with modest sample sizes. We perform experiments to evaluate several different test statistics and provide recommendations for applying our method across a broad range of scenarios.

                Volumetric functional imaging is widely used for recording neuron activities in vivo, but there exist tradeoffs between the quality of the extracted calcium traces, imaging speed, and laser power. While deep-learning methods have recently been applied to denoise images, their applications to downstream analyses, such as recovering high-SNR calcium traces, have been limited. Further, these methods require temporally-linked pre-registered data with ultrafast rates. Here, we demonstrate supervised deep-denoising methods to circumvent these tradeoffs for several applications, including whole-brain imaging, large field-of-view imaging in freely moving animals, and recovering complex neurite structures in C. elegans. Our framework has 30x smaller memory footprint, and is fast in training and inference (50-70ms); it is highly accurate and generalizable, and further, only small, non-temporally-sequential, independently-acquired training datasets (~500 images) are needed. We envision that the framework will enable faster and long-term imaging experiments necessary to study neuronal mechanisms of many behaviors.

                In real-world decision-making scenarios, negative consequences do not always occur immediately after a choice. This delay between action and outcome drives the underestimation, or delay discounting, of punishment. While the neural substrates underlying sensitivity to immediate punishment have been well-studied, there has been minimal investigation of delayed consequences. Here, we assessed the role of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two regions implicated in cost/benefit decision-making, in sensitivity to delayed vs immediate punishment. The delayed punishment decision-making task (DPDT) was used to measure delay discounting of punishment in rodents. During DPDT, rats choose between a small, single pellet reward and a large, three pellet reward accompanied by a mild foot shock. As the task progresses, the shock is preceded by a delay that systematically increases or decreases throughout the session. We observed that rats avoid choices associated with immediate punishment, then shift preference toward these options when the punishment is delayed. LOFC inactivation did not influence choice of rewards with immediate punishment, but decreased choice of delayed punishment. We also found that BLA inactivation reduced choice of delayed punishment, but this was only evident when punishment was initially delivered immediately after a choice, then preceded by a delay as the task progressed. Therefore, both LOFC and BLA contribute to the delay discounting of punishment, and may serve as promising therapeutic targets to improve sensitivity to delayed punishment during decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-avoidance alone does not explain the function of Dscam1 in mushroom body axonal wiring</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam1 into 38,016 isoforms provides neurons with a unique molecular code for self-recognition and self-avoidance. A canonical model suggests that homophilic binding of identical Dscam1 isoforms on sister branches of mushroom body (MB) axons supports segregation with high fidelity, even when only a single isoform is expressed. Here we generated a series of mutant flies with a single exon 4, 6, or 9 variant, encoding 1,584, 396, or 576 potential isoforms, respectively. Surprisingly, most of the mutants in the latter two groups exhibited obvious defects in the growth, branching, and segregation of MB axonal sister branches. This demonstrates that repertoires of 396 and 576 Dscam1 isoforms were not sufficient for normal patterning of axonal branches. Moreover, reducing Dscam1 levels largely reversed the defects caused by reduced isoform diversity, suggesting a functional link between Dscam1 expression levels and isoform diversity. Taken together, these results indicate that canonical self-avoidance alone does not explain the function of Dscam1 in MB axonal wiring.

                The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) exhibits choice-selective activity during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it is not known how this selective activity arises from the underlying synaptic connectivity. Here, we combined virtual reality behavior, two-photon calcium imaging, high throughput electron microscopy, and circuit modeling to analyze how synaptic connectivity between neurons in PPC relates to their selective activity. We found that excitatory pyramidal neurons preferentially target inhibitory interneurons with the same selectivity. In turn, inhibitory interneurons preferentially target pyramidal neurons with opposite selectivity, forming an opponent inhibition motif. Using circuit models, we show that opponent inhibition amplifies selective inputs and induces competition between neural populations with opposite selectivity, thereby improving the encoding of trial-type information. These results provide evidence for how synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits supports a learned decision-making task.

                Drosophila Dscam1 encodes ten thousand of cell recognition molecules via alternative splicing, which is required for nervous function. However, the underlying mechanism has not fully understood. Here we revealed extensive noncanonical functions of Dscam1 isoform diversity in neuronal wiring. We generated a series of allelic cis mutations in Dscam1, encoding normal number of isoforms albeit with altered isoform composition. Despite normal dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination in da neurons, which is consistent with canonical self-avoidance model, these mutants exhibited strikingly distinct spectra of phenotypic defects in three classes of neurons: up to ~60% defects in mushroom bodies, a significantly increased branching and growth in da neurons, and mild axonal branching defects in mechanosensory neurons. These data suggest that proper Dscam1 isoform composition is required for axon and dendrite growth in diverse neurons. This unprecedented splicing-tuned regulation unlocks new insights into the molecular mechanisms that Dscam1 isoform diversity is engaged in.

                Rationale. Obesity is a major health problem worldwide. An understanding of the factors that drive feeding behaviors is key to the development of pharmaceuticals to decrease appetite and consumption. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the melanocortin peptide precursor, is essential in the regulation of body weight and ingestive behaviors. Deletion of POMC or impairment of melanocortin signaling in the brain results in hyperphagic obesity. Neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus produce POMC and project to many areas including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which is well established in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of both food and drugs of abuse. Objective. These studies sought to determine the role of melanocortins in the NAcc on consumption of and motivation to obtain access to standard rodent chow. Methods. Male, C57BL/6J mice were microinjected bilaterally into the NAcc (100 nl/side) with the melanocortin receptor 3/4 agonist melanotan-II (MT-II; 0.1, 0.3, and 1 nmol), and ingestive behaviors were examined in both home cage and operant food self-administration experiments. In addition, the ability of MT-II in the NAcc to produce aversive properties or affect metabolic rate were tested. Results. MT-II injected into the NAcc significantly decreased consumption in both home cage and operant paradigms, and furthermore decreased appetitive responding to gain access to food. There was no development of conditioned taste avoidance or change in metabolic parameters following anorexic doses of MT-II. Conclusions. MT-II in the NAcc decreased both the motivation to eat and the amount of food consumed without inducing an aversive state or affecting metabolic rate, suggesting a role for melanocortin signaling in the ventral striatum that is selective for appetite and satiety without affecting metabolism or producing an aversive state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coding of reward uncertainty and probability by orexin neurons</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate arousal in our brains critically relies on hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons (HONs). HON activity regulation has been a subject of intense research, uncovering slow responses to nutrients and hormones, and fast responses to external sensory inputs. However, it remains unclear whether HONs also respond to statistical patterns in the environment. Among these, reward probability and uncertainty are fundamental measures of information that enable evaluation of predictions, and guide diverse aspects of cognition such as learning and motivation. Using different cues to denote reward likelihood across the full probability range (0-1) , we found that HON population responses to the reward-predicting cues co-vary with reward uncertainty. Single-cell analyses additionally revealed HON subsets specializing in monotonic representations of probability, as well as cells sharply tuned to uncertainty. Furthermore, simultaneous recordings of HONs and midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) indicated that HONs and DANs diverge in their coding of reward probability, both in responses to reward-predicting cues and to rewards. These results demonstrate previously unseen coding of reward expectation in genetically-defined hypothalamic cells central to clinical conditions and neurobehavioral physiology, and suggest a possible role for HONs in converting reward statistics into arousal-based allocation of cognitive and autonomic resources.

                Popular theories suggest that hallucinations arise through excessive top-down perceptual expectations, whereas others have emphasised the role of spontaneous bottom-up activity. These theories make different predictions about how input and feedback layers in sensory regions contribute to hallucinations. Here, we used layer-specific fMRI to interrogate neural activity underlying hallucinations - high confidence false percepts - and perceptual expectations while healthy participants (N=25) performed a perceptual discrimination task. We found that false percepts were related to stimulus-like activity in the middle input layers of V2. On the other hand, perceptual expectations activated the deep feedback layers of V2, without influencing perception. The prevalence of high confidence false percepts was related to everyday hallucination severity, confirming their ecological validity. These results reveal that hallucinations can arise through spontaneous stimulus-specific activity in the input layers of the visual cortex, independent of top-down perceptual expectations.

                Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) are widespread techniques to measure neural activity in vivo at a high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution. Locating the sources underlying the M/EEG poses an inverse problem, which is itself ill-posed. In recent years, a new class of source imaging methods was developed based on artificial neural networks. We present a long-short term memory (LSTM) network to solve the M/EEG inverse problem. It integrates several aspects essential for qualitative inverse solutions: Low computational cost, exploitation of both spatial and temporal information, input flexibility and robustness to noise. Using simulation data, the LSTM shows higher accuracy on multiple metrics and for varying numbers of neural sources, compared to classical inverse solutions but also compared to our alternative architectures without integration of temporal information. It successfully integrates the temporal context given by sequential data, which is particularly useful with noisy data. Real data of a median nerve stimulation paradigm was used to show that the LSTM predicts plausible sources that are in concordance with classical inverse solutions. The performance of the LSTM regarding its robustness to noise renders it a promising and easy-to-apply inverse solution to be considered in future source localization studies and for clinical applications.

                One of the most prominent and robust findings in cognitive neuroscience is the strengthening of memories during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, with slow oscillations (SOs, < 1Hz) playing a critical role in systems-level consolidation. However, NREM is a sleep period generally showing a breakdown in connectivity and reduction of synaptic plasticity with increasing depth: a brain state seemingly unfavorable to memory consolidation. Here, we present a novel approach to address this apparent paradox that leverages an event-related causality measure to estimate directional information flow during NREM sleep in epochs with and without SOs. Our results confirm that NREM is generally a state of dampened neural communication, but reveals that SOs provide two windows of enhanced large-scale communication before and after the SO trough. These peaks in communication are significantly higher when SOs are coupled with sleep spindles, compared with uncoupled SOs. To probe the functional relevance of these SO-selective peaks of information flow, we tested the temporal and topographic conditions that predict overnight episodic memory improvement. Our results show that global, long-range communication during SOs promote sleep-dependent systems consolidation of episodic memories. A significant correlation between peaks of information flow and memory improvement lends a predictive validity to our measurements of effective connectivity. In other words, we were able to predict memory improvement on the basis of independent electrophysiological observations during sleep. This work introduces a non-invasive approach to understanding information processing during sleep, a behavioral stage whose function, until now, has been understood only after synaptic reorganization after waking from sleep. Our findings provide a mechanism for how systems-level brain communication can occur during an otherwise low connectivity sleep state, indicating that SOs are a gating mechanism for large-scale neural communication, which is the necessary substrate for systems consolidation and long-term memory formation.

                Human and non-human primates produce rhythmical sounds as soon as they are born. These early vocalizations are important for soliciting the attention of caregivers. How they develop, remains a mystery. The orofacial movements necessary for producing these vocalizations have distinct spatiotemporal signatures. Therefore, their development could potentially be tracked over the course of prenatal life. We densely and longitudinally sampled fetal head and orofacial movements in marmoset monkeys using ultrasound imaging. We show that orofacial movements necessary for producing rhythmical vocalizations differentiate from a larger movement pattern that includes the entire head. We also show that signature features of marmoset infant contact calls emerge prenatally as a distinct pattern of orofacial movements. Our results establish that aspects of the sensorimotor development necessary for vocalizing occur prenatally, even before the production of sound.

                A brain template provides a standard space for statistical analysis of brain structure and function. For decades, the T1- and T2-weighted brain templates have been widely used for brain grey matter anatomical and functional analysis. However, T1- and T2-weighted templates provide very limited information about the axonal organization within the white matter. Recent advances in Diffusion MRI have enabled the detailed modelling of the axonal fibre orientation distribution (FOD) in white matter. Therefore, building a FOD template is essential for more robust white matter anatomy related analysis; however, it is important that this template aligns well with the cortical and subcortical structures. From such a FOD template, a tractography template can be also generated by fibre tracking algorithms, which can be used for subsequent applications, such as to perform the joint structural and functional analysis while ensuring rigorous fibre-to-fibre correspondence. In this paper, we explore the potential of generating the FOD template based on multimodal registration, in order to constrain the tempalte unbiased to both white and grey matter. We combine the information from T1-weighted, T2-weighted and Diffusion MRI to generate a coherent transformation for FOD registration and template generation. Our FOD template preserves the structural details at the white-grey matter boundary. To illustrate the benefit of this new approach, the resulting tractography template was used for joint structural-functional connectivity analysis.

                Attention allows us to selectively enhance the processing of specific locations or features in our external environment while simultaneously filtering out momentarily irrelevant information. It is currently hypothesized that this is achieved through the boosting of relevant sensory signals which biases the competition between competing neural representations. Recent neurophysiological and behavioral studies have revealed that attention is a fundamentally rhythmic process, tightly linked to neural oscillations in fronto-parietal networks. Instead of continuously highlighting a single object or location, attention rhythmically alternates between multiple relevant representations at a frequency of 3-6 Hz. However attention can not only be directed towards the external world but also towards internal visual working memory (VWM) representations, e.g. when selecting one of several search templates to find corresponding objects in the external world. Two recent studies have revealed that objects in VWM are attended in a similarly rhythmic fashion as perceived objects. We add to the current literature by showing that retro-cues towards multi-feature gratings in VWM initiate a similar theta-rhythmic competition, modulating reaction times in an anti-phasic manner. Our findings add to the converging body of evidence that external and internal visual representations are accessed by highly similar, rhythmic attentional mechanisms.

	<p>Glial neoplasms are a group of diseases with poor prognoses. Not all risk factors are known, and no screening tests are available. Only histology provides certain diagnosis. As already reported, DNA transported by exosomes can be an excellent source of information shared by cells locally or systemically. These vesicles seem to be one of the main mechanisms of tumor remote intercellular signaling used to induce immune deregulation, apoptosis, and both phenotypic and genotypic modifications. In this study, we evaluated the exosomal DNA (exoDNA) concentration in blood samples of patients affected by cerebral glioma and correlated it with histological and radiological characteristics of tumors. From 14 patients with diagnosed primary or recurrent glioma, we obtained MRI imaging data, histological data, and preoperative blood samples that were used to extract circulating exosomal DNA, which we then quantified. Our results demonstrate a relationship between the amount of circulating exosomal DNA and tumor volume, and mitotic activity. In particular, a high concentration of exoDNA was noted in low-grade gliomas. Our results suggest a possible role of exoDNAs in the diagnosis of brain glioma. They could be particularly useful in detecting early recurrent high-grade gliomas and asymptomatic low-grade gliomas.</p>

	<p>Introduction: PTEN gene mutations are frequently found in the genetic landscape of high-grade gliomas since they influence cell proliferation, proangiogenetic pathways, and antitumoral immune response. The present bioinformatics analysis explores the PTEN gene expression profile in HGGs as a prognostic factor for survival, especially focusing on the related immune microenvironment. The effects of PTEN mutation on the susceptibility to conventional chemotherapy were also investigated. Methods: Clinical and genetic data of GBMs and normal tissue samples were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-GBM and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) online databases, respectively. The genetic differential expressions were analyzed in both groups via the one-way ANOVA test. Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier survival curves were applied to estimate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer platform was chosen to assess the response of PTEN-mutated GBMs to temozolomide (TMZ). p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 was fixed as statistically significant. On Tumor Immune Estimation Resource and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis databases, the linkage between immune cell recruitment and PTEN status was assessed through Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis. Results: PTEN was found mutated in 22.2% of the 617 TCGA-GBMs patients, with a higher log2-transcriptome per million reads compared to the GTEx group (255 samples). Survival curves revealed a worse OS and DFS, albeit not significant, for the high-PTEN profile GBMs. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s analysis of immune cells demonstrated a strong positive correlation between the PTEN status and infiltration of Treg (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.179) and M2 macrophages (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.303). The half-maximal inhibitor concentration of TMZ was proven to be lower for PTEN-mutated GBMs compared with PTEN wild-types. Conclusions: PTEN gene mutations prevail in GBMs and are strongly related to poor prognosis and least survival. The infiltrating immune lymphocytes Treg and M2 macrophages populate the glioma microenvironment and control the mechanisms of tumor progression, immune escape, and sensitivity to standard chemotherapy. Broader studies are required to confirm these findings and turn them into new therapeutic perspectives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping of the Sensory Innervation of the Mouse Lung by Specific Vagal and Dorsal Root Ganglion Neuronal Subsets</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The airways are densely innervated by sensory afferent nerves, whose activation regulates respiration and triggers defensive reflexes (e.g., cough, bronchospasm). Airway innervation is heterogeneous, and distinct afferent subsets have distinct functional responses. However, little is known of the innervation patterns of subsets within the lung. A neuroanatomical map is critical for understanding afferent activation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we quantified the innervation of the mouse lung by vagal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory subsets defined by the expression of Pirt (all afferents), 5HT<SUB>3</SUB> (vagal nodose afferents), Tac1 (tachykinergic afferents), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel (TRPV1; defensive/nociceptive afferents) using Cre-mediated reporter expression. We found that vagal afferents innervate almost all conducting airways and project into the alveolar region, whereas DRG afferents only innervate large airways. Of the two vagal ganglia, only nodose afferents project into the alveolar region, but both nodose and jugular afferents innervate conducting airways throughout the lung. Many afferents that project into the alveolar region express TRPV1. Few DRG afferents expressed TRPV1. Approximately 25% of blood vessels were innervated by vagal afferents (many were Tac1+). Approximately 10% of blood vessels had DRG afferents (some were Tac1+), but this was restricted to large vessels. Lastly, innervation of neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) correlated with the cell number within the bodies. In conclusion, functionally distinct sensory subsets have distinct innervation patterns within the conducting airways, alveoli and blood vessels. Physiologic (e.g., stretch) and pathophysiological (e.g., inflammation, edema) stimuli likely vary throughout these regions. Our data provide a neuroanatomical basis for understanding afferent responses <I>in vivo</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Alpha EEG Activity and Pupil Diameter Coupling during Inactive Wakefulness in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Variations in human behavior correspond to the adaptation of the nervous system to different internal and environmental demands. Attention, a cognitive process for weighing environmental demands, changes over time. Pupillary activity, which is affected by fluctuating levels of cognitive processing, appears to identify neural dynamics that relate to different states of attention. In mice, for example, pupil dynamics directly correlate with brain state fluctuations. Although, in humans, alpha-band activity is associated with inhibitory processes in cortical networks during visual processing, and its amplitude is modulated by attention, conclusive evidence linking this narrowband activity to pupil changes in time remains sparse. We hypothesize that, as alpha activity and pupil diameter indicate attentional variations over time, these two measures should be comodulated. In this work, we recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) and pupillary activity of 16 human subjects who had their eyes fixed on a gray screen for 1 min. Our study revealed that the alpha-band amplitude and the high-frequency component of the pupil diameter covariate spontaneously. Specifically, the maximum alpha-band amplitude was observed to occur ~300 ms before the peak of the pupil diameter. In contrast, the minimum alpha-band amplitude was noted to occur ~350 ms before the trough of the pupil diameter. The consistent temporal coincidence of these two measurements strongly suggests that the subject&rsquo;s state of attention, as indicated by the EEG alpha amplitude, is changing moment to moment and can be monitored by measuring EEG together with the diameter pupil.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cooperative Behavior Evokes Interbrain Synchrony in the Prefrontal and Temporoparietal Cortex: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of fNIRS Hyperscanning Studies</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Single-brain neuroimaging studies have shown that human cooperation is associated with neural activity in frontal and temporoparietal regions. However, it remains unclear whether single-brain studies are informative about cooperation in real life, where people interact dynamically. Such dynamic interactions have become the focus of interbrain studies. An advantageous technique in this regard is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because it is less susceptible to movement artifacts than more conventional techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We conducted a systematic review and the first quantitative meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning of cooperation, based on thirteen studies with 890 human participants. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed evidence of statistically significant interbrain synchrony while people were cooperating, with large overall effect sizes in both frontal and temporoparietal areas. All thirteen studies observed significant interbrain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that this region is particularly relevant for cooperative behavior. The consistency in these findings is unlikely to be because of task-related activations, given that the relevant studies used diverse cooperation tasks. Together, the present findings support the importance of interbrain synchronization of frontal and temporoparietal regions in interpersonal cooperation. Moreover, the present article highlights the usefulness of meta-analyses as a tool for discerning patterns in interbrain dynamics.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent (CI) neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, CI neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. CI cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic CI neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">White-Matter Integrity and Working Memory: Links to Aging and Dopamine-Related Genes</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Working memory, a core function underlying many higher-level cognitive processes, requires cooperation of multiple brain regions. White matter refers to myelinated axons, which are critical to interregional brain communication. Past studies on the association between white-matter integrity and working memory have yielded mixed findings. Using voxelwise tract-based spatial statistics analysis, we investigated this relationship in a sample of 328 healthy adults from 25 to 80 years of age. Given the important role of dopamine (DA) in working-memory functioning and white matter, we also analyzed the effects of dopamine-related genes on them. There were associations between white-matter integrity and working memory in multiple tracts, indicating that working-memory functioning relies on global connections between different brain areas across the adult life span. Moreover, a mediation analysis suggested that white-matter integrity contributes to age-related differences in working memory. Finally, there was an effect of the <I>COMT</I> Val158Met polymorphism on white-matter integrity, such that Val/Val carriers had lower fractional anisotropy values than any Met carriers in the internal capsule, corona radiata, and posterior thalamic radiation. As this polymorphism has been associated with dopaminergic tone in the prefrontal cortex, this result provides evidence for a link between DA neurotransmission and white matter. Together, the results support a link between white-matter integrity and working memory, and provide evidence for its interplay with age- and DA-related genes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Hyaluronic Acid in Skeletal Muscle Induces Decreased Voluntary Activity via Chemosensitive Muscle Afferent Sensitization in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>PEGPH20, a human recombinant hyaluronidase, has been proposed as a coadjutant to pancreatic cancer chemotherapy. In early trials, patients reported increased widespread muscle pain as the main adverse reaction to PEGPH20. To understand how PEGPH20 caused musculoskeletal pain, we systemically administered PEGPH20 to male mice and measured voluntary wheel activity and pain-related behaviors. These were paired with <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiology of primary sensory neurons, whole DRG real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry of hindpaw muscle. PEGPH20 induced significantly lower wheel running, compared with vehicle-treated animals, and decreased mechanical withdrawal thresholds 5 d after PEGPH20 injections. Chemo-sensory muscle afferents showed increased responses to noxious chemical stimulation of their receptive fields (RFs) in the PEGPH20-treated group. This was correlated with upregulation of the NGF receptor TrkA, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel and ATP-sensitive channel P2X3 in the DRG. Immunohistochemistry of hindpaw muscles revealed damage to the muscle architecture and extensive infiltration of the tissue by cells of the myelomonocytic lineage 3 d after PEGPH20 injection. Peripheral macrophage ablation in macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (MaFIA) mice, however, did not prevent the decreased voluntary activity and instead caused even lower levels of running. These results suggest that disruption of hyaluronic acid (HA) within the muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) sensitizes chemo-nociceptive muscle afferents possibly leading to altered pain-like behaviors. Ablation experiments suggest macrophages are necessary for adequate recovery of voluntary activity after HA disruption. These data support a role for HA and macrophages in tissue integrity and muscle pain development in patients taking PEGPH20.</p>

                <p>The NMDA subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in both physiological and pathologic processes in the brain. Compared with their critical roles in synaptic modifications and excitotoxicity in excitatory neurons, much less is understood about the functional contributions of NMDARs to the inhibitory GABAergic neurons. By using selective NMDAR inhibitors and potentiators, we here show that NMDARs bidirectionally modulate the intrinsic excitability (defined as spontaneous/evoked spiking activity and EPSP-spike coupling) in inhibitory GABAergic neurons in adult male and female mice. This modulation depends on GluN2C/2D- but not GluN2A/2B-containing NMDARs. We further show that NMDAR modulator EU1794-4 mostly enhances extrasynaptic NMDAR activity, and by using it we demonstrate a significant contribution of extrasynaptic NMDARs to the modulation of intrinsic excitability in inhibitory neurons. Together, this bidirectional modulation of intrinsic excitability reveals a previously less appreciated importance of NMDARs in the second-to-second functioning of inhibitory GABAergic neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) have important roles in brain functions, including both physiological and pathologic ones. The role of NMDARs in inhibitory neurons has been less elucidated compared with that in excitatory neurons. Our results demonstrate the importance of GluN2C/GluN2D-containing but not GluN2A/GluN2B-containing extrasynaptic NMDARs in modulating the intrinsic excitability of inhibitory neurons. These results further suggest distinct contributions of subsynaptic locations and subunit compositions of NMDARs to their functions in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The above findings have implications for better understanding of brain diseases, such as schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CLC Anion/Proton Exchangers Regulate Secretory Vesicle Filling and Granule Exocytosis in Chromaffin Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 are electrogenic chloride/proton exchangers that can be found in endosomal compartments of mammalian cells. Although the association with genetic diseases and the severe phenotype of knock-out animals illustrate their physiological importance, the cellular functions of these proteins have remained insufficiently understood. We here study the role of two <I>Clcn3</I> splice variants, ClC-3b and ClC-3c, in granular exocytosis and catecholamine accumulation of adrenal chromaffin cells using a combination of high-resolution capacitance measurements, amperometry, protein expression/gene knock out/down, rescue experiments, and confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that ClC-3c resides in immature as well as in mature secretory granules, where it regulates catecholamine accumulation and contributes to the establishment of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles. The lysosomal splice variant ClC-3b contributes to vesicle priming only with low efficiency and leaves the vesicular catecholamine content unaltered. The related Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter ClC-5 undergoes age-dependent downregulation in wild-type conditions. Its upregulation in <I>Clcn3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cells partially rescues the exocytotic mutant defect. Our study demonstrates how different CLC transporters with similar transport functions, but distinct localizations can contribute to vesicle functions in the regulated secretory pathway of granule secretion in chromaffin cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers are expressed along the endosomal/lysosomal system of mammalian cells; however, their exact subcellular functions have remained insufficiently understood. We used chromaffin cells, a system extensively used to understand presynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission, to define the role of CLC exchangers in neurosecretion. Disruption of ClC-3 impairs catecholamine accumulation and secretory vesicle priming. There are multiple ClC-3 splice variants, and only expression of one, ClC-3c, in double Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger-deficient cells fully rescues the WT phenotype. Another splice variant, ClC-3b, is present in lysosomes and is not necessary for catecholamine secretion. The distinct functions of ClC-3c and ClC-3b illustrate the impact of expressing multiple CLC transporters with similar transport functions and separate localizations in different endosomal compartments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Suppressing CSPG/LAR/PTP{sigma} Axis Facilitates Neuronal Replacement and Synaptogenesis by Human Neural Precursor Grafts and Improves Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a leading cause of permanent neurologic disabilities in young adults. Functional impairments after SCI are substantially attributed to the progressive neurodegeneration. However, regeneration of spinal-specific neurons and circuit re-assembly remain challenging in the dysregulated milieu of SCI because of impaired neurogenesis and neuronal maturation by neural precursor cells (NPCs) spontaneously or in cell-based strategies. The extrinsic mechanisms that regulate neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis in SCI are poorly understood. Here, we perform extensive <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> studies to unravel that SCI-induced upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) impedes neurogenesis of NPCs through co-activation of two receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases, LAR and PTP. In adult female rats with SCI, systemic co-inhibition of LAR and PTP promotes regeneration of motoneurons and spinal interneurons by engrafted human directly reprogramed caudalized NPCs (drNPC-O2) and fosters their morphologic maturity and synaptic connectivity within the host neural network that culminate in improved recovery of locomotion and sensorimotor integration. Our transcriptomic analysis of engrafted human NPCs in the injured spinal cord confirmed that inhibition of CSPG receptors activates a comprehensive program of gene expression in NPCs that can support neuronal differentiation, maturation, morphologic complexity, signal transmission, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral improvement after SCI. We uncovered that CSPG/LAR/PTP axis suppresses neuronal differentiation in part by blocking Wnt/&beta;-Catenin pathway. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that CSPGs/LAR/PTP axis restricts neurogenesis and synaptic integration of new neurons in NPC cellular therapies for SCI. We propose targeting LAR and PTP receptors offers a promising clinically-feasible adjunct treatment to optimize the efficacy and neurologic benefits of ongoing NPC-based clinical trials for SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is a promising approach for replacing damaged neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, survival, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic connectivity of transplanted NPCs within remain challenging in SCI. Here, we unravel that activation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)/LAR/PTP axis after SCI impedes the capacity of transplanted human NPCs for replacing functionally integrated neurons. Co-blockade of LAR and PTP is sufficient to promote re-generation of motoneurons and spinal V1 and V3 interneurons by engrafted human caudalized directly reprogramed NPCs (drNPC-O2) and facilitate their synaptic integration within the injured spinal cord. CSPG/LAR/PTP axis appears to suppress neuronal differentiation of NPCs by inhibiting Wnt/&beta;-Catenin pathway. These findings identify targeting CSPG/LAR/PTP axis as a promising strategy for optimizing neuronal replacement, synaptic re-connectivity, and neurologic recovery in NPC-based strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Weighting of V1 Spikes Revealed by Optogenetic White Noise Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>During visually guided behaviors, mere hundreds of milliseconds can elapse between a sensory input and its associated behavioral response. How spikes occurring at different times are integrated to drive perception and action remains poorly understood. We delivered random trains of optogenetic stimulation (white noise) to excite inhibitory interneurons in V1 of mice of both sexes while they performed a visual detection task. We then performed a reverse correlation analysis on the optogenetic stimuli to generate a neuronal-behavioral kernel, an unbiased, temporally precise estimate of how suppression of V1 spiking at different moments around the onset of a visual stimulus affects detection of that stimulus. Electrophysiological recordings enabled us to capture the effects of optogenetic stimuli on V1 responsivity and revealed that the earliest stimulus-evoked spikes are preferentially weighted for guiding behavior. These data demonstrate that white noise optogenetic stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding how patterns of spiking in neuronal populations are decoded in generating perception and action.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During visually guided actions, continuous chains of neurons connect our retinas to our motoneurons. To unravel circuit contributions to behavior, it is crucial to establish the relative functional position(s) that different neural structures occupy in processing and relaying the signals that support rapid, precise responses. To address this question, we randomly inhibited activity in mouse V1 throughout the stimulus-response cycle while the animals did many repetitions of a visual task. The period that led to impaired performance corresponded to the earliest stimulus-driven response in V1, with no effect of inhibition immediately before or during late stages of the stimulus-driven response. This approach offers experimenters a powerful method for uncovering the temporal weighting of spikes from stimulus to response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale Computer Model of the Spinal Dorsal Horn Reveals Changes in Network Processing Associated with Chronic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain-related sensory input is processed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) before being relayed to the brain. That processing profoundly influences whether stimuli are correctly or incorrectly perceived as painful. Significant advances have been made in identifying the types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that comprise the SDH, and there is some information about how neuron types are connected, but it remains unclear how the overall circuit processes sensory input or how that processing is disrupted under chronic pain conditions. To explore SDH function, we developed a computational model of the circuit that is tightly constrained by experimental data. Our model comprises conductance-based neuron models that reproduce the characteristic firing patterns of spinal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, defined by their expression of genetic markers, spiking pattern, or morphology, were synaptically connected according to available qualitative data. Using a genetic algorithm, synaptic weights were tuned to reproduce projection neuron firing rates (model output) based on primary afferent firing rates (model input) across a range of mechanical stimulus intensities. Disparate synaptic weight combinations could produce equivalent circuit function, revealing degeneracy that may underlie heterogeneous responses of different circuits to perturbations or pathologic insults. To validate our model, we verified that it responded to the reduction of inhibition (i.e., disinhibition) and ablation of specific neuron types in a manner consistent with experiments. Thus validated, our model offers a valuable resource for interpreting experimental results and testing hypotheses <I>in silico</I> to plan experiments for examining normal and pathologic SDH circuit function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We developed a multiscale computer model of the posterior part of spinal cord gray matter (spinal dorsal horn), which is involved in perceiving touch and pain. The model reproduces several experimental observations and makes predictions about how specific types of spinal neurons and synapses influence projection neurons that send information to the brain. Misfiring of these projection neurons can produce anomalous sensations associated with chronic pain. Our computer model will not only assist in planning future experiments, but will also be useful for developing new pharmacotherapy for chronic pain disorders, connecting the effect of drugs acting at the molecular scale with emergent properties of neurons and circuits that shape the pain experience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Both Corticospinal and Reticulospinal Tracts Control Force of Contraction</a></h4>

              
                <p>The control of contraction strength is a key part of movement control. In primates, both corticospinal and reticulospinal cells provide input to motoneurons. Corticospinal discharge is known to correlate with force, but there are no previous reports of how reticular formation (RF) activity modulates with different contractions. Here we trained two female macaque monkeys (body weight, 5.9&ndash;6.9 kg) to pull a handle that could be loaded with 0.5&ndash;6 kg weights and recorded from identified pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in primary motor cortex and RF cells during task performance. Population-averaged firing rate increased monotonically with higher force for the RF, but showed a complex profile with little net modulation for PTNs. This reflected a more heterogeneous profile of rate modulation across the PTN population, leading to cancellation in the average. Linear discriminant analysis classified the force based on the time course of rate modulation equally well for PTNs and RF cells. Peak firing rate had significant linear correlation with force for 43 of 92 PTNs (46.7%) and 21 of 46 RF cells (43.5%). For almost all RF cells (20 of 21), the correlation coefficient was positive; similar numbers of PTNs (22 vs 21) had positive versus negative coefficients. Considering the timing of force representation, similar fractions (PTNs: 61.2%; RF cells: 55.5%) commenced coding before the onset of muscle activity. We conclude that both corticospinal and reticulospinal tracts contribute to the control of contraction force; the reticulospinal tract seems to specify an overall signal simply related to force, whereas corticospinal cell activity would be better suited for fine-scale adjustments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For the first time, we compare the coding of force for corticospinal and reticular formation cells in awake behaving monkeys, over a wide range of contraction strengths likely to come close to maximum voluntary contraction. Both cortical and brainstem systems coded similarly well for force, but whereas reticular formation cells carried a simple uniform signal, corticospinal neurons were more heterogeneous. This may reflect a role in the gross specification of a coordinated movement, versus more fine-grained adjustments around individual joints.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Separate Functional Subnetworks of Excitatory Neurons Show Preference to Periodic and Random Sound Structures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Auditory cortex (ACX) neurons are sensitive to spectro-temporal sound patterns and violations in patterns induced by rare stimuli embedded within streams of sounds. We investigate the auditory cortical representation of repeated presentations of sequences of sounds with standard stimuli (common) with an embedded deviant (rare) stimulus in two conditions, Periodic (Fixed deviant position) or Random (Random deviant position). We used extracellular single-unit and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings in layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse (<I>Mus musculus</I>) ACX of either sex. Population single-unit average responses increased over repetitions in the Random condition and were suppressed or did not change in the Periodic condition, showing general irregularity preference. A subset of neurons showed the opposite behavior, indicating regularity preference. Furthermore, pairwise noise correlations were higher in the Random condition than in the Periodic condition, suggesting a role of recurrent connections in the observed differential adaptation. Functional two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that excitatory (EX), and inhibitory (IN) neurons [parvalbumin-positive (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SOM)] also had different categories of long-term adaptation as observed with single-units. However, examination of functional connectivity between pairs of neurons of different categories showed that EX-PV connected pairs behaved opposite to the EX-EX and EX-SOM pairs, with more connections outside category in Random condition than Periodic condition. Finally, considering Regularity, Irregularity, and no preference of connected pairs of neurons showed that EX-EX and EX-SOM pairs were in largely separate functional subnetworks with different preferences, not EX-PV pairs. Thus, separate subnetworks underlie coding of periodic and random sound sequences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Studying how the auditory cortex (ACX) neurons respond to streams of sound sequences help us understand the importance of changes in dynamic acoustic noisy scenes around us. Humans and animals are sensitive to regularity and its violations in sound sequences. Psychophysical tasks in humans show that the auditory brain differentially responds to Periodic and Random structures, independent of the listener's attentional states. Here, we show that mouse ACX L2/3 neurons detect changes and respond differently to patterns over long-time scales. The differential functional connectivity profile obtained in response to two different sound contexts suggests the vital role of recurrent connections in the auditory cortical network. Furthermore, the excitatory-inhibitory neuronal interactions can contribute to detecting the changing sound patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">High Fidelity Theta Phase Rolling of CA1 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Single hippocampal cells encode the spatial position of an animal by increasing their firing rates within "place fields," and by shifting the phase of their spikes to earlier phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (theta phase precession). Whether other forms of spatial phase changes exist in the hippocampus is unknown. Here, we used high-density electrophysiological recordings in mice of either sex running back and forth on a 150-cm linear track. We found that the instantaneous phase of spikes shifts to progressively later theta phases as the animal traverses the place field. We term this shift theta "phase rolling." Phase rolling is opposite in direction to precession, faster than precession, and occurs between distinct theta cycles. Place fields that exhibit phase rolling are larger than nonrolling fields, and in-field spikes occur in distinct theta phases in rolling compared with nonrolling fields. As a phase change associated with position, theta phase rolling may be used to encode space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Theta phase precession is a well-known coding scheme in which neurons represent the position of the animal by the timing of their spikes with respect to the phase of ongoing theta oscillations. Here, we show that hippocampal neurons also undergo "theta phase rolling," a phase change faster and opposite in direction to precession. As the animal advances in space, spikes occur at progressively later phases of consecutive theta cycles. Future studies may reveal whether phase rolling constitutes a novel coding mechanism of space.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Causal Evidence for the Multiple Demand Network in Change Detection: Auditory Mismatch Magnetoencephalography across Focal Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>The multiple demand (MD) system is a network of fronto-parietal brain regions active during the organization and control of diverse cognitive operations. It has been argued that this activation may be a nonspecific signal of task difficulty. However, here we provide convergent evidence for a causal role for the MD network in the "simple task" of automatic auditory change detection, through the impairment of top-down control mechanisms. We employ independent structure-function mapping, dynamic causal modeling (DCM), and frequency-resolved functional connectivity analyses of MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 75 mixed-sex human patients across four neurodegenerative syndromes [behavioral variant fronto-temporal dementia (bvFTD), nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and Alzheimer's disease mild cognitive impairment with positive amyloid imaging (ADMCI)] and 48 age-matched controls. We show that atrophy of any MD node is sufficient to impair auditory neurophysiological response to change in frequency, location, intensity, continuity, or duration. There was no similar association with atrophy of the cingulo-opercular, salience or language networks, or with global atrophy. MD regions displayed increased functional but decreased effective connectivity as a function of neurodegeneration, suggesting partially effective compensation. Overall, we show that damage to any of the nodes of the MD network is sufficient to impair top-down control of sensation, providing a common mechanism for impaired change detection across dementia syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous evidence for fronto-parietal networks controlling perception is largely associative and may be confounded by task difficulty. Here, we use a preattentive measure of automatic auditory change detection [mismatch negativity (MMN) magnetoencephalography (MEG)] to show that neurodegeneration in any frontal or parietal multiple demand (MD) node impairs primary auditory cortex (A1) neurophysiological response to change through top-down mechanisms. This explains why the impaired ability to respond to change is a core feature across dementias, and other conditions driven by brain network dysfunction, such as schizophrenia. It validates theoretical frameworks in which neurodegenerating networks upregulate connectivity as partially effective compensation. The significance extends beyond network science and dementia, in its construct validation of dynamic causal modeling (DCM), and human confirmation of frequency-resolved analyses of animal neurodegeneration models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Minimal Phrase Composition Revealed by Intracranial Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to comprehend phrases is an essential integrative property of the brain. Here, we evaluate the neural processes that enable the transition from single-word processing to a minimal compositional scheme. Previous research has reported conflicting timing effects of composition, and disagreement persists with respect to inferior frontal and posterior temporal contributions. To address these issues, 19 patients (10 male, 9 female) implanted with penetrating depth or surface subdural intracranial electrodes, heard auditory recordings of adjective-noun, pseudoword-noun, and adjective-pseudoword phrases and judged whether the phrase matched a picture. Stimulus-dependent alterations in broadband gamma activity, low-frequency power, and phase-locking values across the language-dominant left hemisphere were derived. This revealed a mosaic located on the lower bank of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), in which closely neighboring cortical sites displayed exclusive sensitivity to either lexicality or phrase structure, but not both. Distinct timings were found for effects of phrase composition (210&ndash;300 ms) and pseudoword processing (~300&ndash;700 ms), and these were localized to neighboring electrodes in pSTS. The pars triangularis and temporal pole encoded anticipation of composition in broadband low frequencies, and both regions exhibited greater functional connectivity with pSTS during phrase composition. Our results suggest that the pSTS is a highly specialized region composed of sparsely interwoven heterogeneous constituents that encodes both lower and higher level linguistic features. This hub in pSTS for minimal phrase processing may form the neural basis for the human-specific computational capacity for forming hierarchically organized linguistic structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Linguists have claimed that the integration of multiple words into a phrase demands a computational procedure distinct from single-word processing. Here, we provide intracranial recordings from a large patient cohort, with high spatiotemporal resolution, to track the cortical dynamics of phrase composition. Epileptic patients volunteered to participate in a task in which they listened to phrases (red boat), word-pseudoword or pseudoword-word pairs (e.g., red fulg). At the onset of the second word in phrases, greater broadband high gamma activity was found in posterior superior temporal sulcus in electrodes that exclusively indexed phrasal meaning and not lexical meaning. These results provide direct, high-resolution signatures of minimal phrase composition in humans, a potentially species-specific computational capacity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lateralized and Region-Specific Thalamic Processing of Lexical Status during Reading Aloud</a></h4>

              
                <p>To explore whether the thalamus participates in lexical status (word vs nonword) processing during spoken word production, we recorded local field potentials from the ventral lateral thalamus in 11 essential tremor patients (three females) undergoing thalamic deep-brain stimulation lead implantation during a visually cued word and nonword reading-aloud task. We observed task-related beta (12&ndash;30 Hz) activity decreases that were preferentially time locked to stimulus presentation, and broadband gamma (70&ndash;150 Hz) activity increases, which are thought to index increased multiunit spiking activity, occurring shortly before and predominantly time locked to speech onset. We further found that thalamic beta activity decreases bilaterally were greater when nonwords were read, demonstrating bilateral sensitivity to lexical status that likely reflects the tracking of task effort; in contrast, greater nonword-related increases in broadband gamma activity were observed only on the left, demonstrating lateralization of thalamic broadband gamma selectivity for lexical status. In addition, this lateralized lexicality effect on broadband gamma activity was strongest in more anterior thalamic locations, regions which are more likely to receive basal ganglia than cerebellar afferents and have extensive connections with prefrontal cortex including Brodmann's areas 44 and 45, regions consistently associated with grapheme-to-phoneme conversions. These results demonstrate active thalamic participation in reading aloud and provide direct evidence from intracranial thalamic recordings for the lateralization and topography of subcortical lexical status processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the corticocentric focus of most experimental work and accompanying models, there is increasing recognition of the role of subcortical structures in speech and language. Using local field potential recordings in neurosurgical patients, we demonstrated that the thalamus participates in lexical status (word vs nonword) processing during spoken word production, in a lateralized and region-specific manner. These results provide direct evidence from intracranial thalamic recordings for the lateralization and topography of subcortical lexical status processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subregions of DLPFC Display Graded yet Distinct Structural and Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; approximately corresponding to Brodmann areas 9 and 46) has demonstrable roles in diverse executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether this is the result of one functionally homogeneous region or whether there are functional subdivisions within the DLPFC. Here, we divided the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically and explored their respective patterns of structural and functional connectivity. In vivo probabilistic tractography (11 females and 13 males) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; 57 females and 21 males) were employed to map out the patterns of connectivity from each DLPFC subregion. Structural connectivity demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of structural connectivity between the DLPFC subregions and other cortical areas revealed that the dorsal-rostral subregions connections were restricted to other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, parietal, and limbic cortex. Functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other. The dorsal subregions were associated with the default mode network (DMN), while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the multiple demand network (MDN). The ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that the connectivity of the DLPFC may be subdivided along a dorsorostral-ventrocaudal axis with differing (albeit graded) patterns of connectivity reflecting the integrative executive function of the DLPFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research has shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a role in various executive functions. By dividing the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically, we explored their patterns of structural and functional connectivity. The patterns of connectivity within DLPFC subregions demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity. There were distinctive patterns of connectivity with other cortical areas in dorsal-rostral and ventral-caudal DLPFC subregions. Divisions across DLPFC subregions seem to align with their structural and functional connectivity. Our results suggest that DLPFC may be subdivided by the diagonal axis of the dorsal-ventral axis and rostral-caudal axis, supporting the framework of a functional organization along the anterior-posterior axis in the lateral PFC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Patient-Derived Anti-NMDAR Antibody Disinhibits Cortical Neuronal Networks through Dysfunction of Inhibitory Neuron Output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder associated with autoantibodies against NMDARs, which cause a variety of symptoms from prominent psychiatric and cognitive manifestations to seizures and autonomic instability. Previous studies mainly focused on hippocampal effects of these autoantibodies, helping to explain mechanistic causes for cognitive impairment. However, antibodies' effects on higher cortical network function, where they could contribute to psychosis and/or seizures, have not been explored in detail until now. Here, we employed a patient-derived monoclonal antibody targeting the NR1 subunit of NMDAR and tested its effects on <I>in vitro</I> cultures of rodent cortical neurons, using imaging and electrophysiological techniques. We report that this hNR1 antibody drives cortical networks to a hyperexcitable state and disrupts mechanisms stabilizing network activity such as Npas4 signaling. Network hyperactivity is in part a result of a reduced synaptic output of inhibitory neurons, as indicated by a decreased inhibitory drive and levels of presynaptic inhibitory proteins, specifically in inhibitory-to-excitatory neuron synapses. Importantly, on a single-cell level hNR1 antibody selectively impairs NMDAR-mediated currents and synaptic transmission of cortical inhibitory neurons, yet has no effect on excitatory neurons, which contrasts with its effects on hippocampal neurons. Together, these findings provide a novel, cortex-specific mechanism of antibody-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, highlighting regional specificity underlying the pathology of autoimmune encephalitis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is increasingly appreciated that the inadvertent activation of the immune system within CNS can underlie pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms remain elusive, autoantibodies derived from patients with autoimmune encephalitis pose a unique tool to study pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric states. Our analysis reveals that autoantibody against the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) has a distinct mechanism of action in the cortex, where it impairs function of inhibitory neurons leading to increased cortical network excitability, in contrast to previously described hippocampal synaptic mechanisms of information encoding, highlighting brain regional specificity. Notably, similar mechanism of NMDAR-mediated inhibitory hypofunction leading to cortical disinhibition has been suggested to underlie pathology of schizophrenia, hence our data provide new evidence for common mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Activation of Pain Circuitry Neuron Populations in a Mouse Model of Spinal Cord Injury-Induced Neuropathic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropathic pain (NP) is one of the most common and debilitating comorbidities of spinal cord injury (SCI). Current therapies are often ineffective due in part to an incomplete understanding of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, it remains unclear how SCI leads to dysfunction in the excitability of nociceptive circuitry. The immediate early gene c-Fos has long been used in pain processing locations as a marker of neuronal activation. We employed a mouse reporter line with fos-promoter driven Cre-recombinase to define neuronal activity changes in relevant pain circuitry locations following cervical spinal cord level (C)5/6 contusion (using both females and males), a SCI model that results in multiple forms of persistent NP-related behavior. SCI significantly increased activation of cervical dorsal horn (DH) projection neurons, as well as induced a selective reduction in the activation of a specific DH projection neuron subpopulation that innervates the periaqueductal gray (PAG), an important brain region involved in descending inhibitory modulation of DH pain transmission. SCI also increased the activation of both protein kinase C (PKC) and calretinin excitatory DH interneuron populations. Interestingly, SCI promoted a significant decrease in the activation selectively of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing inhibitory interneurons of cervical DH. In addition, SCI altered activation of various supraspinal neuron populations associated with pain processing, including a large increase in thalamus and a significant decrease in PAG. These findings reveal a complex and diverse set of SCI-induced neuron activity changes across the pain circuitry neuraxis. Moving forward, these results can be used to inform therapeutic targeting of defined neuronal populations in NP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuropathic pain (NP) is one of the most common and highly debilitating comorbidities of spinal cord injury (SCI). Unfortunately, current therapies are often ineffective due in part to an incomplete understanding of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, it remains unclear how SCI leads to dysfunction in excitability of nociceptive circuitry. Using a FosTRAP2 reporter mouse line in a model of SCI-induced NP, we show SCI alters activation of a number of important interneuron and projection neuron populations across relevant spinal cord and brain locations of the pain circuitry neuraxis. These data suggest a role for maladaptive plasticity involving specific subpopulations of neurons and circuits in driving SCI-induced chronic pain. Moving forward, these results can be used to inform therapeutic targeting of defined neuronal populations in NP.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The diversity of the diprotodontids provides an excellent opportunity to study how a basic marsupial cortical plan has been modified for the needs of the mammals living in different habitats. Very little is known about the connections of the cerebral cortex with the deep brain structures (basal ganglia and thalamus) in this evolutionarily significant group of mammals. In this study, we performed mapping of brain regions and connections in a diprotodontid marsupial from data obtained from an excised brain scanned in high-field (9.4 T) microstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument. The analysis was based on two MRI methodologies. First, high-resolution structural scans were used to map MRI visible brain regions from T1w and T2w images. Second, extensive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were obtained to elucidate connectivity between brain areas using deterministic diffusion tracking of neuronal brain fibers. From the data, we were able to identify corticostriate connections between the frontal association and dorsomedial isocortex and the head of the caudate, and between the lateral somatosensory cortex and the putamen. We were also able to follow the olfactory and limbic connections by tracing fibers in the fornix, cingulum, intrabulbar part of the anterior commissure, and lateral olfactory tract. There was segregation of fibers in the anterior commissure such that olfactory connections passed through the rostroventral part and successively more dorsal cortical areas connected through more dorsal parts of the commissure. Our findings confirm a common pattern of cortical connectivity in therian mammals, even where brain expansion has occurred independently in diverse groups.</p>

<p>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuronal network (magenta) grows in complexity with the developing honey bee brain. Numbers of PDF neurons in the honey bee brain are displayed along with the developmental stage of the honey bee.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) plays a prominent role in the circadian clock of many insects including honey bees. In the honey bee brain, PDF is expressed in about 15 clock neurons per hemisphere that lie between the central brain and the optic lobes. As in other insects, the bee PDF neurons form wide arborizations in the brain, but certain differences are evident. For example, they arborize only sparsely in the accessory medulla (AME), which serves as important communication center of the circadian clock in cockroaches and flies. Furthermore, all bee PDF neurons cluster together, which makes it impossible to distinguish individual projections. Here, we investigated the developing bee PDF network and found that the first three PDF neurons arise in the third larval instar and form a dense network of varicose fibers at the base of the developing medulla that strongly resembles the AME of hemimetabolous insects. In addition, they send faint fibers toward the lateral superior protocerebrum. In last larval instar, PDF cells with larger somata appear and send fibers toward the distal medulla and the medial protocerebrum. In the dorsal part of the medulla serpentine layer, a small PDF knot evolves from which PDF fibers extend ventrally. This knot disappears during metamorphosis and the varicose arborizations in the putative AME become fainter. Instead, a new strongly stained PDF fiber hub appears in front of the lobula. Simultaneously, the number of PDF neurons increases and the PDF neuronal network in the brain gets continuously more complex.</p>

<p>The picture illustrates a boar fetus 2 weeks before birth and its highly gyrated brain. A representative coronal section through one hemisphere indicates regions of interest for assessing, in the laminar compartments, the changes in morphology and cell density. Microglia cells reach adult-like cell density and morphology well before birth. Cells interact with neuronal somata and axon initial segments by late midgestation. Depending on the laminar compartment, microglia cells represent 7–12% of all cortical cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Knowledge on cortical development is based mainly on rodents besides primates and carnivores, all being altricial. Here, we analyzed a precocial animal, the pig, looking at dorsoparietal cortex from E45 to P90. At E45, most ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive (Iba1+) cells had a macrophage-like morphology and resided in meninges and choroid plexus. Only a few cells were scattered in the ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ and SVZ). At E60/E70, all laminar compartments displayed microglia cells at a low-to-moderate density, being highest in VZ and SVZ followed by intermediate zone/white matter (IZ/WM). The cortical plate and marginal zone displayed only a few Iba1+ cells. Cells were intensely labeled, but still had poorly arborized somata and many resembled ameboid, macrophage-like microglia. Concurrent with a massive increase in cortical volume, microglia cell density increased until E85, and further until E100/E110 (birth at E114) to densities that resemble those seen postnatally. A fraction of microglia colabeled with Ki67 suggesting proliferation in all laminar compartments. Cell-to-cell distance decreased substantially during this time, and the fraction of microglia to all nuclei and to neurons increases in the laminar compartments. Eventually, of all cortical DAPI+ nuclei 7–12% were Iba1+ microglia. From E70 onwards, more and more cells with ramified processes were present in MZ down to IZ/WM, showing, for instance, a close association with NeuN+, NPY+, and GAD65/67+ somata and axon initial segments. These results suggested that the development of microglia cell density and morphology proceeds rapidly from mid-gestation onwards reaching near-adult status already before birth.</p>

<p>The interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) innervations reaches their targets via dorsal rami, not via intercostal nerves (aka ventral rami).</p>
<p>Dorsal rami 1–5 represent sympathetic chain ganglia inputs (stellate ganglion to T5).</p>
<p>Fine nerves branch off each dorsal ramus to enter the iBAT for innervation, while dorsal rami continue to innervate additional dorsal structures like the skin.</p>
<p>Brown adipocytes (BA) are densely innervated by axonal varicosities that form neuro-adipocyte junctions, while white adipocytes show sparse innervation in mouse and human adipose tissues.</p>
<p>Core iBAT innervation density remains unchanged by cold exposure, but increases in white adipose tissue mainly within beige islands.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) is under sympathetic control, and recent studies emphasized the importance of efferent sympathetic and afferent sensory or humoral feedback systems to regulate adipose tissue function and overall metabolic health. However, functional studies of the sympathetic nervous system in the mouse are limited, because details of anatomy and fine structure are lacking. Here, we used reporter mice for tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons (TH:tomato mice), iDISCO tissue clearance, confocal, lightsheet, and electron microscopy to clarify that (<b>a)</b> iBAT receives sympathetic input via dorsal rami (instead of often cited intercostal nerves); (<b>b)</b> dorsal rami T1–T5 correspond to the postganglionic input from sympathetic chain ganglia (stellate/T1–T5); (<b>c)</b> dorsal rami serve as conduits for sympathetic axons that branch off in finer nerve bundles to enter iBAT; (<b>d)</b> axonal varicosities show strong differential innervation of brown (dense innervation) versus white (sparse innervation) adipocytes, that surround the core iBAT in the mouse and are intermingled in human adipose tissues, (<b>e)</b> axonal varicosities can form neuro-adipocyte junctions with brown adipocytes. Taken together, we demonstrate that sympathetic iBAT innervation is organized by specific nerves and terminal structures that can be surgically and genetically accessed for neuromodulatory purposes.</p>

<p>Central olfactory pathway in the brain of the hermit crabs <i>Pagurus bernhardus</i> and <i>Coenobita clypeatus</i>: summary of glomerular structure and neurochemistry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The primary olfactory centers of metazoans as diverse as arthropods and mammals consist of an array of fields of dense synaptic neuropil, the olfactory glomeruli. However, the neurochemical structure of crustacean olfactory glomeruli is largely understudied when compared to the insects. We analyzed the glomerular architecture in selected species of hermit crabs using immunohistochemistry against presynaptic proteins, the neuropeptides orcokinin, RFamide and allatostatin, and the biogenic amine serotonin. Our study reveals an unexpected level of structural complexity, unmatched by what is found in the insect olfactory glomeruli. Peptidergic and aminergic interneurons provide the structural basis for a regionalization of the crustacean glomeruli into longitudinal and concentric compartments. Our data suggest that local olfactory interneurons take a central computational role in modulating the information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to projection neurons within the glomeruli. Furthermore, we found yet unknown neuronal elements mediating lateral inhibitory interactions across the glomerular array that may play a central role in modulating the transfer of sensory input to the output neurons through presynaptic inhibition. Our study is another step in understanding the function of crustacean olfactory glomeruli as highly complex units of local olfactory processing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disturbances of the early stages of neurogenesis lead to irreversible changes in the structure of the mature brain and its functional impairment, including increased excitability, which may be the basis for drug-resistant epilepsy. The range of possible clinical symptoms is as wide as the different stages of disturbed neurogenesis may be. In this study, we used a quadruple model of brain dysplasia by comparing structural and functional disorders in animals whose neurogenesis was disturbed with a single dose of 1 Gy of gamma rays at one of the four stages of neurogenesis, that is, on days 13, 15, 17, or 19 of prenatal development.</p>
<p>When reached adulthood, the prenatally irradiated rats received EEG teletransmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered and significant differences in susceptibility to seizure behavioral symptoms were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during, and after the seizures significant correlations were found between the density of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons located in the cerebral cortex and the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or increases in the power of particular EEG bands. Neurons expressing calretinin or NPY showed also dysplasia-related increases without, however, correlations with parameters of seizure intensity. The results point to significant roles of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, and also to expression of NPY—an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant reducing susceptibility to seizures and supporting neuronal survival.</p>

     alt="Structural analysis of the microglia–interneuron interactions in the CA1 hippocampal area of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease"/>
<p>This study provides new insights into the structural interactions between microglia and two types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons defined by expression of parvalbumin or somatostatin. We report a high level of structural interactions between microglia and both types of interneurons, with cell-type-specific differences in contact location and interaction area. Furthermore, these interactions were preserved in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD), suggesting that physical interactions between microglia and interneurons remain stable. However, the fraction of microglia contacts onto interneuron dendrites was significantly decreased, indicating that, under AD-like conditions, the somatic control of interneurons by microglia becomes more functionally relevant and may control the firing behavior of interneurons to maintain the network inhibition/excitation balance.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia can interact with glutamatergic neurons and, through control of synaptic elements, regulate their physiological function. Much less is known about the partnership between microglia and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Here, we compared the interactions between microglia and parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal area of APP/PS1 transgenic mice that mimic certain aspects of the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first uncovered a high level of interactions between microglia and two types of interneurons, with 98% of SOM+ and 90% of PV+ cells receiving different types of putative microglial contacts. The latter included the microglia soma to the interneuron soma (Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>), the microglia process to the interneuron soma (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>) and the microglia process to the interneuron dendrite (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub>) interactions. Moreover, we found significantly larger areas of interaction for the Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> and the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub> type of contacts between microglia and SOM+ cells. In contrast, PV+ cells exhibited larger areas for the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> interactions. Second, in APP/PS1 mice, although the overall microglia interactions with interneurons remained preserved, the fraction of interneurons receiving putative microglia contacts on their dendrites was reduced, and larger areas of interactions were observed for somatic contacts, suggesting a stronger modulation of the interneuron output by microglia in AD. In summary, these results reveal microglia as important partners of hippocampal PV+ and SOM+ GABAergic cells, with interneuron type-specific pattern of interactions. Thus, microglia may play an essential role in the operation of interneurons under normal conditions and their dysfunction in disease.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroscience lacks a diverse repertoire of model organisms, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the general principles of neural function. Ctenophores display many neurobiological and experimental features which make them a promising candidate to fill this gap. They possess a nerve net distributed across their body surface in the epithelial layer. There is a long-held assumption that nerve nets are “simple” and lack distinct organizational principles. We want to challenge this assumption and determine how stereotyped the structure of this network is. We estimated body surface area in <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> using custom optical projection tomography and light sheet morphometry imaging systems. Using an antibody against tyrosinated α-tubulin, we visualized the nerve net in situ and quantified the geometric properties using an automated segmentation approach. We characterized organizational rules of the epithelial nerve net in animals of different sizes and at different regions of the body. We found that specific morphological features within the nerve net are largely unchanged during growth. These properties must be essential to the functionality of the nervous system and therefore are maintained during a change in body size. We have also established the principles of organization of the network and showed that some of the geometric properties are variable across different parts of the body. This suggests that there may be different functions occurring in regions with different structural characteristics. This is the most comprehensive structural description of a ctenophore nerve net to date and demonstrates the amenability of <i>P. pileus</i> for whole organism network analysis.</p>

     alt="The lateral posterior clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster express three neuropeptides and have multiple connections within the circadian clock network and beyond"/>
<p>The authors characterized <i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) that belong to the circadian clock neurons. They demonstrate that the LPNs are well connected to the other clock neurons (s-LN<sub>v</sub>, LN<sub>d</sub>, DN<sub>2</sub>, DN<sub>1p</sub>) and to putative wake and sleep centers as well as centers that control temperature preference, metabolism, feeding, and oviposition (e.g., the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> (PI), the mushroom body (MB), and the dorsal fan-shaped body(dFB)). The LPNs get input from the small ventrolateral clock neurons (s-LN<sub>v</sub>) and may signal to the downstream neurons and centers via direct synapses and/or via three neuropeptides (AstA, AstC, and DH31), which they express rhythmically. Furthermore, the authors show that the LPNs are heterogeneous (LPN-Type 1 and LPN-Type 2) and appear to have opposing roles on activity and sleep.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) belong to a small group of circadian clock neurons that is so far not characterized in detail. Thanks to a new highly specific split-Gal4 line, here we describe LPNs’ morphology in fine detail, their synaptic connections, daily bimodal expression of neuropeptides, and propose a putative role of this cluster in controlling daily activity and sleep patterns. We found that the three LPNs are heterogeneous. Two of the neurons with similar morphology arborize in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum and most likely promote sleep. One unique, possibly wakefulness-promoting, neuron with wider arborizations extends from the superior lateral protocerebrum toward the anterior optic tubercle. Both LPN types exhibit manifold connections with the other circadian clock neurons, especially with those that control the flies’ morning and evening activity (M- and E-neurons, respectively). In addition, they form synaptic connections with neurons of the mushroom bodies, the fan-shaped body, and with many additional still unidentified neurons. We found that both LPN types rhythmically express three neuropeptides, Allostatin A, Allostatin C, and Diuretic Hormone 31 with maxima in the morning and the evening. The three LPN neuropeptides may, furthermore, signal to the insect hormonal center in the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> and contribute to rhythmic modulation of metabolism, feeding, and reproduction. We discuss our findings in the light of anatomical details gained by the recently published hemibrain of a single female fly on the electron microscopic level and of previous functional studies concerning the LPN.</p>

<p>We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of general retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs are susceptible to chronic OHT, while M1 ipRGCs exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve damage. Studies, including this study, support that RGCs degenerate and die in a type-specific manner following the disease insult. Here we specifically examined one RGC type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC), and its associated functional deficits in a mouse model of experimental glaucoma. We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of ipRGC subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs, which are involved in pattern vision, are susceptible to chronic OHT. Correspondingly, mice with chronic OHT experience reduced contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. By comparison, M1 ipRGCs, which project to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to regulate circadian rhythmicity, exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT. Accordingly, we observed that circadian re-entrainment and circadian rhythmicity are largely not disrupted in OHT mice. Our study demonstrates the link between subtype-specific ipRGC survival and behavioral deficits in glaucomatous mice. These findings provide insight into glaucoma-induced visual behavioral deficits and their underlying mechanisms.</p>

     alt="Immunoreactive distribution of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone precursor, RFRP, in a temperate bat species (Eptesicus fuscus)"/>
<p>We provide the first neuroanatomical description of RFRP (precursor peptide of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone) expression and localization in the brain of any bat using a widespread temperate species (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, big brown bat) as a model. We found that RFRP mRNA expression occurs in the hypothalamus, testes, and ovaries of big brown bats with cellular RFRP peptide immunoreactivity across the hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, and median eminence. Putative contact between RFRP fibers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cell bodies were observed in the brain, suggesting potential for direct inhibition of downstream reproductive behavior and physiology via RFRP signaling to GnRH cells. Our work highlights utility of the unique annual reproductive life history of temperate bats—including extended reproductive suppression in overwintering females and asynchronous upregulation between sexes—and provides the foundation for exploring the neuroendocrine and molecular mechanisms regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis of bats in response to seasonal/environmental cues.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH, also known RFRP-3 in mammals) is an important regulator of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and downstream reproductive physiology. Substantial species differences exist in the localization of cell bodies producing RFRP-3 and patterns of fiber immunoreactivity in the brain, raising the question of functional differences. Many temperate bat species exhibit unusual annual reproductive patterns. Male bats upregulate spermatogenesis in late spring which is asynchronous with periods of mating in the fall, while females have the physiological capacity to delay their reproductive investment over winter via sperm storage or delayed ovulation/fertilization. Neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating reproductive timing in male and female bats are not well-studied. We provide the first description of RFRP—precursor peptide of GnIH —expression and localization in the brain of any bat using a widespread temperate species (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, big brown bat) as a model. RFRP mRNA expression was detected in the hypothalamus, testes, and ovaries of big brown bats. Cellular RFRP-immunoreactivity was observed within the periventricular nuclei, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus (Arc), and median eminence (ME). As in other vertebrates, RFRP fiber immunoreactivity was widespread, with the greatest density observed in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, Arc, ME, midbrain, and thalamic nuclei. Putative interactions between RFRP-ir fibers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cell bodies were observed in 16% of GnRH-immunoreactive cells, suggesting direct regulation of GnRH via RFRP signaling. This characterization of RFRP distribution contributes to a deeper understanding of bat neuroendocrinology, which serves as foundation for manipulative approaches examining changes in reproductive neuropeptide signaling in response to environmental and physiological challenges within, and among, bat species.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Immunoreactivity for calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has been attributed to geniculocortical relay neurons and has also been suggested to arise from terminals of retinal ganglion cells. Here, we combined immunostaining with single-cell injections to investigate the expression of CaMKII in retinal ganglion cells of three primate species: macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>, <i>M. nemestrina</i>), human, and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). We found that in all species, about 2%–10% of the total ganglion cell population expressed CaMKII. In all species, CaMKII was expressed by multiple types of wide-field ganglion cell including large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin-expressing), broad thorny, and narrow thorny cells. Three other ganglion cells types, namely, inner and outer stratifying maze cells in macaque and tufted cells in marmoset were also found. Double labeling experiments showed that CaMKII-expressing cells included inner and outer stratifying melanopsin cells. Nearly all CaMKII-expressing ganglion cell types identified here are known to project to the koniocellular layers of the dLGN as well as to the superior colliculus. The best characterized koniocellular projecting cell type—the small bistratified (blue ON/yellow OFF) cell—was, however, not CaMKII-positive in any species. Our results indicate that the pattern of CaMKII expression in retinal ganglion cells is largely conserved across different species of primate suggesting a common functional role. But the results also show that CaMKII is not a marker for all koniocellular projecting retinal ganglion cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chaotic and stochastic dynamics of epileptiform-like activities in sclerotic hippocampus resected from patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noemi S. Araújo, Selvin Z. Reyes-Garcia, João A. F. Brogin, Douglas D. Bueno, Esper A. Cavalheiro, Carla A. Scorza, Jean Faber</p>

The types of epileptiform activity occurring in the sclerotic hippocampus with highest incidence are interictal-like events (II) and periodic ictal spiking (PIS). These activities are classified according to their event rates, but it is still unclear if these rate differences are consequences of underlying physiological mechanisms. Identifying new and more specific information related to these two activities may bring insights to a better understanding about the epileptogenic process and new diagnosis. We applied Poincaré map analysis and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) onto 35 <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiological signals recorded from slices of 12 hippocampal tissues surgically resected from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. These analyzes showed that the II activity is related to chaotic dynamics, whereas the PIS activity is related to deterministic periodic dynamics. Additionally, it indicates that their different rates are consequence of different endogenous dynamics. Finally, by using two computational models we were able to simulate the transition between II and PIS activities. The RQA was applied to different periods of these simulations to compare the recurrences between artificial and real signals, showing that different ranges of regularity-chaoticity can be directly associated with the generation of PIS and II activities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">SNX27–Retromer directly binds ESCPE-1 to transfer cargo proteins during endosomal recycling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Boris Simonetti, Qian Guo, Manuel Giménez-Andrés, Kai-En Chen, Edmund R. R. Moody, Ashley J. Evans, Mintu Chandra, Chris M. Danson, Tom A. Williams, Brett M. Collins, Peter J. Cullen</p>

Coat complexes coordinate cargo recognition through cargo adaptors with biogenesis of transport carriers during integral membrane protein trafficking. Here, we combine biochemical, structural, and cellular analyses to establish the mechanistic basis through which SNX27–Retromer, a major endosomal cargo adaptor, couples to the membrane remodeling endosomal SNX-BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1 (ESCPE-1). In showing that the SNX27 FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain directly binds acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs in the SNX1/SNX2 subunits of ESCPE-1, we propose a handover model where SNX27–Retromer captured cargo proteins are transferred into ESCPE-1 transport carriers to promote endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling. By revealing that assembly of the SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1 coat evolved in a stepwise manner during early metazoan evolution, likely reflecting the increasing complexity of endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling from the ancestral opisthokont to modern animals, we provide further evidence of the functional diversification of yeast pentameric Retromer in the recycling of hundreds of integral membrane proteins in metazoans.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Why did only one genus of insects, Halobates, take to the high seas?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lanna Cheng, Himanshu Mishra</p>

Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and house a dizzying array of organisms. Mammals, birds, and all manner of fish can be commonly sighted at sea, but insects, the world’s most common animals, seem to be completely absent. Appearances can deceive, however, as 5 species of the ocean skater <i>Halobates</i> live exclusively at the ocean surface. Discovered 200 years ago, these peppercorn-sized insects remain rather mysterious. How do they cope with life at the ocean surface, and why are they the only genus of insects to have taken to the high seas?
