              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anesthesia modality does not affect clinical outcomes of intra-arterial vasodilator treatment in patients with symptomatic cerebral vasospasms [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Delayed cerebral ischemia and cerebral vasospasm remain the leading causes of poor outcome in survivors of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Refractory cerebral vasospasms can be treated with endovascular vasodilator therapy, which can either be performed in conscious sedation or general anesthesia. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the anesthesia modality on long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular vasodilator therapy due to cerebral vasospasm and hypoperfusion. Methods: Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were retrospectively analyzed at time of discharge from the hospital and six months after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was assessed 24 hours before, immediately before, immediately after, and 24 hours after endovascular vasodilator therapy, and at discharge and six months. Interventional parameters such as duration of intervention, choice and dosage of vasodilator and number of arteries treated were also recorded. Results: A total of 98 patients were included in this analysis and separated into patients who had interventions in conscious sedation, general anesthesia and a mix of both. Neither mRS at discharge nor at six months showed a significant difference for functionally independent outcomes (mRS 0-2) between groups. NIHSS before endovascular vasodilator therapy was significantly higher in patients receiving interventions in general anesthesia but did not differ anymore between groups six months after the initial bleed. Conclusion: This study did not observe a difference in outcome whether patients underwent endovascular vasodilator therapy in general anesthesia or conscious sedation for refractory cerebral vasospasms. Hence, the choice should be made for each patient individually.

                Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung is an uncommon subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Even in the early stages, pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) has a dismal prognosis when compared to other kinds of NSCLC with a mean survival of 9–12 months and a five-year survival rate of around 20%. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with a two-month history of shortness of breath and cough. Initial computed tomography (CT) scan showed features of interstitial lung disease with chronic obstructive airway changes. After 34 months, the patient’s condition worsened with newer complaints of sore throat and hemoptysis. A repeat CT scan showed a ∼49x38x59mm size lesion in the superior segment of the left lower lobe. A core needle biopsy was performed, which revealed tumor cells consisting of irregular tubules and sarcomatoid components. The patient was started on chemotherapy. Unfortunately, she succumbed to her disease. Our case highlights the aggressiveness of PSC.

                Reports of non-replicable research demand new methods of research data management. Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are suggested as tools to improve the documentation of research data and make them universally accessible. In a self-guided approach, we introduced the open-source ELN eLabFTW into our life-science lab group and, after using it for a while, think it is a useful tool to overcome hurdles in ELN introduction by providing a combination of properties making it suitable for small life-science labs, like ours. We set up our instance of eLabFTW, without any further programming needed. Our efforts to embrace open data approach by introducing an ELN fits well with other institutional organized ELN initiatives in academic research and our goals towards data quality management.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model checking via testing for direct effects in Mendelian Randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yangqing Deng, Wei Pan</p>

It is of great interest and potential to discover causal relationships between pairs of exposures and outcomes using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to deal with hidden confounding in observational studies. Two most popular approaches are Mendelian randomization (MR), which usually use independent genetic variants/SNPs across the genome, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) (or their generalizations) using cis-SNPs local to a gene (or some genome-wide and likely dependent SNPs), as IVs. In spite of their many promising applications, both approaches face a major challenge: the validity of their causal conclusions depends on three critical assumptions on valid IVs, and more generally on other modeling assumptions, which however may not hold in practice. The most likely as well as challenging situation is due to the wide-spread horizontal pleiotropy, leading to two of the three IV assumptions being violated and thus to biased statistical inference. More generally, we’d like to conduct a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test to check the model being used. Although some methods have been proposed as being robust to various degrees to the violation of some modeling assumptions, they often give different and even conflicting results due to their own modeling assumptions and possibly lower statistical efficiency, imposing difficulties to the practitioner in choosing and interpreting varying results across different methods. Hence, it would help to directly test whether any assumption is violated or not. In particular, there is a lack of such tests for TWAS. We propose a new and general GOF test, called TEDE (TEsting Direct Effects), applicable to both correlated and independent SNPs/IVs (as commonly used in TWAS and MR respectively). Through simulation studies and real data examples, we demonstrate high statistical power and advantages of our new method, while confirming the frequent violation of modeling (including valid IV) assumptions in practice and thus the importance of model checking by applying such a test in MR/TWAS analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical framework for place coding in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex D. Reyes</p>

In the auditory system, tonotopy is postulated to be the substrate for a place code, where sound frequency is encoded by the location of the neurons that fire during the stimulus. Though conceptually simple, the computations that allow for the representation of intensity and complex sounds are poorly understood. Here, a mathematical framework is developed in order to define clearly the conditions that support a place code. To accommodate both frequency and intensity information, the neural network is described as a space with elements that represent individual neurons and clusters of neurons. A mapping is then constructed from acoustic space to neural space so that frequency and intensity are encoded, respectively, by the location and size of the clusters. Algebraic operations -addition and multiplication- are derived to elucidate the rules for representing, assembling, and modulating multi-frequency sound in networks. The resulting outcomes of these operations are consistent with network simulations as well as with electrophysiological and psychophysical data. The analyses show how both frequency and intensity can be encoded with a purely place code, without the need for rate or temporal coding schemes. The algebraic operations are used to describe loudness summation and suggest a mechanism for the critical band. The mathematical approach complements experimental and computational approaches and provides a foundation for interpreting data and constructing models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Topology-preserving smoothing of retinotopic maps</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanshuai Tu, Duyan Ta, Zhong-Lin Lu, Yalin Wang</p>

Retinotopic mapping, i.e., the mapping between visual inputs on the retina and neuronal activations in cortical visual areas, is one of the central topics in visual neuroscience. For human observers, the mapping is obtained by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals of cortical responses to slowly moving visual stimuli on the retina. Although it is well known from neurophysiology that the mapping is topological (i.e., the topology of neighborhood connectivity is preserved) within each visual area, retinotopic maps derived from the state-of-the-art methods are often not topological because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of fMRI. The violation of topological condition is most severe in cortical regions corresponding to the neighborhood of the fovea (e.g., < 1 degree eccentricity in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset), significantly impeding accurate analysis of retinotopic maps. This study aims to directly model the topological condition and generate topology-preserving and smooth retinotopic maps. Specifically, we adopted the Beltrami coefficient, a metric of quasiconformal mapping, to define the topological condition, developed a mathematical model to quantify topological smoothing as a constrained optimization problem, and elaborated an efficient numerical method to solve the problem. The method was then applied to V1, V2, and V3 simultaneously in the HCP dataset. Experiments with both simulated and real retinotopy data demonstrated that the proposed method could generate topological and smooth retinotopic maps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-throughput Interpretation of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor Short-read Sequencing Data with PING</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wesley M. Marin, Ravi Dandekar, Danillo G. Augusto, Tasneem Yusufali, Bianca Heyn, Jan Hofmann, Vinzenz Lange, Jürgen Sauter, Paul J. Norman, Jill A. Hollenbach</p>

The <i>killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor</i> (<i>KIR)</i> complex on chromosome 19 encodes receptors that modulate the activity of natural killer cells, and variation in these genes has been linked to infectious and autoimmune disease, as well as having bearing on pregnancy and transplant outcomes. The medical relevance and high variability of <i>KIR</i> genes makes short-read sequencing an attractive technology for interrogating the region, providing a high-throughput, high-fidelity sequencing method that is cost-effective. However, because this gene complex is characterized by extensive nucleotide polymorphism, structural variation including gene fusions and deletions, and a high level of homology between genes, its interrogation at high resolution has been thwarted by bioinformatic challenges, with most studies limited to examining presence or absence of specific genes. Here, we present the PING (Pushing Immunogenetics to the Next Generation) pipeline, which incorporates empirical data, novel alignment strategies and a custom alignment processing workflow to enable high-throughput <i>KIR</i> sequence analysis from short-read data. PING provides <i>KIR</i> gene copy number classification functionality for all <i>KIR</i> genes through use of a comprehensive alignment reference. The gene copy number determined per individual enables an innovative genotype determination workflow using genotype-matched references. Together, these methods address the challenges imposed by the structural complexity and overall homology of the <i>KIR</i> complex. To determine copy number and genotype determination accuracy, we applied PING to European and African validation cohorts and a synthetic dataset. PING demonstrated exceptional copy number determination performance across all datasets and robust genotype determination performance. Finally, an investigation into discordant genotypes for the synthetic dataset provides insight into misaligned reads, advancing our understanding in interpretation of short-read sequencing data in complex genomic regions. PING promises to support a new era of studies of KIR polymorphism, delivering high-resolution <i>KIR</i> genotypes that are highly accurate, enabling high-quality, high-throughput <i>KIR</i> genotyping for disease and population studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Circadian rhythm shows potential for mRNA efficiency and self-organized division of labor in multinucleate cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leif Zinn-Brooks, Marcus L. Roper</p>

Multinucleate cells occur in every biosphere and across the kingdoms of life, including in the human body as muscle cells and bone-forming cells. Data from filamentous fungi suggest that, even when bathed in a common cytoplasm, nuclei are capable of autonomous behaviors, including division. How does this potential for autonomy affect the organization of cellular processes between nuclei? Here we analyze a simplified model of circadian rhythm, a form of cellular oscillator, in a mathematical model of the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>. Our results highlight a potential role played by mRNA-protein phase separation to keep mRNAs close to the nuclei from which they originate, while allowing proteins to diffuse freely between nuclei. Our modeling shows that syncytism allows for extreme mRNA efficiency—we demonstrate assembly of a robust oscillator with a transcription rate a thousand-fold less than in comparable uninucleate cells. We also show self-organized division of the labor of mRNA production, with one nucleus in a two-nucleus syncytium producing at least twice as many mRNAs as the other in 30% of cycles. This division can occur spontaneously, but division of labor can also be controlled by regulating the amount of cytoplasmic volume available to each nucleus. Taken together, our results show the intriguing richness and potential for emergent organization among nuclei in multinucleate cells. They also highlight the role of previously studied mechanisms of cellular organization, including nuclear space control and localization of mRNAs through RNA-protein phase separation, in regulating nuclear coordination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Presentation of cytokine profile in relation to oxidative stress parameters in patients with severe COVID-19: an observational pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: COVID-19 can be worsened by hyper-production of cytokines accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator™ Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-1α. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012). Similar behavior was evidenced between IFN-g and d-ROM (r=0.4006, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.6030, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.4298, p=0.012). Conclusion: The oxidative stress markers show good correlation with the tested cytokines which can be measured at the beginning of the disease in a primary care setting to predict the course of COVID-19.

                Background: Sea grapes or  Caulerpa racemosa have a lot of phytochemical content, especially unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial for health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sea grapes extract on blood glucose levels, total cholesterol-, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α in male Wistar rats, which were given per-oral (p.o.) cholesterol- and carbohydrates fat-enriched diets (CFED). Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats weighing between 200 – 250 g were used for this study. Animals were randomly distributed into four groups of ten animals each. Group A served as control (received standard dry pellet diet). Rats in group B were fed on CFED for 4 weeks.  Groups C and D were fed on CFED and were administered 150 and 450 mg/kg of  sea grapes extract (p.o.), respectively. Results: Group C rats indicated a blood glucose reduction and an increase in PGC-1α serum, in comparison to group D (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between group C and D in blood cholesterol reduction (high dose of the extract did not have significant effects) (p=0.222), and both groups had the same effect in lowering total cholesterol in rats. Conclusion: Sea grapes extract is proven to improve blood glucose, total cholesterol, and PGC-1α levels in rats fed with CFED.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning detects cardiotoxicity in a high-content screen with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Drug-induced cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are major causes of drug attrition. To decrease late-stage drug attrition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries need to establish biologically relevant models that use phenotypic screening to detect drug-induced toxicity <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, we sought to rapidly detect patterns of cardiotoxicity using high-content image analysis with deep learning and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). We screened a library of 1280 bioactive compounds and identified those with potential cardiotoxic liabilities in iPSC-CMs using a single-parameter score based on deep learning. Compounds demonstrating cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs included DNA intercalators, ion channel blockers, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin-dependent kinase, and multi-kinase inhibitors. We also screened a diverse library of molecules with unknown targets and identified chemical frameworks that show cardiotoxic signal in iPSC-CMs. By using this screening approach during target discovery and lead optimization, we can de-risk early-stage drug discovery. We show that the broad applicability of combining deep learning with iPSC technology is an effective way to interrogate cellular phenotypes and identify drugs that may protect against diseased phenotypes and deleterious mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting effects of Western vs. Mediterranean diets on monocyte inflammatory gene expression and social behavior in a primate model</a></h4>

              
                Dietary changes associated with industrialization substantially increase the prevalence of chronic diseases, such as obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, major contributors to the public health burden. The high prevalence of these chronic diseases is often attributed to an 'evolutionary mismatch' between human physiology and modern nutritional environments. Western diets enriched with foods that were scarce throughout human evolutionary history (e.g., simple sugars and saturated fats) promote inflammation and disease relative to diets more akin to ancestral human hunter-gatherer diets, such as a Mediterranean diet. Peripheral blood monocytes, precursors to macrophages and important mediators of innate immunity and inflammation, are sensitive to the environment and may represent a critical intermediate in the pathway linking diet to disease. We evaluated the effects of 15 months of whole diet manipulations mimicking human Western or Mediterranean diet patterns on monocyte polarization using a well-established model of human health, the cynomolgus macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>). Monocyte transcriptional profiles differed markedly between the two diets, with 40% of transcripts showing differential expression (FDR &lt; 0.05). Monocytes from Western diet consumers were polarized toward a more proinflammatory phenotype. Compared to the Mediterranean diet, the Western diet shifted the co-expression of 445 gene pairs, including small RNAs and transcription factors associated with metabolism and adiposity in humans, and dramatically altered behavior. For example, Western-fed individuals were more anxious and less socially integrated compared to the Mediterranean-fed subjects. These behavioral changes were also associated with some of the effects of diet on gene expression, suggesting an interaction between diet, central nervous system activity, and monocyte gene expression. The results of this study provide new insights into evolutionary mismatch at the molecular level and uncover new pathways through which Western diets alter monocyte polarization toward a proinflammatory phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An oscillating computational model can track pseudo-rhythmic speech by using linguistic predictions</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations putatively track speech in order to optimize sensory processing. However, it is unclear how isochronous brain oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. Here we propose that oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech when considering that speech time is dependent on content-based predictions flowing from internal language models. We show that temporal dynamics of speech are dependent on the predictability of words in a sentence. A computational model including oscillations, feedback, and inhibition is able to track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. As the model processes, it generates temporal phase codes, which are a candidate mechanism for carrying information forward in time. The model is optimally sensitive to the natural temporal speech dynamics and can explain empirical data on temporal speech illusions. Our results suggest that speech tracking does not have to rely only on the acoustics but could also exploit ongoing interactions between oscillations and constraints flowing from internal language models.

                Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires potent and low-cost therapeutics. We identified a series of single-domain antibodies (i.e., nanobody), <i>Nanosota-1</i>, from a camelid nanobody phage display library. Structural data showed that <i>Nanosota-1</i> bound to the oft-hidden receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking viral receptor ACE2. The lead drug candidate possessing an Fc tag (<i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i>) bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD ~3000 times more tightly than ACE2 did and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ~160 times more efficiently than ACE2 did. Administered at a single dose, <i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i> demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models. Unlike conventional antibodies, <i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i> was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional thermostability. Pharmacokinetic analysis of <i>Nanosota-1C-F</i>c documented an excellent <i>in vivo</i> stability and a high tissue bioavailability. As effective and inexpensive drug candidates, <i>Nanosota-1</i> may contribute to the battle against COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of splicing factor SRSF1 is required for development and cilia function</a></h4>

              
                Shuttling RNA-binding proteins coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic steps of gene expression. The SR family proteins regulate RNA splicing in the nucleus and a subset of them, including SRSF1, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm affecting post-splicing processes. However, the physiological significance of this remains unclear. Here, we used genome editing to knock-in a nuclear retention signal (NRS) in <i>Srsf1 </i>to create a mouse model harboring an SRSF1 protein that is retained exclusively in the nucleus. <i>Srsf1<sup>NRS/NRS </sup></i>mutants displayed small body size, hydrocephalus and immotile sperm, all traits associated with ciliary defects. We observed reduced translation of a subset of mRNAs and decreased abundance of proteins involved in multiciliogenesis, with disruption of ciliary ultrastructure and motility in cells and tissues derived from this mouse model. These results demonstrate that SRSF1 shuttling is used to reprogram gene expression networks in the context of high cellular demands, as observed here, during motile ciliogenesis.

                    implications for evolutionary trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variation (CNV) through gene or chromosome amplification provides a route for rapid phenotypic variation and supports long-term evolution of gene functions. Although the evolutionary importance of CNV is known, little is understood about how genetic background influences CNV tolerance. Here, we measured fitness costs of over 4,000 over-expressed genes in 15 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strains representing different lineages, to explore natural variation in tolerating gene overexpression (OE). Strain-specific effects dominated the fitness costs of gene OE. We report global differences in the consequences of gene OE, independent of the amplified gene, as well as gene-specific effects that were dependent on the genetic background. Natural variation in the response to gene OE could be explained by several models, including strain-specific physiological differences, resource limitations, and regulatory sensitivities. This work provides new insight on how genetic background influences tolerance to gene amplification and the evolutionary trajectories accessible to different backgrounds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uniparental nuclear inheritance following bisexual mating in fungi</a></h4>

              
                Some remarkable animal species require an opposite-sex partner for their sexual development but discard the partner’s genome before gamete formation, generating hemi-clonal progeny in a process called hybridogenesis. Here, we discovered a similar phenomenon, termed pseudosexual reproduction, in a basidiomycete human fungal pathogen, <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, where exclusive uniparental inheritance of nuclear genetic material was observed during bisexual reproduction. Analysis of strains expressing fluorescent reporter proteins revealed instances where only one of the parental nuclei was present in the terminal sporulating basidium. Whole-genome sequencing revealed the nuclear genome of the progeny was identical with one or the other parental genome. Pseudosexual reproduction was also detected in natural isolate crosses where it resulted in mainly <i>MAT</i>a progeny, a bias observed in <i>Cryptococcus</i> ecological distribution as well. The mitochondria in these progeny were inherited from the <i>MAT</i>&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; parent, resulting in nuclear-mitochondrial genome exchange. The meiotic recombinase Dmc1 was found to be critical for pseudosexual reproduction. These findings reveal a novel, and potentially ecologically significant, mode of eukaryotic microbial reproduction that shares features with hybridogenesis in animals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interpreting wide-band neural activity using convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Rapid progress in technologies such as calcium imaging and electrophysiology has seen a dramatic increase in the size and extent of neural recordings. Even so, interpretation of this data requires considerable knowledge about the nature of the representation and often depends on manual operations. Decoding provides a means to infer the information content of such recordings but typically requires highly processed data and prior knowledge of the encoding scheme. Here, we developed a deep-learning framework able to decode sensory and behavioral variables directly from wide-band neural data. The network requires little user input and generalizes across stimuli, behaviors, brain regions, and recording techniques. Once trained, it can be analyzed to determine elements of the neural code that are informative about a given variable. We validated this approach using electrophysiological and calcium-imaging data from rodent auditory cortex and hippocampus as well as human electrocorticography (ECoG) data. We show successful decoding of finger movement, auditory stimuli, and spatial behaviors – including a novel representation of head direction - from raw neural activity.

                Histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is mediated by six different lysine methyltransferases. Amongst these enzymes SET domain containing 1b (SETD1B) has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability but its role in the postnatal brain has not been studied yet. Here we employ mice that lack Setd1b from excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain and combine neuron-specific ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches to elucidate its role in neuronal gene expression. We observe that SETD1B controls the expression of genes with a broad H3K4me3 peak at their promoters that represent neuronal enriched genes linked to learning and memory function. Comparative analysis to corresponding data from conditional Kmt2a and Kmt2b knockout mice suggests that this function is specific to SETD1B. Moreover, postnatal loss of Setd1b leads to severe learning impairment, suggesting that SETD1B-mediated regulation of H3K4me levels in postnatal neurons is critical for cognitive function.

                Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), consisting of transcription factors and their target cis-regulatory sequences, control neurogenesis and cell fate specification in the developing central nervous system, but their organization is poorly characterized. In this study, we performed integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis from both mouse and human retina to profile dynamic changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting during retinal neurogenesis. We identified multiple interconnected, evolutionarily-conserved GRNs consisting of cell type-specific transcription factors that both activate expression of genes within their own network and often inhibit expression of genes in other networks. These GRNs control state transitions within primary retinal progenitors that underlie temporal patterning, regulate the transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirmed the prediction of this analysis that the NFI transcription factors Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix selectively activate expression of genes that promote late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors. We also used GRNs to identify additional transcription factors that selectively promote (Insm1/2) and inhibit (Tbx3, Tcf7l1/2) rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study provides an inventory of cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development, identifies transcription factors that control the temporal identity of retinal progenitors and cell fate specification, and will potentially help guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost due to disease.

                Recent studies suggest that the Zona Incerta (ZI) plays a role in fear learning and recall. However, there is a clear gap in knowledge as to whether the ZI can encode fear evoking threats and cues that predict them. Here, we subject mice to a classical fear conditioning paradigm while recording the in-vivo calcium dynamics of ZI neurons. We observed that ZI neurons can encode not only a fear evoking stimulus, but can also learn to encode predictive cues, associate them with the unconditioned fear evoking stimulus, and discriminate them from neutral non-predictive cues. While the ZI across all mice learned to become mainly excited by fear predictive cues, only mice that did not generalize fear became largely inhibited by non-predictive cues and better discriminated the two. Together, we provide extensive evidence that the ZI differentially encode fear predictive and non-predictive cues in a generalization dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ageing-associated myelin dysfunction drives amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, shows a strict age-dependency, but why ageing constitutes the main risk factor for this disease is still poorly understood. Brain ageing affects oligodendrocytes and the structural integrity of myelin sheaths, the latter associated with secondary neuroinflammation. Since oligodendrocytes support axonal and neuronal health, we hypothesised that ageing-associated loss of myelin integrity could be an upstream risk factor for neuronal amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition, the primary neuropathological hallmark of AD. Here, we show that in AD mouse models different genetically induced defects of myelin integrity or demyelinating injuries are indeed potent drivers of amyloid deposition in vivo, quantified by whole brain light sheet microscopy. Conversely, the lack of myelin in the forebrain provides protection against plaque deposition. Mechanistically, we find that myelin dysfunction causes the accumulation of the A{beta} producing machinery within axonal swellings and increases cortical amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Surprisingly, AD mice with dysfunctional myelin lack plaque-corralling microglia but show a disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like signature as revealed by bulk and single cell transcriptomics. These activated microglia, however, are primarily engaged with myelin, preventing the protective reactions of microglia to A{beta} plaques. Our data suggest a working model, in which age-dependent structural defects of myelin promote plaque formation, directly and indirectly, and are thus an upstream AD risk factor. Improving oligodendrocyte health and myelin integrity could be a promising target to delay AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disparate energy consumption despite similar network activity</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits can produce similar activity patterns from vastly different combinations of channel and synaptic conductances. These conductances are tuned for specific activity patterns but might also reflect additional constraints, such as metabolic cost or robustness to perturbations. How do such constraints influence the range of permissible conductances? Here, we investigate how metabolic cost affects the parameters of neural circuits with similar activity in a model of the pyloric network of the crab Cancer borealis. We use a novel machine learning method to identify a range of network models that can generate activity patterns matching experimental data. We find that neural circuits can consume largely different amounts of energy despite similar circuit activity. We then study how circuit parameters get constrained by minimizing energy consumption and identify circuit parameters that might be subject to metabolic tuning. Finally, we investigate the interaction between metabolic cost and temperature robustness. We show that metabolic cost can vary across temperatures, but that robustness to temperature changes does not necessarily incur an increased metabolic cost. Our analyses show that, despite metabolic efficiency and temperature robustness constraining circuit parameters, neural systems can generate functional, efficient, and robust network activity with widely disparate sets of conductances.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deliberation gated by opportunity cost adapts to context with urgency</a></h4>

              
                The value we place on our time impacts what we decide to do with it. Value it too little, and we obsess over all details. Value it too much, and we rush carelessly to move on. How to strike this often context-specific balance is a challenging decision-making problem. Average-reward, putatively encoded by tonic dopamine, serves in existing reinforcement learning theory as the stationary opportunity cost of time. However, environmental context and the cost of deliberation therein often varies in time and is hard to infer and predict. Here, we define a non-stationary opportunity cost of deliberation arising from performance variation on multiple timescales. Estimated from reward history, this cost readily adapts to reward-relevant changes in context and suggests a generalization of average-reward reinforcement learning (AR-RL) to account for non-stationary contextual factors. We use this deliberation cost in a simple decision-making heuristic called Performance-Gated Deliberation, which approximates AR-RL and is consistent with empirical results in both cognitive and systems decision-making neuroscience. We propose that deliberation cost is implemented directly as urgency, a previously characterized neural signal effectively controlling the speed of the decision-making process. We use behaviour and neural recordings from non-human primates in a non-stationary random walk prediction task to support our results. We make readily testable predictions for both neural activity and behaviour and discuss how this proposal can facilitate future work in cognitive and systems neuroscience of reward-driven behaviour.

                Challenges in clinical data sharing and the need to protect data privacy have led to the development and popularization of methods that do not require directly transferring patient data. In neuroimaging, integration of data across multiple institutions also introduces unwanted biases driven by scanner differences. These scanner effects have been shown by several research groups to severely affect downstream analyses. To facilitate the need of removing scanner effects in a distributed data setting, we introduce distributed ComBat, an adaptation of a popular harmonization method for multivariate data that borrows information across features. We present our fast and simple distributed algorithm and show that it yields equivalent results using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our method enables harmonization while ensuring maximal privacy protection, thus facilitating a broad range of downstream analyses in functional and structural imaging studies.

                Humans adapt their learning strategies to changing environments by estimating the volatility of the reinforcement conditions. Here, we examine how volatility affects learning and the underlying functional brain organizations using a probabilistic reward reversal learning task. We found that the order of conditions was critically important; participants adjusted learning rate going from volatile to stable, but not from stable to volatile, environments. Subjective volatility of the environment was encoded in the striatal reward system and its dynamic connections with the prefrontal control system. Flexibility, which captures the dynamic changes of network modularity in the brain, was higher in the environmental transition from volatile to stable than from stable to volatile. These findings suggest that behavioral adaptations and dynamic brain organizations in transitions between stable and volatile environments are asymmetric, providing critical insights into the way that people learn under uncertainty.

                Treatments for amblyopia focus on vision therapy and patching of one eye. Predicting the success of these methods remains difficult, however. Recent research has used binocular rivalry to monitor visual cortical plasticity during occlusion therapy, leading to a successful prediction of the recovery rate of the amblyopic eye. The underlying mechanisms and their relation to neural homeostatic plasticity are not known. Here we propose a spiking neural network to explain the effect of shortterm monocular deprivation on binocular rivalry. The model reproduces perceptual switches as observed experimentally. When one eye is occluded, inhibitory plasticity changes the balance between the eyes and leads to longer dominance periods for the eye that has been deprived. The model suggests that homeostatic inhibitory plasticity is a critical component of the observed effects and might play an important role in the recovery from amblyopia.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">When learning a movement based on binary success information, one is more variable following failure than following success. Theoretically, the additional variability post-failure might reflect exploration of possibilities to obtain success. When average behavior is changing (as in learning), variability can be estimated from differences between subsequent movements. Can one estimate exploration reliably from such trial-to-trial changes when studying reward-based motor learning? To answer this question, we tried to reconstruct the exploration underlying learning as described by four existing reward-based motor learning models. We simulated learning for various learner and task characteristics. If we simply determined the additional change post-failure, estimates of exploration were sensitive to learner and task characteristics. We identified two pitfalls in quantifying exploration based on trial-to-trial changes. Firstly, performance-dependent feedback can cause correlated samples of motor noise and exploration on successful trials, which biases exploration estimates. Secondly, the trial relative to which trial-to-trial change is calculated may also contain exploration, which causes underestimation. As a solution, we developed the additional trial-to-trial change (ATTC) method. By moving the reference trial one trial back and subtracting trial-to-trial changes following specific sequences of trial outcomes, exploration can be estimated reliably for the three models that explore based on the outcome of only the previous trial. Since ATTC estimates are based on a selection of trial sequences, this method requires many trials. In conclusion, if exploration is a binary function of previous trial outcome, the ATTC method allows for a model-free quantification of exploration.</p>

	<p>Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor in all living organisms. It is involved in a large number of biochemical processes functioning either as an activator of molecules with carbonyl groups or as a carrier of acyl moieties. Together with its thioester derivatives, it plays a central role in cell metabolism, post-translational modification, and gene expression. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for CoA in the redox regulation by the S-thiolation of cysteine residues in cellular proteins. The intracellular concentration and distribution in different cellular compartments of CoA and its derivatives are controlled by several extracellular stimuli such as nutrients, hormones, metabolites, and cellular stresses. Perturbations of the biosynthesis and homeostasis of CoA and/or acyl-CoA are connected with several pathological conditions, including cancer, myopathies, and cardiomyopathies. In the most recent years, defects in genes involved in CoA production and distribution have been found in patients affected by rare forms of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant aspects of CoA cellular metabolism, their role in the pathogenesis of selected neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and recent advancements in the search for therapeutic approaches for such diseases.</p>

	<p>Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic, extremely rare epileptic encephalopathy. It strikes previously healthy school-aged children and is usually cryptogenic. Its dramatic onset with refractory status epilepticus is always preceded by a nonspecific febrile illness. The seizure activity in FIRES may last for several weeks with little to no response to antiepileptic treatment, usually resulting in the usage of anaesthetics. This acute phase is followed by a chronic, refractory epilepsy and cognitive deficit, that persist for the rest of the patient’s life. Still to this day no definite cause has been described. In this study we review the current finding in FIRES and describe a case of a 4-year-old patient with a dramatic course of the acute phase in FIRES and unusual presentation of the chronic phase, which is dominated by extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia. This case highlights that the clinical presentation of FIRES may differ from those frequently described in literature.</p>

<p>The authors reconstructed 26 single lumbar spinocerebellar axons in mice and mapped axon terminals with zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. The lumbar spinocerebellar axons showed high variations the pathway patterns (contralateral vs. ipsilateral, dorsal vs. ventral in the spinal cord, medullary vs. pontine in the cerebellar entry), branching, and termination (mainly in cerebellar lobules II, III-V, VIII-IXa-b, cerebellar nuclei, CN, nucleus X, NX, lateral reticular nucleus, LRN). The axons were classified into three major groups (magenta, orange, green), confirming the conventional main types of the lumbar spinocerebellar projections to an extent. However, the results also indicated highly heterogeneous axonal populations beyond these groups.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Among the spinocerebellar projections vital for sensorimotor coordination of limbs and the trunk, the morphology of spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar cord has not been well characterized compared to those from thoracic and sacral cords. We reconstructed 26 single spinocerebellar axons labeled by biotinylated dextran injections into the gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord in mice. Axon terminals were mapped in relation to the zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex.</p>
<p>Reconstructed axons were primarily classified into ipsilaterally and contralaterally ascending axons, arising mainly from the dorsal and ventral horns, respectively. The majority of ipsilateral and contralateral axons took the dorsal-medullary and ventral-pontine pathways, respectively. The axons of both groups terminated mainly in the vermal and medial paravermal areas of lobules II-V and VIII-IXa, often bilaterally but predominantly ipsilateral to the axonal origin, with a weak preference to particular portions of zebrin stripes. The ipsilateral axons originating from the medial dorsal horn in the upper lumbar cord (n = 3) had abundant (43–147) mossy fiber terminals and no medullary collaterals. The ipsilateral axons originating from the lateral dorsal horn in the lower lumbar cord (n = 9) and the contralateral axons (n = 14) showed remarkable morphology variations. The number of their mossy fiber terminals varied from 2 to 172. Their collaterals, observed in 17 axons out of 23, terminated mainly in the medial cerebellar nucleus, nucleus X, and lateral reticular nucleus in various degrees. The results indicated that the lumbar spinocerebellar projection contains highly heterogeneous axonal populations regarding their pathway, branching, and termination patterns.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as <i>Sirindhorna khoratensis</i> (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analysed. Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between the situation in adults of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> and <i>Gallus gallus</i>, which are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We thence gauge the level of encephalisation of <i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> through the calculation of the Encephalisation Quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The EQ obtained for <i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> (3.611) suggests that this species was significantly more encephalised than most if not all extant non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea that an increasing encephalisation was fostered not only once in theropods but also in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. <i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> was ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other iguanodontian ornithopods favoured a degree of encephalisation that was outstanding by reptile standards.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subcellular and regional localization of mRNA translation in midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Local translation within excitatory and inhibitory neurons is involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Despite the extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations of central monoaminergic neurons, the subcellular localization of protein synthesis is not well-characterized in these populations. Here, we investigated mRNA localization and translation in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, cells with enormous axonal and dendritic projections, both of which exhibit stimulation-evoked dopamine (DA) release. Using highly-sensitive ribosome-bound RNA-sequencing and imaging approaches in mDA axons, we found no evidence for axonal mRNA localization or translation. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendritic projections into the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observed dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in vesicular exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data further defined a molecular signature of the sparse mDA neurons resident in the SNr, including enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an ER calcium pump previously undescribed in mDA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective ablation of adult GFAP-expressing tanycytes leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males</a></h4>

              
                In adult mammals, neural stem cells emerge in three neurogenic regions, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ), the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (SGZ) and the hypothalamus. In the SVZ and the SGZ, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) express the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and selective ablation of these NSPCs drastically decreases cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In the hypothalamus, GFAP is expressed by -tanycytes, which are specialized radial glia-like cells in the wall of the third ventricle. To explore the role of these hypothalamic GFAP-positive tanycytes, we used transgenic mice expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-Tk) under the control of the mouse Gfap promoter and 4-week intracerebroventricular infusion of the antiviral agent ganciclovir (GCV) that kills dividing cells expressing Tk. While GCV drastically reduced the number and growth of hypothalamus-derived neurospheres from adult transgenic mice in vitro, it caused hypogonadism in vivo. The selective death of dividing tanycytes expressing GFAP indeed caused a marked decrease in testosterone levels and testicular weight, as well as vacuolization of the seminiferous tubules and loss of spermatogenesis. In addition, GCV-treated GFAP-Tk mice showed impaired sexual behavior, but no alteration in food intake or body weight. Our results also show that the selective ablation of GFAP-expressing tanycytes leads to a sharp decrease in the number of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive neurons and blunted LH secretion. Altogether, our data show that GFAP-expressing tanycytes play a central role in the regulation of male reproductive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural temporal context reinstatement of event structure during memory recall</a></h4>

              
                Although life unfolds continuously, experiences are generally perceived and remembered as discrete events. Accumulating evidence suggests that event boundaries disrupt temporal representations and weaken memory associations. However, less is known about the consequences of event boundaries on temporal representations during retrieval, especially when temporal information is not tested explicitly. Using a neural measure of temporal context extracted from scalp electroencephalography, we found reduced temporal context similarity between studied items separated by an event boundary when compared to items from the same event. Further, while participants free recalled list items, neural activity reflected reinstatement of temporal context representations from study, including temporal disruption. A computational model of episodic memory, the Context Maintenance and Retrieval model (CMR; Polyn, Norman & Kahana, 2009), predicted these results, and made novel predictions regarding the influence of temporal disruption on recall order. These findings implicate the impact of event structure on memory organization via temporal representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal correlates of attentional selectivity and intensity in visual area V4 are invariant of motivational context</a></h4>

              
                Flexibly switching attentional strategies is crucial for adaptive behavior in changing environments. Depending on the context, task demand employs different degrees of the two fundamental components of attention- attentional selectivity (preferentially attending to one location in visual space) and effort (the total non-selective intensity of attention). Neuronal responses in the visual cortex that show modulation with changes in either selective attention or effort are reported to partially represent motivational aspect of the task context. The relative contributions and interactions of these two components of attention to modulate neuronal signals and their sensitivity to distinct motivational drives are poorly understood. To address this question, we independently controlled monkeys' spatially selective attention and non-selective attentional intensity in the same experimental session during a novel visual orientation change detection task. Attention was controlled either by adjusting the relative difficulty of the orientation changes at the two locations or by the reward associated with stimuli at two locations while simultaneously recording spikes from populations of neurons in area V4. We found that V4 neurons are robustly modulated by either selective attention or attentional intensity. Notably, as attentional selectivity for a neuron's receptive field location decreased, its responses became weaker, despite an increase in the animal's overall attentional intensity. This strong interaction between attentional selectivity and intensity could be identified in single trial spike trains. A simple divisive normalization of spatially distributed attention performances can explain the interaction between attention components well at the single neuron level. The effects of attentional selectivity and attentional intensity on neuronal responses were the same regardless of whether the changes were motivated by reward or task difficulty. These results provide a detailed cellular-level mechanism of how fundamental components of attention integrate and affect sensory processing in varying motivational and stimulus contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A phenomenological model of neuroimmune interactions in epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy can have many different causes and its development (epileptogenesis) involves a bewildering complexity of interacting processes. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind computational model to better understand the role of neuroimmune interactions in the development of acquired epilepsy. Our model describes the interactions between neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal loss, circuit remodeling, and seizures. Formulated as a system of nonlinear differential equations, the model is validated using data from animal models that mimic human epileptogenesis caused by infection, status epilepticus, and blood-brain barrier disruption. The mathematical model successfully explains characteristic features of epileptogenesis such as its paradoxically long timescales (up to decades) despite short and transient injuries, or its dependence on the intensity of an injury. Furthermore, stochasticity in the model captures the variability of epileptogenesis outcomes in individuals exposed to identical injury. Notably, in line with the concept of degeneracy, our simulations reveal multiple routes towards epileptogenesis with neuronal loss as a sufficient but non-necessary component. We show that our framework allows for in silico predictions of therapeutic strategies, providing information on injury-specific therapeutic targets and optimal time windows for intervention.

                Neuroscience techniques, including in vivo recording, have allowed for a great expansion in knowledge; however, this technology may also affect the very phenomena researchers set out to investigate. Including both female and male mice in our associative learning experiments shed light on sex differences on the impact of chronic implantation of tetrodes on learning. While previous research showed intact female mice acquired trace eyeblink conditioning faster than male and ovariectomized females, implantation of chronic microdrive arrays showed sexually dimorphic effects on learning. Microdrive implanted male mice acquired the associative learning paradigm faster than both intact and ovariectomized females. These effects were not due to the weight of the drive alone, as there were no significant sex-differences in learning of animals that received dummy drive implants without tetrodes lowered into the brain. Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry and western blot analysis suggest that significant alterations in the MAPK pathway, acute inflammation, and brain derived neurotrophic factor may underlie these observed sex- and surgery-dependent effects on learning.

                Modelling brain networks with complex configuration and cellular properties requires a set of neuroinformatic tools and an organized staged workflow. We have therefore developed the Brain Scaffold Builder (BSB), a new modeling framework embedding multiple strategies for cell placement and connectivity and a flexible management of cellular and network mechanisms. With BSB, for the first time, the mouse cerebellar cortex was reconstructed and simulated at cellular resolution, using morphologically realistic multi-compartmental single-neuron models. Embedded connection rules allowed BSB to generate the cerebellar connectome, unifying a collection of scattered experimental data into a coherent construct. Naturalistic background and sensory-burst stimulation were used for functional validation against recordings in vivo, monitoring the impact of subcellular mechanisms on signal propagation and spatio-temporal processing and providing a new ground-truth about circuit organization for the prediction of neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain structure and function predict adherence to an exercise intervention in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Individualized and precision medicine approaches to exercise for cognitive and brain health in aging have the potential to improve intervention efficacy. Predicting adherence to an exercise intervention in older adults prior to its commencement will allow for adaptive and optimized approaches that could save time (no need to demonstrate failure before changing course) and money (cost of de-implementing approaches that do not work for certain individuals) which ultimately could improve health outcomes (e.g., preventative medicine approaches prior to the onset of symptoms). Individual differences in brain structure and function in older adults are potential proxies of brain and brain reserve or maintenance and may provide strong predictions of adherence. We hypothesized that brain-based measures would predict adherence to a six-month randomized controlled trial of exercise in older adults, alone and in combination with psychosocial, cognitive and health measures. In 131 older adults (aged 65.79 (4.65) years, 63 percent female) we found, using regularized elastic net regression within a nested cross-validation framework, that brain structure (cortical thickness and cortical surface area) in somatosensory, inferior temporal, and inferior frontal regions and functional connectivity (degree count) in primary information processing (somatosensory, visual), executive control, default, and attentional networks, predicted exercise adherence (R2 = 0.15, p < 0.001). Traditional survey and clinical measures such as gait and walking self-efficacy, biological sex and perceived stress also predicted adherence (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.001) but a combined multimodal model achieved the highest predictive strength (R2 = 0.22, p <0.001). Neuroimaging features alone can predict adherence to a structured group-based exercise intervention in older adults which suggests there is substantial utility of these measures for future research into precision medicine approaches. The best performing model contained multimodal features suggesting that each modality provided independent relevant information in the prediction of exercise adherence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spike protein multiorgan tropism suppressed by antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                While there is clinical evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 multiorgan tropism in severely infected coronavirus 19 patients, it is unclear if there is differential multiorgan biodistribution and organ uptake in healthy young individuals, a group that usually has asymptomatic to moderate coronavirus 19 symptoms. In addition, for antibody therapies and vaccines that target the spike protein, it is unclear if these reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or spike protein multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled spike protein near infrared fluorescence to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system, in young mice. We found a spike protein body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. Spike protein uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of spike protein into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and anti-spike protein antibodies suppressed spike protein biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-spike protein antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 biodistribution kinetics and multiorgan tropism that could determine coronavirus 19 organ-specific outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuo-vestibular gaze control - conserved subcortical processing</a></h4>

              
                Gaze stabilization compensates for movements of the head or external environment to minimize image blurring, which is critical for visually-guided behaviors. Multisensory information is used to stabilize the visual scene on the retina via the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and optokinetic (OKR) reflexes. While the organization of neuronal circuits underlying VOR is well described across vertebrates, less is known about the contribution and evolutionary origin of the OKR circuits. Moreover, the integration of these two sensory modalities is still poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel experimental model, the isolated lamprey eye-brain-labyrinth preparation, to analyze the neuronal pathways underlying visuo-vestibular integration which allowed electrophysiological recordings while applying vestibular stimulation using a moving platform, coordinated with visual stimulation via two screens. We show that lampreys exhibit robust visuo-vestibular integration, with optokinetic information processed in the pretectum and integrated with vestibular inputs at several subcortical levels. The enhanced eye movement response to multimodal stimulation favored the vestibular response at increased velocities. The optokinetic signals can be downregulated from tectum. Additionally, saccades are present in the form of nystagmus. The lamprey represents the oldest living group of vertebrates, thus all basic components of the visuo-vestibular control of gaze were present already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-linear frequency-dependence of neurovascular coupling in the cerebellar cortex implies vasodilation-vasoconstriction competition</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process associating local cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity (NA). Although NVC provides the basis for the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) effect used in functional MRI (fMRI), the relationship between NVC and NA is still unclear. Since recent studies reported cerebellar non-linearities in BOLD signals during motor tasks execution, we investigated the NVC/NA relationship using a range of input frequencies in acute mouse cerebellar slices of vermis and hemisphere. The capillary diameter increased in response to mossy fiber activation in the 6-300Hz range, with a marked inflection around 50Hz (vermis) and 100Hz (hemisphere). The corresponding NA was recorded using high-density multi-electrode arrays and correlated to capillary dynamics through a computational model dissecting the main components of granular layer activity. Here, NVC is known to involve a balance between the NMDAR-NO pathway driving vasodilation and the mGluRs-20HETE pathway driving vasoconstriction. Simulations showed that the NMDAR-mediated component of NA was sufficient to explain the time-course of the capillary dilation but not its non-linear frequency-dependence, suggesting that the mGluRs-20HETE pathway plays a role at intermediate frequencies. These parallel control pathways imply a vasodilation-vasoconstriction competition hypothesis that could adapt local hemodynamics at the microscale bearing implications for fMRI signals interpretation.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

Headache (5.4%), skeletal muscle injury (5.1%), psychiatric disorders (4.6%), impaired consciousness (2.8%), gustatory/olfactory dysfunction (2.3%), acute cerebrovascular events (1.4%), and dizziness (1.3%), were the most frequently reported neurological manifestations. Ischemic stroke occurred among 1.3% of COVID-19 patients. Other less common neurological manifestations were cranial nerve impairment (0.6%), nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%), epilepsy (0.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.15%). Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were reported in 14% and 4% of patients with a severe disease, respectively, and they were significantly higher compared to non-severe patients (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05). Individual patient data from 129 COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were extracted: mean age was 64.4 (SD ± 6.2), 78.5% had anterior circulation occlusions, the mean NIHSS was 15 (SD ± 7), and the intra-hospital mortality rate was 22.8%.

	<p>The way people represent and transform visuospatial information affects everyday activities including driving behavior. Mental rotation and perspective taking have recently been found to predict cognitive prerequisites for fitness-to-drive (FtD). We argue that the relationship between general cognitive status and FtD is mediated by spatial transformation skills. Here, we investigated the performance in the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and the Perspective-Taking Test (PT) of 175 male active drivers (aged from 18 to 91 years), by administering the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to measure their global cognitive functioning. All participants were submitted to a computerized driving assessment measuring resilience of attention (DT), reaction speed (RS), motor speed (MS), and perceptual speed (ATAVT). Significant results were found for the effect of global cognitive functioning on perceptual speed through the full mediation of both mental rotation and perspective-taking skills. The indirect effect of global cognitive functioning through mental rotation was only found to significantly predict resilience of attention whereas the indirect effect mediated by perspective taking only was found to significantly predict perceptual speed. Finally, the negative effect of age was found on each driving measure. Results presented here, which are limited to male drivers, suggest that general cognitive efficiency is linked to spatial mental transformation skills and, in turn, to driving-related cognitive tasks, contributing to fitness-to-drive in the lifespan.</p>

	<p>Subjective cognitive decline is a symptom that may appear in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. This study examined the effects of smartphone-based calendar training and walking exercise regimen on postmenopausal women experiencing subjective cognitive decline. Experimental group 1 participated in both calendar training and walking exercise, group 2 participated in calendar training only, and the control group did not receive either intervention. Forty-two participants completed a cognitive function test and questionnaire upon entering the study and 12 weeks later. The controlled oral word association score increased in experimental groups 1 and 2 and decreased in the control group. Memory contentment increased in experimental group 1, maintained in experimental group 2, and decreased in the control group. Smartphone-based calendar training and a walking exercise regimen improved executive function and memory contentment in everyday life, but the effects on depressive symptoms and self-esteem were not significant. Our findings demonstrate that smartphone-based calendar training and walking exercise improved cognitive function and have potential as nonpharmacologic interventions to strengthen cognitive function in women experiencing subjective cognitive decline.</p>

                Activity-dependent long-term changes in synaptic transmission known as synaptic plasticity are fundamental processes in brain function and are recognized as the cellular basis of learning and memory. While the neuronal mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity have been largely identified, the involvement of astrocytes in these processes has been less recognized. However, astrocytes are emerging as important cells that regulate synaptic function by interacting with neurons at tripartite synapses.

                Oxytocin (OT), a hypothalamic neuropeptide that acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, orchestrates a variety of animal behaviors. However, the relationship between brain OT dynamics and complex animal behaviors remains largely elusive, partly because of the lack of a suitable technique for its real-time recording in vivo. Here, we describe MTRIAOT, a G protein-coupled receptor-based green fluorescent OT sensor with a large dynamic range, optimal affinity, ligand specificity to OT orthologs, minimal effects on downstream signaling, and long-term fluorescence stability. By combining viral gene delivery and fiber photometry-mediated fluorescence measurements, we demonstrated the utility of MTRIAOT for real-time detection of brain OT dynamics in living mice. Importantly, MTRIAOT-mediated measurements revealed "OT oscillation," a hitherto unknown rhythmic change in OT levels in the brain. MTRIAOT will allow the analysis of OT dynamics in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes.

                Selective relationships are fundamental to humans and many other animals, but relationships between mates, family members, or peers may be mediated differently. We examined connections between social reward and social selectivity, aggression, and oxytocin receptor signaling pathways in rodents that naturally form enduring, selective relationships with mates and peers (prairie voles) or peers (meadow voles). Female prairie and meadow voles worked harder to access familiar vs. unfamiliar individuals, regardless of sex, and huddled extensively with familiar subjects. Male prairie voles also displayed strongly selective huddling preferences for familiar animals, but worked hardest to repeatedly access females vs. males, with no difference in effort by familiarity. This demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between motivation and social selectivity in males, and reveals a striking sex difference in pathways underlying social monogamy. Meadow voles exhibited social preferences but low social motivation, consistent with tolerance rather than reward supporting social groups in this species. Natural variation in oxytocin receptor genotype was associated with oxytocin receptor density, and both genotype and receptor binding predicted individual variation in prosocial and aggressive behaviors. These results provide a basis for understanding species, sex, and individual differences in the mechanisms underlying the role of social reward in social preference.

                Background: Domoic acid (DA) is a naturally occurring neurotoxin harmful to marine animals and humans. California sea lions exposed to DA in prey during algal blooms along the Pacific coast exhibit significant neurological symptoms, including epilepsy with hippocampal atrophy. Observations: Here we describe a xenotransplantation procedure to deliver interneuron progenitor cells into the damaged hippocampus of an epileptic sea lion with suspected DA toxicosis. The sea lion has had no evidence of seizures following the procedure, and clinical measures of well-being including weight and feeding habits have stabilized. Lessons: These preliminary results suggest xenotransplantation has improved the quality-of-life (QOL) for this animal and holds tremendous therapeutic promise.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Patients with Huntington’s disease (HD) have an increased incidence of diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction have not been entirely clarified. Revealing the pathogenesis of diabetes can provide a novel understanding of the onset and progression of HD, as well as potential clues for the development of new therapeutics. Here, we demonstrated that the mouse pancreatic insulinoma cell line NIT-1 expressing N-terminal mutant huntingtin (mHTT) containing 160 polyglutamine (160Q cells) displayed lower cell proliferative ability than the cells expressing N-terminal wild-type HTT containing 20 polyglutamine (20Q cells). In addition, 160Q cells were more prone to apoptosis and exhibited deficient glucose-stimulated insulin expression and secretion. Furthermore, insulin signaling molecule insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) expression decreased and was recruited into mHTT aggregates. Consequently, glucose stimulation failed to activate the downstream molecule phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) in 160Q cells, leading to reduced phosphorylation levels of serine–threonine protein kinase AKT and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). These data indicate that activation of the glucose-stimulated PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling pathway is significantly blocked in pancreatic β-cells in HD. Importantly, insulin treatment inhibited the aggregation of mHTT and significantly improved the activation of PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling in 160Q cells. These results suggest that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway might be due to the recruitment of IRS-2 into mHTT aggregates in HD β-cells, ultimately contributing to the impairment of pancreatic β-cells. In conclusion, our work provides new insight into the underlying mechanisms of the high incidence of diabetes and abnormal glucose homeostasis in HD.</p>

	<p>The risk of accidents while operating a drone is quite high. The most important solution is training for drone pilots. Drone pilot training can be done in both physical and virtual environments, but the probability of an accident is higher for pilot trainees, so the first method is to train in a virtual environment. The purpose of this study is to develop a new system to collect data on students&#039; educational development performance of students during the use of Gamified Drone Training Simulator and objectively analyze students&#039; development. A multimodal recording system that can collect simulator, keystroke, and brain activity data has been developed to analyze the cognitive and physical activities of participants trained in the gamified drone simulator. It was found that as the number of trials increased, participants became accustomed to the cognitive load of visual/auditory tasks and therefore the power in the alpha and beta bands decreased. It was observed that participants&#039; meditation and attention scores increased with the number of repetitions of the educational game. It can be concluded that the number of repetitions lowers stress and anxiety levels, increases attention, and thus enhances game performance.</p>

	<p>Reconsolidation is a process by which memories are destabilized, updated, and then restabilized. Strong memories are resistant to undergoing reconsolidation. Here, we addressed whether an overtrained fear memory could be made susceptible to reconsolidation by first extinguishing, and then renewing, the memory. Rats were trained with ten tone-footshock pairings, followed by eight days of tone extinction in the training context. The next day, rats were placed into a second context and memory for the tone was renewed/reactivated with a single tone presentation. Immediately following reactivation, rats received an injection of midazolam or vehicle. Rats were then tested for freezing to the tone in a third context. Midazolam had no effect in rats that did not undergo tone extinction, but significantly attenuated freezing to the tone in extinguished rats. Thus, rats that received tone extinction underwent tone memory reconsolidation following its renewal. In a second experiment, we administered the reactivation session and midazolam injections prior to extinction. Midazolam had no effect and rats extinguished at a rate similar to controls. These data suggest that strong emotional memories are capable of updating following weakening of memory expression through extinction.</p>

	<p>Objective: To characterize the effect of unilateral (single and two-level) lumbar facet/zygapophysial joint fixation on paraspinal muscle spindle activity immediately following L4 or L6 high velocity low amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) delivered at various thrust durations. Methods: Secondary analysis of immediate (≤2 s) post-HVLA-SM trunk muscle spindle response from two studies involving anesthetized adult cats (n = 39; 2.3–6.0 kg) with either a unilateral single (L5/6) or two-level (L5/6 and L6/7) facet joint fixation. All facet fixations were contralateral to L6 dorsal root recordings. HVLA-SM was delivered to the spinous process in a posterior-to-anterior direction using a feedback motor with a peak thrust magnitude of 55% of average cat body weight and thrust durations of 75, 100, 150, and 250 ms. Time to 1st action potential and spindle activity during 1 and 2 s post-HVLA-SM comparisons were made between facet joint fixation conditions and HVLA-SM segmental thrust levels. Results: Neither two-level facet joint fixation, nor HVLA-SM segmental level significantly altered immediate post-HVLA-SM spindle discharge at tested thrust durations (FDR &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Two-level facet joint fixation failed to alter immediate (≤2 s) post-HVLA-SM spindle discharge when compared to single-level facet joint fixation at any thrust duration. Segmental thrust level did not alter immediate post-HVLA-SM spindle response in two-level facet joint fixation preparations.</p>

	<p>Background: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of the study was to determine serum concentrations of AGEs and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) in MS patients and healthy controls and to investigate their possible influence on disease activity. Methods: Serum concentrations of AGE and sRAGE in patients with MS and healthy controls were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The mean serum AGE concentration in patients with MS was higher than in healthy controls, whereas the mean serum sRAGE concentration was lower than in the control group. However, the differences were not statistically significant. In MS patients, serum AGE and sRAGE concentrations did not differ significantly, depending on the duration of the disease and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Conclusions: Multiple sclerosis may be accompanied by disturbances of the AGE-sRAGE axis. However, further studies are warranted to confirm it. The duration of the disease and the degree of disability do not seem to affect the progression of the glycation process, particularly in the stable phase of the disease.</p>

	<p>Azerbaijani 28-year-old female showed weakness (MRC (Medical Research Council Scale for Muscle Strength) grade 4 in the proximal part of the upper and MRC grade 2–3 in the lower extremities), difficulty in stair lifting, positive symptom of Hoover’s rising, «waddling gait», decline deep reflexes symmetrical, lack of surface reflexes, positive Babinsky’s reflex on the right, urinary incontinence during sneezing, prolonged walking and exercise from puberty. Additional methods made it possible to identify minor violations of conduction of the left ventricle, electromyography signs of primary muscular disease with predominant involvement of the proximal muscles of the lower extremities, elevation of serum creatine kinase (746.81 U/l), active foci of demyelination in the left frontal lobe, intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG bands (type 2) in cerebrospinal fluid, atrophy and fatty degeneration of all muscles of the shins, homozygous Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in TRIM32 gene and heterozygous VUS c.2300C &amp;amp;gt; G (p.Thr767Arg) in KIF5A, c.2840G &amp;amp;gt; A (p.Arg947Lys) in MYH2, c.1502G &amp;amp;gt; C (p.Gly501Ala) in POMT1 genes. Comparison of the phenotypes of the mutations that have been identified with the clinical picture of the patient suggests that VUS c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in the TRIM32 gene can be pathological. Summarizing, it can be argued that the cause of the identified disorders is a homozygous variant c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in TRIM32 gene that causes LGMDR8 in a patient with MS.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive and irreversible disease and the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. In Spain, it affects around 120.000–150.000 individuals, and its prevalence is estimated to increase in the future. PD has a great impact on patients’ and caregivers’ lives and also entails a substantial socioeconomic burden. The aim of the present study was to examine the current situation and the 10-year PD forecast for Spain in order to optimize and design future management strategies. This study was performed using the modified Delphi method to try to obtain a consensus among a panel of movement disorders experts. According to the panel, future PD management will improve diagnostic capacity and follow-up, it will include multidisciplinary teams, and innovative treatments will be developed. The expansion of new technologies and studies on biomarkers will have an impact on future PD management, leading to more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and individualized therapies. However, the socio-economic impact of the disease will continue to be significant by 2030, especially for patients in advanced stages. This study highlighted the unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment and how crucial it is to establish recommendations for future diagnostic and therapeutic management of PD.</p>

	<p>Biomarkers to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) would enable patients to gain access to appropriate services and may facilitate the development of new therapies. Given the large numbers of people affected by AD, there is a need for a low-cost, easy-to-use method to detect AD patients. Potentially, the electroencephalogram (EEG) can play a valuable role in this, but at present no single EEG biomarker is robust enough for use in practice. This study aims to provide a methodological framework for the development of robust EEG biomarkers to detect AD with clinically acceptable performance by exploiting the combined strengths of key biomarkers. A large number of existing and novel EEG biomarkers associated with slowing of EEG, reduction in EEG complexity. and decrease in EEG connectivity were investigated. Support vector machine and linear discriminate analysis methods were used to find the best combination of the EEG biomarkers to detect AD with significant performance. A total of 325,567 EEG biomarkers were investigated, and a panel of six biomarkers was identified and used to create a diagnostic model with high performance (&amp;amp;gt;=85% for sensitivity and 100% for specificity).</p>

	<p>Background: Various three-dimensional (3D) glioblastoma cell culture models have a limited duration of viability. Our aim was to develop a long-term 3D glioblastoma model, which is necessary for reliable drug response studies. Methods: Human U87 glioblastoma cells were cultured in alginate microfibers for 28 days. Cell growth, viability, morphology, and aggregation in 3D culture were monitored by fluorescent and confocal microscopy upon calcein-AM/propidium iodide (CAM/PI) staining every seven days. The glioblastoma 3D model was validated using temozolomide (TMZ) treatments 3 days in a row with a recovery period. Cell viability by MTT and resistance-related gene expression (MGMT and ABCB1) by qPCR were assessed after 28 days. The same TMZ treatment schedule was applied in 2D U87 cell culture for comparison purposes. Results: Within a long-term 3D model system in alginate fibers, U87 cells remained viable for up to 28 days. On day 7, cells formed visible aggregates oriented to the microfiber periphery. TMZ treatment reduced cell growth but increased drug resistance-related gene expression. The latter effect was more pronounced in 3D compared to 2D cell culture. Conclusion: Herein, we described a long-term glioblastoma 3D model system that could be particularly helpful for drug testing and treatment optimization.</p>

                <p>Van der Waals epitaxy provides a fertile playground for the monolithic integration of various materials for advanced electronics and optoelectronics. Here, a previously unidentified nanorod-assisted van der Waals epitaxy is developed and nearly single-crystalline GaN films are first grown on amorphous silica glass substrates using a graphene interfacial layer. The epitaxial GaN-based light-emitting diode structures, with a record internal quantum efficiency, can be readily lifted off, becoming large-size flexible devices. Without the effects of the potential field from a single-crystalline substrate, we expect this approach to be equally applicable for high-quality growth of nitrides on arbitrary substrates. Our work provides a revolutionary technology for the growth of high-quality semiconductors, thus enabling the hetero-integration of highly mismatched material systems.</p>

                <p>FAN1, a DNA structure-specific nuclease, interacts with MLH1, but the repair pathways in which this complex acts are unknown. FAN1 processes DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and FAN1 variants are modifiers of the neurodegenerative Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD), presumably by regulating HD-causing CAG repeat expansions. Here, we identify specific amino acid residues in two adjacent FAN1 motifs that are critical for MLH1 binding. Disruption of the FAN1-MLH1 interaction confers cellular hypersensitivity to ICL damage and defective repair of CAG/CTG slip-outs, intermediates of repeat expansion mutations. FAN1-S126 phosphorylation, which hinders FAN1-MLH1 association, is cell cycle&ndash;regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase activity and attenuated upon ICL induction. Our data highlight the FAN1-MLH1 complex as a phosphorylation-regulated determinant of ICL response and repeat stability, opening novel paths to modify cancer and neurodegeneration.</p>

                <p>The effects of climate change on species richness are debated but can be informed by the past. Here, we generated a sedimentary ancient DNA dataset covering 10 lakes and applied novel methods for data harmonization. We assessed the impact of Holocene climate changes and nutrients on terrestrial plant richness in northern Fennoscandia. We find that richness increased steeply during the rapidly warming Early Holocene. In contrast to findings from most pollen studies, we show that richness continued to increase thereafter, although the climate was stable, with richness and the regional species pool only stabilizing during the past three millennia. Furthermore, overall increases in richness were greater in catchments with higher soil nutrient availability. We suggest that richness will increase with ongoing warming, especially at localities with high nutrient availability and assuming that human activity remains low in the region, although lags of millennia may be expected.</p>

                <p>Several thousand people die every year worldwide because of terrorist attacks perpetrated by non-state actors. In this context, reliable and accurate short-term predictions of non-state terrorism at the local level are key for policy makers to target preventative measures. Using only publicly available data, we show that predictive models that include structural and procedural predictors can accurately predict the occurrence of non-state terrorism locally and a week ahead in regions affected by a relatively high prevalence of terrorism. In these regions, theoretically informed models systematically outperform models using predictors built on past terrorist events only. We further identify and interpret the local effects of major global and regional terrorism drivers. Our study demonstrates the potential of theoretically informed models to predict and explain complex forms of political violence at policy-relevant scales.</p>

                <p>Arctic sea ice extent in autumn is significantly correlated with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the satellite era. However, questions about the robustness and reproducibility of the relationship persist. Here, we show that climate models are able to simulate periods of strong ice-NAO correlation, albeit rarely. Furthermore, we show that the winter circulation signals during these periods are consistent with observations and not driven by sea ice. We do so by interrogating a multimodel ensemble for the specific time scale of interest, thereby illuminating the dynamics that produce large spread in the ice-NAO relationship. Our results support the importance of internal variability over sea ice but go further in showing that the mechanism behind strong ice-NAO correlations, when they occur, is similar in longer observational records and models. Rather than sea ice, circulation anomalies over the Urals emerge as a decisive precursor to the winter NAO signal.</p>

                <p>Epidemiological data have linked vitamin D deficiency to the onset and severity of various cancers, including prostate cancer, and although in vitro studies have demonstrated anticancer activities for vitamin D, clinical trials provided conflicting results. To determine the impact of vitamin D signaling on prostatic precancerous lesions, we treated genetically engineered Pten<sup>(i)pe&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice harboring prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) with Gemini-72, a vitamin D analog with reported anticancer activities. We show that this analog induces apoptosis in senescent PINs, normalizes extracellular matrix remodeling by stromal fibroblasts, and reduces the prostatic infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrates that while a subset of luminal cells expressing Krt8, Krt4, and Tacstd2 (termed luminal-C cells) is lost by such a treatment, antiapoptotic pathways are induced in persistent luminal-C cells. Therefore, our findings delineate the distinct responses of PINs and the microenvironment to Gemini-72, and shed light on mechanisms that limit treatment&rsquo;s efficacy.</p>

                <p>Birds today are the most diverse clade of terrestrial vertebrates, and understanding why extant birds (Aves) alone among dinosaurs survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction is crucial to reconstructing the history of life. Hypotheses proposed to explain this pattern demand identification of traits unique to Aves. However, this identification is complicated by a lack of data from non-avian birds. Here, we interrogate survivorship hypotheses using data from a new, nearly complete skull of Late Cretaceous (~70 million years) bird <I>Ichthyornis</I> and reassess shifts in bird body size across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. <I>Ichthyornis</I> exhibited a wulst and segmented palate, previously proposed to have arisen within extant birds. The origin of Aves is marked by larger, reshaped brains indicating selection for relatively large telencephala and eyes but not by uniquely small body size. Sensory system differences, potentially linked to these shifts, may help explain avian survivorship relative to other dinosaurs.</p>

                <p>A wide variety of intracellular membraneless compartments are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation of charged proteins and nucleic acids. Understanding the stability of these compartments, while accounting for the compositional heterogeneity intrinsic to cellular environments, poses a daunting challenge. We combined experimental and theoretical efforts to study the effects of nonstoichiometric mixing on coacervation behavior and accurately measured the concentrations of polyelectrolytes and small ions in the coacervate and supernatant phases. For synthetic polyacrylamides and polypeptides/DNA, with unequal mixing stoichiometry, we report a general "looping-in" phenomenon found around physiological salt concentrations, where the polymer concentrations in the coacervate initially increase with salt addition before subsequently decreasing. This looping-in behavior is captured by a molecular model that considers reversible ion binding and electrostatic interactions. Further analysis in the low-salt regime shows that the looping-in phenomenon originates from the translational entropy of counterions that are needed to neutralize nonstoichiometric coacervates.</p>

                <p>Rhizobia induce nodule formation on legume roots and differentiate into bacteroids, which catabolize plant-derived dicarboxylates to reduce atmospheric N<SUB>2</SUB> into ammonia. Despite the agricultural importance of this symbiosis, the mechanisms that govern carbon and nitrogen allocation in bacteroids and promote ammonia secretion to the plant are largely unknown. Using a metabolic model derived from genome-scale datasets, we show that carbon polymer synthesis and alanine secretion by bacteroids facilitate redox balance in microaerobic nodules. Catabolism of dicarboxylates induces not only a higher oxygen demand but also a higher NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio than sugars. Modeling and <sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis indicate that oxygen limitation restricts the decarboxylating arm of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which limits ammonia assimilation into glutamate. By tightly controlling oxygen supply and providing dicarboxylates as the energy and electron source donors for N<SUB>2</SUB> fixation, legumes promote ammonia secretion by bacteroids. This is a defining feature of rhizobium-legume symbioses.</p>

                <p>Interpretation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serosurveillance studies is limited by poorly defined performance of antibody assays over time in individuals with different clinical presentations. We measured antibody responses in plasma samples from 128 individuals over 160 days using 14 assays. We found a consistent and strong effect of disease severity on antibody magnitude, driven by fever, cough, hospitalization, and oxygen requirement. Responses to spike protein versus nucleocapsid had consistently higher correlation with neutralization. Assays varied substantially in sensitivity during early convalescence and time to seroreversion. Variability was dramatic for individuals with mild infection, who had consistently lower antibody titers, with sensitivities at 6 months ranging from 33 to 98% for commercial assays. Thus, the ability to detect previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 is highly dependent on infection severity, timing, and the assay used. These findings have important implications for the design and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Photonic skins based on flexible organic microlaser arrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>Flexible photonics is rapidly emerging as a promising platform for artificial smart skins to imitate or extend the capabilities of human skins. Organic material systems provide a promising avenue to directly fabricate large-scale flexible device units; however, the versatile fabrication of all-organic integrated devices with desired photonic functionalities remains a great challenge. Here, we develop an effective technique for the mass processing of organic microlaser arrays, which act as sensing units, on the chip of photonic skins. With a bilayer electron-beam direct writing method, we fabricated flexible mechanical sensor networks composed of coupled-cavity single-mode laser sources on pliable polymer substrates. These microlaser-based mechanical sensor chips were subsequently used to recognize hand gestures, showing great potential for artificial skin applications. This work represents a substantial advance toward scalable construction of high-performance and low-cost flexible photonic chips, thus paving the way for the implementation of smart photonic skins into practical applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The major mechanism of melanoma mutations is based on deamination of cytosine in pyrimidine dimers as determined by circle damage sequencing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sunlight-associated melanomas carry a unique C-to-T mutation signature. UVB radiation induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as the major form of DNA damage, but the mechanism of how CPDs cause mutations is unclear. To map CPDs at single-base resolution genome wide, we developed the circle damage sequencing (circle-damage-seq) method. In human cells, CPDs form preferentially in a tetranucleotide sequence context (5'-Py-T&lt;&gt;Py-T/A), but this alone does not explain the tumor mutation patterns. To test whether mutations arise at CPDs by cytosine deamination, we specifically mapped UVB-induced cytosine-deaminated CPDs. Transcription start sites (TSSs) were protected from CPDs and deaminated CPDs, but both lesions were enriched immediately upstream of the TSS, suggesting a mutation-promoting role of bound transcription factors. Most importantly, the genomic dinucleotide and trinucleotide sequence specificity of deaminated CPDs matched the prominent mutation signature of melanomas. Our data identify the cytosine-deaminated CPD as the leading premutagenic lesion responsible for mutations in melanomas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Interactions between the hippocampus and fronto‐parietal regions during memory encoding in early childhood</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding have received much attention in the literature. Research in adults and school-age children suggest that the hippocampus and cortical regions in both frontal and parietal areas are involved in successful formation of memories. Overall, the hippocampus has been shown to interact with fronto-parietal regions to collaboratively support successful memory encoding for both individual items as well as item details (such as the source or color in which the item was originally encountered). To date, only one study has investigated neural regions engaged during memory encoding in children younger than 8 years of age, which is unfortunate since early childhood is a period of dramatic improvement in memory. This previous study indicated that both the hippocampus and cortical regions are involved during the encoding of subsequently remembered item details (i.e., sources). However, this study reported few interactions between these regions, and it did not explore item memory at a more general level. To fill these gaps, this article reanalyzed data from the previous report, aiming to examine the neural correlates of item memory during encoding in early childhood (4–8 years) and interactions between the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions during encoding. Consistent with research in older individuals, both the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions were found to participate in item memory encoding. Additionally, functional connectivity between hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions was significantly related to both subsequent item memory and subsequent source memory. Taken together, these findings suggest that not only the activation of individual brain regions (hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions) but also the functional connections between these regions are important for memory encoding. These data add to the growing literature providing insight into how the hippocampus and cortical regions interact to support memory during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differential CTCF binding in motor neurons and lymphocytes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diversity is critical to lymphocyte roles in the immune system and to neurons, which form complex network structures in the brain. Emerging evidence suggests that an increasing number of molecules associated with the immune system are also expressed in various central nervous system (CNS) regions and play crucial roles in brain development. Examination of shared molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis and lymphocyte differentiation may clarify relevant pathways, and suggests additional biomarkers in lymphocytes for neurological disorders. These results can contribute to find biomarkers that can be monitored through patient lymphocyte populations. Methods: We analysed similarities and conserved regions in several genes regulated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) during lymphocyte and neuronal developmental stages. We performed epigenetic analyses of CTCF binding Trak1, Gabpa, Gabpb1, Gabpb2, Gfi1, Gfi1b gene loci in T and B lymphocytes at different developmental stages, as well as in neural progenitor cells and motor neurons. Results: Common and shared CTCF binding events at Trak1 suggest additional transcriptional regulatory factors that control Trak1 gene expression levels differ in neurons and lymphocytes. Gabpb1 includes a common CTCF binding site shared with neurons and lymphocytes. Correlation of CTCF binding analysis and gene expression profile suggests that CTCF binding plays a role in epigenetic regulation of Gabpb1 gene. While Gfi1a is phylogenetically well-conserved and CTCF sites are occupied in lymphocytes, there are no CTCF binding occupied in neurons and neural progenitor cells. Although Gfi1b is highly homologous to Gfi1, differences in expression levels suggest that Gfi1b is critical for both lymphogenesis and neurogenesis. Neurons and lymphocytes have multiple common CTCF binding sites in the Gfi1b gene. Conclusions: The partial overlap in CTCF regulatory sites for some genes in neurons and lymphocytes suggests that there may be markers which can exhibit parallel changes in these cells and serve as biomarkers.

                Background: Eating or skipping breakfast for weight interests scientific and lay communities. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze causal effects of eating versus skipping breakfast on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes in humans. Methods: Six databases were searched for obesity- and breakfast-related terms (final search: 02 JAN 2020). Studies needed to isolate eating versus skipping breakfast in randomized controlled trials. Mean differences were synthesized using inverse variance random effects meta-analysis for each outcome. Positive estimates indicate higher outcomes in breakfast conditions (e.g., weight gain). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, secondary baseline habit-by-breakfast assignment analysis, and study duration cumulative analysis were performed. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Ten articles (12 comparisons; 6d-12wk) were included. Conditions included recommendations to eat versus skip breakfast, or provision of some or all meals. 95% confidence intervals of all main analyses included the null value of no difference for each outcome: body weight (0.17 kg [-0.40,0.73], k=12, n=487, I 2=74.5), BMI (0.07 kg/m 2 [-0.10,0.23, k=8, n=396, I 2=54.1), body fat percentage (-0.27% [-1.01,0.47], k=6, n=179, I 2=52.4), fat mass (0.24 kg [-0.21,0.69], k=6, n=205, I 2=0.0), lean mass (0.18 kg [-0.08,0.44], k=6, n=205, I 2=6.7), waist circumference (0.18 cm [-1.77,2.13], k=4, n=102, I 2=78.7), waist:hip ratio (0.00 [-0.01,0.01], k=4, n=102, I 2=8.0), sagittal abdominal diameter (0.19 cm [-2.35,2.73], k=2, n=56, I 2=0.0), and fat mass index (0.00 kg/m 2 [-0.22,0.23], k=2, n=56, I 2=0.0). Subgroup analysis showed only one statistically significant result. The interaction effect for BMI (–0.36[-0.65,-0.07]) indicates assignment to conditions consistent with baseline habits had lower BMI. Leave-one-out analysis did not indicate substantial influence of any one study. Conclusions: There was no discernible effect of eating or skipping breakfast on obesity-related anthropometric measures when pooling studies with substantial design heterogeneity and sometimes statistical heterogeneity. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42016033290.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Organizing knowledge to enable faster data interpretation in COVID-19 research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Enormous volumes of COVID-19 research data have been published and this continues to increase daily. This creates challenges for researchers to interpret, prioritize and summarize their own findings in the context of published literature, clinical trials, and a multitude of databases. Overcoming the data interpretation bottleneck is vital to help researchers to be more efficient in their quest to identify COVID-19 risk factors, potential treatments, drug side-effects, and much more. As a proof of concept, we have organized and integrated a range of COVID-19 and human biomedical data and literature into a knowledge graph (KG). Here we present the datasets we have integrated so far and the content of the KG which consists of 674,969 biological concepts and over 1.6 million relationships between them. The COVID-19 KG is available via KnetMiner, an interactive online platform for gene discovery and knowledge mining, or via RDF and Neo4j graph formats which can be searched programmatically through SPARQL and Cypher endpoints. KnetMiner is a road mapped ELIXIR UK service. We hope this integrated resource will enable faster data interpretation and discovery of linkages between genes, drugs, diseases and many more types of information relating to COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling of DNA binding to the condensin hinge domain using molecular dynamics simulations guided by atomic force microscopy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hiroki Koide, Noriyuki Kodera, Shveta Bisht, Shoji Takada, Tsuyoshi Terakawa</p>

The condensin protein complex compacts chromatin during mitosis using its DNA-loop extrusion activity. Previous studies proposed scrunching and loop-capture models as molecular mechanisms for the loop extrusion process, both of which assume the binding of double-strand (ds) DNA to the hinge domain formed at the interface of the condensin subunits Smc2 and Smc4. However, how the hinge domain contacts dsDNA has remained unknown. Here, we conducted atomic force microscopy imaging of the budding yeast condensin holo-complex and used this data as basis for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to model the hinge structure in a transient open conformation. We then simulated the dsDNA binding to open and closed hinge conformations, predicting that dsDNA binds to the outside surface when closed and to the outside and inside surfaces when open. Our simulations also suggested that the hinge can close around dsDNA bound to the inside surface. Based on these simulation results, we speculate that the conformational change of the hinge domain might be essential for the dsDNA binding regulation and play roles in condensin-mediated DNA-loop extrusion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Theta-gamma coupling emerges from spatially heterogeneous cholinergic neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yihao Yang, Howard Gritton, Martin Sarter, Sara J. Aton, Victoria Booth, Michal Zochowski</p>

Theta and gamma rhythms and their cross-frequency coupling play critical roles in perception, attention, learning, and memory. Available data suggest that forebrain acetylcholine (ACh) signaling promotes theta-gamma coupling, although the mechanism has not been identified. Recent evidence suggests that cholinergic signaling is both temporally and spatially constrained, in contrast to the traditional notion of slow, spatially homogeneous, and diffuse neuromodulation. Here, we find that spatially constrained cholinergic stimulation can generate theta-modulated gamma rhythms. Using biophysically-based excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) neural network models, we simulate the effects of ACh on neural excitability by varying the conductance of a muscarinic receptor-regulated K<sup>+</sup> current. In E-I networks with local excitatory connectivity and global inhibitory connectivity, we demonstrate that theta-gamma-coupled firing patterns emerge in ACh modulated network regions. Stable gamma-modulated firing arises within regions with high ACh signaling, while theta or mixed theta-gamma activity occurs at the peripheries of these regions. High gamma activity also alternates between different high-ACh regions, at theta frequency. Our results are the first to indicate a causal role for spatially heterogenous ACh signaling in the emergence of localized theta-gamma rhythmicity. Our findings also provide novel insights into mechanisms by which ACh signaling supports the brain region-specific attentional processing of sensory information.

Erroneous conversion of gene names into other dates and other data types has been a frustration for computational biologists for years. We hypothesized that such errors in supplementary files might diminish after a report in 2016 highlighting the extent of the problem. To assess this, we performed a scan of supplementary files published in PubMed Central from 2014 to 2020. Overall, gene name errors continued to accumulate unabated in the period after 2016. An improved scanning software we developed identified gene name errors in 30.9% (3,436/11,117) of articles with supplementary Excel gene lists; a figure significantly higher than previously estimated. This is due to gene names being converted not just to dates and floating-point numbers, but also to internal date format (five-digit numbers). These findings further reinforce that spreadsheets are ill-suited to use with large genomic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Selection of stimulus parameters for enhancing slow wave sleep events with a neural-field theory thalamocortical model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Felipe A. Torres, Patricio Orio, María-José Escobar</p>

Slow-wave sleep cortical brain activity, conformed by slow-oscillations and sleep spindles, plays a key role in memory consolidation. The increase of the power of the slow-wave events, obtained by auditory sensory stimulation, positively correlates to memory consolidation performance. However, little is known about the experimental protocol maximizing this effect, which could be induced by the power of slow-oscillation, the number of sleep spindles, or the timing of both events’ co-occurrence. Using a mean-field model of thalamocortical activity, we studied the effect of several stimulation protocols, varying the pulse shape, duration, amplitude, and frequency, as well as a target-phase using a closed-loop approach. We evaluated the effect of these parameters on slow-oscillations (SO) and sleep-spindles (SP), considering: (i) the power at the frequency bands of interest, (ii) the number of SO and SP, (iii) co-occurrences between SO and SP, and (iv) synchronization of SP with the up-peak of the SO. The first three targets are maximized using a decreasing ramp pulse with a pulse duration of 50 ms. Also, we observed a reduction in the number of SO when increasing the stimulus energy by rising its amplitude. To assess the target-phase parameter, we applied closed-loop stimulation at 0°, 45°, and 90° of the phase of the narrow-band filtered ongoing activity, at 0.85 Hz as central frequency. The 0° stimulation produces better results in the power and number of SO and SP than the rhythmic or random stimulation. On the other hand, stimulating at 45° or 90° change the timing distribution of spindles centers but with fewer co-occurrences than rhythmic and 0° phase. Finally, we propose the application of closed-loop stimulation at the rising zero-cross point using pulses with a decreasing ramp shape and 50 ms of duration for future experimental work.

                <p>by Daltry L. Snider, Stacy M. Horner</p>

A new study in PLOS Biology finds that interferon (IFN)-induced adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) mRNA is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified to promote its translation, enabling ADAR1 to modify self-double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) generated during the IFN response and preventing activation of the melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5)-mediated host antiviral response.

This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology which finds that interferon-induced ADAR1 mRNA is m6A-modified to promote its translation, enabling ADAR1 to modify self-dsRNAs generated during the interferon response; this prevents recognition of these self RNAs and erroneous activation of the MDA5-mediated host antiviral response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the  adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 181 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 21 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Inversely, CBD was present in the products below the no observed adverse effect level. Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC and not due to effects of CBD itself. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predicting coronary artery disease risk in firefighters – a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Firefighters are placed under severe cardiovascular load in performing active duty and, when carrying various coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, firefighters are predisposed to significant morbidity and mortality. Reducing the incidence of these risk factors is paramount. The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors of CAD risk.   Methods: This study used a quantitative, cross-sectional and correlational design. The researchers conveniently sampled 124 full-time firefighters from the City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service. A researcher-generated questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and CAD risk factors information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, family history of CAD, cigarette smoking and physical activity levels, and all research procedures were conducted according to the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. Data collection took place between September and November 2019. Linear and logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between the various CAD risk factors and the predictors of CAD risk.   Results: Age was a significant predictor of hypertension (p <0.01), dyslipidemia (p <0.01), diabetes (p <0.01), obesity (p <0.01) and central obesity (p <0.01). Gender was a significant predictor of obesity, central obesity and cigarette smoking (p <0.05). Waist circumference was a significant predictor of hypertension (p <0.01), dyslipidemia (p <0.01) and diabetes (p <0.05).   Conclusion: Age was a significant predictor of various modifiable CAD risk factors, including obesity, in both genders and all ethnicities. Attentive monitoring should be in place as firefighters age, along with behavioural modifications designed to reduce age-related increases in CAD risk factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Norwegian public’s ability to assess treatment claims: results of a cross-sectional study of critical health literacy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Few studies have evaluated the ability of the general public to assess the trustworthiness of claims about the effects of healthcare. For the most part, those studies have used self-reported measures of critical health literacy. Methods: We mailed 4500 invitations to Norwegian adults. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four online questionnaires that included multiple-choice questions that test understanding of Key Concepts people need to understand to assess healthcare claims. They also included questions about intended behaviours and self-efficacy. One of the four questionnaires was identical to one previously used in two randomised trials of educational interventions in Uganda, facilitating comparisons to Ugandan children, parents, and teachers. We adjusted the results using demographic data to reflect the population. Results: A total of 771 people responded. The adjusted proportion of Norwegian adults who answered correctly was > 50% for 17 of the 30 Key Concepts. On the other hand, less than half answered correctly for 13 concepts. The results for Norwegian adults were better than the results for Ugandan children in the intervention arm of the trial and parents, and similar to those of Ugandan teachers in the intervention arm of the trial. Based on self-report, most Norwegians are likely to find out the basis of treatment claims, but few consider it easy to assess whether claims are based on research and to assess the trustworthiness of research. Conclusions: Norwegian adults do not understand many concepts that are essential for assessing healthcare claims and making informed choices.Future interventions should be tailored to address Key Concepts for which there appears to be a lack of understanding.

     alt="Morphology of P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like afferent nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia and close relationship with vesicular nucleotide transporter-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the rat gastric antrum"/>
<p>We discovered P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia in the rat antral lesser curvature by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The nerve endings were derived from large web-like structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors, and wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia with pleomorphic terminal structures. The nerve endings may be specialized ending structures of vagal mechanoreceptors to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3)-expressing vagal afferent nerve endings with large web-like structures in the subserosal tissue of the antral lesser curvature, suggesting that these nerve endings were one of the vagal mechanoreceptors. The present study investigated the morphological relationship between P2X3-immunoreactive nerve endings and serosal ganglia in the rat gastric antrum by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like subserosal nerve endings with new morphology were distributed laterally to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into numerous nerve fibers with pleomorphic flattened structures to form basket-like nerve endings, and the parent axons were originated from large net-like structures of vagal afferent nerve endings. Basket-like nerve endings wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia, which were characterized by neurofilament 200 kDa-immunoreactive neurons with or without neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity and S100B-immunoreactive glial cells. Furthermore, basket-like nerve endings were localized in close apposition to dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibers immunoreactive for vesicular nucleotide transporter. These results suggest that P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings associated with serosal ganglia are the specialized ending structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors in order to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis, and are activated by ATP from sympathetic nerve fibers and/or serosal ganglia for the regulation of mechanoreceptor function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditure, productivity cost during pregnancy and COVID-19 impact on household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka; A study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,393 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

                Background: Heavy metals are materials naturally occurring in nature and increase with a rise in human activity. Ex-mining areas and domestic waste from human settlements are sources of heavy metal contamination that enter and pollute water, which then accumulates in various organisms including the Caulerpa racemosa community. The accumulation of heavy metals in C. racemosa has a wide impact on the food chain in aquatic ecosystems and humans because this alga is a consumptive commodity.   Methods: Sampling of C. racemosa was carried out at seven sites on Bintan Island, Indonesia covering the eastern (Teluk Bakau, Beralas Pasir, Malang Rapat), northern (Berakit and Pengudang), western (Sakera), and southern parts (Tg. Siambang). Sampling was carried out during different monsoons, and heavy metals in water and sediment samples were measured to determine the heavy metal concentration. Heavy metals were analyzed by a spectrophotometric method using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.   Results: The results showed that heavy metal concentrations fluctuate according to changes in the wind season, which carry currents and spread pollutants into the water. The concentration of metal in the water is also from anthropogenic activities. The heavy metal content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in C. racemosa is high in locations close to settlements. Meanwhile, in seawater samples, Fe and Zn metals have the highest concentrations compared to others.  Conclusions: Ex-bauxite mines are a source of Fe and Zn metal contamination in the environment, especially at Tg. Siambang. The levels of these heavy metals in the sediment are also high, as surface particle deposits accumulate at the bottom of the sediment. In general, the levels of heavy metals Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Zn increase in the northern monsoon because the dynamics of the water transport greater heavy metal pollution.

                Small, isolated teaching centers have difficulty mentoring interprofessional junior faculty in research methods and grant writing. Peer mentoring programs for grant writing at larger institutions have been successful. In this short report, we describe our program that leveraged mentor experience using four framing seminars followed by project refinement in three-person peer groups and monthly mentored works in progress meetings. In its first year, ten faculty from medicine, psychology, and pharmacy completed the program and successfully obtained six funded grants. Five of the projects transitioned from single profession applications to interprofessional applications as participants connected and profession-specific expertise was identified. Refinements for future cohorts are discussed.

                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.36 ± 1.915 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), undiagnosed (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">rmcorrShiny: A web and standalone application for repeated measures correlation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We describe a web and standalone Shiny app for calculating the common, linear within-individual association for repeated assessments of paired measures with multiple individuals: repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). This tool makes rmcorr more widely accessible, providing a graphical interface for performing and visualizing the output of analysis with rmcorr. In contrast to rmcorr, most widely used correlation techniques assume paired data are independent. Incorrectly analyzing repeated measures data as independent will likely produce misleading results. Using aggregation or separate models to address the issue of independence may obscure meaningful patterns and will also tend to reduce statistical power. rmcorrShiny (repeated measures correlation Shiny) provides a simple and accessible solution for computing the repeated measures correlation. It is available at: https://lmarusich.shinyapps.io/shiny_rmcorr/.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">McsB forms a gated kinase chamber to mark aberrant bacterial proteins for degradation</a></h4>

              
                In Gram-positive bacteria, the McsB protein arginine kinase is central to protein quality control, labelling aberrant molecules for degradation by the ClpCP protease. Despite its importance for stress response and pathogenicity, it is still elusive how the bacterial degradation labelling is regulated. Here, we delineate the mechanism how McsB targets aberrant proteins during stress conditions. Structural data reveal a self-compartmentalized kinase, in which the active sites are sequestered in a molecular cage. The 'closed' octamer interconverts with other oligomers in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and, contrary to these 'open' forms, preferentially labels unfolded proteins. In vivo data show that heat-shock triggers accumulation of higher-order oligomers, of which the octameric McsB is essential for surviving stress situations. The interconversion of open and closed oligomers represents a distinct regulatory mechanism of a degradation labeler, allowing the McsB kinase to adapt its potentially dangerous enzyme function to the needs of the bacterial cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Resonating neurons stabilize heterogeneous grid-cell networks</a></h4>

              
                A central theme that governs the functional design of biological networks is their ability to sustain stable function despite widespread parametric variability. Here, we investigated the impact of distinct forms of biological heterogeneities on the stability of a two-dimensional continuous attractor network (CAN) implicated in grid-patterned activity generation. We show that increasing degrees of biological heterogeneities progressively disrupted the emergence of grid-patterned activity and resulted in progressively large perturbations in low-frequency neural activity. We postulated that targeted suppression of low-frequency perturbations could ameliorate heterogeneity-induced disruptions of grid-patterned activity. To test this, we introduced intrinsic resonance, a physiological mechanism to suppress low-frequency activity, either by adding an additional high-pass filter (phenomenological) or by incorporating a slow negative feedback loop (mechanistic) into our model neurons. Strikingly, CAN models with resonating neurons were resilient to the incorporation of heterogeneities and exhibited stable grid-patterned firing. We found CAN networks with mechanistic resonators to be more effective in targeted suppression of low-frequency activity, with the slow kinetics of the negative feedback loop essential in stabilizing these networks. As low-frequency perturbations (1/<i>f</i> noise) are pervasive across biological systems, our analyses suggest a universal role for mechanisms that suppress low-frequency activity in stabilizing heterogeneous biological networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Social fluidity mobilizes contagion in human and animal populations</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other group-living animals tend to distribute their social effort disproportionately. Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behavior into a mathematical model, we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as <i>social fluidity</i>, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. Large values of social fluidity correspond to gregarious behavior, whereas small values signify the existence of persistent bonds between individuals. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak, we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity. As social fluidity increases, animal-disease systems become increasingly density-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that social fluidity is a stronger predictor of disease outcomes than both group size and connectivity, and it provides an integrated framework for both density-dependent and frequency-dependent transmission.

                The development of pancreatic cancer requires recruitment and activation of different macrophage populations. However, little is known about how macrophages are attracted to the pancreas after injury or an oncogenic event, and how they crosstalk with lesion cells or other cells of the lesion microenvironment. Here, we delineate the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during the early phase of murine pancreatic cancer. We show that CXCL10 is produced by pancreatic precancerous lesion cells in response to IFNγ signaling, and that inflammatory macrophages are recipients for this chemokine. CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in macrophages mediates their chemoattraction to the pancreas, enhances their proliferation and maintains their inflammatory identity. Blocking of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling <i>in vivo</i> shifts macrophage populations to a tumor promoting (Ym1<sup>+</sup>, Fizz<sup>+</sup>, Arg1<sup>+</sup>) phenotype, increases fibrosis and mediates progression of lesions, highlighting the importance of this pathway in PDA development. This is reversed when CXCL10 is overexpressed in PanIN cells.

                Correlates of sensory stimuli and motor actions are found in multiple cortical areas, but such correlates do not indicate whether these areas are causally relevant to task performance. We trained mice to discriminate visual contrast and report their decision by steering a wheel. Widefield calcium imaging and Neuropixels recordings in cortex revealed stimulus-related activity in visual (VIS) and frontal (MOs) areas, and widespread movement-related activity across the whole dorsal cortex. Optogenetic inactivation biased choices only when targeted at VIS and MOs,proportionally to each site's encoding of the visual stimulus, and at times corresponding to peak stimulus decoding. A neurometric model based on summing and subtracting activity in VIS and MOs successfully described behavioral performance and predicted the effect of optogenetic inactivation. Thus, sensory signals localized in visual and frontal cortex play a causal role in task performance, while widespread dorsal cortical signals correlating with movement reflect processes that do not play a causal role.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-term stability of cortical ensembles</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ensembles, coactive groups of neurons found in spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, are causally related to memories and perception, but it still unknown how stable or flexible they are over time. We used two-photon multiplane calcium imaging to track over weeks the activity of the same pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex from awake mice and recorded their spontaneous and visually evoked responses. Less than half of the neurons were commonly active across any two imaging sessions. These 'common neurons' formed stable ensembles lasting weeks, but some ensembles were also transient and appeared only in one single session. Stable ensembles preserved ~68 % of their neurons up to 46 days, our longest imaged period, and these 'core' cells had stronger functional connectivity. Our results demonstrate that neuronal ensembles can last for weeks and could, in principle, serve as a substrate for long-lasting representation of perceptual states or memories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast and flexible estimation of effective migration surfaces</a></h4>

              
                Spatial population genetic data often exhibits ‘isolation-by-distance,’ where genetic similarity tends to decrease as individuals become more geographically distant. The rate at which genetic similarity decays with distance is often spatially heterogeneous due to variable population processes like genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Petkova et al., 2016 developed a statistical method called Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) for visualizing spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance on a geographic map. While EEMS is a powerful tool for depicting spatial population structure, it can suffer from slow runtimes. Here, we develop a related method called Fast Estimation of Effective Migration Surfaces (FEEMS). FEEMS uses a Gaussian Markov Random Field model in a penalized likelihood framework that allows for efficient optimization and output of effective migration surfaces. Further, the efficient optimization facilitates the inference of migration parameters per edge in the graph, rather than per node (as in EEMS). With simulations, we show conditions under which FEEMS can accurately recover effective migration surfaces with complex gene-flow histories, including those with anisotropy. We apply FEEMS to population genetic data from North American gray wolves and show it performs favorably in comparison to EEMS, with solutions obtained orders of magnitude faster. Overall, FEEMS expands the ability of users to quickly visualize and interpret spatial structure in their data.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple neuronal networks coordinate Hydra mechanosensory behavior</a></h4>

              
                <i>Hydra vulgaris</i> is an emerging model organism for neuroscience due to its small size, transparency, genetic tractability, and regenerative nervous system; however, fundamental properties of its sensorimotor behaviors remain unknown. Here, we use microfluidic devices combined with fluorescent calcium imaging and surgical resectioning to study how the diffuse nervous system coordinates <i>Hydra</i>'s mechanosensory response. Mechanical stimuli cause animals to contract, and we find this response relies on at least two distinct networks of neurons in the oral and aboral regions of the animal. Different activity patterns arise in these networks depending on whether the animal is contracting spontaneously or contracting in response to mechanical stimulation. Together, these findings improve our understanding of how <i>Hydra</i>’s diffuse nervous system coordinates sensorimotor behaviors. These insights help reveal how sensory information is processed in an animal with a diffuse, radially symmetric neural architecture unlike the dense, bilaterally symmetric nervous systems found in most model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Application of human liver organoids as a patient-derived primary model for HBV infection and related hepatocellular carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                The molecular events that drive Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis have remained largely unclear, due to the absence of a relevant primary model system. Here we propose the use of human liver organoids as a platform for modeling HBV infection and related tumorigenesis. We first describe a primary ex vivo HBV-infection model derived from healthy donor liver organoids after challenge with recombinant virus or HBV-infected patient serum. HBV infected organoids produced cccDNA, HBeAg, expressed intracellular HBV RNA and proteins, and produced infectious HBV. This ex vivo HBV infected primary differentiated hepatocyte organoid platform was amenable to drug screening for both anti-HBV activity as well as for drug-induced toxicity. We also studied HBV replication in transgenically modified organoids; liver organoids exogenously overexpressing the HBV receptor NTCP after lentiviral transduction were not more susceptible to HBV, suggesting the necessity for additional host factors for efficient infection. We also generated transgenic organoids harboring integrated HBV, representing a long-term culture system also suitable for viral production and the study of HBV transcription. Finally, we generated HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids from non-tumor cirrhotic tissue of explants from liver transplant patients. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived liver organoids indicated the presence of an aberrant early cancer gene signature, which clustered with the HCC cohort on the TCGA LIHC dataset and away from healthy liver tissue, and may provide invaluable novel biomarkers for the development of HCC and surveillance in HBV infected patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single caudate neurons encode temporally discounted value for formulating motivation for action</a></h4>

              
                The term ‘temporal discounting’ describes both choice preferences and motivation for delayed rewards. Here we show that neuronal activity in the dorsal part of the primate caudate head (dCDh) signals the temporally discounted value needed to compute the motivation for delayed rewards. Macaque monkeys performed an instrumental task, in which visual cues indicated the forthcoming size and delay duration before reward. Single dCDh neurons represented the temporally discounted value without reflecting changes in the animal’s physiological state. Bilateral pharmacological or chemogenetic inactivation of dCDh markedly distorted the normal task performance based on the integration of reward size and delay, but did not affect the task performance for different reward sizes without delay. These results suggest that dCDh is involved in encoding the integrated multidimensional information critical for motivation.
