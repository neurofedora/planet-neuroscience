	<p>Calcium imaging, especially two-photon imaging, has become essential in neuroscience for studying neuronal and astrocytic activity under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Current advances in the development of calcium sensors as well as imaging hardware enable high-frequency measurements of calcium signals in hundreds of cells simultaneously. The analysis of these large datasets requires special tools and usually a certain level of programming experience. Despite advancements in calcium imaging analysis software development, significant gaps remain, particularly for data acquired at a high sampling rate that would allow for the spectral analysis of calcium signals. The FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox addresses these gaps by offering a comprehensive solution for analyzing simultaneously measured calcium imaging and electrophysiological data. It features both GUI-based and command-line approaches, emphasizing frequency domain analysis to reveal network-level oscillatory signals linked to single-cell activity. In addition, the toolbox puts special emphasis on differentiating between astrocytes and neurons, revealing the interactions between the network activity of the two major cell types of the brain. It facilitates a streamlined workflow for data loading, ROI identification, cell classification, fluorescence intensity calculation, spectral analysis, and report generation, supporting both manual and automated high-throughput analysis. This versatile platform enables the comprehensive analysis of large imaging datasets. In conclusion, the FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox provides a robust and versatile platform for the integrated analysis of calcium imaging and electrophysiological data, supporting diverse neuroscience research applications.</p>

">Cell type and locus-specific epigenetic editing of memory expression</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic modifications parallel multiple memory processes, but evidence that the epigenetic makeup of a single site can guide learnt behaviors has so far been lacking. Here, we developed CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools to address this question in a cell type-specific, locus-restricted and temporally controllable manner in the adult mouse brain. Focusing on learning-induced neuronal populations, we provide a proof-of-principle that site-specific epigenetic dynamics are causally implicated in memory expression.

">Loss of Zmiz1 in mice leads to impaired cortical development and autistic-like behaviors</a></h4>

              
                De novo mutations in transcriptional regulators are emerging as key risk factors contributing to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Human genetic studies have recently identified ZMIZ1 and its de novo mutations as causal of a neurodevelopmental syndrome strongly associated with intellectual disability, autism, ADHD, microcephaly, and other developmental anomalies. However, the role of ZMIZ in brain development or how ZMIZ1 mutations cause neurological phenotypes is unknown. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific Zmiz1 mutant mouse model that develops brain abnormalities, including cortical microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and abnormal differentiation of upper-layer cortical neurons. Behaviorally, Zmiz1 mutant mice show alterations in motor activity, anxiety, communication, and social interactions with strong sex differences, resembling phenotypes associated with autism. Molecularly, Zmiz1 deficiency leads to transcriptomic changes disrupting neurogenesis, neuron differentiation programs, and synaptic signaling. We identified Zmiz1-mediated downstream regulation of key neurodevelopmental factors, including Lhx2, Auts2, and EfnB2. Importantly, reactivation of the EfnB2 pathway by exogenous EFNB2 recombinant protein rescues the dendritic outgrowth deficits in Zmiz1 mutant cortical neurons. Overall, our in vivo findings provide insight into Zmiz1 function in cortical development and reveal mechanistic underpinnings of ZMIZ1 syndrome, thereby providing valuable information relevant to future studies on this neurodevelopmental disorder.

">Characterization of direct Purkinje cell outputs to the brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Purkinje cells (PCs) primarily project to cerebellar nuclei but also directly innervate the brainstem. Some PC-brainstem projections have been described previously, but most have not been thoroughly characterized. Here we use a PC-specific cre line to anatomically and electrophysiologically characterize PC projections to the brainstem. PC synapses are surprisingly widespread, with the highest densities found in the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. However, there are pronounced regional differences in synaptic densities within both the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. Large optogenetically-evoked PC-IPSCs are preferentially observed in subregions with the highest densities of PC synapses, suggesting that PCs selectively influence these areas and the behaviors they regulate. Unexpectedly, the pontine central gray and nearby subnuclei also contained a low density of PC synapses, and large PC-IPSCs are observed in a small fraction of cells. We combined electrophysiological recordings with immunohistochemistry to assess the molecular identities of these PC targets. PC synapses onto mesencephalic trigeminal neurons were not observed even though these cells are in close proximity to PC boutons. PC synapses onto locus coeruleus neurons are exceedingly rare or absent, even though previous studies concluded that PCs are a major input to these neurons. The availability of a highly selective cre line for PCs allowed us to study functional synapses, while avoiding complications that can accompany the use of viral approaches. We conclude that PCs directly innervate numerous brainstem nuclei, but only inhibit a small fraction of cells in many nuclei. This suggests that PCs target cell types with specific behavioral roles in brainstem regions.

">Task-related activity in auditory cortex enhances sound representation</a></h4>

              
                In auditory-guided tasks, sound presentations often occupy a small fraction of the total task time. We studied here neuronal dynamics that spanned trial duration. Many neurons had large, slow, firing rate modulations, which were not driven by sounds, were larger than the sound evoked responses, and were locked to specific time points during the task, similar to responses of hippocampal time-sensitive neurons. Concurrently, responses to sounds differed between active behavior and passive listening conditions: in the active sessions, the on-going activity just before sound presentations was higher and the responses to target stimuli were weaker but more informative about the task-relevant sounds. We show that the slow firing rate modulations caused the increased on-going activity. Using a model, we demonstrate that higher on-going activity led to more synaptic depression of the cortico-cortical synapses, reducing the tendency to produce population spikes and resulting in weaker but more informative responses.

">Locus coeruleus activation 'resets' hippocampal event representations and separates adjacent memories</a></h4>

              
                Memories reflect the ebb and flow of experiences, capturing unique and meaningful events from our lives. Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuromelanin imaging, and pupillometry, we show that arousal and locus coeruleus (LC) activation transform otherwise continuous experiences into distinct episodic memories. As sequences unfold, encountering a context shift, or event boundary, triggers arousal and LC processes that predict later memory separation. Boundaries furthermore promote temporal pattern separation within left hippocampal dentate gyrus, which correlates with heightened LC responses to those same transition points. We also find that a neurochemical index of prolonged LC activation correlates with diminished arousal responses at boundaries, suggesting a connection between elevated LC output and impaired event processing. These findings align with the idea that arousal processes initiate a neural and memory reset in response to significant changes, constructing the very episodes that define everyday memory.

">Prelimbic corticopontine neurons gate extinction learning</a></h4>

              
                The prelimbic cortex is essential for association of temporally separated events, and impedes extinction of learned association. The network mechanism underlying reversal learning, however, remains elusive. Here, we found that mitochondria-dependent post-tetanic potentiation at synapses onto prelimbic corticopontine neurons impedes extinction learning without affecting initial associative learning. Rats underwent trace fear conditioning followed by extinction sessions. Pharmacological inhibition of post-tetanic potentiation using tetaraphenylphosphnium (TPP), a mitochondrial Ca2+ release blocker, accelerated extinction of trace fear memory, leaving trace fear memory formation intact. Optogenetic inhibition of corticopontine, but not commissural, neurons phenocopied these effects. Electrophysiological recordings and Ca2+ imaging revealed that TPP treatment reduced the persistent activity of corticopontine neurons encoding tone presentation. Mechanistically, associative learning triggers the bursting activity of prelimbic pyramidal neurons that induces post-tetanic potentiation of corticopontine neurons, an effect blocked by TPP treatment. Thus, we identified a prelimbic cell type- and local circuit-specific mechanism that selectively gates extinction learning.

">Iron chelation by oral deferoxamine treatment decreased brain iron and iron signaling proteins</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deferoxamine (DFO) and other iron chelators are clinically used for cancer and stroke. They may also be useful for Alzheimers disease (AD) to diminish iron from microbleeds. DFO may also stimulate antioxidant membrane repair which is impaired during AD. DFO, and other chelators do enter the brain despite some contrary reports. Objective: Low dose, oral DFO was given in lab chow to wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice to evaluate potential impact on iron levels, iron-signaling and storage proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) and processing enzymes. Young WT mice do not have microbleeds or disrupted blood-brain barrier of AD mice. Methods: Iron was measured by MRI and chemically after two weeks of dietary DFO. Cerebral cortex was examined for changes in iron metabolism, antioxidant signaling, and APP processing by Western blot. Results: DFO decreased brain iron by 18% (MRI) and decreased seven major proteins that mediate iron metabolism by at least 25%. The iron storage proteins ferritin light and heavy chain decreased by at least 30%. APP and secretase enzymes also decreased by 30%. Conclusions: WT mice respond to DFO with decreased APP, amyloid processing enzymes, and antioxidant repair. Potential DFO treatment for early-stage AD by DFO should consider the benefits of lowered APP and secretase enzymes.

	<p>Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are often only partially effective, with many patients experiencing no significant benefit, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, a classical serotonergic psychedelic, has emerged as a notable emerging treatment for such disorders. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize and discuss the most recent evidence about the therapeutic effects of single-dose and two-dose psilocybin administration on the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as compare the efficacy of these interventions among patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD or TRD. Articles were collected from EBSCOhost and PubMed following the PRISMA guidelines, yielding 425 articles with 138 duplicates. After screening 287 records, 12 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A quantitative analysis of the studies indicates that psilocybin is highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms severity among patients with primary MDD or TRD. Both single-dose and two-dose psilocybin treatments significantly reduced depressive symptoms severity, with two-dose administration sometimes yielding more pronounced and lasting effects. However, it is unclear if this was solely due to dosage or other factors. Future research should include standardized trials comparing these dosing strategies to better inform clinical practice.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

Matrix stiffness increases CLIC1 levels through the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF4 pathway, correlating with adverse outcomes and tumor progression. Reducing matrix stiffness may offer therapeutic benefits by targeting CLIC1.

                The value of visual stimuli guides learning, decision-making and motivation. Although stimulus values often depend on multiple attributes, how neurons extract and integrate distinct value components from separate cues remains unclear. Here we recorded the activity of amygdala neurons while monkeys viewed sequential cues indicating the probability and magnitude of expected rewards. Amygdala neurons frequently signalled reward probability in an abstract, stimulus-independent code that generalized across cue formats. While some probability-coding neurons were insensitive to magnitude, signalling pure probability rather than value, many neurons showed biphasic responses that signalled probability and magnitude in a dynamic (temporally-patterned) and flexible (reversible) value code. Specific neurons integrated these reward attributes into risk signals that quantified the uncertainty of expected rewards, distinct from value. Population codes were accurate, mutually transferable between value components and expressed differently across amygdala nuclei. Our findings identify amygdala neurons as a substrate for the sequential integration of multiple reward attributes into value and risk.

">A triple dissociation across the medial, ventral, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex in rats making sequential foraging decisions</a></h4>

              
                The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is functionally heterogeneous across its medial-to-lateral axis, though the nature of this heterogeneity is unclear. The present study leveraged high-density neural recording across the medial-to-lateral span of the OFC using a neuroeconomic task in rats to clarify how functional heterogeneity within the OFC participates in sequential cost-benefit foraging. Lateral and ventral OFC contained opposing representations of an encountered reward's subjective benefit and its associated opportunity costs, respectively. These representations directly competed to make accept-reject decisions during reward evaluation. If a poor-quality reward was mistakenly accepted, ventral and medial OFC participated in reevaluation processes during change-of-mind decisions. Collectively, these results suggest a triple dissociation in representational content and timing across the medial-to-lateral OFC during sequential foraging.

">C9orf72 repeat expansion-carrying iPSC-microglia from FTD patients show increased phagocytic activity concomitantly with decreased number of autophagosomal-lysosomal vesicles</a></h4>

              
                C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) is a major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The role of microglia in these C9orf72 HRE-associated diseases is understudied. To elucidate effects of C9orf72 HRE on microglia, we have characterized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) from behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients carrying the C9orf72 HRE. C9orf72 HRE iMG were compared to iMG from healthy controls and sporadic bvFTD patients. The phenotypes of iMG were analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing, biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses, and live cell imaging. C9orf72 HRE-carrying iMG showed nuclear RNA foci and poly-GP dipeptide repeat proteins but no decreased C9orf72 mRNA or protein expression. TDP-43 pathology was absent from all bvFTD iMG. As compared to healthy control iMG, quantitative immunofluorescence analyses indicated that all bvFTD iMG had reduced number, size, and intensity of LAMP2-A-positive vesicles. C9orf72 HRE-carrying iMG additionally showed decreased number, size, and intensity of p62/SQSTM1-positive vesicles. These changes were accompanied by increased phagocytic activity of the C9orf72 HRE-carrying iMG. Serum starvation increased phagocytic activity also in the iMG of sporadic bvFTD patients. RNA sequencing revealed that iMG of C9orf72 HRE-carrying bvFTD patients as compared to the iMG of sporadic bvFTD patients showed differential gene expression in pathways related to RNA and protein regulation and mitochondrial metabolism. Our data suggest potential alterations in the autophagosomal/lysosomal pathways in bvFTD patient iMG, which are further reinforced by the C9orf72 HRE and functionally manifest as increased phagocytic activity.

">A nanobody-based proximity ligation assay detects constitutive and stimulus-regulated native Arc/Arg3.1 oligomers in hippocampal neuronal dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc), the product of an immediate early gene, plays critical roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. Evidence suggests that Arc function is determined by its oligomeric state, however, methods for localization of native Arc oligomers are lacking. Here, we developed a nanobody-based proximity ligation assay (PLA) for detection, localization, and quantification of Arc-Arc complexes in primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. We used nanobodies with single, structurally defined epitopes in the bilobar Arc capsid domain. Nanobody H11 binds inside the N-lobe ligand pocket, while nanobody C11 binds to the C-lobe surface. For each nanobody, ALFA- and FLAG-epitope tags created a platform for antibody binding and PLA. Surprisingly, PLA puncta in neuronal dendrites revealed widespread constitutive Arc-Arc complexes. Treatment of cultures with tetrodotoxin or cycloheximide had no effect, suggesting stable complexes that are independent of recent neuronal activity and protein synthesis. To assess detection of oligomers, cultures were exposed to a cell-penetrating peptide inhibitor of the Arc oligomerization motif (OligoOFF). Arc-Arc complexes detected by H11 PLA were inhibited by OligoOff but not by control peptide. Notably, Arc complexes detected by C11 were unaffected by OligoOFF. Furthermore, we evaluated Arc complex formation after chemical stimuli that increase Arc synthesis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor increased Arc-Arc signal detected by C11, but not H11. Conversely, dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) treatment selectively enhanced H11 PLA signals. In sum, nanobody-based PLA reveals constitutive and stimulus-regulated Arc oligomers in hippocampal neuronal dendrites. A model is proposed based on detection of Arc dimer by C11 and higher-order oligomer by H11 nanobody.

">Integrative genomics approach identifies glial transcriptomic dysregulation and risk in the cortex of individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder that is a major global health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Past molecular studies of AUD used underpowered single cell analysis or bulk homogenates of postmortem brain tissue, which obscures gene expression changes in specific cell types. Here we performed single nuclei RNA-sequencing analysis of 73 post-mortem samples from individuals with AUD (N=36, Nnuclei= 248,873) and neurotypical controls (N=37, Nnuclei= 210,573) in both sexes across two institutional sites. We identified 32 clusters and found widespread cell type-specific transcriptomic changes across the cortex in AUD, particularly affecting glia. We found the greatest dysregulation in novel microglial and astrocytic subtypes that accounted for the majority of differential gene expression and co-expression modules linked to AUD. Analysis for cell type-specific enrichment of aggregate genetic risk for AUD identified subtypes of glial and neuronal cell types as potential key players not only affected by but causally linked to the progression of AUD. Most of the enrichments for genetic risk for AUD were in glial cell types. These results highlight the importance of cell-type specific molecular changes in AUD and offer opportunities to identify novel targets for treatment.

">Electrical Synapse Rectification Enables Dual-Network Activity in the crab Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Flexibility of rhythmic networks includes neuromodulator-elicited changes in neuronal participation between networks. We are examining the role of rectifying electrical synapses in this neuronal switching. Electrical synapses can have complex, non-intuitive effects on network output. However, it is often difficult to measure and manipulate rectification across conditions to determine their functional contributions. Here, we use the Jonah crab Cancer borealis to investigate rectification in well-described rhythmic networks. In an established modulatory state, stimulating the projection neuron MCN5 or bath applying its neuropeptide Gly1-SIFamide causes the two LPG neurons to switch from pyloric rhythm-only (food filtering, 1 Hz) activity to dual pyloric and gastric mill rhythm (chewing, 0.1 Hz) activity. Typically, LPG is co-active with the two PD and single AB pyloric pacemaker neurons due to rectifying electrical coupling. In Gly1-SIFamide, LPG continues to burst in pyloric time with AB/PD but periodically escapes and generates intrinsic longer-duration gastric mill-timed bursts, decreasing its overall synchrony with AB/PD, while AB/PD retain their synchronous pyloric timing. Using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, we find that Gly1-SIFamide does not alter electrical coupling strength or the rectification between LPG and AB/PD. However, in a computational model, rectification is necessary for LPG to escape AB/PD electrical coupling and generate longer, gastric mill-timed bursts. This was confirmed in the biological system by adding a dynamic clamp non-rectifying electrical synapse between LPG and PD, which decreased the LPG escape from AB/PD and its gastric mill-timed activity. Thus, rectification between electrically coupled oscillators can underlie modulator-elicited changes in their synchrony.

">Overcoming off-target optical stimulation-evoked cortical activity in the mouse brain in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Genetic engineering of exogenous opsins sensitive to a wide range of light wavelengths allows the interrogation of brain circuits to an unprecedented temporal and spatial precision. In particular, red-shifted opsins offer access deeper within the brain tissue. It is however crucial to consider the potential unintended back-activation of endogenous opsins due to laser light striking the back of the retina. Here, we found that in complete darkness and with no expression of exogenous opsins, optical fiber laser stimulation at wavelengths of 637 nm (red), 594 nm (yellow), or 473 nm (blue) from within the ipsilateral mouse visual cortex resulted in a strong neuronal response in its contralateral counterpart. This neuronal activation occurred even at low laser intensities (1 mW at the fiber tip, ~31.8 mW/mm2) and was most pronounced using red wavelengths. We therefore took advantage of retinal light adaptation using external illumination with a relatively dim ambient light source (20 lux) which was found to completely abolish orange and blue laser-evoked neuronal activation from within the brain, even at high laser intensities (15 mW, ~477.3 mW/mm2). To prevent red laser-evoked retinal activation, however, only much lower intensities (2.5 mW, ~79.6 mW/mm2) combined with external illumination (20 lux) could be used. These findings demonstrate the critical need for careful selection of light wavelengths and intensities for laser stimulation during optogenetic experiments in the mouse brain in vivo. Additionally, light adaptation of the retina through ambient light exposure offers an effective solution to minimize unintended retinal activation.

">Quantitative 3D histochemistry reveals region-specific amyloid-β reduction by the antidiabetic drug netoglitazone</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the extracellular aggregation of toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides in form of plaques. Here, we identify netoglitazone, an antidiabetic compound previously tested in humans, as an A{beta} aggregation antagonist. Netoglitazone improved cognition and reduced microglia activity in a mouse model of AD. Using quantitative whole-brain three-dimensional histology (Q3D), we precisely identified brain regions where netoglitazone reduced the number and size of A{beta} plaques. We demonstrate the utility of Q3D in preclinical drug evaluation for AD by providing a high-resolution brain-wide view of drug efficacy. Applying Q3D has the potential to improve pre-clinical drug evaluation by providing information that can help identify mechanisms leading to brain region-specific drug efficacy.

">Novel tau filament folds in individuals with MAPT mutations P301L and P301T</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in MAPT, the microtubule-associated protein tau gene, give rise to cases of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) with abundant filamentous tau inclusions in brain cells. Individuals with pathological MAPT variants exhibit behavioural changes, cognitive impairment and signs of parkinsonism. Missense mutations of residue P301, which are the most common MAPT mutations associated with FTDP-17, give rise to the assembly of mutant four-repeat tau into filamentous inclusions, in the absence of extracellular deposits. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from five individuals belonging to three unrelated families with mutation P301L and from one individual belonging to a family with mutation P301T. A novel three-lobed tau fold resembling the two-layered tau fold of Pick's disease was present in all cases with the P301L tau mutation. Two different tau folds were found in the case with mutation P301T, the less abundant of which was a variant of the three-lobed fold. The major P301T tau fold was V-shaped, with partial similarity to the four-layered tau folds of corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain disease. These findings suggest that FTDP-17 with mutations in P301 should be considered distinct inherited tauopathies and that model systems with these mutations should be used with caution in the study of sporadic tauopathies.

">Relationships of hematocrit concentration with dementia from a multiethnic population-based study</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Red blood cell (RBC) concentration impacts cerebrovascular disease, yet it is unclear whether RBC concentrations relate to dementia risk, particularly in racially/ethnically diverse cohorts. We investigated whether RBC concentrations associate with incident dementia risk in a diverse population of stroke-free individuals and explored whether cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) mediates this relationship. Methods: A longitudinal observational analysis was performed using a population-based cohort of stroke-free, older adult participants (>50 years) from the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) enrolled between 2003-2008. Participants received baseline hematocrit testing, MRI neuroimaging, and cognitive assessments at baseline and long-term follow-up. Associations of baseline hematocrit as a categorical variable (low, normal [reference], and high based on laboratory reference levels) with incident dementia were assessed using Cox models adjusting for relevant covariates. Separate analyses investigated whether MRI CSVD mediated these relationships. Results: We studied 1207 NOMAS participants (mean age 71{+/-}9 years, 60% female, 66% Hispanic). Mean hematocrit was 41.2% ({+/-}3.8) with 16% of participants developing incident dementia. Lower hematocrit associated with increased dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81 [1.01-3.23]) after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, APOE status, and comorbidities. High hematocrit was not associated with dementia risk. No interactions by sex or race/ethnicity were seen and baseline CSVD did not mediate relationships between hematocrit and dementia. Conclusions: Low hematocrit associated with dementia risk in our diverse population cohort. Further work is needed to assess mechanisms behind anemia's relationship with dementia to assess whether this can serve as a trackable, preventable/treatable risk factor for dementia.

">Recovery of Verbal Working Memory Depends on Left Hemisphere White Matter Tracts</a></h4>

              
                Researchers propose that the recovery of language function following stroke depends on the recruitment of perilesional regions in the left hemisphere and/or homologous regions in the right hemisphere. Many investigations of recovery focus on changes in gray matter regions, whereas relatively few examine white matter tracts and none address the role of these tracts in the recovery of verbal working memory (WM). The present study addressed these gaps, examining the role of left vs. right hemisphere tracts in the longitudinal recovery of phonological and semantic WM. For 24 individuals with left hemisphere stroke, we assessed WM performance within one week of stroke (acute timepoint) and at more than six months after stroke (chronic timepoint). To address whether recovery depends on the recruitment of left or right hemisphere tracts, we assessed whether changes in WM were related to the integrity of five white matter tracts in the left hemisphere which had been implicated previously in verbal WM and their right hemisphere analogues. Behavioral results showed significant improvement in semantic but not phonological WM from the acute to chronic timepoints. Improvements in semantic WM significantly correlated with tract integrity as measured by functional anisotropy in the left direct segment of the arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. The results confirm the role of white matter tracts in language recovery and support the involvement of the left rather than right hemisphere in the recovery of semantic WM.

	<p>(1) Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) utilizing multi-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (ME-GE-EPI) has demonstrated higher sensitivity and stability compared to utilizing single-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (SE-GE-EPI). The direct derivation of T2* maps from fitting multi-echo data enables accurate recording of dynamic functional changes in the brain, exhibiting higher sensitivity than echo combination maps. However, the widely employed voxel-wise log-linear fitting is susceptible to inevitable noise accumulation during image acquisition. (2) Methods: This work introduced a synthetic data-driven deep learning (SD-DL) method to obtain T2* maps for multi-echo (ME) fMRI analysis. (3) Results: The experimental results showed the efficient enhancement of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), improved task-based blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) percentage signal change, and enhanced performance in multi-echo independent component analysis (MEICA) using the proposed method. (4) Conclusion: T2* maps derived from ME-fMRI data using the proposed SD-DL method exhibit enhanced BOLD sensitivity in comparison to T2* maps derived from the LLF method.</p>

	<p>In recent years, sports-related concussion (SRC) in soccer has been extensively researched worldwide. However, there have been no reports of large-scale SRC studies among soccer players in Japan. The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of SRC among university soccer players in Japan. This descriptive epidemiological study collected data on the history of SRC and details of SRC injuries during soccer. The participants were university male soccer players belonging to the Japan University Football Association. SRC rates were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). A total of 5953 students participated in this study. The SRC rate was 0.10/1000 AE during total activities. The SRC rate during competition (0.42/1000 AE) was higher than in practice (0.04/1000 AE). The most frequent mechanism of SRC was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (26.9%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (24.2%). During competition, the most frequent mechanism was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (30.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (19.3%) followed, while in practice, it was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (34.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (17.2%). Thus, there was a difference in the mechanism of injury between competition and practice. In this study, among Japanese university soccer players, the SRC rate was to be approximately ten times higher in competition than in practice.</p>

	<p>The current descriptive study reports the sleep, diet, and exercise patterns among 114 dementia caregivers, whose mean age was 55.7 (SD: 10.4) years, with 83 (72.8%) being women. The results indicate significant sleep dysfunction: 37.2% of caregivers reported rarely or never feeling rested upon waking, and 46.5% did not get enough sleep, with 45.6% sleeping only 5 to 5.5 h on average. Sleep latency was also prevalent, as 33.3% required 16 to 30 min to fall asleep. Dietary habits showed reliance on coffee, with 69.4% consuming it daily. Meat consumption was reported by 75%, and 60.9% ate pasta, indicating common dietary preferences. While 86.2% had one to three meals per day, 100% of the caregivers supplemented their diets with vitamins. The physical activity level was low, with 62.3% of respondents reporting no exercise in the past week. These findings underscore significant health concerns among dementia caregivers, including sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and physical inactivity. The report emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to promote self-care practices that can enhance caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; health, including better sleep hygiene, balanced nutrition, and regular exercise.</p>

	<p>Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), one of the 30 available fatigue questionnaires, is commonly applied because it evaluates multidimensional aspects of fatigue. The chief objectives of this study were to validate FIS and evaluate the psychometric properties of MS patients in Serbia. One hundred and twenty-one (121) MS patients and one hundred and twenty-two (122) age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects completed the FIS and the Beck Depression Inventory. Internal consistency of the FIS subscales was determined using Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha Coefficient. Test/retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for each FIS subscale was performed. The total FIS score and subscale scores showed statistically significant differences between the MS patients and the HC subjects in both FIS sessions. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha was 0.966. All ICCs were statistically significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The Serbian version of this instrument may be useful as a clinical measure for fatigue and functionality in patients with MS.</p>

                <p>by Catherine M Byrne, Ana Citlali Márquez, Bing Cai, Daniel Coombs, Soren Gantt</p>

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection. Several HCMV vaccines are in development, but none have yet been approved. An understanding of the kinetics of CMV replication and transmission may inform the rational design of vaccines to prevent this infection. The salivary glands (SG) are an important site of sustained CMV replication following primary infection and during viral reactivation from latency. As such, the strength of the immune response in the SG likely influences viral dissemination within and between hosts. To study the relationship between the immune response and viral replication in the SG, and viral dissemination from the SG to other tissues, mice were infected with low doses of murine CMV (MCMV). Following intra-SG inoculation, we characterized the viral and immunological dynamics in the SG, blood, and spleen, and identified organ-specific immune correlates of protection. Using these data, we constructed compartmental mathematical models of MCMV infection. Model fitting to data and analysis indicate the importance of cellular immune responses in different organs and point to a threshold of infection within the SG necessary for the establishment and spread of infection.

                <p>by Ao Liu, Andrea Mair, Juliana L. Matos, Macy Vollbrecht, Shou-Ling Xu, Dominique C. Bergmann</p>

The development of multicellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs, and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling—the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knockdown of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together, these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23621?af=R">17β‐Estradiol reduces inhibitory synaptic currents in entorhinal cortex neurons through G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-402/v2?src=rss">Anticancer activities of tocotrienols: A Systematic Scoping Review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The increasing number of cancer cases requires developing newer approaches to treat this disease. One approach uses natural compounds with known anticancer effects, such as tocotrienols. Many cell-based and animal-model studies found that tocotrienols possess potent anticancer activities. However, the exact molecular regulatory mechanism through which tocotrienols exert anticancer actions remains unclear. Methods: This scoping review analysed data from original research articles reporting on the anticancer effects of tocotrienols on human cancer cell lines published in the last seven years (January 2015 and September 2021) using a systematic scoping review approach. From the initial 619 research papers [ProQuest (n= 61), PubMed (n= 84), Embase (n = 148), Ovid Medline (n =53), Scopus (n = 137), Web of Science (n =136)] identified using pre-defined keywords, only 37 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review. Human cancers commonly studied in the 37 research articles include breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines. Results: The analysis showed that exposing human cancer cell lines to tocotrienols triggered common anticancer mechanisms such as activation of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis and cell migration through regulation of key regulatory genes and proteins involved in these pathways. Conclusions: The findings show that tocotrienols regulate a number of biomarkers that induce cell death and regulate cell cycle in various types of human cancer cells. Further targeted studies are required to map the definite pathways by which T3 exerts their action and to better understand the cellular actions and the regulatory pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81571">Membrane curvature sensing and symmetry breaking of the M2 proton channel from Influenza A</a></h4>

              
                The M2 proton channel aids in the exit of mature influenza viral particles from the host plasma membrane through its ability to stabilize regions of high negative gaussian curvature (NGC) that occur at the neck of budding virions. The channels are homo-tetramers that contain a cytoplasm-facing amphipathic helix (AH) that is necessary and sufficient for NGC generation; however, constructs containing the transmembrane spanning helix, which facilitates tetramerization, exhibit enhanced curvature generation. Here we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of M2 channels in lipid bilayers revealing that the AH is dynamic, quickly breaking the 4-fold symmetry observed in most structures. Next, we carried out MD simulations with the protein restrained in 4-fold and 2-fold symmetric conformations to determine the impact on the membrane shape. While each pattern was distinct, all configurations induced pronounced curvature in the outer leaflet, while conversely, the inner leaflets showed minimal curvature and significant lipid tilt around the AHs. The MD-generated profiles at the protein-membrane interface were then extracted and used as boundary conditions in a continuum elastic membrane model to calculate the membrane bending energy of each conformation embedded in different membrane surfaces characteristic of a budding virus. The calculations show that all three M2 conformations are stabilized in inward-budding, concave spherical caps and destabilized in outward-budding, convex spherical caps, the latter reminiscent of a budding virus. One of the C2-broken symmetry conformations is stabilized by 4 kT in NGC surfaces with the minimum energy conformation occurring at a curvature corresponding to 33 nm radii. In total, our work provides atomistic insight into the curvature sensing capabilities of M2 channels and how enrichment in the nascent viral particle depends on protein shape and membrane geometry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92826">Hyperglycemia induced cathepsin L maturation linked to diabetic comorbidities and COVID-19 mortality</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with <i>CTSL</i> knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i>mice and <i>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></i>mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91568">Biocalcification in porcelaneous foraminifera</a></h4>

              
                Living organisms control the formation of mineral skeletons and other structures through biomineralization. Major phylogenetic groups usually consistently follow a single biomineralization pathway. Foraminifera, which are very efficient marine calcifiers, making a substantial contribution to global carbonate production and global carbon sequestration, are regarded as an exception. This phylum has been commonly thought to follow two contrasting models of either <i>in situ</i> ‘mineralization of extracellular matrix’ attributed to hyaline rotaliid shells, or ‘mineralization within intracellular vesicles’ attributed to porcelaneous miliolid shells. Our previous results on rotaliids along with those on miliolids in this paper question such a wide divergence of biomineralization pathways within the same phylum of Foraminifera. We have found under a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that precipitation of high-Mg calcitic mesocrystals in porcelaneous shells takes place <i>in situ</i> and form a dense, chaotic meshwork of needle-like crystallites. We have not observed calcified needles that already precipitated in the transported vesicles, what challenges the previous model of miliolid mineralization. Hence, Foraminifera probably utilize less divergent calcification pathways, following the recently discovered biomineralization principles. Mesocrystalline chamber walls in both models are therefore most likely created by intravesicular accumulation of pre-formed liquid amorphous mineral phase deposited and crystallized within the extracellular organic matrix enclosed in a biologically controlled privileged space by active pseudopodial structures. Both calcification pathways evolved independently in the Paleozoic and are well conserved in two clades that represent different chamber formation modes.

">Instruction-tuned large language models misalign with natural language comprehension in humans</a></h4>

              
                Transformer-based language models have significantly advanced our understanding of meaning representation in the human brain. Prior research utilizing smaller models like BERT and GPT-2 suggests that "next-word prediction" is a computational principle shared between machines and humans. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of instruction tuning beyond next-word prediction. It remains to be tested whether instruction tuning can further align the model with language processing in the human brain. In this study, we evaluated the self-attention of base and finetuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading. Our results reveal that increases in model size significantly enhance the alignment between LLMs and brain activity, whereas instruction tuning does not. These findings confirm a scaling law in LLMs' brain-encoding performance and suggest that "instruction-following" may not mimic natural language comprehension in humans.

">Assessing white matter plasticity in a randomized controlled trial of early literacy training in preschoolers</a></h4>

              
                Reading is a cognitive skill that requires our brain to go through a myriad of changes during learning. While many studies have described how reading acquisition shapes childrens' brain function, less is known about the impact of reading on brain structure. Here we examined short-term causal effects of reading training on preschoolers' behavior and white matter structure. Forty-eight English-speaking preschoolers (4y10m to 6y2m) participated in a randomized controlled trial where they were randomly assigned to two training programs: the Letter training program was focused on key skills for reading (e.g., decoding and letter knowledge), while the Language training program strengthened oral language comprehension skills without exposure to text. Longitudinal behavioral data showed that only the Letter Training group increased letter knowledge and decoding skills after the two-week training. Diffusion MRI measures (FA and MD) of eighteen white matter pathways (including the left arcuate and the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus) did not reveal any statistically significant changes for either group despite high degrees of scan-rescan reliability across sessions. These findings suggest that a two-week reading training program can cause changes in preschoolers' letter knowledge and decoding abilities, without being accompanied by measurable changes in the diffusion properties of the major white matter pathways of the reading network. We conclude highlighting possible constraints (i.e., age, training onset and duration, cognitive profile) to reading-related white matter plasticity.

">Distinct Contributions of the Dorsal and Ventral Hippocampus to Spatial Working Memory and Spatial Coding in the Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus (HPC) supports spatial working memory (SWM) through its interactions with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, it is not clear whether and how the dorsal (dHPC) and ventral (vHPC) poles of the HPC make distinct contributions to SWM and whether they differentially influence the PFC. To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Silencing of either subregion altered the spatial firing patterns of PFC neurons. However, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally-relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.

">EEG source imaging technique to investigate sleep oscillations for simultaneous EEG-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used non-invasive neuroimaging technique in sleep studies. However, EEG data are strongly influenced by two types of MRI-related artefacts: gradient artefacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram artefacts (BCG). If artefacts correction is suboptimal, the BCG obscures the EEG signals below 20Hz and could make it difficult to investigate sleep oscillations, especially sleep spindles, sleep specific oscillations occurring within 11-16Hz frequency band. We previously demonstrated the utility of beamforming spatial filtering in correcting MRI-related artefacts on EEG. Here, we investigated the use of beamforming spatial filtering for improving the detection of EEG oscillations during sleep, in particular, 1) to accurately estimate single-event spindle EEG power changes, and 2) to demonstrate the potential improvement of fMRI general linear model (GLM) analysis when involving such additional EEG information. We analysed EEG-fMRI data acquired during a recovery nap after sleep deprivation in 20 young healthy participants (12 females, 8 males, age=21.3+/-2.5 years). Based on spindle events (onset and duration) detected by trained sleep scorers on BCG corrected EEG signals through a conventional average artefact subtraction (AAS) method, we compared four different EEG processing steps: non-BCG corrected; AAS BCG corrected; beamforming BCG corrected; beamforming+AAS BCG corrected. These processing steps consist of non-BCG corrected and AAS BCG corrected considered either at the sensor level or at the source-level (after beamformer localization) to evaluate the impact of the BCG artefact on the detection of spindle activity. Then we further investigated four different fMRI GLM approaches using 1) the spindle onset and duration (GLM1), 2) spindle onset, duration, and parametric modulation of single-spindle power change from the Cz electrode of the AAS BCG corrected data (GLM2), 3) spindle onset, duration, and parametric modulation of single-spindle power change from the beamforming+AAS BCG corrected (GLM3) and 4) spindle onset, duration, and parametric modulation of single-spindle power change from the beamforming BCG corrected data (GLM4). We found that the beamforming approach did not only attenuate the BCG artefacts, but also recovered sleep spindle activity occurring during NREM sleep. Furthermore, this beamforming approach allowed us to accurately estimate single-event power change of each spindle in the source space when compared to the channel level analysis, and therefore to further improve the specificity of fMRI GLM analysis, better localizing the recruited brain regions during spindles. Our findings show the benefit of applying beamforming source imaging technique to EEG-fMRI acquired during sleep. We demonstrate that this approach would be beneficial especially for long EEG-fMRI data acquisitions (i.e., sleep, resting-state), when the BCG correction becomes problematic due to inherent dynamic changes of heart rates. Our findings extend previous work regarding the application of the source imaging to the sleep EEG-fMRI. Combining with this advanced methodology and analysis, sleep EEG-fMRI will help us better understand the functional roles of human sleep.

">The ageing stopping network: Regional and network changes in the IFG, preSMA, and STN across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Response inhibition, the cancellation of planned movement, is essential for everyday motor control. Extensive fMRI and brain stimulation research provides evidence for the crucial role of a number of cortical and subcortical regions in response inhibition, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Current models assume that these regions operate as a network, with action cancellation originating in the cortical areas and then executed rapidly via the subcortex. Response inhibition slows in older age, a change that has been attributed to deterioration or changes in the connectivity and integrity of this network. However, previous research has mainly used whole-brain approaches when investigating changes in structural connectivity across the lifespan, or have used simpler measures to investigate structural ageing. Here, we used high-resolution quantitative and diffusion MRI to extensively examine the anatomical changes that occur in this network across the lifespan. We found substantial changes in iron concentration in these tracts, increases in the apparent diffusion coefficient, and some evidence for demyelination. Conversely, we found very little evidence for age-related anatomical changes in the regions themselves. We propose that some of the functional changes observed in these regions in older adult populations (e.g., increased BOLD recruitment) are a reflection of alterations to the connectivity between the regions, rather than localised regional change.

">Contingency awareness shapes neural responses in fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Contingency awareness refers to an observer's ability to identify the association between a conditioned (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US). A widely held belief in human fear conditioning is that this form of associative learning may occur independently of contingency awareness. To test this hypothesis, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/vywq7), we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) during a task, where participants were presented with compounds of words (from two semantic categories) and tactile stimulation, followed by either a neutral sound (US-) or a loud noise (US+). Based on interviews, participants were divided into an aware (N=50) and an unaware (N=31) group. Only the aware group showed signs of learning, as expressed in larger stimulus-preceding negativity developing before US+ and a stronger theta response to vibrations predicting US+. The aware group also showed stronger alpha and beta suppression around the vibrations and a weaker theta response to US+, possibly indicating heightened attention to the cue and the violation/confirmation of expectation. Personality tests showed that elevated anxiety, neuroticism, higher intolerance of uncertainty, or harm avoidance are not predictive to the acquisition of contingency awareness. Our findings support the notion that fear conditioning, as reflected in cortical measures, cannot occur without contingency awareness.

">Network models incorporating chloride dynamics predict optimal strategies for terminating status epilepticus</a></h4>

              
                Seizures that continue for beyond five minutes are classified as status epilepticus (SE) and constitute a medical emergency. Benzodiazepines, the current first-line treatment, attempt to terminate SE by increasing the conductance of chloride-permeable type-A GABA receptors (GABAARs). Despite their widespread use, benzodiazepines are ineffective in over a third of cases. Previous research in animal models has demonstrated that changes in intraneuronal chloride homeostasis and GABAAR physiology may underlie the development of benzodiazepine resistance in SE. However, there remains a need to understand the effect of these changes at a network level to improve translation into the clinical domain. Therefore, informed by data from human EEG recordings of SE and experimental brain slice recordings, we used a large spiking neural network model that incorporates chloride dynamics to investigate and address the phenomenon of benzodiazepine resistance in SE. We found that the GABAAR reversal potential (EGABA) sets SE-like bursting and determines the response to GABAAR conductance modulation, with benzodiazepines being anti-seizure at low EGABA and ineffective or pro-seizure at high EGABA. The SE-like activity and EGABA depended on a non-linear relationship between the strength of Cl- extrusion and GABAAR conductance, but not on the initial EGABA of neurons. Independently controlling Cl- extrusion in the pyramidal and interneuronal cell populations revealed the critical role of pyramidal cell Cl- extrusion in determining the severity of SE activity and the response to simulated benzodiazepine application. Finally, we demonstrate the model's utility for considering improved therapeutic approaches for terminating SE in the clinic.

">The brain simulates actions and their consequences during REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Vivid dreams mostly occur during a phase of sleep called REM. During REM sleep, the brain's internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal? Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.

">Parvalbumin expression identifies subicular principal cells with high projection specificity</a></h4>

              
                The calcium-binding protein parvalbumin is an established marker for a subset of cortical inhibitory interneurons with similar biophysical features and connectivity. However, parvalbumin is also expressed in a small population of excitatory cells in layer 5 of the neocortex with specific sub-cortical projection targets. Parvalbumin may thus also in principal cells identify particular subclasses with distinct connectivity and function. Here we investigated whether parvalbumin is expressed in excitatory neurons of the hippocampal formation and if so, whether it delineated neurons with specific features. We report parvalbumin-expressing glutamatergic cells in the distal subiculum, which - based on location, connectivity and gene expression - separated into two subclasses: neurons in deep layers, which specifically project to the antero-ventral thalamus and neurons in superficial layers, which project to the mamillary bodies. Contrary to most adjacent pyramidal cells parvalbumin-positive neurons were non-bursting and displayed straight apical dendrites devoid of oblique dendrites. Functionally, the projections diverged from classical driver/modulator subdivisions. Parvalbumin expression thus marks two sub-types of subicular projection neurons with high target specificity and unique functional features.

">The relationship between sleep and cognitive performance on tests of pattern separation</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Sleep disturbances are considered both a risk factor and symptom of dementia. The present research aimed to identify cognitive tests that are sensitive to sleep-dependent cognition, focusing on cognitive tests designed to evaluate the earliest cognitive changes in dementia. Methods: In Experiment 1, we recruited younger (n=89) and older (n=40) adults and remotely monitored their sleep patterns for 7 consecutive days using actigraphy and sleep diaries. On day 7, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests, which included the Prodromal Alzheimer's and MCI battery from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of a night of total sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in young adults. We observed a sleep deprived group (n=16) overnight in the lab. The rested control group (n=32) slept normally at home. Results: In Experiment 1, there was a significant relationship between performance on MST and total sleep time in the older adults. There were no relationships between cognitive performance and sleep quantity or quality in the younger adults. In the older adults, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were correlated with performance on the CANTAB and MST. In Experiment 2, the young adults who underwent 24-hour sleep deprivation performed worse than the rested participants on the MST task. Conclusion: Performance on cognitive tests designed to assess pattern separation are sensitive to sleep patterns, particularly in older adults and should be evaluated for potential use as clinical trial outcome measures for sleep-promoting treatments.

">A Biologically Inspired Attention Model for Neural Signal Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain represents sensory information and triggers behavioural responses is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Recent advances in neuronal recording techniques aim to progress towards this milestone, yet the resulting high dimensional responses are challenging to interpret and link to relevant variables. In this work, we introduce SPARKS, a model capable of generating low dimensional latent representations of high dimensional neural recordings. SPARKS adapts the self-attention mechanism of large language models to extract information from the timing of single spikes and the sequence in which neurons fire using Hebbian learning. Trained with a criterion inspired by predictive coding to enforce temporal coherence, our model produces interpretable embeddings that are robust across animals and sessions. Behavioural recordings can be used to inform the latent representations of the neural data, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive capabilities across diverse electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets from the motor, visual and entorhinal cortices. We also show how SPARKS can be applied to large neuronal networks by revealing the temporal evolution of visual information encoding across the hierarchy of the visual cortex. Overall, by integrating biological mechanisms into a machine learning model, we provide a powerful tool to study large-scale network dynamics. SPARKS' capacity to generalize across animals and behavioural states suggests it is capable of estimating the internal latent generative model of the world in animals, paving the way towards a foundation model for neuroscience.

">Age-dependent cortical overconnectivity revers under anesthesia in Shank3 mice</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence points to brain network dysfunction as a central neurobiological basis for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Consequently, studies on Functional Connectivity (FC) have become pivotal for understanding autism-related large-scale network dynamics. While autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, existing FC studies in mouse models largely focus on adult subjects under anesthesia. Given that FC can be significantly influenced by brain state, the differential impact of anesthesia on cortical functional networks in autistic subjects remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted a longitudinal evaluation of FC across three distinct brain states in the Shank3b mouse model of autism. We utilized wide-field calcium imaging to monitor cortical activity in Shank3b+/- and Shank3b+/+ mice from late development through adulthood, and isoflurane anesthesia to manipulate the brain state. Our findings reveal that network hyperconnectivity, initially evident in the barrel-field cortices during the juvenile stage, progressively expands to encompass the entire dorsal cortex in adult Shank3b+/- mice. Notably, the severity of FC imbalances is highly dependent on the brain state: network alterations are more pronounced in the awake state and shift towards hypoconnectivity under anesthesia. These results underscore the crucial role of anesthesia in detecting autism-related FC alterations and identify a significant network of early cortical dysfunction associated with autism. This network represents a potential target for non-invasive translational treatments.

	<p>Objectives: Hypersensitive acupoints in specific body areas are associated with corresponding internal or visceral disorders. Back-shu points are clinically significant for the diagnosis of visceral organ disease, according to the biomechanical characteristics of the acupoints. In this study, we assessed the biomechanical characteristics and pain sensitivities of five back-shu points linked to five visceral organs in healthy participants. Methods: The study included 48 volunteer participants. A myotonometry was used to assess muscle tone and muscle stiffness at five back-shu points associated with visceral organs. Pressure was monitored using a microcontroller and a force sensor. Pain sensitivity was assessed in response to deep pressure pain produced by a constant force. Results: Substantial differences in muscle tone and stiffness were observed at the five back-shu points; muscle tone was highest at BL15, whereas muscle tone and muscle stiffness were lowest at BL23. Moreover, pain sensitivity was significantly different among the acupoints; pain sensitivity was highest at BL23. There was a significant negative correlation between muscle tone and pain sensitivity. Conclusions: We found significant differences in muscle tone, muscle stiffness, and pain sensitivity among five back-shu points associated with visceral organs, which may be attributable to anatomical variations at each point. Our findings suggest that differences at back-shu points should be considered to ensure the accurate diagnosis of visceral disease.</p>

	<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered one of the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders. ECT has proven effective in the treatment of depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It is presumed that seizures induced during ECT administration cause toxicity and potentially neuronal and glial cell death. A broad range of neurological disorders increase cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100b protein. This study aims to investigate the effect of ECT on NSE and S-100b levels, which, together, serve as a proxy for neuronal cell damage. Serum concentrations of S-100b and NSE of adult patients who received ECT were measured by immunoluminometric analysis before and after treatment. A two-way ANOVA test was used to estimate the statistical differences in marker concentrations between the subgroups of the study population. Results: A total of 55 patients were included in the analysis: 52.73% (n = 29) were diagnosed with depression, 21.82% (n = 12) with schizophrenia or other psychosis, 16.36% (n = 9) with mania and 9.09% (n = 5) with catatonia. There were no statistically significant changes in NSE (p = 0.288) and S-100b (p = 0.243) levels. We found no evidence that ECT induced neuronal damage based on NSE and S-100b protein levels measured in the serum of patients before and after treatment.</p>

	<p>Tracheostomy ventilation (TV) can increase survival time for people living with motor neurone disease (MND); however, the use of TV varies between countries. Concerns regarding anticipated quality of life (QoL) are among the reasons given by healthcare professionals for not recommending this intervention, yet little is known about QoL in this context. This scoping review was conducted to examine the evidence on QoL for those with MND who use TV and family members involved in their care. Using the methodological guidance of the Joanna Briggs Institute, 23 papers were identified for inclusion, and findings were inductively analysed to identify key themes. We found that people living with MND tend to rate QoL post TV more positively than anticipated by healthcare professionals or family members. QoL was found to be related to positive relationships and activities the person could maintain. Feeling able to make a choice and an adequate level of financial resources were also important factors. Family members tended to experience lower QoL, associated with the uncertainty surrounding an emergency procedure and the complexity of subsequently required care. More evidence on QoL from the perspectives of people with MND who use TV is needed to support decision making and inform guidance.</p>

	<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can objectively reflect a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional state and have been widely studied in emotion recognition. However, the effective feature fusion and discriminative feature learning from EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS data is challenging. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition, a graph convolution and capsule attention network model (GCN-CA-CapsNet) is proposed. Firstly, EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS signals are collected from 50 subjects induced by emotional video clips. And then, the features of the EEG and fNIRS are extracted; the EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS features are fused to generate higher-quality primary capsules by graph convolution with the Pearson correlation adjacency matrix. Finally, the capsule attention module is introduced to assign different weights to the primary capsules, and higher-quality primary capsules are selected to generate better classification capsules in the dynamic routing mechanism. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method on our emotional EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS dataset with an ablation study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GCN-CA-CapsNet method achieves a more satisfactory performance against the state-of-the-art methods, and the average accuracy can increase by 3&amp;amp;ndash;11%.</p>

	<p>This study investigated relations between a measure of early-stage visual function and self-reported visual anomalies in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Eleven individuals at CHR identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) were recruited from a CHR-P research program in NYC. The sample was ~36% female, ranging from 16 to 33 years old (M = 23.90, SD = 6.14). Participants completed a contrast sensitivity task on an iPad with five spatial frequencies (0.41&amp;amp;ndash;13 cycles/degree) and completed the self-report Audio-Visual Abnormalities Questionnaire. Higher contrast sensitivity (better performance) to low spatial frequencies was associated with higher perceptual (r = 0.616, p = 0.044) and visual disturbances (r = 0.667, p = 0.025); lower contrast sensitivity to a middle spatial frequency was also associated with higher perceptual (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.604, p = 0.049) and visual disturbances (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.606, p = 0.048). This relation between the questionnaire and contrast sensitivity to low spatial frequency may be indicative of a reduction in lateral inhibition and &amp;amp;ldquo;flooding&amp;amp;rdquo; of environmental stimuli. The association with middle spatial frequencies, which play a critical role in face processing, may result in a range of perceptual abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that self-reported perceptual anomalies occur in these individuals and are linked to performance on a measure of early visual processing.</p>

                Background In Australia, we are not meeting our goals in relation to breastfeeding overall, and in particular, promoting and supporting breastfeeding rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies especially breastfeeding to at least six months. The WHO has recognised the importance of exclusively breastfeeding a baby for a minimum of six months to ensure a healthy start to life. Breastfeeding has been shown to be a protective factor against asthma and allergy development, ear disease, infections, respiratory illness and gastrointestinal issues. This study aims to improve predominant breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies in the Perth Metropolitan area (Western Australia, Australia). Methods and analysis We will use an interrupted time series design to determine the effectiveness of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program delivered over 6 months by selected community health staff. The intervention will be delivered at two community health regions and the remaining 17 community health regions will be the control group. The primary outcomes will be predominant breastfeeding rates at two and four months, and secondary outcomes will include any breastfeeding at two and four months, and hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and immunisation data at 6 months. Discussion The study will allow us to determine the breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal babies, identify the barriers and enablers to initiating and maintaining breastfeeding and determine whether a CQI program can achieve improvements in breastfeeding rates.

                <p>by Scott L. Nuismer, Andrew J. Basinski, Courtney L. Schreiner, Evan A. Eskew, Elisabeth Fichet-Calvet, Christopher H. Remien</p>

Reducing spillover of zoonotic pathogens is an appealing approach to preventing human disease and minimizing the risk of future epidemics and pandemics. Although the immediate human health benefit of reducing spillover is clear, over time, spillover reduction could lead to counterintuitive negative consequences for human health. Here, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to explore the conditions under which unanticipated consequences of spillover reduction can occur in systems where the severity of disease increases with age at infection. Our results demonstrate that, because the average age at infection increases as spillover is reduced, programs that reduce spillover can actually increase population-level disease burden if the clinical severity of infection increases sufficiently rapidly with age. If, however, immunity wanes over time and reinfection is possible, our results reveal that negative health impacts of spillover reduction become substantially less likely. When our model is parameterized using published data on Lassa virus in West Africa, it predicts that negative health outcomes are possible, but likely to be restricted to a small subset of populations where spillover is unusually intense. Together, our results suggest that adverse consequences of spillover reduction programs are unlikely but that the public health gains observed immediately after spillover reduction may fade over time as the age structure of immunity gradually re-equilibrates to a reduced force of infection.

                <p>by Rachael Stentiford, James C. Knight, Thomas Nowotny, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

The central complex of insects contains cells, organised as a ring attractor, that encode head direction. The ‘bump’ of activity in the ring can be updated by idiothetic cues and external sensory information. Plasticity at the synapses between these cells and the ring neurons, that are responsible for bringing sensory information into the central complex, has been proposed to form a mapping between visual cues and the heading estimate which allows for more accurate tracking of the current heading, than if only idiothetic information were used. In Drosophila, ring neurons have well characterised non-linear receptive fields. In this work we produce synthetic versions of these visual receptive fields using a combination of excitatory inputs and mutual inhibition between ring neurons. We use these receptive fields to bring visual information into a spiking neural network model of the insect central complex based on the recently published Drosophila connectome. Previous modelling work has focused on how this circuit functions as a ring attractor using the same type of simple visual cues commonly used experimentally. While we initially test the model on these simple stimuli, we then go on to apply the model to complex natural scenes containing multiple conflicting cues. We show that this simple visual filtering provided by the ring neurons is sufficient to form a mapping between heading and visual features and maintain the heading estimate in the absence of angular velocity input. The network is successful at tracking heading even when presented with videos of natural scenes containing conflicting information from environmental changes and translation of the camera.

Enteric pathogens navigate distinct regional microenvironments within the intestine that cue important adaptive behaviors. We investigated the response of <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>, a model of human pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection in mice, to regional gastrointestinal pH. We found that small intestinal pH (4.4–4.8) triggered virulence gene expression and altered cell morphology, supporting initial intestinal attachment, while higher pH, representative of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i>’s replicative niches further along the murine intestine, supported pathogen growth. Gastric pH, a key barrier to intestinal colonization, caused significant accumulation of intra-bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting growth of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i> and related human pathogens. Within-host adaptation increased gastric acid survival, which may be due to a robust acid tolerance response (ATR) induced at colonic pH. However, the intestinal environment changes throughout the course of infection. We found that murine gastric pH decreases postinfection, corresponding to increased serum gastrin levels and altered host expression of acid secretion-related genes. Similar responses following <i>Salmonella</i> infection may indicate a protective host response to limit further pathogen ingestion. Together, we highlight interlinked bacterial and host adaptive pH responses as an important component of host–pathogen coevolution.

                <p>by Alex E. Yuan, Wenying Shou</p>

In disciplines from biology to climate science, a routine task is to compute a correlation between a pair of time series and determine whether the correlation is statistically significant (i.e., unlikely under the null hypothesis that the time series are independent). This problem is challenging because time series typically exhibit autocorrelation and thus cannot be properly analyzed with the standard iid-oriented statistical tests. Although there are well-known parametric tests for time series, these are designed for linear correlation statistics and thus not suitable for the increasingly popular nonlinear correlation statistics. There are also nonparametric tests that can be used with any correlation statistic, but for these, the conditions that guarantee correct false positive rates are either restrictive or unclear. Here, we describe the truncated time-shift (TTS) test, a nonparametric procedure to test for dependence between 2 time series. We prove that this test correctly controls the false positive rate as long as one of the time series is stationary, a minimally restrictive requirement among current tests. The TTS test is versatile because it can be used with any correlation statistic. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that this test performs correctly even while other tests suffer high false positive rates. In simulation examples, simple guidelines for parameter choices allow high statistical power to be achieved with sufficient data. We apply the test to datasets from climatology, animal behavior, and microbiome science, verifying previously discovered dependence relationships and detecting additional relationships.

Horizontal mitochondrial transfer (HMT) has emerged as a novel phenomenon in cell biology, but it is unclear how this process of intercellular movement of mitochondria is regulated. A new study in <i>PLOS Biology</i> reports that ADP released by stressed cells is a signal that triggers HMT.

                <p>by Kevin Gross, Carl T. Bergstrom</p>

Scientific research requires taking risks, as the most cautious approaches are unlikely to lead to the most rapid progress. Yet, much funded scientific research plays it safe and funding agencies bemoan the difficulty of attracting high-risk, high-return research projects. Why don’t the incentives for scientific discovery adequately impel researchers toward such projects? Here, we adapt an economic contracting model to explore how the unobservability of risk and effort discourages risky research. The model considers a hidden-action problem, in which the scientific community must reward discoveries in a way that encourages effort and risk-taking while simultaneously protecting researchers’ livelihoods against the vicissitudes of scientific chance. Its challenge when doing so is that incentives to motivate effort clash with incentives to motivate risk-taking, because a failed project may be evidence of a risky undertaking but could also be the result of simple sloth. As a result, the incentives needed to encourage effort actively discourage risk-taking. Scientists respond by working on safe projects that generate evidence of effort but that don’t move science forward as rapidly as riskier projects would. A social planner who prizes scientific productivity above researchers’ well-being could remedy the problem by rewarding major discoveries richly enough to induce high-risk research, but in doing so would expose scientists to a degree of livelihood risk that ultimately leaves them worse off. Because the scientific community is approximately self-governing and constructs its own reward schedule, the incentives that researchers are willing to impose on themselves are inadequate to motivate the scientific risks that would best expedite scientific progress.

                <p>by Jessica E. Buddle, Lucy M. Thompson, Anne S. Williams, Rosanna C. T. Wright, William M. Durham, Claire E. Turner, Roy R. Chaudhuri, Michael A. Brockhurst, Robert P. Fagan</p>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> is an important human pathogen, for which there are very limited treatment options, primarily the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. In recent years, vancomycin resistance has emerged as a serious problem in several gram-positive pathogens, but high-level resistance has yet to be reported for <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>, although it is not known if this is due to constraints upon resistance evolution in this species. Here, we show that resistance to vancomycin can evolve rapidly under ramping selection but is accompanied by fitness costs and pleiotropic trade-offs, including sporulation defects that would be expected to severely impact transmission. We identified 2 distinct pathways to resistance, both of which are predicted to result in changes to the muropeptide terminal D-Ala-D-Ala that is the primary target of vancomycin. One of these pathways involves a previously uncharacterised D,D-carboxypeptidase, expression of which is controlled by a dedicated two-component signal transduction system. Our findings suggest that while <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> is capable of evolving high-level vancomycin resistance, this outcome may be limited clinically due to pleiotropic effects on key pathogenicity traits. Moreover, our data identify potential mutational routes to resistance that should be considered in genomic surveillance.

Protein import and genome replication are essential processes for mitochondrial biogenesis and propagation. The J-domain proteins Pam16 and Pam18 regulate the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the protozoan <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, their counterparts are TbPam16 and TbPam18, which are essential for the procyclic form (PCF) of the parasite, though not involved in mitochondrial protein import. Here, we show that during evolution, the 2 proteins have been repurposed to regulate the replication of maxicircles within the intricate kDNA network, the most complex mitochondrial genome known. TbPam18 and TbPam16 have inactive J-domains suggesting a function independent of heat shock proteins. However, their single transmembrane domain is essential for function. Pulldown of TbPam16 identifies a putative client protein, termed MaRF11, the depletion of which causes the selective loss of maxicircles, akin to the effects observed for TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, depletion of the mitochondrial proteasome results in increased levels of MaRF11. Thus, we have discovered a protein complex comprising TbPam18, TbPam16, and MaRF11, that controls maxicircle replication. We propose a working model in which the matrix protein MaRF11 functions downstream of the 2 integral inner membrane proteins TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, we suggest that the levels of MaRF11 are controlled by the mitochondrial proteasome.

                Purpose To explore how principles of social justice and equity are integrated into research concerning accessibility to public buildings for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Utilising a scoping review methodology to assess literature based on the criteria set by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were screened. Studies were selected using the framework: “persons with mobility disabilities” AND “accessibility” AND “public buildings”. A theoretical framework helped to extract codes and develop themes through an inductive-deductive analysis method. The results are presented descriptively. Results The examination of 84 studies uncovered a complex interplay between agencies, systemic challenges, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes perpetuating marginalisation of individuals with mobility disabilities in their access to public buildings. The recommendations emphasize importance of practical measures, research imperatives, and policy developments to promote inclusivity. We present a ‘Ten-step approach’ to integrate social justice and equity into research on accessibility in public buildings for people with mobility disabilities. Conclusion Integrating diversity, active participation, and inclusive methodologies are essential to address systemic issues, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes that hinder accessibility and inclusion. Collaborations with diverse stakeholders are crucial for policy changes, resource allocation, and advancing social justice and equity in accessibility research and practice.

                Background Food security’s multidimensional nature poses challenges in measurement and policy targeting. This comprehensive study explores the nexus between small-scale irrigation and household food security in Raya Kobo Woreda, Ethiopia, in a cross-sectional data. Methods Employing a two-stage sampling technique, the research examines 152 irrigation participants and 196 non-participants. Utilizing descriptive and econometric models, including a binary logit model and propensity score matching. Results The study reveals that 15% of participants and 12% of non-participants are food secure. Descriptive analysis reveals positive correlations between irrigation participation and household food security, dietary diversity, and food consumption scores. Econometric analysis identifies factors influencing participation, such as the age of the household head, family size and tropical livestock units have negative relationship with irrigation participation while the importance of agriculture is found to be positively associated with irrigation participation. Propensity score matching reveals a substantial positive impact on household expenditure, reaffirmed through sensitivity analysis. Conclusion The findings contribute to understanding the complexities of small-scale irrigation in enhancing rural livelihoods and emphasize the importance of targeted interventions for sustained positive outcomes.

                Background Cataracts are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness globally, with a particularly high incidence in diabetic patients due to the complex interplay of metabolic dysregulation and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Diabetic cataract development is influenced by several modifiable risk factors including smoking and hypertension, which may exacerbate lens opacity through various biological mechanisms. This study aims to determine the effects of smoking and hypertension on cataract development in diabetic patients. Methods Conducted from December 2022 to November 2023, this cross-sectional study at a specialized diabetes and ophthalmology healthcare facility involved 60 diabetic patients. The participants were divided into two groups: those with cataracts (n=32) and those without (n=28). Data collection focused on demographics, smoking history, hypertension status, and cataract presence, using structured interviews and medical record reviews. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between cataracts and potential risk factors, adjusting for age, diabetes duration, and glycemic control. Results Age and genderfi were not significantly different between the two groups, with mean ages of 50.21±14.34 years in the cataract group and 49.41±12.15 years in the non-cataract group (P=0.087). The prevalence of smoking was similar between those with cataracts (14.3%) and without (15.6%), showing no significant association (P=0.885). Hypertension was more prevalent in the cataract group (71.4%) compared to the non-cataract group (53.1%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.146). Logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking had a minimal effect on cataract development (OR=1.187; 95% CI=0.264-5.33; P=0.823), and while hypertension showed a stronger association (OR=2.277; 95% CI=0.749-6.92), it also lacked statistical significance (P=0.147). Conclusion Neither smoking nor hypertension showed significant associations with cataract development. These findings suggest that the influence of these factors on cataract progression may differ in diabetic individuals due to the complex interplay of metabolic and vascular changes associated with the condition.

                Background Acute coronary syndromes refer to STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina. The preferred biomarkers for assessing myocardial damage are cTnI and cTnT, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are recommended in clinical practice. Other biomarkers such as CK-MB have lower sensitivity and specificity. Platelets play a major role in thrombosis, which is a causative factor for most acute coronary syndromes. In our study, we attempted to analyze the effectiveness of platelet indices (mean platelet volume, platelet count, and platelet distribution width) as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes. Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, and plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers. Methods A total of 290 subjects were recruited for the study, including 145 cases and 145 controls matched for sex and age. Cases presented with the first episode of acute coronary syndrome. Controls are those without acute coronary syndrome during present admission or in the past. Results MPV and plateletcrit correlated with both troponin T and pro-BNP, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with troponin T. The only significant correlation was between the plateletcrit and pro-BNP levels. The plateletcrit showed a positive correlation with other parameters (degree of ventricular dysfunction, severity of coronary artery disease, and presence of arrhythmia). On comparing platelet indices with risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, MPV showed a positive correlation with HbA1c and the entire lipid profile, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with HbA1c and triglycerides. The plateletcrit was positively correlated with HbA1c and total cholesterol levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, whereas plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-924/v1?src=rss">Incentivizing green building technology: A financial perspective on sustainable development in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-844/v2?src=rss">Geographic distribution of conversion therapy prevalence in Canada. Findings from a national cross-sectional survey, 2020 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Conversion therapy practices (CTPs) are discredited efforts that target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, Two-Spirit, or other (LGBTQ2S+) people and seek to change, deny, or discourage their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of CTPs across Canadian provinces and territories and identify whether CTP bans reduce the prevalence of CTPs. Methods: We collected 119 CTPs from 31 adults (18+) in Canada who have direct experience with CTPs, know people who have gone to CTPs, or know of conversion therapy practitioners using a 2020 anonymous online survey. Mapping analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Online. CTP prevalence was compared between provinces/territories with and without bans using chi-square tests. Results: Three provinces and eleven municipalities had CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories with bans was 2.34 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 1.65, 3.31). The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 4.13 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 3.32, 5.14). Accounting for the underlying population, provinces/territories with the highest prevalence of CTPs per 1,000,000 population were New Brunswick (6.69), Nova Scotia (6.50), and Saskatchewan (6.37). Conclusions: Findings suggest only 55% of Canadians were protected under CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 1.76 times greater than provinces/territories with bans. CTPs are occurring in most provinces/territories, with higher prevalence in the west and the Atlantic. These findings and continued efforts to monitor CTP prevalence can help inform policymakers and legislators as society is increasingly acknowledging CTPs as a threat to the health and well-being of LGBTQ2S+ people.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-923/v1?src=rss">Uncaria nervosa Elmer, a new herbal source for betulinic acid and ursolic acid: Metabolites profiling, isolation, and in vitro cytotoxicity studies against T47D breast cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects Methods This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. Results The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, Nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.01,14.04,9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively. These compounds were reported in this plant for the first time. Conclusion Betulinic acid, and ursolic acid have been successfully isolated from leaves Uncaria nervosa Elmer, and ursolic acid have moderate cytotoxic activity on T47D breast cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23631?af=R">Differential role of NMDA receptors in hippocampal‐dependent spatial memory and plasticity in juvenile male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97107">A dynamic generative model can extract interpretable oscillatory components from multichannel neurophysiological recordings</a></h4>

              
                Modern neurophysiological recordings are performed using multichannel sensor arrays that are able to record activity in an increasingly high number of channels numbering in the 100s to 1000s. Often, underlying lower-dimensional patterns of activity are responsible for the observed dynamics, but these representations are difficult to reliably identify using existing methods that attempt to summarize multivariate relationships in a post hoc manner from univariate analyses or using current blind source separation methods. While such methods can reveal appealing patterns of activity, determining the number of components to include, assessing their statistical significance, and interpreting them requires extensive manual intervention and subjective judgment in practice. These difficulties with component selection and interpretation occur in large part because these methods lack a generative model for the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics. Here, we describe a novel component analysis method anchored by a generative model where each source is described by a bio-physically inspired state-space representation. The parameters governing this representation readily capture the oscillatory temporal dynamics of the components, so we refer to it as oscillation component analysis. These parameters – the oscillatory properties, the component mixing weights at the sensors, and the number of oscillations – all are inferred in a data-driven fashion within a Bayesian framework employing an instance of the expectation maximization algorithm. We analyze high-dimensional electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings from human studies to illustrate the potential utility of this method for neuroscience data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97327">RGS10 deficiency facilitates distant metastasis by inducing epithelial–mesenchymal transition in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Regulator of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins modulates metastasis in various cancers. This study identified a novel role for RGS10 in EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and deficiency in RGS10 protein predicted a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in the poorly aggressive, less invasive cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing <i>RGS10</i> in SKBR3 cells enhanced EMT and caused SKBR3 cell migration and invasion. The ability of RGS10 to suppress EMT and metastasis in breast cancer was dependent on lipocalin-2 and <i>MIR539-5p</i>. These findings identify RGS10 as a tumor suppressor, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95009">Exploring the role of the immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma: Implications for immunotherapy and drug resistance</a></h4>

              
                Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver tumor, is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and the incidence of liver cancer is still increasing worldwide. Curative hepatectomy or liver transplantation is only indicated for a small population of patients with early-stage HCC. However, most patients with HCC are not candidates for radical resection due to disease progression, leading to the choice of the conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug sorafenib as first-line treatment. In the past few years, immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized the clinical strategy for HCC. Combination therapy with ICIs has proven more effective than sorafenib, and clinical trials have been conducted to apply these therapies to patients. Despite significant progress in immunotherapy, the molecular mechanisms behind it remain unclear, and immune resistance is often challenging to overcome. Several studies have pointed out that the complex intercellular communication network in the immune microenvironment of HCC regulates tumor escape and drug resistance to immune response. This underscores the urgent need to analyze the immune microenvironment of HCC. This review describes the immunosuppressive cell populations in the immune microenvironment of HCC, as well as the related clinical trials, aiming to provide insights for the next generation of precision immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80622">Plasticity-induced actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft regulates intracellular AMPA receptor trafficking</a></h4>

              
                AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs) are rapidly inserted into synapses undergoing plasticity to increase synaptic transmission, but it is not fully understood if and how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses. Here, we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from their endogenous loci in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and characterized the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced structural plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of synaptic activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96496">Probing PAC1 receptor activation across species with an engineered sensor</a></h4>

              
                Class-B1 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an important family of clinically relevant drug targets that remain difficult to investigate via high-throughput screening and in animal models. Here, we engineered PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, a novel genetically encoded sensor based on a class-B1 GPCR (the human PAC1 receptor, hmPAC1R) endowed with high dynamic range (Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i><sub>0</sub> = 1100%), excellent ligand selectivity, and rapid activation kinetics (<i>τ</i><sub>ON</sub> = 1.15 s). To showcase the utility of this tool for in vitro applications, we thoroughly characterized and compared its expression, brightness and performance between PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-transfected and stably expressing cells. Demonstrating its use in animal models, we show robust expression and fluorescence responses upon exogenous ligand application ex vivo and in vivo in mice, as well as in living zebrafish larvae. Thus, the new GPCR-based sensor can be used for a wide range of applications across the life sciences empowering both basic research and drug development efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93223">OpenNucleome for high-resolution nuclear structural and dynamical modeling</a></h4>

              
                The intricate structural organization of the human nucleus is fundamental to cellular function and gene regulation. Recent advancements in experimental techniques, including high-throughput sequencing and microscopy, have provided valuable insights into nuclear organization. Computational modeling has played significant roles in interpreting experimental observations by reconstructing high-resolution structural ensembles and uncovering organization principles. However, the absence of standardized modeling tools poses challenges for furthering nuclear investigations. We present OpenNucleome—an open-source software designed for conducting GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of the human nucleus. OpenNucleome offers particle-based representations of chromosomes at a resolution of 100 KB, encompassing nuclear lamina, nucleoli, and speckles. This software furnishes highly accurate structural models of nuclear architecture, affording the means for dynamic simulations of condensate formation, fusion, and exploration of non-equilibrium effects. We applied OpenNucleome to uncover the mechanisms driving the emergence of ‘fixed points’ within the nucleus—signifying genomic loci robustly anchored in proximity to specific nuclear bodies for functional purposes. This anchoring remains resilient even amidst significant fluctuations in chromosome radial positions and nuclear shapes within individual cells. Our findings lend support to a nuclear zoning model that elucidates genome functionality. We anticipate OpenNucleome to serve as a valuable tool for nuclear investigations, streamlining mechanistic explorations and enhancing the interpretation of experimental observations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85794">A rapid phylogeny-based method for accurate community profiling of large-scale metabarcoding datasets</a></h4>

              
                Environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming an increasingly important tool in diverse scientific fields from ecological biomonitoring to wastewater surveillance of viruses. The fundamental challenge in eDNA analyses has been the bioinformatical assignment of reads to taxonomic groups. It has long been known that full probabilistic methods for phylogenetic assignment are preferable, but unfortunately, such methods are computationally intensive and are typically inapplicable to modern Next-Generation Sequencing data. We here present a fast approximate likelihood method for phylogenetic assignment of DNA sequences. Applying the new method to several mock communities and simulated datasets, we show that it identifies more reads at both high and low taxonomic levels more accurately than other leading methods. The advantage of the method is particularly apparent in the presence of polymorphisms and/or sequencing errors and when the true species is not represented in the reference database.

	<p>In recent years, EEG-based emotion recognition technology has made progress, but there are still problems of low model efficiency and loss of emotional information, and there is still room for improvement in recognition accuracy. To fully utilize EEG&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional information and improve recognition accuracy while reducing computational costs, this paper proposes a Convolutional-Recurrent Hybrid Network with a dual-stream adaptive approach and an attention mechanism (CSA-SA-CRTNN). Firstly, the model utilizes a CSAM module to assign corresponding weights to EEG channels. Then, an adaptive dual-stream convolutional-recurrent network (SA-CRNN and MHSA-CRNN) is applied to extract local spatial-temporal features. After that, the extracted local features are concatenated and fed into a temporal convolutional network with a multi-head self-attention mechanism (MHSA-TCN) to capture global information. Finally, the extracted EEG information is used for emotion classification. We conducted binary and ternary classification experiments on the DEAP dataset, achieving 99.26% and 99.15% accuracy for arousal and valence in binary classification and 97.69% and 98.05% in ternary classification, and on the SEED dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.63%, surpassing relevant algorithms. Additionally, the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficiency is significantly higher than other models, achieving better accuracy with lower resource consumption.</p>

	<p>Neurodegeneration occurs naturally as humans age, but the presence of additional pathogenic mechanisms yields harmful and consequential effects on the brain. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a composite of such factors. Despite extensive research to identify the exact causes of AD, therapeutic approaches for treating the disease continue to be ineffective, indicating important gaps in our understanding of disease mechanisms. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an endogenous class of regulatory RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, involved in various regulatory networks, whose dysregulation is evident in several neural and extraneural diseases. LncRNAs are ubiquitously expressed across all tissues with a wide range of functions, including controlling cell differentiation and development, responding to environmental stimuli, and other physiological processes. Several lncRNAs have been identified as potential contributors in worsening neurodegeneration due to altered regulation during abnormal pathological conditions. Within neurological disease, lncRNAs are prime candidates for use as biomarkers and pharmacological targets. Gender-associated lncRNA expression is altered in a gender-dependent manner for AD, suggesting more research needs to be focused on this relationship. Overall, research on lncRNAs and their connection to neurodegenerative disease is growing exponentially, as commercial enterprises are already designing and employing RNA therapeutics. In this review we offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the role of lncRNAs in AD and discuss the potential implications of lncRNA as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Most intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can be treated either with microsurgical clipping or endovascular techniques. In a few cases, simultaneous treatment utilizing both modalities in a hybrid operation room may be favorable. This study analyzes the indication and benefits of a true hybrid approach (tHA) that combines simultaneous endovascular and microsurgical procedures for treatment of IAs in one session. (2) Methods: All patients receiving a true hybrid procedure between 2010 and 2022 in our institution were included. Demographic characteristics, neurological symptoms, pre-interventional treatments, angiographic findings, and postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes were analyzed. Results are discussed in the light of a systematic literature review on reported true hybrid procedures for IA treatment. (3) Results: In total, 10 tHAs were performed. Of these, coiling and concomitant decompressive craniectomy or hematoma evacuation was performed on six occasions. In two patients, multiple IAs were treated with different modalities during the same procedure. In two patients, intraoperative conditions did not allow for complete IA clipping, and the remnant was coiled in the same session. The review of the literature revealed nine papers comprising 58 IAs treated with a tHA. (4) Conclusions: The need for a tHA for IA treatment is rare and limited to highly selective cases. In our experience, tHAs have been most valuable in an emergency setting concerning ruptured IAs. Furthermore, tHAs may also be considered in patients with multiple aneurysms in different vascular territories.</p>

	<p>Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) experience severe face memory deficits that are often accompanied by impairments in face perception. Images of human facial features are better discriminated between when they are presented in the locations on the visual field that they typically appear in while viewing human faces in daily life, than in locations which they do not typically appear (i.e., better performance for eyes in the upper visual field, and better performance for mouths in the lower visual field). These feature-to-location tuning effects (FLEs) can be explained by a retinotopically organised visual statistical learning mechanism. We had a large group of DP participants (N = 64), a control group (N = 74) and a group of individuals with a mild form of DP (N = 58) complete a single-feature discrimination task to determine whether face perception deficits in DP can be accounted for by an impairment in face feature-to-location tuning. The results showed that individuals with DP did not have significant FLEs, suggesting a marked impairment in the underlying visual statistical learning mechanism. In contrast, the mild DP group showed normal FLE effects which did not differ from the control group. Both DP groups had impaired single-feature processing (SFP) as compared to the control group. We also examined the effects of age on FLEs and SFP.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region plays an important role in learning and memory. CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) receive two prominent excitatory inputs&mdash;mossy fibers (MFs) from dentate gyrus (DG) and recurrent collaterals (RCs) from CA3 PNs&mdash;that play opposing roles in pattern separation and pattern completion, respectively. Although the dorsoventral heterogeneity of the hippocampal anatomy, physiology, and behavior has been well established, nothing is known about the dorsoventral heterogeneity of synaptic connectivity in CA3 PNs. In this study, we performed Timm's sulfide silver staining, dendritic and spine morphological analyses, and ex vivo electrophysiology in mice of both sexes to investigate the heterogeneity of MF and RC pathways along the CA3 dorsoventral axis. Our morphological analyses demonstrate that ventral CA3 (vCA3) PNs possess greater dendritic lengths and more complex dendritic arborization, compared with dorsal CA3 (dCA3) PNs. Moreover, using ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2)-assisted patch-clamp recording, we found that the ratio of the RC-to-MF excitatory drive onto CA3 PNs increases substantially from dCA3 to vCA3, with vCA3 PNs receiving significantly weaker MFs, but stronger RCs, excitation than dCA3 PNs. Given the distinct roles of MF versus RC inputs in pattern separation versus completion, our findings of the significant dorsoventral variations of MF and RC excitation in CA3 PNs may have important functional implications for the contribution of CA3 circuit to the dorsoventral difference in hippocampal function.</p>

                <p>The encoding of acoustic stimuli requires precise neuron timing. Auditory neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and brainstem are&nbsp;well suited for accurate analysis of fast acoustic signals, given their physiological specializations of fast membrane time constants, fast axonal conduction, and reliable synaptic transmission. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons that provide efferent inhibition of the cochlea reside in the ventral brainstem and participate in these fast neural circuits. However, their modulation of cochlear function occurs over time scales of a slower nature. This suggests the presence of mechanisms that reduce MOC inhibition of cochlear function. To determine how monaural excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs integrate to affect the timing of MOC neuron activity, we developed a novel in vitro slice preparation ("wedge-slice"). The wedge-slice maintains the ascending auditory nerve root, the entire CN and projecting axons, while preserving the ability to perform visually guided patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings from genetically identified MOC neurons. The "in vivo-like" timing of the wedge-slice demonstrates that the inhibitory pathway accelerates relative to the excitatory pathway when the ascending circuit is intact, and the CN portion of the inhibitory circuit is precise enough to compensate for reduced precision in later synapses. When combined with machine learning PSC analysis and computational modeling, we demonstrate a larger suppression of MOC neuron activity when the inhibition occurs with in vivo-like timing. This delay of MOC activity may ensure that the MOC system is only engaged by sustained background sounds, preventing a maladaptive hypersuppression of cochlear activity.</p>

                <p>Humans are immensely curious and motivated to reduce uncertainty, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that generate curiosity. Curiosity is inversely associated with confidence, suggesting that it is triggered by states of low confidence (subjective uncertainty), but the neural mechanisms of this link, have been little investigated. Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are read out by higher-order structures to generate signals of confidence and, ultimately, curiosity. We scanned participants (17 female, 15 male) using fMRI while they performed a new task in which they rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. We measured the activity evoked by each image in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and devised a new metric of "OTC Certainty" indicating the strength of evidence this activity conveys about the animal versus object categories. We show that, perceptual curiosity peaked at low confidence and OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, establishing a link between curiosity and a multivariate representation of sensory uncertainty. Moreover, univariate (average) activity in two frontal areas&mdash;vmPFC and ACC&mdash;correlated positively with confidence and negatively with curiosity, and the vmPFC mediated the relationship between OTC Certainty and curiosity. The results reveal novel mechanisms through which uncertainty about an event generates curiosity about that event.</p>

                <p>The neocortex and striatum are topographically organized for sensory and motor functions. While sensory and motor areas are lateralized for touch and motor control, respectively, frontal areas are involved in decision-making, where lateralization of function may be less important. This study contrasted the topographic precision of cell-type&ndash;specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical projections while varying the injection site location in transgenic mice of both sexes. While sensory cortical areas had strongly topographic outputs to the ipsilateral cortex and striatum, they were weaker and not as topographically precise to contralateral targets. The motor cortex had somewhat stronger projections but still relatively weak contralateral topography. In contrast, frontal cortical areas had high degrees of topographic similarity for both ipsilateral and contralateral projections to the cortex and striatum. Corticothalamic organization is mainly ipsilateral, with weaker, more medial contralateral projections. Corticostriatal computations might integrate input outside closed basal ganglia loops using contralateral projections, enabling the two hemispheres to act as a unit to converge on one result in motor planning and decision-making.</p>

                <p>Synapses are fundamental to the function of the central nervous system and are implicated in a number of brain disorders. Despite their pivotal role, a comprehensive imaging resource detailing the distribution of synapses in the human brain has been lacking until now. Here, we employ high-resolution PET neuroimaging in healthy humans (17F/16M) to create a 3D atlas of the synaptic marker Synaptic Vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Calibration to absolute density values (pmol/ml) was achieved by leveraging postmortem human brain autoradiography data. The atlas unveils distinctive cortical and subcortical gradients of synapse density that reflect functional topography and hierarchical order from core sensory to higher-order integrative areas&mdash;a distribution that diverges from SV2A mRNA patterns. Furthermore, we found a positive association between IQ and SV2A density in several higher-order cortical areas. This new resource will help advance our understanding of brain physiology and the pathogenesis of brain disorders, serving as a pivotal tool for future neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e2012232024?rss=1">Conflicting Sensory Information Sharpens the Neural Representations of Early Selective Visuospatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behaviors require the ability to resolve conflicting information caused by the processing of incompatible sensory inputs. Prominent theories of attention have posited that early selective attention helps mitigate cognitive interference caused by conflicting sensory information by facilitating the processing of task-relevant sensory inputs and filtering out behaviorally irrelevant information. Surprisingly, many recent studies that investigated the role of early selective attention on conflict mitigation have failed to provide positive evidence. Here, we examined changes in the selectivity of early visuospatial attention in male and female human subjects performing an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task, where they discriminated the shape of a visual target surrounded by congruent or incongruent distractors. We used the inverted encoding model to reconstruct spatial representations of visual selective attention from the topographical patterns of amplitude modulations in alpha band oscillations in scalp EEG (~8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz). We found that the fidelity of the alpha-based spatial reconstruction was significantly higher in the incongruent compared with the congruent condition. Importantly, these conflict-related modulations in the reconstruction fidelity occurred at a much earlier time window than those of the lateralized posterior event-related potentials associated with target selection and distractor suppression processes, as well as conflict-related modulations in the frontocentral negative-going wave and midline-frontal theta oscillations (~3&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz), thought to track executive control functions. Taken together, our data suggest that conflict resolution is supported by the cascade of neural processes underlying early selective visuospatial attention and frontal executive functions that unfold over time.</p>

                <p>An economic choice entails computing and comparing the values of individual offers. Offer values are represented in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)&mdash;an area that participates in value comparison&mdash;but it is unknown where offer values are computed in the first place. One possibility is that this computation takes place in OFC. Alternatively, offer values might be computed upstream of OFC. For choices between edible goods, a primary candidate is the gustatory region of the anterior insula (gustatory cortex, GC). Here we recorded from the GC of male rhesus monkeys choosing between different juice types. As a population, neurons in GC represented the flavor, the quantity, and the subjective value of the juice chosen by the animal. These variables were represented by distinct groups of cells and with different time courses. Specifically, chosen value signals emerged shortly after offer presentation, while neurons encoding the chosen juice and the chosen quantity peaked after juice delivery. Surprisingly, neurons in GC did not represent individual offer values in a systematic way. In a computational sense, the variables encoded in GC follow the process of value comparison. Thus our results argue against the hypothesis that offer values are computed in GC. At the same time, signals representing the subjective value of the expected reward indicate that responses in GC are not purely sensory. Thus neuronal responses in GC appear consummatory in nature.</p>

                <p>The simple act of viewing and grasping an object involves complex sensorimotor control mechanisms that have been shown to vary as a function of multiple object and other task features such as object size, shape, weight, and wrist orientation. However, these features have been mostly studied in isolation. In contrast, given the nonlinearity of motor control, its computations require multiple features to be incorporated concurrently. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that grasp computations integrate multiple task features superadditively in particular when these features are relevant for the same action phase. We asked male and female human participants to reach-to-grasp objects of different shapes and sizes with different wrist orientations. Also, we delayed the movement onset using auditory signals to specify which effector to use. Using electroencephalography and representative dissimilarity analysis to map the time course of cortical activity, we found that grasp computations formed superadditive integrated representations of grasp features during different planning phases of grasping. Shape-by-size representations and size-by-orientation representations occurred before and after effector specification, respectively, and could not be explained by single-feature models. These observations are consistent with the brain performing different preparatory, phase-specific computations; visual object analysis to identify grasp points at abstract visual levels; and downstream sensorimotor preparatory computations for reach-to-grasp trajectories. Our results suggest the brain adheres to the needs of nonlinear motor control for integration. Furthermore, they show that examining the superadditive influence of integrated representations can serve as a novel lens to map the computations underlying sensorimotor control.</p>

                <p>The ability to make accurate and timely decisions, such as judging when it is safe to cross the road, is the foundation of adaptive behavior. While the computational and neural processes supporting simple decisions on isolated stimuli have been well characterized, decision-making in the real world often requires integration of discrete sensory events over time and space. Most previous experimental work on perceptual decision-making has focused on tasks that involve only a single, task-relevant source of sensory input. It remains unclear, therefore, how such integrative decisions are regulated computationally. Here we used psychophysics, electroencephalography, and computational modeling to understand how the human brain combines visual motion signals across space in the service of a single, integrated decision. To that purpose, we presented two random-dot kinematograms in the left and the right visual hemifields. Coherent motion signals were shown briefly and concurrently in each location, and healthy adult human participants of both sexes reported the average of the two motion signals. We directly tested competing predictions arising from influential serial and parallel accounts of visual processing. Using a biologically plausible model of motion filtering, we found evidence in favor of parallel integration as the fundamental computational mechanism regulating integrated perceptual decisions.</p>

Leveraging evolutionary conservation to identify sites more likely to permit insertion of a tag, we generated constitutive and conditional tagged alleles for <I>Drosophila</I> <I>5-HT1A</I>, <I>5-HT2A</I>, <I>5-HT2B</I>, <I>Oct</I><I>&beta;</I><I>1R</I>, <I>Oct</I><I>&beta;</I><I>2R</I>, two isoforms of <I>OAMB</I>, and <I>mGluR</I>. The conditional alleles allow for the restricted expression of tagged receptor in specific cell types, an option not available for any previous reagents to label these proteins. We show expression patterns for these receptors in female brains and that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B localize to the mushroom bodies (MBs) and central complex, respectively, as predicted by their roles in sleep. By contrast, the unexpected enrichment of Oct&beta;1R in the central complex and of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A to nerve terminals in lobular columnar cells in the visual system suggest new hypotheses about their functions at these sites. Using an additional tagged allele of the serotonin transporter, a marker of serotonergic tracts, we demonstrate diverse spatial relationships between postsynaptic 5-HT receptors and presynaptic 5-HT neurons, consistent with the importance of both synaptic and volume transmission. Finally, we use the conditional allele of <I>5-HT1A</I> to show that it localizes to distinct sites within the MBs as both a postsynaptic receptor in Kenyon cells and a presynaptic autoreceptor.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e2420232024?rss=1">Synaptic Connectivity and Electrophysiological Properties of the Nucleus of the Lateral Olfactory Tract</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sense of smell is tightly linked to emotions, a link that is thought to rely on the direct synaptic connections between the olfactory bulb (OB) and nuclei of the amygdala. However, there are multiple pathways projecting olfactory information to the amygdala, and their unique functions are unknown. The pathway via the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) that receives input from olfactory regions and projects to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is among them. NLOT has been very little studied, and consequentially its function is unknown. Furthermore, formulation of informed hypotheses about NLOT function is at this stage limited by the lack of knowledge about its connectivity and physiological properties. Here, we used virus-based tracing methods to systematically reveal inputs into NLOT, as well as NLOT projection targets in mice of both sexes. We found that the NLOT is interconnected with several olfactory brain regions and with the BLA. Some of these connections were reciprocal, and some showed unique interhemispheric patterns. We tested the excitable properties of NLOT neurons and the properties of each of the major synaptic inputs. We found that the NLOT receives powerful input from the piriform cortex, tenia tecta, and the BLA but only very weak input from the OB. When input crosses threshold, NLOT neurons respond with calcium-dependent bursts of action potentials. We hypothesize that this integration of olfactory and amygdalar inputs serves behaviors that combine smell and emotion.</p>

                <p>by Christoph Koch, Ondrej Zika, Rasmus Bruckner, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Surprise is a key component of many learning experiences, and yet its precise computational role, and how it changes with age, remain debated. One major challenge is that surprise often occurs jointly with other variables, such as uncertainty and outcome probability. To assess how humans learn from surprising events, and whether aging affects this process, we studied choices while participants learned from bandits with either Gaussian or bi-modal outcome distributions, which decoupled outcome probability, uncertainty, and surprise. A total of 102 participants (51 older, aged 50—73; 51 younger, 19–30 years) chose between three bandits, one of which had a bimodal outcome distribution. Behavioral analyses showed that both age-groups learned the average of the bimodal bandit less well. A trial-by-trial analysis indicated that participants performed choice reversals immediately following large absolute prediction errors, consistent with heightened sensitivity to surprise. This effect was stronger in older adults. Computational models indicated that learning rates in younger as well as older adults were influenced by surprise, rather than uncertainty, but also suggested large interindividual variability in the process underlying learning in our task. Our work bridges between behavioral economics research that has focused on how outcomes with low probability affect choice in older adults, and reinforcement learning work that has investigated age differences in the effects of uncertainty and suggests that older adults overly adapt to surprising events, even when accounting for probability and uncertainty effects.

                <p>by Jose L. Alejo, Dylan Girodat, Michael J. Hammerling, Jessica A. Willi, Michael C. Jewett, Aaron E. Engelhart, Katarzyna P. Adamala</p>

Translocation in protein synthesis entails the efficient and accurate movement of the mRNA-[tRNA]<sub>2</sub> substrate through the ribosome after peptide bond formation. An essential conformational change during this process is the swiveling of the small subunit head domain about two rRNA ‘hinge’ elements. Using iterative selection and molecular dynamics simulations, we derive alternate hinge elements capable of translocation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and describe their effects on the conformational trajectory of the EF-G-bound, translocating ribosome. In these alternate conformational pathways, we observe a diversity of swivel kinetics, hinge motions, three-dimensional head domain trajectories and tRNA dynamics. By finding alternate conformational pathways of translocation, we identify motions and intermediates that are essential or malleable in this process. These findings highlight the plasticity of protein synthesis and provide a more thorough understanding of the available sequence and conformational landscape of a central biological process.

                <p>by Jiayi Lin, Hrayer Aprahamian, George Golovko</p>

We study the problem of mass screening of heterogeneous populations under limited testing budget. Mass screening is an essential tool that arises in various settings, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of mass screening is to classify the entire population as positive or negative for a disease as efficiently and accurately as possible. Under limited budget, testing facilities need to allocate a portion of the budget to target sub-populations (i.e., proactive screening) while reserving the remaining budget to screen for symptomatic cases (i.e., reactive screening). This paper addresses this decision problem by taking advantage of accessible population-level risk information to identify the optimal set of sub-populations for proactive/reactive screening. The framework also incorporates two widely used testing schemes: Individual and Dorfman group testing. By leveraging the special structure of the resulting bilinear optimization problem, we identify key structural properties, which in turn enable us to develop efficient solution schemes. Furthermore, we extend the model to accommodate customized testing schemes across different sub-populations and introduce a highly efficient heuristic solution algorithm for the generalized model. We conduct a comprehensive case study on COVID-19 in the US, utilizing geographically-based data. Numerical results demonstrate a significant improvement of up to 52% in total misclassifications compared to conventional screening strategies. In addition, our case study offers valuable managerial insights regarding the allocation of proactive/reactive measures and budget across diverse geographic regions.

                <p>by Catarina S. C. Martins, Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo, Ramesha H. Jayaramaiah, Dongxue Tao, Jun-Tao Wang, Tadeo Sáez-Sandino, Hongwei Liu, Fernando T. Maestre, Peter B. Reich, Brajesh K. Singh</p>

Grasslands are integral to maintaining biodiversity and key ecosystem services and are under threat from climate change. Plant and soil microbial diversity, and their interactions, support the provision of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, it remains virtually unknown whether plant and soil microbial diversity explain a unique portion of total variation or shared contributions to supporting multifunctionality across global grasslands. Here, we combine results from a global survey of 101 grasslands with a novel microcosm study, controlling for both plant and soil microbial diversity to identify their individual and interactive contribution to support multifunctionality under aridity and experimental drought. We found that plant and soil microbial diversity independently predict a unique portion of total variation in above- and belowground functioning, suggesting that both types of biodiversity complement each other. Interactions between plant and soil microbial diversity positively impacted multifunctionality including primary production and nutrient storage. Our findings were also climate context dependent, since soil fungal diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality in less arid regions, while plant diversity was strongly and positively linked to multifunctionality in more arid regions. Our results highlight the need to conserve both above- and belowground diversity to sustain grassland multifunctionality in a drier world and indicate climate change may shift the relative contribution of plant and soil biodiversity to multifunctionality across global grasslands.

<br/>
<p>Amyloid neuropathy is caused by deposition of insoluble β-pleated amyloid sheets in the peripheral nervous system. It is most common in: (1) light-chain amyloidosis, a clonal non-proliferative plasma cell disorder in which fragments of immunoglobulin, light or heavy chain, deposit in tissues, and (2) hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis, a disorder caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the <i>TTR</i> gene resulting in mutated protein that has a higher tendency to misfold. Amyloid fibrils deposit in the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, often extensive in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia, leading to atrophy of Schwann cells in proximity to amyloid fibrils and blood–nerve barrier disruption. Clinically, amyloid neuropathy is manifested as a length-dependent sensory predominant neuropathy associated with generalized autonomic failure. Small unmyelinated nerves are involved early and prominently in early-onset Val30Met ATTRv, whereas other ATTRv and light-chain amyloidosis often present with large- and small-fiber involvement. Nerve conduction studies, quantitative sudomotor axon testing, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density are useful tools to evaluate denervation. Amyloid deposition can be demonstrated by tissue biopsy of the affected organ or surrogate site, as well as bone-avid radiotracer cardiac imaging. Treatment of light-chain amyloidosis has been revolutionized by monoclonal antibodies and stem cell transplantation with improved 5-year survival up to 77%. Novel gene therapy and transthyretin stabilizers have revolutionized treatment of ATTRv, improving the course of neuropathy (less change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 from baseline) and quality of life. With great progress in amyloidosis therapies, early diagnosis and presymptomatic testing for ATTRv family members has become paramount. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:423–440</p>

                <p>Despite the use of ‘high efficacy’ disease-modifying therapies, disease activity and clinical progression of different immune-mediated neurological diseases continue for some patients, resulting in accumulating disability, deteriorating social and mental health, and high economic cost to patients and society. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment modality, it is an intensive chemotherapy-based therapy with a range of short- and long-term side-effects. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell and other hematological malignancies, conferring long-term remission for otherwise refractory diseases. However, the toxicity of this treatment, particularly cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and the complexity of production necessitate the need for a high level of specialization at treating centers. Early-phase trials of CAR-T therapies in immune-mediated B cell driven conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis, have shown dramatic clinical response with few adverse events. Based on the common physiopathology, CAR-T therapy in other immune-mediated neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, autoimmune encephalitis, and stiff person syndrome, might be an effective option for patients, avoiding the need for long-term immunosuppressant medications. It may prove to be a more selective immunoablative approach than autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with potentially increased efficacy and lower adverse events. In this review, we present the state of the art and future directions of the use of CAR-T in such conditions. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:441–452</p>

                <p>Brain iron deficiency (ID) and, to a degree, systemic ID have been implicated in restless leg syndrome (RLS) pathogenesis. Previously, we found increased ferritin in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) in RLS, suggesting a mechanism for depleting intracellular iron by secreting ferritin-loaded NDEVs. In this study, we hypothesized that increased NDEV ferritin occurs even in RLS accompanied by systemic ID and that neuronal intracellular iron depletion in RLS also manifests as NDEV abnormalities in other iron regulatory proteins, specifically, decreased transferrin receptor (TfR) and increased ferroportin. To address these hypotheses, we studied 71 women with ID anemia, 36 with RLS, and 35 without RLS. Subjects with RLS again showed higher NDEV ferritin and also decreased TfR, suggesting diminished neuronal capacity for iron uptake. Findings inform a more complete understanding of the pathogenic role of neuronal iron homeostasis and dissociate it from peripheral ID. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:560–564</p>

                <p>The life expectancy of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) has increased, yet we have noted that development of a typical Alzheimer disease dementia syndrome is uncommon. We hypothesized that Alzheimer disease pathology is uncommon in MS patients. In 100 MS patients, the rate of amyloid-β plasma biomarker positivity was approximately half the rate in 300 non-MS controls matched on age, sex, apolipoprotein E proteotype, and cognitive status. Interestingly, most MS patients who did have amyloid-β pathology had features atypical for MS at diagnosis. These results support that MS is associated with reduced Alzheimer disease risk, and suggest new avenues of research. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:453–459</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the clinical progression of the brain-/body-first categories within Lewy body disease (LBD): Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and PD dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to establish a population-based cohort of clinically diagnosed LBD. We used two definitions for differentiating between brain- and body-first LBD: a previously hypothesized body-first presentation in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior onset before motor symptoms onset; and an expanded definition of body-first LBD when a patient had at least 2 premotor symptoms between constipation, erectile dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behavior, anosmia, or neurogenic bladder.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with PD (RR = 1.43, <i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas body-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with DLB (RR = 3.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Under the expanded definition, there was no difference in LBD diagnosis between brain-first and body-first patients (PD: RR = 1.03, <i>p</i> = 0.10; DLB: RR = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.58) There were no patterns between brain- or body-first presentation, PD dementia under either definition (original: <i>p</i> = 0.09, expanded: <i>p</i> = 0.97), and no significant difference in motor symptoms between brain-first and body-first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings do not support the dichotomous classification of body-first and brain-first LBD with the currently proposed definition. Biological exposures resulting in PD and DLB are unlikely to converge on a binary classification of top-down or bottom-up synuclein pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:551–559</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be more common in African Americans (AA), but biomarker studies in AA populations are limited. This report represents the largest study to date examining cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers in AA individuals.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 3,006 cerebrospinal fluid samples from controls, AD cases, and non-AD cases, including 495 (16.5%) self-identified black/AA and 2,456 (81.7%) white/European individuals using cutoffs derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and using a data-driven multivariate Gaussian mixture of regressions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct effects of race were found in different groups. Total Tauand phospho181-Tau were lower among AA individuals in all groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ<sub>42</sub> was markedly lower in AA controls compared with white controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Gaussian mixture of regressions modeling of cerebrospinal fluid distributions incorporating adjustments for covariates revealed coefficient estimates for AA race comparable with 2-decade change in age. Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cutoffs, fewer AA controls were classified as biomarker-positive asymptomatic AD (8.0% vs 13.4%). After adjusting for covariates, our Gaussian mixture of regressions model reduced this difference, but continued to predict lower prevalence of asymptomatic AD among AA controls (9.3% vs 13.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although the risk of dementia is higher, data-driven modeling indicates lower frequency of asymptomatic AD in AA controls, suggesting that dementia among AA populations may not be driven by higher rates of AD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:463–475</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately half of ischemic strokes (IS) in cancer patients are cryptogenic, with many presumed cardioembolic. We evaluated whether there were specific miRNA and mRNA transcriptome architectures in peripheral blood of IS patients with and without comorbid cancer, and between cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic IS etiologies in comorbid cancer.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied patients with cancer and IS (CS; n = 42), stroke only (SO; n = 41), and cancer only (n = 28), and vascular risk factor-matched controls (n = 30). mRNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data, analyzed with linear regression models, identified differentially expressed genes in CS versus SO and in cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic CS, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs. Network-level analyses identified stroke etiology-specific responses in CS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,085 mRNAs and 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed between CS and SO. In CS, 122 and 35 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs, and 5 and 3 coexpressed gene modules, were associated with cardioembolic and noncardioembolic CS, respectively. Complement, growth factor, and immune/inflammatory pathways showed differences between IS etiologies in CS. A 15-gene biomarker panel assembled from a derivation cohort (n = 50) correctly classified 81% of CS and 71% of SO participants in a validation cohort (n = 33). Another 15-gene panel correctly identified etiologies for 13 of 13 CS-cardioembolic and 11 of 11 CS-noncardioembolic participants upon cross-validation; 11 of 16 CS-cryptogenic participants were predicted cardioembolic.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We discovered unique mRNA and miRNA transcriptome architecture in CS and SO, and in CS with different IS etiologies. Cardioembolic and noncardioembolic etiologies in CS showed unique coexpression networks and potential master regulators. These may help distinguish CS from SO and identify IS etiology in cryptogenic CS patients. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:565–581</p>

<p>This study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap – whether low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment long after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is still effective for chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) and cognitive impairments. We have found that LD-IL-2 treatment preferentially expands meningeal regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby abolishing PTH-related behaviors and memory deficit in mice with a wide therapeutic time window. This identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for mTBI with the potential of reducing polypharmacy. [Color figure can be viewed at <a target="_blank"

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced chronic headache and cognitive deficits are poorly understood and lack effective treatments. Low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment soon after mTBI or overexpressing IL-2 in brain astrocytes prior to injury protects mice from developing post-traumatic headache (PTH)-related behaviors and cognitive decline. The present study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap: whether LD-IL-2 treatment long after the initial injury is still effective for chronic PTH and cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>mTBI was induced by a noninvasive closed-head weight drop method. LD-IL-2 was administered 4–6 weeks post-mTBI to assess its effects on chronic PTH-related facial mechanical hypersensitivity as well as mTBI-induced impairment in novel object recognition and object location tests. Endogenous regulatory T (Treg) cells were depleted to investigate the mechanism of action of LD-IL-2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Delayed LD-IL-2 treatment abolished chronic PTH-related behaviors. It also completely reversed mTBI-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. Treg cell depletion not only prolonged PTH-related behaviors but also abolished the effects of LD-IL-2. Interestingly, LD-IL-2 treatment significantly increased the number of Treg cells in dura but not in brain tissues.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that the beneficial effects of LD-IL-2 treatment are mediated through the expansion of meningeal Treg cells. Collectively, our study identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for both chronic PTH and mTBI-induced cognitive impairment for both males and females, with a wide therapeutic time window and the potential of reducing polypharmacy in mTBI treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27001?af=R">Human‐Derived Induced GABAergic Progenitor Cells Improve Cognitive Function in Mice and Inhibit Astrocyte Activation with Anti‐Inflammatory Exosomes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neuron impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and if and how transplantation of healthy GABAergic neurons can improve AD, remain unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human-derived medial ganglionic eminence progenitors (hiMGEs) differentiated from programmed induced neural precursor cells (hiNPCs) were injected into the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (HIP).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that grafts migrate to the whole brain and form functional synaptic connections in amyloid precursor protein gene/ presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) chimeric mice. Following transplantation of hiMGEs, behavioral deficits and AD-related pathology were alleviated and defective neurons were repaired. Notably, exosomes secreted from hiMGEs, which are rich in anti-inflammatory miRNA, inhibited astrocyte activation <i>invitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and the mechanism was related to regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that hiMGEs transplantation is an alternative treatment for neuronal loss in AD and demonstrate that exosomes with anti-inflammatory activity derived from hiMGEs are important factors for graft survival.
