The added value of deep brain stimulation (DBS) instead of continued VNS optimization is unknown. In a prospective, non-blinded, randomized patient preference trial of 18 children (aged 8–17 years) who did not respond to VNS after at least 1 year, add-on DBS resulted in greater seizure reduction compared with an additional year of VNS optimization (51.9% vs. 12.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Add-on DBS also resulted in less bothersome seizures (<i>p</i> = 0.03), but no change in quality of life. DBS may be considered earlier for childhood epilepsy after non-response to VNS.

">Psilocybin reduces heroin seeking behavior and modulates inflammatory gene expression in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex of male rats</a></h4>

              
                Preclinical and human studies indicate psilocybin may reduce perseverant maladaptive behaviors, including nicotine and alcohol seeking. Such studies in the opioid field are lacking, though opioids are involved in more >50% of overdose deaths. Psilocybin is an agonist at the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), a well-documented target for modulation of drug seeking, and evidence suggests 5-HT2AR agonists may dampen motivation for opioids. We sought to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of psilocybin in mediating cessation of opioid use and maintenance of long-lasting abstinence from opioid seeking behavior in a rat model of heroin self-administration (SA). Psilocybin or 5-HT2AR antagonists ketanserin and volinanserin were administered systemically to rats prior to SA of 0.075 mg/kg/infusion of heroin, or relapse following forced abstinence. Psilocybin did not alter heroin taking, but a single exposure to 3.0 mg/kg psilocybin 4-24 hours prior to a relapse test blunted cue-induced heroin seeking. Conversely, 5-HT2AR antagonists exacerbated heroin relapse. To begin to elucidate mechanisms of psilocybin, drug-naive rats received psilocybin and/or ketanserin, and tissue was collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region critical for drug seeking and responsive to psilocybin, 24 hours later for RNA-sequencing. 3.0 mg/kg psilocybin regulated ~2-fold more genes in the PFC than 1.0 mg/kg, including genes involved in the cytoskeleton and cytokine signaling. Ketanserin blocked >90% of psilocybin-regulated genes, including the IL-17a cytokine receptor, Il17ra. Psychedelic compounds have reported anti-inflammatory properties, and therefore we performed a gene expression array to measure chemokine/cytokine molecules in the PFC of animals that displayed psilocybin-mediated inhibition of heroin seeking. Psilocybin regulated 4 genes, including Il17a, and a subset of genes correlated with relapse behavior. Selective inhibition of PFC IL-17a was sufficient to reduce heroin relapse. We conclude that psilocybin reduces heroin relapse and highlight IL-17a signaling as a potential downstream pathway of psilocybin that also reduces heroin seeking.

">Snake venom-inspired novel peptides protect Caenorhabditis elegans against paraquat induced Parkinson's pathology</a></h4>

              
                The in vivo protective mechanisms of two low molecular mass novel custom peptides (CPs) against paraquat (PT) induced neurodegenerative dysfunction in the Caenorhabditis elegans model were deciphered. CPs prevent the PT binding to the nerve ring adjacent to the pharynx in C elegans (N2 strain) by stable and high-affinity binding to the tyrosine protein kinase receptor CAM 1, resulting in significant inhibition of PT induced toxicity by reducing enhanced reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and chemosensory dysfunction. The CPs inhibited PT induced dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron degeneration and alpha synuclein aggregation, the hallmarks of Parkinsons Disease, in transgenic BZ555 and NL5901 strains of C elegans. The transcriptomic, functional proteomics, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) analyses show that CPs prevented the increased expression of the genes involved in the skn 1 downstream pathway, thereby restoring PT mediated oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuronal damage in C elegans. The CPs ability to repair PT induced damage was demonstrated by a network of gene expression profiles illustrating the molecular relationships between the regulatory proteins. Further, CPs did not show toxicity or induce inflammatory mediators in the mouse model.

">IL1A enhances TNF-induced retinal ganglion cell death</a></h4>

              
                Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). A growing body of literature suggests a role for neuroinflammation in RGC death after glaucoma-relevant insults. For instance, it was shown that deficiency of three proinflammatory cytokines, complement component 1, subcomponent q (C1q), interleukin 1 alpha (Il1a), and tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), resulted in near complete protection of RGCs after two glaucoma-relevant insults, optic nerve injury and ocular hypertension. While TNF and C1Q have been extensively investigated in glaucoma-relevant model systems, the role of IL1A in RGC is not as well defined. Thus, we investigated the direct neurotoxicity of IL1A on RGCs in vivo. Intravitreal injection of IL1A did not result in RGC death at either 14 days or 12 weeks after insult. Consistent with previous studies, TNF injection did not result in significant RGC loss at 14 days but did after 12 weeks. Interestingly, IL1A+TNF resulted in a relatively rapid RGC death, driving significant RGC loss two weeks after injection. JUN activation and SARM1 have been implicated in RGC death in glaucoma and after cytokine insult. Using mice deficient in JUN or SARM1, we show RGC loss after IL1A+TNF insult is JUN-independent and SARM1-dependent. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that RGC death by SARM1 deficiency does not stop the neuroinflammatory response to IL1A+TNF. These findings indicate that IL1A can potentiate TNF-induced RGC death after combined insult is likely driven by a SARM1-dependent RGC intrinsic signaling pathway.

">Neuronal toxicity and recovery from early bortezomib-induced neuropathy: targeting the blood nerve barrier but not the dorsal root ganglion</a></h4>

              
                The use of the first in class proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BTZ) is highly effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma. However, its long-term use is limited by the fact, that most treated patients develop dose limiting painful polyneuropathy. In some of the treated patients, pain resolves after variable timeframes, in others it persists, despite the discontinuation of treatment, with the underlying mechanisms poorly understood. One condition of neural toxicity is the ability to penetrate the blood nerve barrier. Here we present pathways involved in early bortezomib-induced polyneuropathy (BIPN) development and its resolution, in rats and in myeloma patients. One cycle of BTZ elicited transient mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in rats. Transcriptomic signature and network analysis revealed regulation of circadian, extracellular matrix, and immune genes within the nerve and modest changes in the dorsal root ganglia. Recovery processes resealed the small molecule leakiness of the perineurial barrier, reversed axonal swelling, and normalized small fiber density in the skin. Expression of the microtubule-associated cytoskeletal protein cortactin matched this process in the perineurium. Netrin-1 (Ntn1) as a known barrier sealer was also upregulated in pain resolution in nerve and skin. In patients with painful BIPN skin NTN1 was independent of axonal damage. In summary, our data demonstrate that early BTZ toxicity targets mainly the nerve and indicates that pain resolution could be supported by protective growth factors like Ntn1 for remodeling of the extracellular matrix and neuronal barriers.

">Integrating Data Across Oscillatory Power Bands Predicts the Epileptogenic Zone: the Frequency Range Explorer Epileptogenic Zone (FREEZ) Identification Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy affects over 70 million people globally. One-third of people with focal epilepsy have drug-resistant epilepsy. Identification and removal of the site of onset of seizures, termed the epileptogenic zone (EZ), is the most successful treatment to stop seizures in these people. Implanting electrodes into the brain with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is the gold standard diagnostic test for identifying the EZ. But identification of the EZ with iEEG remains challenging in many cases. We developed a novel computational methodology that integrates mean power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high gamma frequencies over time to identify the EZ. A machine learning model was trained to predict electrodes within the EZ using publicly available data from 21 patients. In patients that were seizure free after surgery, electrodes within the EZ had significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) for mean power over time in the first 20 seconds after a seizure compared to electrodes outside the EZ in the alpha (p = 0.001), beta (p = 0.001), gamma (p <0.0001), and high gamma (p = 0.0003) ranges. Additionally, electrodes within the EZ in patients that became seizure-free after surgery had significantly higher AUC compared to electrodes marked within the EZ in patients who did not become seizure-free after surgery in the gamma (p = 0.0006) and high gamma (p <0.0001) power ranges. Leave-one-out patient cross validation of the machine learning model yielded a 95.7% positive predictive value and 80.6% specificity for identifying electrodes within the epileptogenic zone, and 90.5% accuracy for predicting seizure outcome based on a planned resection. We implemented this algorithm into the open-source software tool "Reproducible Analysis and Visualization of iEEG" (RAVE) to enable users to reproduce our results and implement this methodology with new datasets, creating a software module we title FREEZ. The software facilitates quantification of the spectral power changes during seizures, including displaying time-frequency spectrograms and projecting results across patient-specific 3D brain maps. Users can also adjust parameters for visualizing multiple frequency ranges from various time regions around seizure onsets in a web-browser-based interface.

">The Impact of Scene Context on Visual Object Recognition: Comparing Humans, Monkeys, and Computational Models</a></h4>

              
                During natural vision, we rarely see objects in isolation but rather embedded in rich and complex contexts. Understanding how the brain recognizes objects in natural scenes by integrating contextual information remains a key challenge. To elucidate neural mechanisms compatible with human visual processing, we need an animal model that behaves similarly to humans, so that inferred neural mechanisms can provide hypotheses relevant to the human brain. Here we assessed whether rhesus macaques could model human context-driven object recognition by quantifying visual object identification abilities across variations in the amount, quality, and congruency of contextual cues. Behavioral metrics revealed strikingly similar context-dependent patterns between humans and monkeys. However, neural responses in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys that were never explicitly trained to discriminate objects in context, as well as current artificial neural network models, could only partially explain this cross-species correspondence. The shared behavioral variance unexplained by context-naive neural data or computational models highlights fundamental knowledge gaps. Our findings demonstrate an intriguing alignment of human and monkey visual object processing that defies full explanation by either brain activity in a key visual region or state-of-the-art models.

">Using N2pc variability to probe functionality: Linear mixed modelling of trial EEG and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                This paper has two concurrent goals. On one hand, we hope it will serve as a simple primer in the use of linear mixed modelling (LMM) for inferential statistical analysis of multimodal data. We describe how LMM can be easily adopted for the identification of trial-wise relationships between disparate measures and provide a brief cookbook for assessing the suitability of LMM in your analyses. On the other hand, this paper is an empirical report, probing how trial-wise variance in the N2pc, and specifically its sub-component the NT, can be predicted by manual reaction time (RT) and stimuli parameters. Extant work has identified a link between N2pc and RT that has been interpreted as evidence of a direct and causative relationship. However, results have left open the less-interesting possibility that the measures covary as a function of motivation or arousal. Using LMM, we demonstrate that the relationship only emerges when the NT is elicited by targets, not distractors, suggesting a discrete and functional relationship. In other analyses, we find that the target-elicited NT is sensitive to variance in distractor identity even when the distractor cannot itself elicit consistently lateralized brain activity. The NT thus appears closely linked to attentional target processing, supporting the propagation of target-related information to response preparation and execution. At the same time, we find that this component is sensitive to distractor interference, which leaves open the possibility that NT reflects brain activity responsible for the suppression of irrelevant distractor information.

">The Interplay of Prior Information and Motion Cues in Resolving Visual Ambiguity in Agent Perception</a></h4>

              
                Agent perception is essential for social interaction, allowing individuals to interpret and respond to the actions of others within dynamic environments. In this study, we examined how prior knowledge and motion cues are integrated to influence the temporal dynamics of perceiving agents. In order to make realistic but ambiguous stimuli in motion and form characteristics, we used human, robot, and android agents. Using temporal representational similarity analysis (RSA) on EEG recordings, we analyzed the representation of agent identities under varying conditions: Still versus Moving stimuli and Prior versus Naive contexts. Our findings revealed that prior knowledge and motion cues interact to produce distinct temporal patterns of representation. In the naive condition, information about the agent persisted longer during still presentations than during moving ones, suggesting that the processing of agents depends on the availability of motion information and prior information. Moreover, motion information affects the temporal processing of agents when no prior information about agents is available. These results highlight the critical roles of both bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down expectations and their interactions in resolving the ambiguities inherent in agent perception.

">Aging disrupts the coordination between mRNA and protein expression in mouse and human midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Age-related dopamine (DA) neuron loss is a primary feature of Parkinsons disease. However, it remains unclear whether similar biological processes occur during healthy aging, albeit to a lesser degree. We therefore determined whether midbrain DA neurons degenerate during aging in mice and humans. In mice, we identified no changes in midbrain neuron numbers throughout aging. Despite this, we found age-related decreases in midbrain mRNA expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), the rate limiting enzyme of DA synthesis. Among midbrain glutamatergic cells, we similarly identified age-related declines in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) mRNA expression. In co-transmitting Th+/Vglut2+ neurons, Th and Vglut2 transcripts decreased with aging. Importantly, striatal Th and Vglut2 protein expression remained unchanged. In translating our findings to humans, we found no midbrain neurodegeneration during aging and identified age-related decreases in TH and VGLUT2 mRNA expression similar to mouse. Unlike mice, we discovered diminished density of striatal TH+ dopaminergic terminals in aged human subjects. However, TH and VGLUT2 protein expression were unchanged in the remaining striatal boutons. Finally, in contrast to Th and Vglut2 mRNA, expression of most ribosomal genes in Th+ neurons was either maintained or even upregulated during aging. This suggests a homeostatic mechanism where age-related declines in transcriptional efficiency are overcome by ongoing ribosomal translation. Overall, we demonstrate species-conserved transcriptional effects of aging in midbrain dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons that are not accompanied by marked cell death or lower striatal protein expression. This opens the door to novel therapeutic approaches to maintain neurotransmission and bolster neuronal resilience.

">Serotonin-2B receptor (5-HT2BR) expression and binding in the brain of ageing APPswe/PS1de9 transgenic mice and in human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Although evidence of dysregulation in central serotonergic signalling is widespread in Alzheimer's disease (AD), relatively little is known about the specific involvement of the serotonin-2B receptor (5-HT2BR) subtype. Here, we assessed 5-HT2BR expression and binding in brain tissue from APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (TG) mice and AD patients. 5-HT2BR mRNA was measured by RT-qPCR in 3- to >18-month-old TG and wild-type (WT) littermate mice (n=3-8), and in middle frontal gyrus samples from female, AD and control subjects (n=7-10). The density of 5-HT2BRs was measured by autoradiography using 1 nM [3H]RS127445 and 1 M LY266097. In both mouse and human samples, 5-HT2BR mRNA was detectable after 33 amplification cycles. mRNA levels in WT mice, not TG mice, increased with age, and were higher in AD patients compared to control subjects. [3H]RS127445 binding was low in the mouse brain, detected after 3 months of age. 5-HT2BR density was overall lower in the hippocampus of TG compared to WT mice. Specific binding was too low to be reliably quantified in the human samples. These data provide evidence of a different 5-HT2BR expression and binding in the APPswe/PS1dE9 TG model of AD and AD patients. Studies investigating the functional involvement of the 5-HT2BR in AD are warranted.

">Neural correlates of device-based sleep characteristics in adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying objective sleep patterns in adolescents and their implications for psychophysiological development is a complex challenge. Here, we applied sparse canonical correlation (sCCA) analysis on 3300 adolescents from Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, integrating extensive device-based sleep characteristics and multimodal imaging data. We revealed two sleep-brain dimensions: one characterized by later being asleep and shorter duration, linked to decreased subcortical-cortical network functional connectivities; the other showed higher heart rate and shorter light sleep duration, associated with lower brain volumes and decreased functional connectivities. Hierarchical clustering based on brain dimension associated with sleep characteristics revealed three biotypes of adolescents, marked by unique sleep profiles: biotype 1 exhibited delayed and shorter sleep, coupled with higher heart rate during sleep; biotype 3 with earlier and longer sleep, accompanied by lower heart rate; and biotype 2 with intermediate pattern. This biotypic differences also extended to cognition, academic attainment, brain structure and function in a gradient order. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated consistent biotypic differences from ages 9 to14, highlighting enduring cognitive and academic advantages in biotype3. The linked sleep-brain dimensions and the associated biotypes were well replicated in a longitudinal sample of 1271 individuals. Collectively, our novel findings delineate a linkage between objective sleep characteristics and developing brain in adolescents, underscoring their significance in cognitive development and academic attainment, which could serve as references for individuals with sleep difficulties and offer insights for optimizing sleep routines to enhance better cognitive development and school achievement.

">Decomposed Linear Dynamical Systems (dLDS) modelsreveal context-dependent dynamic connectivity in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Despite innumerable efforts to characterize C. elegans neural activity and behavior, the roles of each individual neuron and the compositional mechanisms of all their interactions are still not completely known. In particular, there is evidence that C. elegans neurons perform changing roles over time, in different behavioral contexts, etc.; however, existing stationary anatomical and functional connectivity can average across time and obfuscate the nonstationary nature of the neural dynamics. We contribute to these efforts by leveraging recent advances in decomposed linear dynamical systems (dLDS) models. dLDS models neural dynamics in a latent space with a set of linear operators that can be recombined and reused over time, enabling the discovery of multiple parallel neural processes on different timescales. We leverage the ability to identify reused patterns of dynamical neural interactions, which we call "dynamical connectivity," to 1) identify contextually dependent roles of neurons; 2) discover the underlying variability of neural representations even under discrete behaviors; 3) quantify differences between anatomical, functional, and dynamical connectivity; and 4) learn a single aligned latent space underlying multiple individual worms' activity. These results highlight the importance of defining a neuron's functions not solely by its internal activity or place in a time-averaged network, but by its evolving interactions across context-dependent circuits.

">A melancholy machine: simulated synapse loss induces depression-like behaviors in deep reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Deep Reinforcement Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses artificial neural networks to model reward-based learning as it occurs in biological agents. Here we modify a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach by imposing a suppressive effect on the connections between neurons in the artificial network - simulating the effect of dendritic spine loss as observed in major depressive disorder (MDD). Surprisingly, this simulated spine loss is sufficient to induce a variety of MDD-like behaviors in the artificially intelligent agent, including anhedonia, increased temporal discounting, avoidance, and an altered exploration/exploitation balance. Furthermore, simulating alternative and longstanding reward-processing-centric conceptions of MDD (dysfunction of the dopamine system, altered reward discounting, context-dependent learning rates, increased exploration) does not produce the same range of MDD-like behaviors. These results support a conceptual model of MDD as a reduction of brain connectivity (and thus information-processing capacity) rather than an imbalance in monoamines - though the computational model suggests a possible explanation for the dysfunction of dopamine systems in MDD. Reversing the spine-loss effect in our computational MDD model can lead to rescue of rewarding behavior under some conditions. This supports the search for treatments that increase plasticity and synaptogenesis, and the model suggests some implications for their effective administration.

">The within-subject stability of cortical thickness, surface area, and brain volumes across one year</a></h4>

              
                With the feature of noninvasively monitoring the human brain, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a ubiquitous means to understand how the brain works. Specifically, T1-weighted (T1w) imaging is widely used to examine the brain structure where the cortical thickness, surface area, and brain volumes have been investigated. These T1w-derived phenotypes undergo radical changes during childhood and adolescence, while remaining relatively stable during adulthood. However, stability over a short time (e.g. one year) during adulthood is still unknown. Additionally, how environmental factors such as time-of-day and different daylight lengths could impact the structural brain is also elusive. The main purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess the stability of T1w-derived phenotypes, i.e., cortical thickness, surface area, and brain volumes including subcortical volumes, and to explore the time-of-day and daylight length effects. Accordingly, three subjects in their late 20s, and early 30s and 40s were scanned repeatedly on the same scanner over one year from which a deep brain imaging dataset was constructed with 38, 40, and 25 sessions for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The T1w-derived phenotypes demonstrated percentage changes within 5% and CVs (coefficients of variance) within 2% for the majority of brain regions. However, several brain regions did show larger variations with percentage changes around 10% and CVs around 5%, such as the temporal pole, the frontal pole, and the entorhinal cortex. More importantly, there were no significant effects of time-of-day and daylight length. Moreover, cortical thickness change was strongly and positively correlated with that of volume while being negatively correlated with that of surface area, illustrating their distinct roles in brain anatomy. Additionally, it was found that apparent head motion causes cortical thickness and volume to be underestimated and surface area to be overestimated. These results indicate that T1w-derived phenotypes are reasonably stable regardless of time-of-day or daylight length, but that head motion should be taken into consideration.

                While circadian rhythm disruption may promote neurodegenerative disease, how aging and neurodegenerative pathology impact circadian gene expression patterns in different brain cell types is unknown. Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification methods to define the circadian translatomes of astrocytes, microglia, and bulk cerebral cortex, in healthy mouse brain and in the settings of amyloid-beta plaque pathology or aging. Our data reveal that glial circadian translatomes are highly cell type-specific and exhibit profound, context-dependent reprogramming of rhythmic transcripts in response to amyloid pathology or aging. Transcripts involved in glial activation, immunometabolism, and proteostasis, as well as nearly half of all Alzheimer Disease (AD)-associated risk genes, displayed circadian oscillations, many of which were altered by pathology. Amyloid-related differential gene expression was also dependent on time of day. Thus, circadian rhythms in gene expression are cell- and context dependent and provide important insights into glial gene regulation in health, AD, and aging.

                Spontaneous brain activity in the absence of external stimuli is not random but contains complex dynamical structures such as neuronal avalanches with power-law duration and size distributions. These experimental observations have been interpreted as supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the brain is operating at criticality and attracted much attention. Here, we show that an entire state of coherent bursting, with power-law distributed avalanches and features as observed in experiments, emerges in networks of adaptive neurons with stochastic input when excitation is sufficiently strong and balanced by adaptation. We demonstrate that these power-law distributed avalanches are direct consequences of stochasticity and the oscillatory population firing rate arising from coherent bursting, which in turn is the result of the balance between excitation and adaptation, and criticality does not play a role.

Only limited information is available about peripheral neuropathy (PN), although a notable component of AMN pathology besides myelopathy. To enrich our knowledge of PN, the current study reports the clinical, electromyographic and morphological aspects of peripheral neuropathy.

">Dynamic functional connectivity is modulated by the amount of p-Tau231 in blood in cognitively intact participants</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION Electrophysiology and plasma biomarkers are early and non-invasive candidates for Alzheimer's disease detection. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate changes in dynamic functional connectivity measured with magnetoencephalography, associated with the plasma pathology marker p-tau231 in unimpaired adults. METHODS 73 individuals were included. Static and dynamic functional connectivity were calculated using leakage corrected amplitude envelope correlation. Each source's strength entropy across trials was calculated. A data-driven statistical analysis was performed to find the association between functional connectivity and plasma p-tau231 levels. Regression models were used to assess the influence of other variables over the clusters' connectivity. RESULTS Frontotemporal dynamic connectivity positively associated with p-tau231 levels. Linear regression models identified pathological, functional and structural factors that influence dynamic functional connectivity. DISCUSSION These results expand previous literature on dynamic functional connectivity in healthy individuals at risk of AD, highlighting its usefulness as an early, non-invasive and more sensitive biomarker.

">No Electrophysiological Evidence for Semantic Processing During Inattentional Blindness</a></h4>

              
                A long-standing question concerns whether sensory input can reach semantic stages of processing in the absence of attention and awareness. Here, we examine whether the N400, an event related potential associated with semantic processing, can occur under conditions of inattentional blindness. By employing a novel three-phase inattentional blindness paradigm designed to maximise the opportunity for detecting an N400, we found no evidence for it when participants were inattentionally blind to the eliciting stimuli (related and unrelated word pairs). In contrast, when minimal attention was allocated to the same task-irrelevant word pairs, participants became aware of them, and a small N400 became evident. Finally, when the same stimuli were fully attended and relevant to the task, a robust N400 was observed. In addition to univariate ERP measures, multivariate decoding analyses were unable to classify related versus unrelated word pairs when observers were inattentionally blind to the words, with decoding reaching above-chance levels only when the words were (at least minimally) attended. Our results also replicated several previous studies by finding a visual awareness negativity (VAN) that distinguished task-irrelevant stimuli that were perceived compared with those that were not perceived, and a P3b (or late positivity) that was evident only when the stimuli were perceived and task relevant. Together, our findings suggest that semantic processing might require at least a minimal amount of attention.

">A hemispheric dome setup for naturalistic visual stimulation in head-fixed mice</a></h4>

              
                The visual system of any animal species is adapted to its ecological niche. Thus, investigating visual function and behavior using naturalistic stimuli holds significant potential. In mice, these adaptations include a field of view of ~280{degrees} and cone opsins sensitive to UV and green wavelengths. Such adaptations, however, cannot be probed with standard consumer displays. To present naturalistic visual stimuli to mice, we built a hemispheric dome setup, enabling the controlled projection of wide-field movies with UV-green spectral content. For our UV-green projection, we used a customized light engine with external high-power LEDs. We mitigated spatial distortions introduced by the projection through a geometry-independent calibration procedure. Additionally, we adapted a head-mounted eye tracking system to capture behavioral responses of head-fixed mice viewing these stimuli. We validated our setup by quantifying the pupillary light reflex to uniform stimuli and the optokinetic reflex to drifting gratings. Finally, in experiments with naturalistic movies, we investigated whether mice showed differential saccades and eye positions based on visual input. Comparing naturalistic movies to a uniform screen control condition, we observed that although head-fixed mice did not make targeted saccades during movies, their overall eye position consistently shifted towards more frontal regions of visual space. This indicates that mice adjust their eye position in a stimulus-dependent way, potentially to optimize visual processing of information ahead in the visual field. Together, our results highlight the utility of our setup for in vivo studies of the mouse visual system with more naturalistic visual stimulation.

">D-Serine inhibits non-ionotropic NMDA receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are widely recognized as master regulators of synaptic plasticity, most notably for driving long-term changes in synapse size and strength that support learning. NMDARs are unique among neurotransmitter receptors in that they require binding of both neurotransmitter (glutamate) and co-agonist (e.g. D-serine) to open the receptor channel, which leads to the influx of calcium ions that drive synaptic plasticity. Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated that NMDARs also support synaptic plasticity via ion flux-independent (non-ionotropic) signaling upon the binding of glutamate in the absence of co-agonist, although conflicting results have led to significant controversy. Here, we hypothesized that a major source of contradictory results can be attributed to variable occupancy of the co-agonist binding site under different experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated co-agonist availability in acute hippocampal slices from mice of both sexes. We found that enzymatic scavenging of endogenous co-agonists enhanced the magnitude of LTD induced by non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling in the presence of the NMDAR pore blocker, MK801. Conversely, a saturating concentration of D-serine completely inhibited both LTD and spine shrinkage induced by glutamate binding in the presence of MK801. Using a FRET-based assay in cultured neurons, we further found that D-serine completely blocked NMDA-induced conformational movements of the GluN1 cytoplasmic domains in the presence of MK801. Our results support a model in which D-serine inhibits ion flux-independent NMDAR signaling and plasticity, and thus D-serine availability could serve to modulate NMDAR signaling even when the NMDAR is blocked by magnesium.

">Functional efficacy of the MAO-B inhibitor safinamide in murine substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons in vitro: a comparative study with tranylcypromine</a></h4>

              
                Safinamide (SAF) is currently used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms based on its theoretical ability to potentiate the dopamine (DA) signal, blocking monoamine oxidase (MAO) B. The present work aims to highlight the functional relevance of SAF as an enhancer of the DA signal, by evaluating its ability to prolong recovery from DA-mediated firing inhibition of DAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), compared to another MAO antagonist, tranylcypromine (TCP). Using multielectrode array (MEA) and single electrode extracellular recordings of spontaneous spikes from presumed SNpc DAergic cells in vitro, we show that SAF (30 uM) mildly prolongs the DA-mediated firing inhibition, as opposed to the profound effect of TCP (10 uM). In patch-clamp recordings, we found that SAF (30 uM) significantly reduced the number of spikes evoked by depolarizing currents in SNpc DAergic neurons, in a sulpiride (1 uM) independent manner. According to our results, SAF marginally potentiates the DA signal in SNpc DAergic neurons, while exerting an inhibitory effect on the postsynaptic excitability acting on membrane conductances. Thus, we propose that the therapeutic effects of SAF in PD patients partially depends on MAO inhibition, while other MAO-independent sites of action could be more relevant.

">Alzheimer's disease-associated protective variant Plcg2-P522R modulates peripheral macrophage function in a sex-dimorphic manner and confers functional advantage in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies have identified a protective mutation in the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) gene which confers protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cognitive decline. Therefore, PLCG2, which is primarily expressed in immune cells, has become a target of interest for potential therapeutic intervention. The protective allele, known as P522R, has been shown to be hyper-morphic in microglia, increasing phagocytosis of amyloid-beta (A{beta}), and increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of this protective mutation on peripheral tissue-resident macrophages, and the extent to which sex modifies this effect, has yet to be assessed. Herein, we show that peripheral macrophages from wild-type (WT) female and male mice harbor intrinsic differences, with macrophages from females exhibiting less phagocytosis and lysosomal protease activity, as well as a more pro-inflammatory phenotype upon stimulation compared to those from male mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the P522R mutation does indeed alter peripheral macrophage function in a sex-dependent manner, with more prominent effects seen in females, including pushing macrophages from females toward an M2 protective phenotype that more closely resembles macrophages from males. These results suggest that the P522R mutation may be partially conferring protection against protein aggregation via activation of peripheral immune cell function and underscore the importance of considering sex as a biological variable when assessing the viability of potential immune system-targeted therapies.

">Brain-state modeling using electroencephalography: Application to adaptive closed-loop neuromodulation for epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The progress of developing an effective closed-loop neuromodulation system for many neurological pathologies is hindered by the difficulties in accurately capturing a useful representation of a brain's instantaneous functional state. Existing approaches rely on expert labeling of electroencephalography data to develop biomarkers of neurophysiological pathology. These techniques do not capture the highly complex functional states of the brain that are presumed to exist between labeled states or allow for the likely possibility of variation among identically labeled states. Thus, we propose BrainState, a self-supervised technique to model an arbitrarily complex instantaneous functional state of a brain using neural multivariate timeseries data. Application of BrainState to intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with epilepsy was able to capture diverse pre-seizure states and quantify nuanced effects of neuromodulation. We anticipate that BrainState will enable the development of sophisticated closed-loop neuromodulation systems for a diverse array of neurological pathologies.

">AKT2 modulates astrocytic nicotine responses in vivo.</a></h4>

              
                A better understanding of nicotine neurobiology is needed to reduce or prevent chronic addiction, ameliorate the detrimental effects of nicotine withdrawal, and increase successful cessation of use. Nicotine binds and activates two astrocyte-expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), 4{beta}2 and 7. We recently found that Protein kinase B-{beta} (Pkb-{beta} or Akt2) expression is restricted to astrocytes in mice and humans. To determine if AKT2 plays a role in astrocytic nicotinic responses, we generated astrocyte-specific Akt2 conditional knockout (cKO) and full Akt2 KO mice for in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo studies, we examined mice exposed to chronic nicotine for two weeks in drinking water (200 g/mL) and following acute nicotine challenge (0.09, 0.2 mg/kg) after 24 hrs. Our in vitro studies used cultured mouse astrocytes to measure nicotine-dependent astrocytic responses. We validated our approaches using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure inducing astrogliosis. Sholl analysis was used to measure glial fibrillary acidic protein responses in astrocytes. Our data show that wild-type (WT) mice exhibit increased astrocyte morphological complexity during acute nicotine exposure, with decreasing complexity during chronic nicotine use, whereas Akt2 cKO mice showed increased astrocyte morphology complexity. In culture, we found that 100M nicotine was sufficient for morphological changes and blocking 7 or 4{beta}2 nAChRs prevented observed morphologic changes. Finally, we performed conditioned place preference (CPP) in Akt2 cKO mice and found that astrocytic AKT2 deficiency reduced nicotine preference compared to controls. These findings show the importance of nAChRs and Akt2 signaling in the astrocytic response to nicotine.

">Computer vision guided open-source active commutator for neural imaging in freely behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                Recently developed miniaturized neural recording devices that can monitor and perturb neural activity in freely behaving animals have significantly expanded our knowledge neural underpinning of complex behaviors. Most miniaturized neural interfaces require a wired connection for external power and data acquisition systems. The wires are required to be commutated through a slip ring to accommodate for twisting of the wire or tether and alleviate torsional stresses. The increased trend towards long term continuous neural recordings have spurred efforts to realize active commutators that can sense the torsional stress and actively rotation the slip ring to alleviate torsional stresses. Current solutions however require addition of sensing modules. Here we report on an active translating commutator that uses computer vision (CV) algorithms on behavioral imaging videos captured during the experiment to track the animal's position and heading direction in real-time and uses this information to control the translation and rotation of a slipring commutator to accommodate for accumulated mouse heading orientation changes and position. The CV guided active commutator has been extensively tested in three separate behavioral contexts and we show reliable cortex-wide imaging in a mouse in an open-field with a miniaturized widefield cortical imaging device. Active commutation resulted in no changes to measured neurophysiological signals. The active commutator is fully open source, can be assembled using readily available off-the-shelf components, and is compatible with a wide variety of miniaturized neurophotonic and neurophysiology devices.

">Clearing-enabled light sheet microscopy as a novel method for three-dimensional mapping of the sensory innervation of the mouse knee</a></h4>

              
                A major barrier that hampers our understanding of the precise anatomic distribution of pain sensing nerves in and around the joint is the limited view obtained from traditional two dimensional (D) histological approaches. Therefore, our objective was to develop a workflow that allows examination of the innervation of the intact mouse knee joint in 3D by employing clearing-enabled light sheet microscopy. We first surveyed existing clearing protocols (SUMIC, PEGASOS, and DISCO) to determine their ability to clear the whole mouse knee joint, and discovered that a DISCO protocol provided the most optimal transparency for light sheet microscopy imaging. We then modified the DISCO protocol to enhance binding and penetration of antibodies used for labeling nerves. Using the pan-neuronal PGP9.5 antibody, our protocol allowed 3D visualization of innervation in and around the mouse knee joint. We then implemented the workflow in mice intra-articularly injected with nerve growth factor (NGF) to determine whether changes in the nerve density can be observed. Both 3D and 2D analytical approaches of the light sheet microscopy images demonstrated quantifiable changes in midjoint nerve density following 4 weeks of NGF injection in the medial but not in the lateral joint compartment. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive workflow that allows detailed and quantifiable examination of mouse knee joint innervation in 3D.

">Neuronal segmentation in cephalopod arms</a></h4>

              
                The prehensile arms of the cephalopod are among these animals most remarkable features, but the neural circuitry governing arm and sucker movements remains largely unknown. We studied the neuronal organization of the adult axial nerve cord (ANC) of Octopus bimaculoides with molecular and cellular methods. The ANCs, which lie in the center of every arm, are the largest neuronal structures in the octopus, containing four times as many neurons as found in the central brain. In transverse cross section, the cell body layer (CBL) of the ANC wraps around its neuropil (NP) with little apparent segregation of sensory and motor neurons or nerve exits. Strikingly, when studied in longitudinal sections, the ANC is segmented. ANC neuronal cell bodies form columns separated by septa, with 15 segments overlying each pair of suckers. The segments underlie a modular organization to the ANC neuropil: neuronal cell bodies within each segment send the bulk of their processes directly into the adjoining neuropil, with some reaching the contralateral side. In addition, some nerve processes branch upon entering the NP, forming short-range projections to neighboring segments and mid-range projections to the ANC segments of adjoining suckers. The septa between the segments are employed as ANC nerve exits and as channels for ANC vasculature. Cellular analysis establishes that adjoining septa issue nerves with distinct fiber trajectories, which across two segments (or three septa) fully innervate the arm musculature. Sucker nerves also use the septa, setting up a nerve fiber ''suckerotopy'' in the sucker-side of the ANC. Comparative anatomy suggests a strong link between segmentation and flexible sucker-laden arms. In the squid Doryteuthis pealeii, the arms and the sucker-rich club of the tentacles have segments, but the sucker-poor stalk of the tentacles does not. The neural modules described here provide a new template for understanding the motor control of octopus soft tissues. In addition, this finding represents the first demonstration of nervous system segmentation in a mollusc.

">CRISPRi-based screen of Autism Spectrum Disorder risk genes in microglia uncovers roles of ADNP in microglia endocytosis and uptake of synaptic material</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders with complex biology. The identification of ASD risk genes from exome-wide association studies and de novo variation analyses has enabled mechanistic investigations into how ASD-risk genes alter development. Most functional genomics studies have focused on the role of these genes in neurons and progenitor cells. However, roles for ASD risk genes in other cell types are largely uncharacterized. There is evidence from postmortem tissue that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, appear activated in ASD. Here, we systematically assess the impact of ASD-risk gene knock-down on microglial uptake of synaptic material. We developed both an iPSC-derived microglia-neuron coculture system and high-throughput flow cytometry readout for synaptic uptake to enable CRISPRi-based screening. Our screen identified ADNP, one of the high-confidence ASD risk genes, amongst others as a modifier of microglial synaptic uptake. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional analyses revealed that ADNP plays a role in endocytosis, cell surface remodeling, and motility in microglia. Through this focused investigation into the role of ADNP in microglia, we also found preliminary evidence for WNT signaling coordinating microglial uptake of synaptic material.

">Role of the nucleus accumbens in signaled avoidance actions</a></h4>

              
                Animals, humans included, navigate their environments guided by sensory cues, responding adaptively to potential dangers and rewards. Avoidance behaviors serve as adaptive strategies in the face of signaled threats, but the neural mechanisms orchestrating these behaviors remain elusive. Current circuit models of avoidance behaviors indicate that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum plays a key role in signaled avoidance behaviors, but the nature of this engagement is unclear. Evolving perspectives propose the NAc as a pivotal hub for action selection, integrating cognitive and affective information to heighten the efficiency of both appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors. To unravel the engagement of the NAc during active and passive avoidance, we used calcium imaging fiber photometry and single-unit recordings to examine NAc GABAergic neuron activity in freely moving mice performing avoidance behaviors. We then probed the functional significance of NAc neurons using optogenetics, and genetically targeted or electrolytic lesions. We found that NAc neurons code contraversive orienting movements and avoidance actions. Intriguingly, specific optogenetic patterns intended to excite NAc GABAergic neurons resulted in local somatic inhibition through GABAergic synaptic collaterals. Nevertheless, these patterns directly excited NAc GABAergic output axons, which in turn inhibited their targets, disrupting active avoidance behavior. Thus, this disruption stemmed from abnormal alterations in the activity of downstream midbrain areas crucial for the behavior. In contrast, direct optogenetic inhibition or lesions of NAc neurons did not impair active or passive avoidance behaviors, challenging the notion of their purported pivotal role in adaptive avoidance. The findings emphasize that NAc is not required for avoidance behaviors, but disruptions in NAc output during pathological states can impair these behaviors.

	<p>This study introduces Multi-Threshold Recurrence Rate Plots (MTRRP), a novel methodology for analyzing dynamic patterns in complex systems, such as those influenced by neurodegenerative diseases in brain activity. MTRRP characterizes how recurrence rates evolve with increasing recurrence thresholds. A key innovation of our approach, Recurrence Complexity, captures structural complexity by integrating local randomness and global structural features through the product of Recurrence Rate Gradient and Recurrence Hurst, both derived from MTRRP. We applied this technique to resting-state EEG data from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and age-matched healthy controls. The results revealed significantly higher recurrence complexity in the occipital areas of AD and FTD patients, particularly pronounced in the Alpha and Beta frequency bands. Furthermore, EEG features derived from MTRRP were evaluated using a Support Vector Machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.7%. These findings not only underscore the utility of MTRRP in detecting distinct neurophysiological patterns associated with neurodegenerative diseases but also highlight its broader applicability in time series analysis, providing a substantial tool for advancing medical diagnostics and research.</p>

                In this white paper, we describe the founding of a new ELIXIR Community - the Systems Biology Community - and its proposed future contributions to both ELIXIR and the broader community of systems biologists in Europe and worldwide. The Community believes that the infrastructure aspects of systems biology - databases, (modelling) tools and standards development, as well as training and access to cloud infrastructure - are not only appropriate components of the ELIXIR infrastructure, but will prove key components of ELIXIR’s future support of advanced biological applications and personalised medicine. By way of a series of meetings, the Community identified seven key areas for its future activities, reflecting both future needs and previous and current activities within ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. These are: overcoming barriers to the wider uptake of systems biology; linking new and existing data to systems biology models; interoperability of systems biology resources; further development and embedding of systems medicine; provisioning of modelling as a service; building and coordinating capacity building and training resources; and supporting industrial embedding of systems biology. A set of objectives for the Community has been identified under four main headline areas: Standardisation and Interoperability, Technology, Capacity Building and Training, and Industrial Embedding. These are grouped into short-term (3-year), mid-term (6-year) and long-term (10-year) objectives.

                Background Persistent neck pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition that affects the quality of life and functional abilities of individuals. Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFRT) is a novel therapeutic approach that involves restricting blood flow to exercising muscles to enhance strength and function. However, limited research has been conducted on the effects of BFRT on pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the potential benefits of BFRT as a treatment intervention for this population. Methods This study will be a prospective 1:1 allocation, parallel group active controlled trail conducted at Physiotherapy Department, Galgotias University. The trial was prospectively registered with the Clinical Trial Registry India CTRI/2023/06/053439. Informed consent will be obtained from all the participants who are eligible to be included in the study. A total of 110 patients with persistent neck pain will be randomly allocated into two groups. The BFRT group will receive supervised training sessions three times a week for eight weeks, performing low-load resistance exercises with blood flow restriction applied using personalized cuff pressure. The control group will receive standard care for neck pain, which may include general advice, manual therapy, and/or home exercises without BFRT. The primary outcome measures will be the pressure pain threshold, assessed using a pressure Algometer, and hand function, evaluated using standardized tests such as Hand Grip Strength and Purdue Peg board Test. Results The data obtained will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, and the significance level will be set at p<0.05. Conclusion This trial will contribute valuable contribution highlighting the potential benefits of BFR training in improving pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain.

                Background In recent years, various advancements in anticancer therapy have led to the development of multiple regimens and protocols. This study endeavors to provide an extensive evaluation of anticancer therapy prescription patterns in correlation with patient outcomes. Methods From June 2014 to April 2022, we included adult cancer patients who received anticancer therapy in our cancer center. Collected data encompassed demographic characteristics of patients and cancer, chemotherapy protocols or agents, antiemetics, drug side effects, and the patient’s last status. The prescribed drugs were assessed using the Essential Medicines List, while the prescription’s rationality was determined using the World Health Organization indicators. Results The mean age was 55.16 ± 17.04 years, with 56.4% of the patients being males. Gastrointestinal (29.7%) and breast (25.8%) cancers were the most common malignancies. The main protocols included a combination of Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (20.1%) and folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin-based (FOLFOX) regimen (13.5%). The most frequently used drugs were doxorubicin (14.0%), cyclophosphamide (13.3%), and docetaxel (9.9%). The majority of patients also did not report any acute adverse events related to chemotherapy (81.1%). Antiemetics, mainly metoclopramide-based, were used in 76.07% of cases. Remarkably, 86.7% of anticancer agents were from the EML, and 90.1% were prescribed generically. Conclusion In this study, gastrointestinal cancers were the most prevalent cancers observed, with more preponderance among males. Most anticancer agents were taken from the essential drug list, with the majority being prescribed under generic names, indicating rational use.

                Background Pulmonary involvement is a major cause of internal organ complication and the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This study aimed to demonstrate the characteristics of pulmonary function (PF) in Thai patients with SSc and the association between PF and body mass index (BMI) and anti-topoisomerase (anti-Scl70). Methods All patients diagnosed with SSc in our tertiary care teaching hospital database between 2016 and 2021 were reviewed and analyzed. Results Of 211 SSc patients, 128 patients who underwent the PF test were enrolled; 102 (79.7%) were female. The mean age was 54 years. The median BMI for all patients was 21.7 kg/m2. Regarding anti-Scl70, 10.9% of patients were positive, 7.8% were negative, and the status was unreported for 81.3%. The mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.8 (0.1). The mean (SD) % predicted values of FEV1, FVC, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were 76.3 (16.3), 69.1 (15.8), and 75.5 (22.8), respectively. A restrictive spirometry pattern (RSP) was found in 78.8% of the patients. DLCO had a moderate positive linear correlation with FVC (r=0.50, p <0.001) and a moderate negative linear correlation with BMI (r=-0.36, p <0.001). However, there was no correlation between FVC and BMI. There was no statistical difference in demographic data or the presence of anti-Scl70 among patients with or without RSP. Conclusions RSP is common among Thai patients with SSc. However, the power of using demographic data and the presence of anti-Scl70 to determine the probability of pulmonary involvement remains limited.

                Introduction The commonest type of cancer in the head and neck region is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) due to its high rates of occurrence and mortality. The early diagnosis of oral cancer gives better prognosis. Brandwein-Gensler criteria predict the early stage of OSCC cases with a high risk of locoregional recurrence. Objectives To correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion of OSCC with three-year survival. Methodology In the study, This study will include 80 random histopathologically-diagnosed cases of OSCC. hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained section slides will be used to evaluate, Brandwein and Gensler criteria by three histopathologists in a blinded manner. The depth of invasion assessment will be done from the basement-membrane (BM), in regions where the BM has been lost, as well as from an illustrative line connecting the BM from the neighbouring epithelium to the point of deepest tumour invasion in the connective-tissue stroma with the help of a research microscope (Leica-DMLB2) in resected tissue specimens of OSCC cases. Expected results The present study will find the correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion in OSCC in order to evaluate the locoregional recurrence in OSCC cases. In high-risk OSCC cases, there may be an increased depth of invasion in resected tissues. Conclusions We hypothesized that the correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion can be used as an independent predictor for locoregional recurrence in OSCC.

                Background Interpersonal meaning is the interaction between the speaker and the listener and the writer and the reader. This study aims to determine the structure of mood and how the structure of mood is found. The purposes of this study are (1) to be more sensitive to the mood structure shown in Maybelline New York cosmetic advertisement. (2) to investigate the reason of why interrogative sentences are more difficult to find than declarative sentences. Through this research, we can see the types of mood structures, and how these mood structures are used. Methods The type of research approach used is descriptive qualitative. Research in this case describes systematically, factually and accurately facts and causal relationships of the phenomena studied. The sources of data in this study are eight cosmetic Maybelline New York products, namely the Maybelline gel pencil, L’oreal colour riche nail, Maybelline mascara and eyeliner, Maybelline creamy lipmatte and Maybelline eyeshadow, Maybelline eyeliner, Maybelline lipstick, and Maybelline clear smooth all in one. Results In analyzing the data, the researcher of the 2014 Halliday theory revised by Mathiesse found that there are three types of manifested mood, four types of realized speech function, and mood-based realization of speech function. The moods manifested were declarative (48.64%), interrogative (5.40%) and imperative (45.94%). Speech functions that are realized are statements (48.64%), questions (5.40%), offers (18.91%) and command (24.32%). Conclusions It can be concluded that declarative sentences are mostly found in Maybelline New York products. Researchers suggest that readers be more careful in using mood structures in cosmetic advertisements so that there are no misunderstandings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1339/v3?src=rss">Outward investment of Portuguese small and medium enterprises in the Central and Eastern European countries: motivations and challenges [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper identifies the determinant factors of Portuguese investment in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. We assume that investment abroad is motivated by business opportunities, and the quality-price ratio of the workforce. Methods To this end, we used a qualitative methodology composed of 6 case studies, based on interviews and surveys with the managers of the Portuguese firms investing in those three economies. Results Despite the business opportunities, Portuguese investment directed towards these economies is negligible, due, in part, to the geographic and cultural distance. However, the economic and political stability, combined with market size and growth potential are undeniable attraction factors for Portuguese investors. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their flexible conditions that allow changes in the activity, and the strong trend towards outsourcing, to the detriment of the manufacturing industry, are the primary focus of international investment. This trend, although common to several sectors, has shown greater dynamism in the banking and financial sector. Conclusions The results suggest market-oriented investments aiming at growth and expansion. The vast Polish market is the one that most attracted Portuguese investors. The hybrid feature of some strategies can align with the cautious attitude towards the investment translated into cooperation agreements with financial institutions for funding, the market learning process, and the training of the personnel. The anticipation of the installation over potential competitors, the experience in production and international markets, the price-quality ratio, the capacity of product adaptation and the design were considered important sources of competitive advantage that motivated the investment. The greatest difficulties during this process were language and the complexity of legislation.

                Background Amidst the global escalation of COVID-19, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to some moral dilemmas. This study aims to explore the psychological burden and dilemmas faced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards, elucidating their professional distress and rewards, and examining their interrelation. Methods This qualitative descriptive study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data on the experiences of nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results The study involved 12 participants (8 women and 4 men). Their experience ranged from 4-21 years. The group included 6 staff nurses, 3 head or deputy head nurses, and 3 head nurses. No significant changes were observed in weekly working hours pre- and post-COVID-19. Analysis of the interviews revealed that nurses working in COVID-19 wards experienced conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they also reported finding rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions This study revealed that nurses experienced distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges, leading to a sense of mistrust towards their organizations. However, working in COVID-19 wards also brought a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly through interactions with individuals they had not previously encountered. These experiences are illustrative of the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the distress and rewards inherent in their roles.

                Background Differentiating between ameloblastoma (AB) and ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) is difficult, especially when AB has atypical cytological characteristics or an uncommon clinical history. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the differential expression of immunohistochemical markers between AB and AC. Methods We conducted a thorough search of PUBMED and SCOPUS according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify cross-sectional studies that compared the expression of immunohistochemical markers in AB and AC. We used a random-effects model to analyze the risk ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The Egger’s test was used to assess publication bias. Results In total, 301 articles were identified. After excluding irrelevant titles and abstracts, 86 articles were selected for full-text review. We categorized the 41 markers into proliferative and non-proliferative markers. Among non-proliferative markers, nuclear markers were differentially expressed in AB and AC. SOX2 was the only marker that significantly differentiated AB and AC, with an RR of -0.19 (CI 0.10-0.36, I2=0). Conclusion The current evidence suggests the significance of SOX2 in differentiating between AB and AC, warranting prospective confirmation in well-defined extensive studies. We highlight the paucity of high-quality replicated studies of other markers in this field. Collaborative efforts with standardized techniques are necessary to generate clinically useful immunohistochemical markers.

                Background Determining the appropriate computational requirements and software performance is essential for efficient genomic surveillance. The lack of standardized benchmarking complicates software selection, especially with limited resources. Methods We developed a containerized benchmarking pipeline to evaluate seven long-read assemblers—Canu, GoldRush, MetaFlye, Strainline, HaploDMF, iGDA, and RVHaplo—for viral haplotype reconstruction, using both simulated and experimental Oxford Nanopore sequencing data of HIV-1 and other viruses. Benchmarking was conducted on three computational systems to assess each assembler’s performance, utilizing QUAST and BLASTN for quality assessment. Results Our findings show that assembler choice significantly impacts assembly time, with CPU and memory usage having minimal effect. Assembler selection also influences the size of the contigs, with a minimum read length of 2,000 nucleotides required for quality assembly. A 4,000-nucleotide read length improves quality further. Canu was efficient among de novo assemblers but not suitable for multi-strain mixtures, while GoldRush produced only consensus assemblies. Strainline and MetaFlye were suitable for metagenomic sequencing data, with Strainline requiring high memory and MetaFlye operable on low-specification machines. Among reference-based assemblers, iGDA had high error rates, RVHaplo showed the best runtime and accuracy but became ineffective with similar sequences, and HaploDMF, utilizing machine learning, had fewer errors with a slightly longer runtime. Conclusions The HIV-64148 pipeline, containerized using Docker, facilitates easy deployment and offers flexibility to select from a range of assemblers to match computational systems or study requirements. This tool aids in genome assembly and provides valuable information on HIV-1 sequences, enhancing viral evolution monitoring and understanding.

                <p>by Lulu Gong, Fabio Pasqualetti, Thomas Papouin, ShiNung Ching</p>

Astrocytes are a ubiquitous and enigmatic type of non-neuronal cell and are found in the brain of all vertebrates. While traditionally viewed as being supportive of neurons, it is increasingly recognized that astrocytes play a more direct and active role in brain function and neural computation. On account of their sensitivity to a host of physiological covariates and ability to modulate neuronal activity and connectivity on slower time scales, astrocytes may be particularly well poised to modulate the dynamics of neural circuits in functionally salient ways. In the current paper, we seek to capture these features via actionable abstractions within computational models of neuron-astrocyte interaction. Specifically, we engage how nested feedback loops of neuron-astrocyte interaction, acting over separated time-scales, may endow astrocytes with the capability to enable learning in context-dependent settings, where fluctuations in task parameters may occur much more slowly than within-task requirements. We pose a general model of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interaction and use formal analysis to characterize how astrocytic modulation may constitute a form of meta-plasticity, altering the ways in which synapses and neurons adapt as a function of time. We then embed this model in a bandit-based reinforcement learning task environment, and show how the presence of time-scale separated astrocytic modulation enables learning over multiple fluctuating contexts. Indeed, these networks learn far more reliably compared to dynamically homogeneous networks and conventional non-network-based bandit algorithms. Our results fuel the notion that neuron-astrocyte interactions in the brain benefit learning over different time-scales and the conveyance of task-relevant contextual information onto circuit dynamics.

                <p>by Garrick W. Bruening, Robert J. Courter, Shruthi Sukumar, Megan K. O’Brien, Alaa A. Ahmed</p>

On any given day, we make countless reaching movements to objects around us. While such ubiquity may suggest uniformity, each movement’s speed is unique—why is this? Reach speed is known to be influenced by accuracy; we slow down to sustain high accuracy. However, in other forms of movement like walking or running, metabolic cost is often the primary determinant of movement speed. Here we bridge this gap and ask: how do metabolic cost and accuracy interact to determine speed of reaching movements? First, we systematically measure the effect of increasing mass on the metabolic cost of reaching across a range of movement speeds. Next, in a sequence of three experiments, we examine how added mass affects preferred reaching speed across changing accuracy requirements. We find that, while added mass consistently increases metabolic cost thereby leading to slower metabolically optimal movement speeds, self-selected reach speeds are slower than those predicted by an optimization of metabolic cost alone. We then demonstrate how a single model that considers both accuracy and metabolic costs can explain preferred movement speeds. Together, our findings provide a unifying framework to illuminate the combined effects of metabolic cost and accuracy on movement speed and highlight the integral role metabolic cost plays in determining reach speed.

                <p>by Thomas J. Hladish, Alexander N. Pillai, Carl A. B. Pearson, Kok Ben Toh, Andrea C. Tamayo, Arlin Stoltzfus, Ira M. Longini</p>

We evaluate approaches to vaccine distribution using an agent-based model of human activity and COVID-19 transmission calibrated to detailed trends in cases, hospitalizations, deaths, seroprevalence, and vaccine breakthrough infections in Florida, USA. We compare the incremental effectiveness for four different distribution strategies at four different levels of vaccine supply, starting in late 2020 through early 2022. Our analysis indicates that the best strategy to reduce severe outcomes would be to actively target high disease-risk individuals. This was true in every scenario, although the advantage was greatest for the intermediate vaccine availability assumptions and relatively modest compared to a simple mass vaccination approach under high vaccine availability. Ring vaccination, while generally the most effective strategy for reducing infections, ultimately proved least effective at preventing deaths. We also consider using age group as a practical surrogate measure for actual disease-risk targeting; this approach also outperforms both simple mass distribution and ring vaccination. We find that quantitative effectiveness of a strategy depends on whether effectiveness is assessed after the alpha, delta, or omicron wave. However, these differences in absolute benefit for the strategies do not change the ranking of their performance at preventing severe outcomes across vaccine availability assumptions.

                <p>by Philippe Nguyen, Jinani Sooriyaarachchi, Qianyu Huang, Curtis L. Baker Jr.</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond selectively to simple features of visual stimuli, such as orientation and spatial frequency. Simple cells, which have phase-sensitive responses, can be modeled by a single receptive field filter in a linear-nonlinear model. However, it is challenging to analyze phase-invariant complex cells, which require more elaborate models having a combination of nonlinear subunits. Estimating parameters of these models is made additionally more difficult by cortical neurons’ trial-to-trial response variability. We develop a simple convolutional neural network method to estimate receptive field models for both simple and complex visual cortex cells from their responses to natural images. The model consists of a spatiotemporal filter, a parameterized rectifier unit (PReLU), and a two-dimensional Gaussian "map" of the receptive field envelope. A single model parameter determines the simple vs. complex nature of the receptive field, capturing complex cell responses as a summation of homogeneous subunits, and collapsing to a linear-nonlinear model for simple type cells. The convolutional method predicts simple and complex cell responses to natural image stimuli as well as grating tuning curves. The fitted models yield a continuum of values for the PReLU parameter across the sampled neurons, showing that the simple/complex nature of cells can vary in a continuous manner. We demonstrate that complex-like cells respond less reliably than simple-like cells. However, compensation for this unreliability with noise ceiling analysis reveals predictive performance for complex cells proportionately closer to that for simple cells. Most spatial receptive field structures are well fit by Gabor functions, whose parameters confirm well-known properties of cat A17/18 receptive fields.

                <p>by Tomas Ferreira Amaro Freire, Zhijian Hu, Kevin B. Wood, Erida Gjini</p>

Multi-drug combinations to treat bacterial populations are at the forefront of approaches for infection control and prevention of antibiotic resistance. Although the evolution of antibiotic resistance has been theoretically studied with mathematical population dynamics models, extensions to spatial dynamics remain rare in the literature, including in particular spatial evolution of multi-drug resistance. In this study, we propose a reaction-diffusion system that describes the multi-drug evolution of bacteria based on a drug-concentration rescaling approach. We show how the resistance to drugs in space, and the consequent adaptation of growth rate, is governed by a Price equation with diffusion, integrating features of drug interactions and collateral resistances or sensitivities to the drugs. We study spatial versions of the model where the distribution of drugs is homogeneous across space, and where the drugs vary environmentally in a piecewise-constant, linear and nonlinear manner. Although in many evolution models, per capita growth rate is a natural surrogate for fitness, in spatially-extended, potentially heterogeneous habitats, fitness is an emergent property that potentially reflects additional complexities, from boundary conditions to the specific spatial variation of growth rates. Applying concepts from perturbation theory and reaction-diffusion equations, we propose an analytical metric for characterization of <i>average mutant fitness</i> in the spatial system based on the principal eigenvalue of our linear problem, λ<sub>1</sub>. This enables an accurate translation from drug spatial gradients and mutant antibiotic susceptibility traits to the relative advantage of each mutant across the environment. Our approach allows one to predict the precise outcomes of selection among mutants over space, ultimately from comparing their λ<sub>1</sub> values, which encode a critical interplay between growth functions, movement traits, habitat size and boundary conditions. Such mathematical understanding opens new avenues for multi-drug therapeutic optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011145">How well do models of visual cortex generalize to out of distribution samples?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yifei Ren, Pouya Bashivan</p>

Unit activity in particular deep neural networks (DNNs) are remarkably similar to the neuronal population responses to static images along the primate ventral visual cortex. Linear combinations of DNN unit activities are widely used to build predictive models of neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Nevertheless, prediction performance in these models is often investigated on stimulus sets consisting of everyday objects under naturalistic settings. Recent work has revealed a generalization gap in how predicting neuronal responses to synthetically generated out-of-distribution (OOD) stimuli. Here, we investigated how the recent progress in improving DNNs’ object recognition generalization, as well as various DNN design choices such as architecture, learning algorithm, and datasets have impacted the generalization gap in neural predictivity. We came to a surprising conclusion that the performance on none of the common computer vision OOD object recognition benchmarks is predictive of OOD neural predictivity performance. Furthermore, we found that adversarially robust models often yield substantially higher generalization in neural predictivity, although the degree of robustness itself was not predictive of neural predictivity score. These results suggest that improving object recognition behavior on current benchmarks alone may not lead to more general models of neurons in the primate ventral visual cortex.

Negation is key for cognition but has no physical basis, raising questions about its neural origins. A new study in PLOS Biology on the negation of scalar adjectives shows that negation acts in part by altering the response to the adjective it negates.

All languages make use of negation, but the neural bases of our cognitive ability to process negation remain unknown. This Primer explores a new PLOS Biology study which shows that humans first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning.

                <p>by Ricarda Sabitzki, Anna-Lena Roßmann, Marius Schmitt, Sven Flemming, Andrés Guillén-Samander, Hannah Michaela Behrens, Ernst Jonscher, Katharina Höhn, Ulrike Fröhlke, Tobias Spielmann</p>

Vesicular trafficking, including secretion and endocytosis, plays fundamental roles in the unique biology of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood-stage parasites. Endocytosis of host cell cytosol (HCC) provides nutrients and room for parasite growth and is critical for the action of antimalarial drugs and parasite drug resistance. Previous work showed that PfVPS45 functions in endosomal transport of HCC to the parasite’s food vacuole, raising the possibility that malaria parasites possess a canonical endolysosomal system. However, the seeming absence of VPS45-typical functional interactors such as rabenosyn 5 (Rbsn5) and the repurposing of Rab5 isoforms and other endolysosomal proteins for secretion in apicomplexans question this idea. Here, we identified a parasite Rbsn5-like protein and show that it functions with VPS45 in the endosomal transport of HCC. We also show that PfRab5b but not PfRab5a is involved in the same process. Inactivation of PfRbsn5L resulted in PI3P and PfRab5b decorated HCC-filled vesicles, typical for endosomal compartments. Overall, this indicates that despite the low sequence conservation of PfRbsn5L and the unusual N-terminal modification of PfRab5b, principles of endosomal transport in malaria parasite are similar to that of model organisms. Using a conditional double protein inactivation system, we further provide evidence that the PfKelch13 compartment, an unusual apicomplexa-specific endocytosis structure at the parasite plasma membrane, is connected upstream of the Rbsn5L/VPS45/Rab5b-dependent endosomal route. Altogether, this work indicates that HCC uptake consists of a highly parasite-specific part that feeds endocytosed material into an endosomal system containing more canonical elements, leading to the delivery of HCC to the food vacuole.

                Background It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiograms changes were suggestive of type A Wellens syndrome. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented electrocardiogram before he went for catheterization and based on the second electrocardiogram changes were suggestive of an ST-elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, critical occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery coronary artery with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit, the patient improved and was transferred to Low Care Unit. Conclusions The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute critical occlusion with collateral artery.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26950?af=R">Manipulation of the Myc Interactome to Enhance Nerve Regeneration in a Murine Model</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to explore manipulation of the Myc protein interactome, members of an oncogene group, in enhancing the intrinsic growth of injured peripheral adult postmitotic neurons and the nerves they supply. New approaches to enhance adult neuron growth properties are a key strategy in improving nerve regeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Expression and impact of Myc interactome members c-Myc, N-Myc, Mad1, and Max were evaluated within naive and “preconditioned” adult sensory neurons and Schwann cells (SCs), using siRNA and transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 or luciferase reporter in vitro. Morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological indices of nerve regeneration were analyzed in vivo.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>c-Myc, N-Myc, Max, and Mad were expressed in adult sensory neurons and in partnering SCs. In vitro knockdown (KD) of either Mad1 or Max, competitive inhibitors of Myc, unleashed heightened neurite outgrowth in both naive uninjured or preconditioned adult neurons. In contrast, KD or inhibition of both isoforms of Myc was required to suppress growth. In SCs, Mad1 KD not only enhanced migratory behavior but also conditioned increased outgrowth in separately cultured adult sensory neurons. In vivo, local Mad1 KD improved electrophysiological, behavioral, and structural indices of nerve regeneration out to 60 days of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Members of the Myc interactome, specifically Mad1, are novel targets for improving nerve regeneration. Unleashing of Myc growth signaling through Mad1 KD enhances the regrowth of both peripheral neurons and SCs to facilitate better regrowth of nerves. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Disentangling how cognitive functions emerge from the interplay of brain dynamics and network architecture is among the major challenges that neuroscientists face. Pharmacological and pathological perturbations of consciousness provide a lens to investigate these complex challenges. Here, we review how recent advances about consciousness and the brain’s functional organisation have been driven by a common denominator: decomposing brain function into fundamental constituents of time, space, and information. Whereas unconsciousness increases structure–function coupling across scales, psychedelics may decouple brain function from structure. Convergent effects also emerge: anaesthetics, psychedelics, and disorders of consciousness can exhibit similar reconfigurations of the brain’s unimodal–transmodal functional axis. Decomposition approaches reveal the potential to translate discoveries across species, with computational modelling providing a path towards mechanistic integration.

                Fan and Dal Monte et al. apply closed-loop microstimulations in prefrontal areas when monkeys interact with gaze. Stimulations of the orbitofrontal cortex enhance momentary spatial and temporal social attention, whereas stimulations of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex modulate inter-individual gaze dynamics. These regions causally control social attention, with potential for therapeutic brain interface.

                The adhesive interaction between endothelial cells (ECs) and the matrix generates restrictive endothelium but the mechanism remains unclear. Akhter et al. show that, in a kinase-independent manner, FAK suppression of the RhoA pathway safeguards tension transmission to the nucleus, limiting emerin-DNMT3a activities and enabling KLF2 transcription of the restricted ECs for vascular homeostasis.

They show that increased cell size increases epithelial compliance in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. They further uncover the importance of Ezrin and E-cadherin in offsetting actomyosin contractility in epithelial cells to regulate tissue fracture strength.

They also found that loss of the remote enhancer affects ipsilateral RGCs and their projections to the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93178">Bacterial vampirism mediated through taxis to serum</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovars, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Citrobacter koseri</i> are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94191">Visual working memories are abstractions of percepts</a></h4>

              
                During perception, decoding the orientation of gratings depends on complex interactions between the orientation of the grating, aperture edges, and topographic structure of the visual map. Here, we aimed to test how aperture biases described during perception affect working memory (WM) decoding. For memoranda, we used gratings multiplied by radial and angular modulators to generate orthogonal aperture biases for identical orientations. Therefore, if WM representations are simply maintained sensory representations, they would have similar aperture biases. If they are abstractions of sensory features, they would be unbiased and the modulator would have no effect on orientation decoding. Neural patterns of delay period activity while maintaining the orientation of gratings with one modulator (e.g. radial) were interchangeable with patterns while maintaining gratings with the other modulator (e.g. angular) in visual and parietal cortex, suggesting that WM representations are insensitive to aperture biases during perception. Then, we visualized memory abstractions of stimuli using models of visual field map properties. Regardless of aperture biases, WM representations of both modulated gratings were recoded into a single oriented line. These results provide strong evidence that visual WM representations are abstractions of percepts, immune to perceptual aperture biases, and compel revisions of WM theory.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96065">Neutralizing gut-derived lipopolysaccharide as a novel therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis</a></h4>

              
                Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> spp. Humans and some mammals can develop severe forms of leptospirosis accompanied by a dysregulated inflammatory response, which often results in death. The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a vital element in systemic health. However, the precise role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis is still unknown. Here, we aimed to explore the function and potential mechanisms of the gut microbiota in a hamster model of severe leptospirosis. Our study showed that leptospires were able to multiply in the intestine, cause pathological injury, and induce intestinal and systemic inflammatory responses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that <i>Leptospira</i> infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota of hamsters with an expansion of Proteobacteria. In addition, gut barrier permeability was increased after infection, as reflected by a decrease in the expression of tight junctions. Translocated Proteobacteria were found in the intestinal epithelium of moribund hamsters, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, with elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the serum. Moreover, gut microbiota depletion reduced the survival time, increased the leptospiral load, and promoted the expression of proinflammatory cytokines after <i>Leptospira</i> infection. Intriguingly, fecal filtration and serum from moribund hamsters both increased the transcription of <i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-10</i>, and <i>TLR4</i> in macrophages compared with those from uninfected hamsters. These stimulating activities were inhibited by LPS neutralization using polymyxin B. Based on our findings, we identified an LPS neutralization therapy that significantly improved the survival rates in severe leptospirosis when used in combination with antibiotic therapy or polyclonal antibody therapy. In conclusion, our study not only uncovers the role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis but also provides a therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89516">Genetically defined nucleus incertus neurons differ in connectivity and function</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus incertus (NI), a conserved hindbrain structure implicated in the stress response, arousal, and memory, is a major site for production of the neuropeptide relaxin-3. On the basis of <i>goosecoid homeobox 2</i> (<i>gsc2</i>) expression, we identified a neuronal cluster that lies adjacent to <i>relaxin 3a</i> (<i>rln3a</i>) neurons in the zebrafish analogue of the NI. To delineate the characteristics of the <i>gsc2</i> and <i>rln3a</i> NI neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted integration to drive gene expression specifically in each neuronal group, and found that they differ in their efferent and afferent connectivity, spontaneous activity, and functional properties. <i>gsc2</i> and <i>rln3a</i> NI neurons have widely divergent projection patterns and innervate distinct subregions of the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Whereas <i>gsc2</i> neurons are activated more robustly by electric shock, <i>rln3a</i> neurons exhibit spontaneous fluctuations in calcium signaling and regulate locomotor activity. Our findings define heterogeneous neurons in the NI and provide new tools to probe its diverse functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93087">Aberrant methylation and expression of TNXB promote chondrocyte apoptosis and extracullar matrix degradation in hemophilic arthropathy via AKT signaling</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent joint bleeding in hemophilia patients frequently causes hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Drastic degradation of cartilage is a major characteristic of HA, but its pathological mechanisms has not yet been clarified. In HA cartilages, we found server matrix degradation and increased expression of DNA methyltransferase proteins. We thus performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on human HA (N=5) and osteoarthritis (OA) (N=5) articular cartilages, and identified 1228 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the association between DMR genes (DMGs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. Among these DMGs, Tenascin XB (TNXB) expression was down-regulated in human and mouse HA cartilages. The loss of <i>Tnxb</i> in <i>F8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse cartilage provided a disease-promoting role in HA by augmenting cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss. <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown also promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT. Importantly, AKT agonist showed chondroprotective effects following <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown. Together, our findings indicate that exposure of cartilage to blood leads to alterations in DNA methylation, which is functionally related to ECM homeostasis, and further demonstrate a critical role of TNXB in HA cartilage degeneration by activating AKT signaling. These mechanistic insights allow development of potentially new strategies for HA cartilage protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91798">SMAD4 promotes somatic-germline contact during murine oocyte growth</a></h4>

              
                Development of the mammalian oocyte requires physical contact with the surrounding granulosa cells of the follicle, which provide it with essential nutrients and regulatory signals. This contact is achieved through specialized filopodia, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that extend from the granulosa cells to the oocyte surface. Transforming growth factor (TGFβ) family ligands produced by the oocyte increase the number of TZPs, but how they do so is unknown. Using an inducible Cre recombinase strategy together with expression of green fluorescent protein to verify Cre activity in individual cells, we examined the effect of depleting the canonical TGFβ mediator, SMAD4, in mouse granulosa cells. We observed a 20–50% decrease in the total number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted granulosa cell-oocyte complexes, and a 50% decrease in the number of newly generated TZPs when the granulosa cells were reaggregated with wild-type oocytes. Three-dimensional image analysis revealed that TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were longer than controls and more frequently oriented towards the oocyte. Strikingly, the transmembrane proteins, N-cadherin and Notch2, were reduced by 50% in SMAD4-depleted cells. SMAD4 may thus modulate a network of cell adhesion proteins that stabilize the attachment of TZPs to the oocyte, thereby amplifying signalling between the two cell types.

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons from the brain and spinal cord. The excessive neuroinflammation is thought to be a common determinant of ALS. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is pathologically upregulated after injury/diseases to negatively regulate a broad range of cytokines/chemokines that mediate inflammation; however, the role that SOCS3 plays in ALS pathogenesis has not been explored. Here, we found that SOCS3 protein levels were significantly increased in the brainstem of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-G93A ALS mice, which is negatively related to a progressive decline in motor function from the pre-symptomatic to the early symptomatic stage. Moreover, SOCS3 levels in both cervical and lumbar spinal cords of ALS mice were also significantly upregulated at the pre-symptomatic stage and became exacerbated at the early symptomatic stage. Concomitantly, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages were progressively increased and reactivated over time. In contrast, neurons were simultaneously lost in the brainstem and spinal cord examined over the course of disease progression. Collectively, SOCS3 was first found to be upregulated during ALS progression to directly relate to both increased astrogliosis and increased neuronal loss, indicating that SOCS3 could be explored to be as a potential therapeutic target of ALS.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to explore the impact of the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and physical states of sports students from Romania and also to compare the differences according to gender and the type of sport. Initially, in order to collect demographic data and health reports, a cross-sectional survey was developed to evaluate the emotional needs of sports students during the pandemic. After the second wave, the coping strategies used by the participants to fight negative emotions were assessed using the CERQ questionnaire. The results indicate that depression symptoms are the most reported psychological issues among the participants and that there are differences according to gender concerning the cognitive schemas they use in order to reduce the symptoms. Also, it was found that there are differences, corresponding to the type of sport, in choosing adaptive coping mechanisms. Ultimately, it was confirmed that higher levels of hopelessness among sports students are associated with increased vulnerability to substance use, with the correlation between those two indicators being strong. Delving deeper into this relationship can help identify critical points for intervention to prevent substance abuse. At the same time, the dichotomic analysis of the results found as moderators&amp;amp;mdash;the gender and the type of sport in decreasing the severity of depression could be an important aspect of the next counseling interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0285-23.2024?rss=1">Targeted Memory Reactivation during Nonrapid Eye Movement Sleep Enhances Neutral, But Not Negative, Components of Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotionally salient components of memory are preferentially remembered at the expense of accompanying neutral information. This emotional memory trade-off is enhanced over time, and possibly sleep, through a process of memory consolidation. Sleep is believed to benefit memory through a process of reactivation during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Here, targeted memory reactivation (TMR) was used to manipulate the reactivation of negative and neutral memories during NREM sleep. Thirty-one male and female participants encoded composite scenes containing either a negative or neutral object superimposed on an always neutral background. During NREM sleep, sounds associated with the scene object were replayed, and memory for object and background components was tested the following morning. We found that TMR during NREM sleep improved memory for neutral, but not negative scene objects. This effect was associated with sleep spindle activity, with a larger spindle response following TMR cues predicting TMR effectiveness for neutral items only. These findings therefore do not suggest a role of NREM memory reactivation in enhancing the emotional memory trade-off across a 12&nbsp;h period but do align with growing evidence of spindle-mediated memory reactivation in service of neutral declarative memory.</p>

                <p>The Enhanced-Deep-Super-Resolution (EDSR) model is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network suitable for improving image spatial resolution. It was previously trained with general-purpose pictures and then, in this work, tested on biomedical magnetic resonance (MR) images, comparing the network outcomes with traditional up-sampling techniques. We explored possible changes in the model response when different MR sequences were analyzed. T<SUB>1</SUB>w and T<SUB>2</SUB>w MR brain images of 70 human healthy subjects (F:M, 40:30) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) repository were down-sampled and then up-sampled using EDSR model and BiCubic (BC) interpolation. Several reference metrics were used to quantitatively assess the performance of up-sampling operations (RMSE, pSNR, SSIM, and HFEN). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconstructions were evaluated. Different brain tissues were analyzed individually. The EDSR model was superior to BC interpolation on the selected metrics, both for two- and three- dimensional reconstructions. The reference metrics showed higher quality of EDSR over BC reconstructions for all the analyzed images, with a significant difference of all the criteria in T<SUB>1</SUB>w images and of the perception-based SSIM and HFEN in T<SUB>2</SUB>w images. The analysis per tissue highlights differences in EDSR performance related to the gray-level values, showing a relative lack of outperformance in reconstructing hyperintense areas. The EDSR model, trained on general-purpose images, better reconstructs MR T<SUB>1</SUB>w and T<SUB>2</SUB>w images than BC, without any retraining or fine-tuning. These results highlight the excellent generalization ability of the network and lead to possible applications on other MR measurements.</p>

                Background A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods Seventeen girls’ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. Results Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. The levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmentally constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

                Background Co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an impact on high HBV replication and progression to liver cancer. These may lead to cross-resistance of drugs due to therapeutic pressure or liver toxicity. These require continuous monitoring of HBV variants for better diagnosis and treatment strategies. Methods Convenience sampling was used to collect fifty archival sera from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. The Sera were subjected to HBsAg screening using ELISA, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, phylogenetic and mutation analysis. A correlation test was performed to measure the association between polymerase and surface mutations. Results Of the 50 samples, 86% (N= 43/50) were HBsAg positive; 82% (N=41/50) PCR positive and 92% (N=38/41) sequenced. The HBV sequences showed similarity to genotype A (73% [N=19/26]) and (24% [N=7/26]) as genotypes B, C, D, E, F, and G. Prevalence of the mutations in the Surface region was (47% [N=18/38]); including diagnostic failure (K122R and T143S) and vaccines escape mutations (P127T, G145R, S207N, Y200T, E164D, Y206H and L209V). The mutations in the RT was at (36% [N=14/38]) with drug resistance mutations (DRM) at (50% [7/14]). Mutations showed resistance to lamivudine (LMV) at (35% [5/14]), telbivudine (LdT) at (29% [4/14]), (14% [2/14]) for entecavir (ETV) and (21% [3/14]) for adefovir (ADV). One sample had a combination of L180M, M204V, S202K, and M250I mutations. There was no statistical significance between S and RT mutations at P>0.005 and the statistical correlation between RT and SHB mutations was weak at 0.877. Conclusions Our findings highlight the prevalence of HBV genotype A in HIV-infected patients in South Africa. We provide evidence of mutations linked to immune evasion and drug resistance. Mutations have no statistical significance but can have clinical Implication on the diagnosis and treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals.

                Introduction The process of breast cancer treatment, especially radiation therapy, frequently alters patients’ lives significantly. It is essential to comprehend how radiation affects breast cancer survivors’ quality of life to improve their overall treatment and well-being. The quality of life among breast cancer patients treated at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital (AVBRH), affiliated with the University Of Datta Meghe Institute Of Higher Education and Research (DMIHER), Sawangi, following radiation therapy is examined in this study during the years 2023–2024. Methods This observational cross-sectional study will be conducted in the Department of Radiotherapy of AVBRH associated with DMIHER, the hospital is situated in the state of Maharashtra, in India, from 2023 to 2024. We will select Breast cancer patients registered in AVBRH at the Radiotherapy department from Jan 2023 to October 2023 and receive treatment in the form of radiotherapy; chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The study will be observational and cross-sectional. This research will take approximately six months. Questionnaires will be distributed on the spot to patients and phone interviews for distant patients will be conducted using an interview checklist. Discussion The study is expected to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge by delving into specific challenges and experiences of breast cancer survivors post-radiotherapy, particularly within the context of a rural healthcare setting. By concentrating on this group, the study will contribute to the body of existing knowledge by offering a deeper view of the variables influencing the quality of life in breast cancer survivors. The knowledge gathered from this research will be extremely helpful in understanding the complex effects of radiation therapy on the physical, psychological, and social aspects of survivors’ quality of life.

                <p>by Amber Marijn Brands, Sasha Devore, Orrin Devinsky, Werner Doyle, Adeen Flinker, Daniel Friedman, Patricia Dugan, Jonathan Winawer, Iris Isabelle Anna Groen</p>

Neural responses in visual cortex adapt to prolonged and repeated stimuli. While adaptation occurs across the visual cortex, it is unclear how adaptation patterns and computational mechanisms differ across the visual hierarchy. Here we characterize two signatures of short-term neural adaptation in time-varying intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data collected while participants viewed naturalistic image categories varying in duration and repetition interval. Ventral- and lateral-occipitotemporal cortex exhibit slower and prolonged adaptation to single stimuli and slower recovery from adaptation to repeated stimuli compared to V1-V3. For category-selective electrodes, recovery from adaptation is slower for preferred than non-preferred stimuli. To model neural adaptation we augment our delayed divisive normalization (DN) model by scaling the input strength as a function of stimulus category, enabling the model to accurately predict neural responses across multiple image categories. The model fits suggest that differences in adaptation patterns arise from slower normalization dynamics in higher visual areas interacting with differences in input strength resulting from category selectivity. Our results reveal systematic differences in temporal adaptation of neural population responses between lower and higher visual brain areas and show that a single computational model of history-dependent normalization dynamics, fit with area-specific parameters, accounts for these differences.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012071">The evolution of environmentally mediated social interactions and posthumous spite under isolation by distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles Mullon, Jorge Peña, Laurent Lehmann</p>

Many social interactions happen indirectly via modifications of the environment, e.g. through the secretion of functional compounds or the depletion of renewable resources. Here, we derive the selection gradient on a quantitative trait affecting dynamical environmental variables that feed back on reproduction and survival in a finite patch-structured population subject to isolation by distance. Our analysis shows that the selection gradient depends on how a focal individual influences the fitness of all future individuals in the population through modifications of the environmental variables they experience, weighted by the neutral relatedness between recipients and the focal. The evolutionarily relevant trait-driven environmental modifications are formalized as the extended phenotypic effects of an individual, quantifying how a trait change in an individual in the present affects the environmental variables in all patches at all future times. When the trait affects reproduction and survival through a payoff function, the selection gradient can be expressed in terms of extended phenotypic effects weighted by scaled relatedness. We show how to compute extended phenotypic effects, relatedness, and scaled relatedness using Fourier analysis, which allow us to investigate a broad class of environmentally mediated social interactions in a tractable way. We use our approach to study the evolution of a trait controlling the costly production of some lasting commons (e.g. a common-pool resource or a toxic compound) that can diffuse in space and persist in time. We show that indiscriminate posthumous spite readily evolves in this scenario. More generally, whether selection favours environmentally mediated altruism or spite is determined by the spatial correlation between an individual’s lineage and the commons originating from its patch. The sign of this correlation depends on interactions between dispersal patterns and the commons’ renewal dynamics. More broadly, we suggest that selection can favour a wide range of social behaviours when these have carry-over effects in space and time.

                <p>by Yahaya A Yabo, Dieter Henrik Heiland</p>

Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.

                <p>by Yatian Chen, Jiayue Gu, Biao Yang, Lili Yang, Jie Pang, Qinghua Luo, Yirong Li, Danyang Li, Zixin Deng, Changjiang Dong, Haohao Dong, Zhengyu Zhang</p>

The peptidoglycan (PG) layer is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall and serves as an important target for antibiotics in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The hydrolysis of septal PG (sPG) is a crucial step of bacterial cell division, facilitated by FtsEX through an amidase activation system. In this study, we present the cryo-EM structures of <i>Escherichia coli</i> FtsEX and FtsEX-EnvC in the ATP-bound state at resolutions of 3.05 Å and 3.11 Å, respectively. Our PG degradation assays in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> reveal that the ATP-bound conformation of FtsEX activates sPG hydrolysis of EnvC-AmiB, whereas EnvC-AmiB alone exhibits autoinhibition. Structural analyses indicate that ATP binding induces conformational changes in FtsEX-EnvC, leading to significant differences from the apo state. Furthermore, PG degradation assays of AmiB mutants confirm that the regulation of AmiB by FtsEX-EnvC is achieved through the interaction between EnvC-AmiB. These findings not only provide structural insight into the mechanism of sPG hydrolysis and bacterial cell division, but also have implications for the development of novel therapeutics targeting drug-resistant bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622">Negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arianna Zuanazzi, Pablo Ripollés, Wy Ming Lin, Laura Gwilliams, Jean-Rémi King, David Poeppel</p>

Combinatoric linguistic operations underpin human language processes, but how meaning is composed and refined in the mind of the reader is not well understood. We address this puzzle by exploiting the ubiquitous function of negation. We track the online effects of negation (“not”) and intensifiers (“really”) on the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., “good”) in parametrically designed behavioral and neurophysiological (MEG) experiments. The behavioral data show that participants first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Decoding analyses of neural activity further reveal significant above chance decoding accuracy for negated adjectives within 600 ms from adjective onset, suggesting that negation does not invert the representation of adjectives (i.e., “not bad” represented as “good”); furthermore, decoding accuracy for negated adjectives is found to be significantly lower than that for affirmative adjectives. Overall, these results suggest that negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives. This putative suppression mechanism of negation is supported by increased synchronization of beta-band neural activity in sensorimotor areas. The analysis of negation provides a steppingstone to understand how the human brain represents changes of meaning over time.

The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas12a has become a powerful genome-editing tool in biomedical research due to its ease of use and low off-targeting. However, the size of Cas12a severely limits clinical applications such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy. Here, we characterized a novel compact Cas12a ortholog, termed EbCas12a, from the metagenome-assembled genome of a currently unclassified <i>Erysipelotrichia</i>. It has the PAM sequence of 5′-TTTV-3′ (V = A, G, C) and the smallest size of approximately 3.47 kb among the Cas12a orthologs reported so far. In addition, enhanced EbCas12a (enEbCas12a) was also designed to have comparable editing efficiency with higher specificity to AsCas12a and LbCas12a in mammalian cells at multiple target sites. Based on the compact enEbCas12a, an all-in-one AAV delivery system with crRNA for Cas12a was developed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Overall, the novel smallest high-fidelity enEbCas12a, this first case of the all-in-one AAV delivery for Cas12a could greatly boost future gene therapy and scientific research.

                <p>by Marlen C. Rice, Andrew J. Janik, Nels C. Elde, James A. Gagnon, Keir M. Balla</p>

Zebrafish are popular research organisms selected for laboratory use due in part to widespread availability from the pet trade. Many contemporary colonies of laboratory zebrafish are maintained in aquaculture facilities that monitor and aim to curb infections that can negatively affect colony health and confound experiments. The impact of laboratory control on the microbial constituents associated with zebrafish in research environments compared to the pet trade are unclear. Diseases of unknown causes are common in both environments. We conducted a metatranscriptomic survey to broadly compare the zebrafish-associated microbes in pet trade and laboratory environments. We detected many microbes in animals from the pet trade that were not found in laboratory animals. Cohousing experiments revealed several transmissible microbes including a newly described non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus in the Birnaviridae family we name Rocky Mountain birnavirus (RMBV). Infections were detected in asymptomatic animals from the pet trade, but when transmitted to laboratory animals RMBV was associated with pronounced antiviral responses and hemorrhagic disease. These experiments highlight the pet trade as a distinct source of diverse microbes that associate with zebrafish and establish a paradigm for the discovery of newly described pathogenic viruses and other infectious microbes that can be developed for study in the laboratory.

                Background Copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) ion release, and surface topography change from the orthodontic wire are the initial processes of corrosion that may affect the mechanical properties of the archwire. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of CHX, NaF, and chitosan on the corrosion of CuNiTi wire nickel and copper ions released, surface roughness change, and archwire deflection. Methods Ninety samples of CuNiTi Tanzo™ archwires were divided into five groups according to their immersion solution: Artificial Saliva, CHX, NaF, CHX-NaF, and chitosan group. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (n=6) corresponding immersion time, i.e., two, four, and six weeks. The corrosion of the samples was analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and universal testing machine (UTM). Results The amount of nickel ion releases was increasing, but the copper ion releases were reduced by the time of observations. The highest nickel ion was released in the CHX-NaF group and the lowest in the chitosan group for six-week immersion. It also corresponded to the surface topography by SEM analysis which showed the most extended cracks and deep pits in the CHX-NaF group and a smoother surface in the chitosan group. Copper ion release showed the highest ion release in the NaF group and the lowest release in the chitosan group. The unloading force of CuNiTi archwire deflection remains the same at week two and week four for all mouthwashes. Conclusion The use of mouthwashes that contained CHX, NaF, and chitosan could further alter the passive layer and cause higher nickel and copper ion release and increased CuNiTi archwire surface structure porosity. But there is no distinction between mouthwashes to release the unloading force within two until four weeks.

                Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are well-recognised antidiabetic medications among clinicians due to its highly protective effects on cardiovascular and renal systems on diabetic patients. However, one of its uncommonly reported side effects is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) which is characterized by mild hyperglycemia, ketosis and acidosis. Chest pain as a clinical presentation of EuDKA has been rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of a 46-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia presented to the hospital with central chest pain that radiates to the back and is associated with mild shortness of breath and one bout of vomiting. She had been taking dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for four years. She was found to have a blood glucose level of 7 mmol\L, high anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonuria. Toxicology screening was unremarkable. She was diagnosed as a case of SGLT2-induced EuDKA and was treated with fluid, insulin and potassium chloride (KCL). Her hospital course went smoothly. Dapagloflzi was discontinued, and she was discharged home on oral metformin and subcutaneous insulin. This study highlights the rare occurance of chest pain as a presentation of EuDKA, an uncommon side effect of the widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. Chest pain in patients using SGLT2 Inhibitors should raise the clinician’s suspicion for possible EuDKA.

                Chronic respiratory diseases often necessitate lung transplantation due to irreversible damage. Organ engineering offers hope through stem cell-based organ generation. However, the crucial sterilization step in scaffold preparation poses challenges. This study conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the extracellular matrix (ECM) conditions of decellularised lungs subjected to different sterilisation processes. A search was performed for articles published in the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and SciELO databases according to the PRISMA guidelines. Overall, five articles that presented positive results regarding the effectiveness of the sterilisation process were selected, some of which identified functional damage in the ECM. Was possible concluded that regardless of the type of agent used, physical or chemical, all of them demonstrated that sterilisation somehow harms the ECM. An ideal protocol has not been found to be fully effective in the sterilisation of pulmonary scaffolds for use in tissue and/or organ engineering.

                Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Anopheles are the only vectors of human malaria. Anopheles gibbinsi has been linked to malaria transmission in Kenya, with recent collections in Zambia reporting the mosquito species exhibiting zoophilic and exophilic behavioral patterns with occasional contact with humans. Given the paucity of genetic data, and challenges to identification and molecular taxonomy of the mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles genus; we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of An. gibbinsi using a genome skimming approach. An Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform was used for sequencing, the length of the mitochondrial genome was 15401 bp, with 78.5% AT content comprised of 37 genes. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood using concatenation of the 13 protein coding genes demonstrated that An. marshallii was the closest relative based on existing sequence data. This study demonstrates that the skimming approach is an inexpensive and efficient approach for mosquito species identification and concurrent taxonomic rectification, which may be a useful alternative for generating reference sequence data for evolutionary studies among the Culicidae.

     alt="Thalamic activity-dependent specification of sensory input neurons in the developing chick entopallium"/>
<p>In the developing chick pallium, input neurons located in the entopallium (top, green region) are born from lateral and ventral pallial (LP and VP) precursors (bottom left, blue). LP- and VP-derived neurons then receive thalamic axons around E10 and are specified into input neurons by receiving neuronal activity from thalamic axon within the entopallium E11 onward (bottom right, green cells)

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During development, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors play important roles in neuronal differentiation; however, the underlying mechanisms in nonmammalian species remain largely unknown. We here investigated the mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of sensory input neurons in the chick entopallium, which receives its primary visual input via the tectofugal pathway from the nucleus rotundus. The results obtained revealed that input neurons in the entopallium expressed Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 5 (KCNH5/EAG2) mRNA from embryonic day (E) 11. On the other hand, the onset of protein expression was E20, which was 1 day before hatching. We confirm that entopallium input neurons in chicks were generated during early neurogenesis in the lateral and ventral ventricular zones. Notably, neurons derived from the lateral (LP) and ventral pallium (VP) exhibited a spatially distinct distribution along the rostro–caudal axis. We further demonstrated that the expression of EAG2 was directly regulated by input activity from thalamic axons. Collectively, the present results reveal that thalamic input activity is essential for specifying input neurons among LP- and VP-derived early-generated neurons in the developing chick entopallium.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Pioneering investigations in the mid-19th century revealed that the perception of tactile cues presented to the surface of the skin improves with training, which is referred to as tactile learning. Surprisingly, tactile learning also occurs for body parts and skin locations that are not physically involved in the training. For example, after training of a finger, tactile learning transfers to adjacent untrained fingers. This suggests that the transfer of tactile learning follows a somatotopic pattern and involves brain regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), in which the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations are represented close to each other. However, other results showed that transfer occurs between body parts that are not represented close to each other in S1—for example, between the hand and the foot. These and similar findings have led to the suggestion of additional cortical mechanisms to explain the transfer of tactile learning. Here, different mechanisms are reviewed, and the extent to which they can explain the transfer of tactile learning is discussed. What all of these mechanisms have in common is that they assume a representational or functional relationship between the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations. However, none of these mechanisms alone can explain the complex pattern of transfer results, and it is likely that different mechanisms interact to enable transfer, perhaps in concert with higher somatosensory and decision-making areas.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 6; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Background Surgical site infection (SSI), albeit infrequent, drastically impacts the quality of care. This article endeavors to investigate the predictive factors of SSIs following surgical interventions that involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within a single institution in a resource-limited setting. Methods Over seven years from June 2015 to June 2022, patients who underwent GI surgery and developed SSI were retrospectively matched with an unaffected case-control cohort of patients. Standardized techniques for wound culture, laboratory evaluation of bacterial isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were employed. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the predictive factors associated with 30-day postoperative SSI occurrence. Results A total of 525 patients who underwent GI surgical procedures were included, among whom, 86 (16.4%) developed SSI and the majority of SSIs were superficial (74.4%). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacterium (54.4%), and a high percentage of multidrug-resistant organisms were observed (63.8%). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, illiteracy (Odds ratio [OR]:40.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.54-170.26), smoking (OR: 21.15; 95% CI: 4.63-96.67), diabetes (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: 2.27-11.35), leukocytosis (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24-5.53), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.35-10.16), contaminated and dirty wounds (OR: 6.51; 95% CI:1.62-26.09), longer operation duration (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), emergency operations (OR: 12.58; 95% CI: 2.91-54.30), and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.28-7.10) were the independent risk factors for SSI (all p < 0.05). Conclusions This study highlights significant predictors of SSI, including illiteracy, smoking, diabetes, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, contaminated and dirty wounds, longer operative time, emergency operations, and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Identifying these risk factors can help surgeons adopt appropriate measures to reduce postoperative SSI and improve the quality of surgical care, especially in a resource-limited setting with no obvious and strict policy for reducing SSI.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The plains vizcacha, <i>Lagostomus maximus</i>, is a precocial hystricomorph rodent with a gyrencephalic brain. This work aimed to perform a time-lapse analysis of the embryonic brain cortical development in the plains vizcacha to establish a species-specific temporal window for corticogenesis and the gyrencephaly onset. Additionally, a comparative examination with evolutionarily related rodents was conducted. Embryos from 40 embryonic days (ED) until the end of pregnancy (∼$\sim $154 ED) were evaluated. The neuroanatomical examination determined transverse sulci at 80 ED and rostral lateral and caudal intraparietal sulci around 95 ED. Histological examination of corticogenesis showed emergence of the subplate at 43 ED and expansion of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and its division into inner and outer SVZs around 54 ED. The neocortical layers formation followed an inside-to-outside spatiotemporal gradient beginning with the emergence of layers VI and V at 68 ED and establishing the final six neocortical layers around 100 ED. A progressive increment of gyrencephalization index (GI) from 1.005 ± 0.003 around 70 ED, which reflects a smooth cortex, up to 1.07 ± 0.009 at the end of gestation, reflecting a gyrencephalic neuroanatomy, was determined. Contrarily, the minimum cortical thickness (MCT) progressively decreased from 61 ED up to the end of gestation. These results show that the decrease in the cortical thickness, which enables the onset of neocortical invaginations, occurs together with the expansion and subdivision of the SVZ. The temporal comparison of corticogenesis in plains vizcacha with that in relative species reflects a prenatal long process compared with other rodents that may give an evolutionary advantage to <i>L. maximus</i> as a precocial species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89353">H1 restricts euchromatin-associated methylation pathways from heterochromatic encroachment</a></h4>

              
                Silencing pathways prevent transposable element (TE) proliferation and help to maintain genome integrity through cell division. Silenced genomic regions can be classified as either euchromatic or heterochromatic, and are targeted by genetically separable epigenetic pathways. In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targets mostly euchromatic regions, while CMT DNA methyltransferases are mainly associated with heterochromatin. However, many epigenetic features - including DNA methylation patterning - are largely indistinguishable between these regions, so how the functional separation is maintained is unclear. The linker histone H1 is preferentially localized to heterochromatin and has been proposed to restrict RdDM from encroachment. To test this hypothesis, we followed RdDM genomic localization in an <i>h1</i> mutant by performing ChIP-seq on the largest subunit, NRPE1, of the central RdDM polymerase, Pol V. Loss of H1 resulted in NRPE1 enrichment predominantly in heterochromatic TEs. Increased NRPE1 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in <i>h1</i>, suggesting that H1 restricts NRPE1 occupancy by compacting chromatin. However, RdDM occupancy did not impact H1 localization, demonstrating that H1 hierarchically restricts RdDM positioning. H1 mutants experience major symmetric (CG and CHG) DNA methylation gains, and by generating an <i>h1/nrpe1</i> double mutant, we demonstrate these gains are largely independent of RdDM. However, loss of NRPE1 occupancy from a subset of euchromatic regions in <i>h1</i> corresponded to the loss of methylation in all sequence contexts, while at ectopically bound heterochromatic loci, NRPE1 deposition correlated with increased methylation specifically in the CHH context. Additionally, we found that H1 similarly restricts the occupancy of the methylation reader, SUVH1, and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3. Together, the results support a model whereby H1 helps maintain the exclusivity of heterochromatin by preventing encroachment from other competing pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91533">Theoretical principles explain the structure of the insect head direction circuit</a></h4>

              
                To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91711">The larva and adult of Helicoverpa armigera use differential gustatory receptors to sense sucrose</a></h4>

              
                Almost all herbivorous insects feed on plants and use sucrose as a feeding stimulant, but the molecular basis of their sucrose reception remains unclear. <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. In this study, we determined that the sucrose sensory neurons located in the contact chemosensilla on larval maxillary galea were 100–1000 times more sensitive to sucrose than those on adult antennae, tarsi, and proboscis. Using the <i>Xenopus</i> expression system, we discovered that Gr10 highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while Gr6 highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas9, we revealed that Gr10 was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while Gr6 was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt toward the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90316">Proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of the TRMT1 tRNA modification enzyme by SARS-CoV-2 main protease</a></h4>

              
                Nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81875">Fetal growth delay caused by loss of non-canonical imprinting is resolved late in pregnancy and culminates in offspring overgrowth</a></h4>

              
                Germline epigenetic programming, including genomic imprinting, substantially influences offspring development. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to growth and developmental changes in mouse offspring. In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the PRC2 protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially developmentally delayed, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial growth delay in mid-gestation embryos. This initial developmental delay was resolved as offspring underwent accelerated fetal development and growth in late gestation resulting in offspring that were similar stage and weight to controls at birth. The accelerated development and growth in offspring from <i>Eed</i>-null oocytes was associated with remodelling of the placenta, which involved an increase in fetal and maternal tissue size, conspicuous expansion of the glycogen-enriched cell population, and delayed parturition. Despite placental remodelling and accelerated offspring fetal growth and development, placental efficiency, and fetal blood glucose levels were low, and the fetal blood metabolome was unchanged. Moreover, while expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene and amino acid transporter <i>Slc38a4</i> was increased, fetal blood levels of individual amino acids were similar to controls, indicating that placental amino acid transport was not enhanced. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation and DNA methylation changes in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Together, while deletion of <i>Eed</i> in growing oocytes resulted in fetal growth and developmental delay and placental hyperplasia, our data indicate a remarkable capacity for offspring fetal growth to be normalised despite inefficient placental function and the loss of H3K27me3-dependent genomic imprinting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94315">Neurexins control the strength and precise timing of glycinergic inhibition in the auditory brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Neurexins play diverse functions as presynaptic organizers in various glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. However, it remains unknown whether and how neurexins are involved in shaping functional properties of the glycinergic synapses, which mediate prominent inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord. To address these issues, we examined the role of neurexins in a model glycinergic synapse between the principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the principal neuron in the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem. Combining RNAscope with stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in the MNTB of neurexin1/2/3 conditional triple knockout mice, we showed that MNTB neurons highly express all isoforms of neurexins although their expression levels vary remarkably. Selective ablation of all neurexins in MNTB neurons not only reduced the amplitude but also altered the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission at LSO neurons. The synaptic dysfunctions primarily resulted from an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of release and a loosened coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles. Together, our current findings demonstrate that neurexins are essential in controlling the strength and temporal precision of the glycinergic synapse, which therefore corroborates the role of neurexins as key presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses.

	<p>Researchers have long recognized that friends tend to exhibit behaviors that are more similar to each other than to those of non-friends. In recent years, the concept of neural similarity or neural synchrony among friends has garnered significant attention. This body of research bifurcates into two primary areas of focus: the specificity of neural similarity among friends (vs. non-friends) and the situational factors that influence neural synchrony among friends. This review synthesizes the complex findings to date, highlighting consistencies and identifying gaps in the current understanding. It aims to provide a coherent overview of the nuanced interplay between social relationships and neural processes, offering valuable insights for future investigations in this field.</p>

	<p>Disease prediction is greatly challenged by the scarcity of datasets and privacy concerns associated with real medical data. An approach that stands out to circumvent this hurdle is the use of synthetic data generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs can increase data volume while generating synthetic datasets that have no direct link to personal information. This study pioneers the use of GANs to create synthetic datasets and datasets augmented using traditional augmentation techniques for our binary classification task. The primary aim of this research was to evaluate the performance of our novel Conditional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (C-DCNN) model in classifying brain tumors by leveraging these augmented and synthetic datasets. We utilized advanced GAN models, including Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), to produce synthetic data that retained essential characteristics of the original datasets while ensuring privacy protection. Our C-DCNN model was trained on both augmented and synthetic datasets, and its performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3. The evaluation metrics demonstrated that our C-DCNN model achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 99% on both synthetic and augmented images, outperforming the comparative models. The findings of this study highlight the potential of using GAN-generated synthetic data in enhancing the training of machine learning models for medical image classification, particularly in scenarios with limited data available. This approach not only improves model accuracy but also addresses privacy concerns, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical applications in disease prediction and diagnosis.</p>

	<p>In non-clinical populations, facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) may vary in their contribution to face identity perception. Changes to whole faces are easier to detect than changes to individual features, and eye changes are typically easier to detect than mouth changes, which in turn are easier to detect than nose changes. However, how this differs for people with face recognition difficulties (developmental prosopagnosia; DP) and for individuals with superior face recognition abilities (super-recognisers; SR) is not clear; although findings from previous studies have suggested differences, the nature of this difference is not understood. The aim of this study was to examine whether differences in the ability to detect feature changes in DPs and SRs were (a) quantitative, meaning that the pattern across feature changes remained the same but there was an overall upwards or downwards shift in performance, or (b) qualitative, meaning that the pattern across feature changes was different. Using a change detection task in which individual face features (eyes, nose, mouth) changed between sequentially presented faces, we found that while prosopagnosics showed a quantitative difference in performance with a downwards shift across all conditions, super-recognisers only showed qualitative differences: they were better able to detect when the face was the same and were marginally (but not non-significantly) worse at detecting when the eyes changed. Further, the only condition which distinguished between the three groups was the ability to identify when the same face was presented, with SRs being better than controls, and controls being better than DPs. Our findings suggest that, in feature-matching tasks, differences for DPs are due to them being overall worse at the task, while SRs use a qualitatively different strategy.</p>

	<p>Research supports the efficacy of therapeutic hypnosis for reducing acute and chronic pain. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. This paper provides a review of the evidence regarding the role that electroencephalogram-assessed bandwidth power has in identifying who might benefit the most from hypnotic analgesia and how these effects occur. Findings are discussed in terms of the slow wave hypothesis, which posits that brain activity in slower bandwidths (e.g., theta and alpha) can facilitate hypnosis responsivity. Although the extant research is limited by small sample sizes, the findings from this research are generally consistent with the slow wave hypothesis. More research, including and especially studies with larger sample sizes, is needed to confirm these preliminary positive findings.</p>

	<p>Developmental changes in functional neural networks are sensitive to environmental influences. This EEG study investigated how infant brain responses relate to the social context that their families live in. Event-related potentials of 255 healthy, awake infants between six and fourteen months were measured during a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Infants were presented with 200 standard tones and 48 randomly distributed deviants. All infants are part of a longitudinal study focusing on families with socioeconomic and/or cultural challenges (Bremen Initiative to Foster Early Childhood Development; BRISE; Germany). As part of their familial socioeconomic status (SES), parental level of education and infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s migration background were assessed with questionnaires. For 30.6% of the infants both parents had a low level of education (&amp;amp;le;10 years of schooling) and for 43.1% of the infants at least one parent was born abroad. The N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex is associated with unintentional directing of attention to deviant stimuli and was analysed in frontocentral brain regions. Age was utilised as a control variable. Our results show that tone deviations in infants trigger an immature N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex. Contrary to studies with older children or adults, the N2 amplitude was more positive for deviants than for standards. This may be related to an immature superposition of the N2 with the P3a. For infants whose parents had no high-school degree and were born abroad, this tendency was increased, indicating that facing multiple challenges as a young family impacts on the infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s early neural development. As such, attending to unexpected stimulus changes may be important for early learning processes. Variations of the infant N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex may, thus, relate to early changes in attentional capacity and learning experiences due to familial challenges. This points towards the importance of early prevention programs.</p>

	<p>Mood disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) are of immense medical and social concern. Although significant progress on neuronal involvement in mood and reward circuitries has been achieved, it is only relatively recently that the role of glia in these disorders has attracted attention. Detailed understanding of the glial functions in these devastating diseases could offer novel interventions. Here, following a brief review of circuitries involved in mood regulation and reward perception, the specific contributions of neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota to these diseases are highlighted. In this context, the role of specific glial cells (e.g., microglia, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and synantocytes) on phenotypic manifestation of mood disorders or SUD are emphasized. In addition, use of this knowledge in the potential development of novel therapeutics is touched upon.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in treating sleep disorders in PD. It included 24 patients with PD who had sleep disorders. Group allocations (active or sham with a ratio of 2:1) were placed in serially numbered closed envelopes. Each patient was evaluated with the following: MDS-UPDRS, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and polysomnography (PSG) before and 10 days after the treatment sessions. Each session consisted of 10 trains, 20 Hz, 10 sec for each, over the parietal cortex (bilaterally). Scores of UPDRS, BDI, and PDSS improved significantly in the active group but not in the sham group. The PSG data showed that sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latencies (min), REM duration, and time spent awake (both as %TST) were improved after rTMS in the active group compared with the sham group. The number of awakenings, the wake-after-sleep onset index, the arousal index, and periodic leg movements (PLMs) were all significantly reduced in the active group but not in the sham group. Ten sessions of 20 Hz rTMS over parietal cortexes improved sleep quality and PLMs in patients with PD. The improvement in PSG and PDSS were correlated with improvements in UPDRS and BDI scores.</p>

	<p>To date, most studies examined the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) on neuromuscular control following exercise solely on measuring proprioception, no study explores changes in the brain and muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI following exercise on knee neuromuscular control capacity, and physiological and perceptual responses. In a crossover control design, fifteen participants performed an exhaustion exercise. Subsequently, they underwent a 10 min recovery intervention, either in the form of passively seated rest (CON) or CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C. The knee proprioception, oxygenated cerebral hemoglobin concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;[HbO]), and muscle activation during the proprioception test, physiological and perceptual responses were measured. CWI did not have a significant effect on proprioception at the post-intervention but attenuated the reductions in &amp;amp;Delta;[HbO] in the primary sensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The root mean square of vastus medialis was higher in the CWI compared to the CON. CWI effectively reduced core temperature and mean skin temperature and improved the rating of perceived exertion and thermal sensation. These results indicated that 10 min of CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C post-exercise had no negative effect on the neuromuscular control of the knee joint but could improve subjective perception and decrease body temperature.</p>

                <p>The ability to remember changes in the surroundings is fundamental for daily life. It has been proposed that novel events producing dopamine release in the hippocampal CA1 region could modulate spatial memory formation. However, the role of hippocampal dopamine increase on weak or strong spatial memories remains unclear. We show that male mice exploring two objects located in a familiar environment for 5&nbsp;min created a short-term memory (weak) that cannot be retrieved 1&nbsp;d later, whereas 10&nbsp;min exploration created a long-term memory (strong) that can be retrieved 1&nbsp;d later. Remarkably, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the encoding of weak object location memories (OLMs) allowed their retrieval 1&nbsp;d later but dopamine elevation during the encoding of strong OLMs promoted the preference for a familiar object location over a novel object location after 24&nbsp;h. Moreover, dopamine uncaging after the encoding of OLMs did not have effect on weak memories whereas on strong memories diminished the exploration of the novel object location. Additionally, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the retrieval of OLMs did not allow the recovery of weak memories and did not affect the retrieval of strong memory traces. Finally, dopamine elevation increased hippocampal theta oscillations, indicating that dopamine promotes the recurrent activation of specific groups of neurons. Our experiments demonstrate that hippocampal dopaminergic modulation during the encoding of OLMs depends on memory strength indicating that hyperdopaminergic levels that enhance weak experiences could compromise the normal storage of strong memories.</p>

                <p>This study compared the impact of spectral and temporal degradation on vocoded speech recognition between early-blind and sighted subjects. The participants included 25 early-blind subjects (30.32 &plusmn; 4.88&nbsp;years; male:female, 14:11) and 25 age- and sex-matched sighted subjects. Tests included monosyllable recognition in noise at various signal-to-noise ratios (&ndash;18 to &ndash;4&nbsp;dB), matrix sentence-in-noise recognition, and vocoded speech recognition with different numbers of channels (4, 8, 16, and 32) and temporal envelope cutoff frequencies (50 vs 500&nbsp;Hz). Cortical-evoked potentials (N2 and P3b) were measured in response to spectrally and temporally degraded stimuli. The early-blind subjects displayed superior monosyllable and sentence recognition than sighted subjects (all <I>p</I> &lt; 0.01). In the vocoded speech recognition test, a three-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (two groups <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> four channels <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> two cutoff frequencies) revealed significant main effects of group, channel, and cutoff frequency (all <I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). Early-blind subjects showed increased sensitivity to spectral degradation for speech recognition, evident in the significant interaction between group and channel (<I>p</I> = 0.007). N2 responses in early-blind subjects exhibited shorter latency and greater amplitude in the 8-channel (<I>p</I> = 0.022 and 0.034, respectively) and shorter latency in the 16-channel (<I>p</I> = 0.049) compared with sighted subjects. In conclusion, early-blind subjects demonstrated speech recognition advantages over sighted subjects, even in the presence of spectral and temporal degradation. Spectral degradation had a greater impact on speech recognition in early-blind subjects, while the effect of temporal degradation was similar in both groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0538-23.2024?rss=1">Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons Have Specific Characteristics during the Perinatal Period</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain represent the main source of cholinergic innervation of large parts of the neocortex and are involved in adults in the modulation of attention, memory, and arousal. During the first postnatal days, they play a crucial role in the development of cortical neurons and cortical cytoarchitecture. However, their characteristics, during this period have not been studied. To understand how they can fulfill this role, we investigated the morphological and electrophysiological maturation of cholinergic neurons of the substantia innominata&ndash;nucleus basalis of Meynert (SI/NBM) complex in the perinatal period in mice. We show that cholinergic neurons, whether or not they express gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a cotransmitter, are already functional at Embryonic Day 18. Until the end of the first postnatal week, they constitute a single population of neurons with a well developed dendritic tree, a spontaneous activity including bursting periods, and a short-latency response to depolarizations (early-firing). They are excited by both their GABAergic and glutamatergic afferents. During the second postnatal week, a second, less excitable, neuronal population emerges, with a longer delay response to depolarizations (late-firing), together with the hyperpolarizing action of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated currents. This classification into early-firing (40%) and late-firing (60%) neurons is again independent of the coexpression of GABAergic markers. These results strongly suggest that during the first postnatal week, the specific properties of developing SI/NBM cholinergic neurons allow them to spontaneously release acetylcholine (ACh), or ACh and GABA, into the developing cortex.</p>

                <p>A dynamic environment, such as the one we inhabit, requires organisms to continuously update their knowledge of the setting. While the prefrontal cortex is recognized for its pivotal role in regulating such adaptive behavior, the specific contribution of each prefrontal area remains elusive. In the current work, we investigated the direct involvement of two major prefrontal subregions, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, A32D + A32V) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, VO + LO), in updating pavlovian stimulus&ndash;outcome (S&ndash;O) associations following contingency degradation in male rats. Specifically, animals had to learn that a particular cue, previously fully predicting the delivery of a specific reward, was no longer a reliable predictor. First, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC, but not of OFC, neurons altered the rats&rsquo; ability to adaptively respond to degraded and non-degraded cues. Next, given the growing evidence pointing at noradrenaline (NA) as a main neuromodulator of adaptive behavior, we decided to investigate the possible involvement of NA projections to the two subregions in this higher-order cognitive process. Employing a pair of novel retrograde vectors, we traced NA projections from the locus ceruleus (LC) to both structures and observed an equivalent yet relatively segregated amount of inputs. Then, we showed that chemogenetic inhibition of NA projections to the mPFC, but not to the OFC, also impaired the rats&rsquo; ability to adaptively respond to the degradation procedure. Altogether, our findings provide important evidence of functional parcellation within the prefrontal cortex and point at mPFC NA as key for updating pavlovian S&ndash;O associations.</p>

                <p>The neurovascular unit (NVU) includes multiple different cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and pericytes, which respond to insults on very different time or dose scales. We defined differential vulnerability among these cell types, using response to two different insults: oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) and thrombin-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that neurons are most vulnerable, followed by endothelial cells and astrocytes. After temporary focal cerebral ischemia in male rats, we found significantly more injured neurons, compared with astrocytes in the ischemic area, consistent with differential vulnerability in vivo. We sought to illustrate different and shared mechanisms across all cell types during response to insult. We found that gene expression profiles in response to OGD differed among the cell types, with a paucity of gene responses shared by all types. All cell types activated genes relating to autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but the specific genes differed. Astrocytes and endothelial cells also activated pathways connected to DNA repair and antiapoptosis. Taken together, the data support the concept of differential vulnerability in the NVU and suggest that different elements of the unit will evolve from salvageable to irretrievable on different time scales while residing in the same brain region and receiving the same (ischemic) blood flow. Future work will focus on the mechanisms of these differences. These data suggest future stroke therapy development should target different elements of the NVU differently.</p>

                <p>Creating and evaluating predictions are considered important features in sensory perception. Little is known about processing differences between the senses and their cortical substrates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that olfaction, the sense of smell, would be highly dependent on (nonolfactory) object-predictive cues and involve distinct cortical processing features. We developed a novel paradigm to compare prediction error processing across senses. Participants listened to spoken word cues (e.g., "lilac") and determined whether target stimuli (odors or pictures) matched the word cue or not. In two behavioral experiments (total <I>n</I> = 113; 72 female), the disparity between congruent and incongruent response times was exaggerated for olfactory relative to visual targets, indicating a greater dependency on predictive verbal cues to process olfactory targets. A preregistered fMRI study (<I>n</I> = 30; 19 female) revealed the anterior cingulate cortex (a region central for error detection) being more activated by incongruent olfactory targets, indicating a role for olfactory predictive error processing. Additionally, both the primary olfactory and visual cortices were significantly activated for incongruent olfactory targets, suggesting olfactory prediction errors are dependent on cross-sensory processing resources, whereas visual prediction errors are not. We propose that olfaction is characterized by a strong dependency on predictive (nonolfactory) cues and that odors are evaluated in the context of such predictions by a designated transmodal cortical network. Our results indicate differences in how predictive cues are used by different senses in rapid decision-making.</p>
