              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18945">Solving Inverse Problem for Multi-armed Bandits via Convex Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.18945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03239">PAIR: A Novel Large Language Model-Guided Selection Strategy for Evolutionary Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) employ random or simplistic selection methods, limiting their exploration of solution spaces and convergence to optimal solutions. The randomness in performing crossover or mutations may limit the model's ability to evolve efficiently. This paper introduces Preference-Aligned Individual Reciprocity (PAIR), a novel selection approach leveraging Large Language Models to emulate human-like mate selection, thereby introducing intelligence to the pairing process in EAs. PAIR prompts an LLM to evaluate individuals within a population based on genetic diversity, fitness level, and crossover compatibility, guiding more informed pairing decisions. We evaluated PAIR against a baseline method called LLM-driven EA (LMEA), published recently. Results indicate that PAIR significantly outperforms LMEA across various TSP instances, achieving lower optimality gaps and improved convergence. This performance is especially noticeable when combined with the flash thinking model, demonstrating increased population diversity to escape local optima. In general, PAIR provides a new strategy in the area of in-context learning for LLM-driven selection in EAs via sophisticated preference modelling, paving the way for improved solutions and further studies into LLM-guided optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03018">Classifying States of the Hopfield Network with Improved Accuracy, Generalization, and Interpretability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the existing work on Hopfield network state classification, employing more complex models that remain interpretable, such as densely-connected feed-forward deep neural networks and support vector machines. The states of the Hopfield network can be grouped into several classes, including learned (those presented during training), spurious (stable states that were not learned), and prototype (stable states that were not learned but are representative for a subset of learned states). It is often useful to determine to what class a given state belongs to; for example to ignore spurious states when retrieving from the network. Previous research has approached the state classification task with simple linear methods, most notably the stability ratio. We deepen the research on classifying states from prototype-regime Hopfield networks, investigating how varying the factors strengthening prototypes influences the state classification task. We study the generalizability of different classification models when trained on states derived from different prototype tasks -- for example, can a network trained on a Hopfield network with 10 prototypes classify states from a network with 20 prototypes? We find that simple models often outperform the stability ratio while remaining interpretable. These models require surprisingly little training data and generalize exceptionally well to states generated by a range of Hopfield networks, even those that were trained on exceedingly different datasets.

                arXiv:2503.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential rise in data generation has led to vast, heterogeneous datasets crucial for predictive analytics and decision-making. Ensuring data quality and semantic integrity remains a challenge. This paper presents a brain-inspired distributed cognitive framework that integrates deep learning with Hopfield networks to identify and link semantically related attributes across datasets. Modeled on the dual-hemisphere functionality of the human brain, the right hemisphere assimilates new information while the left retrieves learned representations for association. Our architecture, implemented on MapReduce with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), leverages deep Hopfield networks as an associative memory mechanism to enhance recall of frequently co-occurring attributes and dynamically adjust relationships based on evolving data patterns. Experiments show that associative imprints in Hopfield memory are reinforced over time, ensuring linked datasets remain contextually meaningful and improving data disambiguation and integration accuracy. Our results indicate that combining deep Hopfield networks with distributed cognitive processing offers a scalable, biologically inspired approach to managing complex data relationships in large-scale environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03112">A Multimodal Framework for Topic Propagation Classification in Social Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of the Internet and the widespread adoption of social networks have significantly accelerated information dissemination. However, this transformation has introduced complexities in information capture and processing, posing substantial challenges for researchers and practitioners. Predicting the dissemination of topic-related information within social networks has thus become a critical research focus. This paper proposes a predictive model for topic dissemination in social networks by integrating multidimensional features derived from key dissemination characteristics. Specifically, we introduce two novel indicators, user relationship breadth and user authority, into the PageRank algorithm to quantify user influence more effectively. Additionally, we employ a Text-CNN model for sentiment classification, extracting sentiment features from textual content. Temporal embeddings of nodes are encoded using a Bi-LSTM model to capture temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we refine the measurement of user interaction traces with topics, replacing traditional topic view metrics with a more precise communication characteristics measure. Finally, we integrate the extracted multidimensional features using a Transformer model, significantly enhancing predictive performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms traditional machine learning and unimodal deep learning models in terms of FI-Score, AUC, and Recall, validating its effectiveness in predicting topic propagation within social networks.

                arXiv:2503.03263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing volume of data has necessitated a new computing paradigm, embodied through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Digital electronic AI computing systems, however, are gradually reaching their physical plateaus, stimulating extensive research towards next-generation AI accelerators. Photonic Neural Networks (PNNs), with their unique ability to capitalize on the interplay of multiple physical dimensions including time, wavelength, and space, have been brought forward with a credible promise for boosting computational power and energy efficiency in AI processors. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a novel multidimensional arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR)-based photonic AI accelerator that can execute tensor multiplications at a record-high total computational power of 262 TOPS, offering a ~24x improvement over the existing waveguide-based optical accelerators. It consists of a 16x16 AWGR that exploits the time-, wavelength- and space- division multiplexing (T-WSDM) for weight and input encoding together with an integrated Si3N4-based frequency comb for multi-wavelength generation. The photonic AI accelerator has been experimentally validated in both Fully-Connected (FC) and Convolutional NN (NNs) models, with the FC and CNN being trained for DDoS attack identification and MNIST classification, respectively. The experimental inference at 32 Gbaud achieved a Cohen's kappa score of 0.867 for DDoS detection and an accuracy of 92.14% for MNIST classification, respectively, closely matching the software performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03361">From Infants to AI: Incorporating Infant-like Learning in Models Boosts Efficiency and Generalization in Learning Social Prediction Tasks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early in development, infants learn a range of useful concepts, which can be challenging from a computational standpoint. This early learning comes together with an initial understanding of aspects of the meaning of concepts, e.g., their implications, causality, and using them to predict likely future events. All this is accomplished in many cases with little or no supervision, and from relatively few examples, compared with current network models. In learning about objects and human-object interactions, early acquired and possibly innate concepts are often used in the process of learning additional, more complex concepts. In the current work, we model how early-acquired concepts are used in the learning of subsequent concepts, and compare the results with standard deep network modeling. We focused in particular on the use of the concepts of animacy and goal attribution in learning to predict future events. We show that the use of early concepts in the learning of new concepts leads to better learning (higher accuracy) and more efficient learning (requiring less data). We further show that this integration of early and new concepts shapes the representation of the concepts acquired by the model. The results show that when the concepts were learned in a human-like manner, the emerging representation was more useful, as measured in terms of generalization to novel data and tasks. On a more general level, the results suggest that there are likely to be basic differences in the conceptual structures acquired by current network models compared to human learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03368">Inference-Scale Complexity in ANN-SNN Conversion for High-Performance and Low-Power Applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.03368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising substitute for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their advantages of fast inference and low power consumption. However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also introduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of the spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework in typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction. Code is available at https://github.com/putshua/Inference-scale-ANN-SNN.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15729">Sequential Learning in the Dense Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential learning involves learning tasks in a sequence, and proves challenging for most neural networks. Biological neural networks regularly conquer the sequential learning challenge and are even capable of transferring knowledge both forward and backwards between tasks. Artificial neural networks often totally fail to transfer performance between tasks, and regularly suffer from degraded performance or catastrophic forgetting on previous tasks. Models of associative memory have been used to investigate the discrepancy between biological and artificial neural networks due to their biological ties and inspirations, of which the Hopfield network is the most studied model. The Dense Associative Memory (DAM), or modern Hopfield network, generalizes the Hopfield network, allowing for greater capacities and prototype learning behaviors, while still retaining the associative memory structure. We give a substantial review of the sequential learning space with particular respect to the Hopfield network and associative memories. We perform foundational benchmarks of sequential learning in the DAM using various sequential learning techniques, and analyze the results of the sequential learning to demonstrate previously unseen transitions in the behavior of the DAM. This paper also discusses the departure from biological plausibility that may affect the utility of the DAM as a tool for studying biological neural networks. We present our findings, including the effectiveness of a range of state-of-the-art sequential learning methods when applied to the DAM, and use these methods to further the understanding of DAM properties and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09838">Mitigating the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Adaptive Train Scheduling with Curriculum-Driven Continual DQN Expansion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.09838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continual learning agent builds on previous experiences to develop increasingly complex behaviors by adapting to non-stationary and dynamic environments while preserving previously acquired knowledge. However, scaling these systems presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing the preservation of previous policies with the adaptation of new ones to current environments. This balance, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma, is especially pronounced in complex multi-agent domains such as the train scheduling problem, where environmental and agent behaviors are constantly changing, and the search space is vast. In this work, we propose addressing these challenges in the train scheduling problem using curriculum learning. We design a curriculum with adjacent skills that build on each other to improve generalization performance. Introducing a curriculum with distinct tasks introduces non-stationarity, which we address by proposing a new algorithm: Continual Deep Q-Network (DQN) Expansion (CDE). Our approach dynamically generates and adjusts Q-function subspaces to handle environmental changes and task requirements. CDE mitigates catastrophic forgetting through EWC while ensuring high plasticity using adaptive rational activation functions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency and adaptability compared to RL baselines and other adapted methods for continual learning, highlighting the potential of our method in managing the stability-plasticity dilemma in the adaptive train scheduling setting.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01676">Perceptual Motor Learning with Active Inference Framework for Robust Lateral Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.01676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Perceptual Motor Learning (PML) framework integrated with Active Inference (AIF) to enhance lateral control in Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs). PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error ("surprise") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings highlight the potential of PML-driven active inference as a robust alternative for real-world autonomous driving applications.

	<p>The blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) comprises distinct cell types, including endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, and is essential for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by selectively regulating molecular transport and maintaining integrity. In particular, astrocytes are essential for BBB function, as they maintain BBB integrity through their end-feet, which form a physical and biochemical interface that enhances endothelial cell function and barrier selectivity. Moreover, they secrete growth factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&amp;amp;beta;), which regulate tight junction (TJ) proteins (e.g., claudins and occludins) crucial for limiting paracellular permeability. Molecular motors like kinesins, dynein, and myosins are essential for these astrocyte functions. By facilitating vesicular trafficking and protein transport, they are essential for various functions, including trafficking of junctional proteins to support BBB integrity, the proper mitochondria localization within astrocyte processes for efficient energy supply, the polarized distribution of aquaporin (AQP)-4 at astrocyte end-feet for regulating water homeostasis across the BBB, and the modulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, myosin motors modulate actomyosin dynamics to regulate astrocyte process outgrowth, adhesion, migration, and morphology, facilitating their functional roles. Thus, motor protein dysregulation in astrocytes can compromise BBB function and integrity, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. This review explores the complex interplay between astrocytes and molecular motors in regulating BBB homeostasis, which represents an attractive but poorly explored area of research.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Pediatric migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder that significantly impacts children&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, academic performance, and social interactions. Unlike migraines in adults, pediatric migraines often present differently and involve unique underlying mechanisms, making diagnosis and treatment more complex. Methods: This review discusses the clinical phases of pediatric migraine, key trigger factors, sex- and age-related differences, and the role of childhood maltreatment in migraine development. We also discuss episodic syndromes such as cyclic vomiting syndrome, abdominal migraine, benign paroxysmal vertigo, and benign paroxysmal torticollis, along with comorbidities such as psychiatric disorders, sleep disturbances, and epilepsy. Results: The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for pediatric migraines, including genetic predispositions, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, are summarized. Current therapeutic strategies, including conventional and emerging pharmacological treatments, nutraceuticals, and non-pharmacological approaches, are evaluated. Non-pharmacological strategies, particularly evidence-based lifestyle interventions such as stress management, diet, hydration, sleep, exercise, screen time moderation, and cognitive behavioral therapy, are highlighted as key components of migraine prevention and management. The long-term prognosis and follow-up of pediatric migraine patients are reviewed, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, and tailored multidisciplinary care to prevent chronic progression. Conclusions: Future research should focus on novel therapeutic targets and integrating gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis modulation, with a need for longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term course of pediatric migraine.</p>

	<p>Background: The Delis&amp;amp;ndash;Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Tower Test (TT) is a widely used neuropsychological tool that assesses complex executive functions, including planning, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, switching, and impulsivity&amp;amp;mdash;key abilities often impaired in individuals with frontal dysfunction. Aims: There is currently no normative data for the D-KEFS TT in the Greek population. Consequently, it cannot be effectively used to detect executive dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric populations or for research purposes. Methods: The study sample included 249 healthy adults (28.9% male, 71.1% female) aged 20 to 85 years (M = 46.53, SD = 17.41), with educational levels ranging from secondary school graduates to master&amp;amp;rsquo;s degree holders. Pearson correlation was used to examine the relationship between age and D-KEFS TT performance, while chi-square test assessed the effects of education and gender. Normative data were then derived from raw scores and converted into percentiles. Results: Norms were established for the following D-KEFS TT variables: Total Achievement Score, Total Rule Violations, Move Accuracy Ratio, Mean First Move Time, and Time-per-Move Ratio. Age was the strongest predictor of performance, and normative data were stratified accordingly for the Greek adult population. Conclusions: This study introduces the D-KEFS TT as a neuropsychological assessment tool for Greek adults across different age groups to evaluate complex executive functions throughout the lifespan. Unlike other D-KEFS tests, the TT had not previously been adapted for the Greek population. This study is the first to provide normative data, supporting its use in clinical practice and research.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus discharge synchronously in a brain state-dependent manner to transfer information. Published studies have highlighted the temporal coordination of neuronal activities between the hippocampus and a neocortical area; however, how the spatial extent of neocortical activity relates to hippocampal activity remains partially unknown. We imaged mesoscopic neocortical activity while recording hippocampal local field potentials in anesthetized and unanesthetized GCaMP-expressing transgenic mice. We found that neocortical activity elevates around hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs). SWR-associated neocortical activities occurred predominantly in vision-related regions including the visual, retrosplenial, and frontal cortex. While pre-SWR neocortical activities were frequently observed in awake and natural sleeping states, post-SWR neocortical activity decreased significantly in the latter. Urethane-anesthetized mice also exhibited SWR-correlated calcium elevation, but in longer timescale than observed in natural sleeping mice. During hippocampal theta oscillation states, phase-locked oscillations of calcium activity were observed throughout the entire neocortical areas. In addition, possible environmental effects on neocortico-hippocampal dynamics were assessed in this study by comparing mice reared in ISO (isolated condition) and ENR (enriched environment). In both SWR and theta oscillations, mice reared in ISO exhibited clearer brain state-dependent dynamics than those reared in ENR. Our data demonstrate that the neocortex and hippocampus exhibit heterogeneous activity patterns that characterize brain states, and postnatal experience plays a significant role in modulating these patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/10/e0121242024?rss=1">Reduced Neural Responses to Natural Foreground versus Background Sounds in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday hearing, listeners face the challenge of understanding behaviorally relevant foreground stimuli (speech, vocalizations) in complex backgrounds (environmental, mechanical noise). Prior studies have shown that high-order areas of human auditory cortex (AC) preattentively form an enhanced representation of foreground stimuli in the presence of background noise. This enhancement requires identifying and grouping the features that comprise the background so they can be removed from the foreground representation. To study the cortical computations supporting this process, we recorded single-unit activity in AC of male and female ferrets during the presentation of concurrent natural sounds from these two categories. In contrast to expectations from studies in high-order AC, single-unit responses to foreground sounds were strongly reduced relative to the paired background in primary and secondary AC. The degree of reduction could not be explained by a neuron's preference for the foreground or background stimulus in isolation but could be partially explained by spectrotemporal statistics that distinguish foreground and background categories. Responses to synthesized sounds with statistics either matched or randomized relative to natural sounds showed progressively decreased reduction of foreground responses as natural sound statistics were removed. These results challenge the expectation that cortical foreground representations emerge directly from a mixed representation in the auditory periphery. Instead, they suggest the early AC maintains a robust representation of background noise. Strong background representations may produce a distributed code, facilitating selection of foreground signals from a relatively small subpopulation of AC neurons at later processing stages.</p>

                <p>The human hippocampus, essential for learning and memory, is implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, each linked to specific neuronal subpopulations. Advancing our understanding of hippocampal function requires computational models grounded in precise quantitative neuronal data. While extensive data exist on the neuronal composition and synaptic architecture of the rodent hippocampus, analogous quantitative data for the human hippocampus remain very limited. Given the critical role of local GABAergic interneurons in modulating hippocampal functions, we employed unbiased stereological techniques to estimate the density and total number of three major GABAergic cell types in the male and female human hippocampus: parvalbumin (PV)-expressing, somatostatin (SOM)-positive, and calretinin (CR)-positive interneurons. Our findings reveal an estimated 49,400 PV-positive, 141,500 SOM-positive, and 250,600 CR-positive interneurons per hippocampal hemisphere. Notably, CR-positive interneurons, which are primarily interneuron-selective in rodents, were present in humans at a higher proportion. Additionally, using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we estimated ~25 billion GABAergic synapses per hippocampal hemisphere, with PV-positive boutons comprising ~3.5 billion synapses, or 14% of the total GABAergic synapses. These findings contribute crucial quantitative insights for modeling human hippocampal circuits and understanding its complex regulatory dynamics.</p>

                <p>Individuals avoid spending cognitive effort unless expected rewards offset the perceived costs. Recent work employing tasks that provide explicit information about demands and incentives suggests causal involvement of the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in effort-based decision-making. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we examined whether the FPC's role in motivating effort generalizes to sequential choice problems in which task demand and reward rates vary indirectly and as a function of experience. In a double-blind, within-subject design, 46 participants (36 female, 8 male, 1 "neither/other") received anodal (i.e., excitatory) or sham stimulation over the right FPC during an Effort Foraging Task, which required choosing between harvesting patches for successively decreasing resources or traveling to replenished patches by performing a cognitive task with environment-specific difficulty. As expected, participants exited patches later (i.e., exhibited lower exit thresholds) when traveling required greater (versus less) effort, indicating increased travel costs in high-effort environments. Under anodal tDCS, the difference in exit thresholds between environments was significantly smaller relative to sham. Finally, individual differences analyses hint that participants with lower self-reported motivation to exert effort exhibited greater travel cost reductions following tDCS. Together, these findings support the theorized causal role of the FPC in motivating cognitively effortful behavior, expand its role to more ecologically valid serial decisions, and highlight the potential for tDCS as a tool to increase motivation with potential clinical applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/10/e0691242024?rss=1">Neural Correlates of Perceptual Plasticity in the Auditory Midbrain and Thalamus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hearing is an active process in which listeners must detect and identify sounds, segregate and discriminate stimulus features, and extract their behavioral relevance. Adaptive changes in sound detection can emerge rapidly, during sudden shifts in acoustic or environmental context, or more slowly as a result of practice. Although we know that context- and learning-dependent changes in the sensitivity of auditory cortical (ACX) neurons support many aspects of perceptual plasticity, the contribution of subcortical auditory regions to this process is less understood. Here, we recorded single- and multiunit activity from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and the ventral subdivision of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGV) of male and female Mongolian gerbils under two different behavioral contexts: as animals performed an amplitude modulation (AM) detection task and as they were passively exposed to AM sounds. Using a signal detection framework to estimate neurometric sensitivity, we found that neural thresholds in both regions improve during task performance, and this improvement is largely driven by changes in the firing rate rather than phase locking. We also found that ICC and MGV neurometric thresholds improve as animals learn to detect small AM depths during a multiday perceptual training paradigm. Finally, we revealed that in the MGV, but not the ICC, context-dependent enhancements in AM sensitivity grow stronger during perceptual training, mirroring prior observations in the ACX. Together, our results suggest that the auditory midbrain and thalamus contribute to changes in sound processing and perception over rapid and slow timescales.</p>

                <p>In literate adults, an area along the left posterior fusiform gyrus that is often referred to as the "visual word form area" (VWFA) responds particularly strongly to written characters compared with other visually similar stimuli. Theoretical accounts differ in whether they attribute the strong left-lateralization of the VWFA to a left-hemisphere (LH) bias toward visual features used in script, to competition of visual word form processing with that of other visual stimuli processed in the same general cortical territory (especially faces), or to the well established left-lateralization of the language system. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the last hypothesis by investigating lateralization of the VWFA in participants (male and female) who have right-hemisphere language due to a large LH perinatal stroke. Demographically matched controls were included for comparison. All participants had intact language skills and were proficient readers; age at testing ranged from 9.75&nbsp;years to early adulthood. Activation maps contrasting activation during rapid presentation of pseudowords and pictures of places revealed left-lateralized fusiform activation in controls, as expected. In participants with left-hemisphere perinatal stroke and right-lateralized language, the VWFA was instead found in the right fusiform gyrus, despite the fact that the left-hemisphere tissue normally occupied by the VWFA was intact and responded normally to pictures of places. Region-of-interest analyses confirmed right-lateralization for visual word form processing, both relative to place stimuli and relative to a resting baseline. This provides compelling evidence that the lateralization of the VWFA indeed follows that of the frontotemporal language system.</p>

                <p>Accumulation of astrocytes around &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms and significance remain unclear. Cell adhesion molecule protocadherin-C5 (Pcdh-C5) has been reported to implicate in AD. Here, we find elevated expression levels of Pcdh-C5 in the brain of 5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD mice and A&beta;-treated astrocytes and further reveal that Pcdh-C5 deficiency leads to exacerbated A&beta; deposition in 5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD mice. Deletion of Pcdh-C5 impairs astrocyte migration, astrocytic response to A&beta; signaling, and A&beta; phagocytosis in both cultured astrocytes in vitro and 5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD mice in vivo. Both male and female mice were used in this study. Our findings support a model in which increased expression level of Pcdh-C5 promotes astrocyte migration in response to A&beta; signaling and engulfment and phagocytosis of neurotoxic A&beta; plaques, therefore exerting a critical neuroprotective function in AD.</p>

                <p>While the brain continues to develop during adolescence, such development may depend on sex-at-birth. However, the elucidation of such differences may be hindered by analytical decisions (e.g., covariate selection to address brain-size differences) and the typical reporting of cross-sectional data. To further evaluate adolescent cortical development, we analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, whose cohort of 11,000+ youth participants with biannual neuroimaging data collection can facilitate understanding neuroanatomical change during a critical developmental window. Doubly considering individual differences within the context of group-level effects, we analyzed regional changes in cortical thickness, sulcal depth, surface area, and volume between two timepoints (~2&nbsp;years apart) in 9- to 12-year-olds assigned male or female sex-at-birth. First, we conducted linear mixed-effect models to gauge how controlling for intracranial volume, whole-brain volume (WBV), or a summary metric (e.g., mean cortical thickness) influenced interpretations of age-dependent cortical change. Next, we evaluated the relative changes in thickness and surface area as a function of sex-at-birth and age. Here, we showed that WBV (thickness, sulcal depth, volume) and total cortical surface area were more optimal covariates; controlling for different covariates would have substantially altered our interpretations of overall and sex-at-birth-specific neuroanatomical development. Furthermore, we provided evidence to suggest that aggregate change in how cortical thickness is changing relative to surface area is generally comparable across those assigned male or female sex-at-birth, with corresponding change happening at slightly older ages in those assigned male sex-at-birth.

                <p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are characterized by a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Determining how temporally specific alcohol exposure (AE) affects neural circuits is crucial to understanding the FASD phenotype. Third trimester AE can be modeled in rats by administering alcohol during the first two postnatal weeks, which damages the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC), structures whose functional interactions are required for working memory and executive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that AE during this period would impair working memory, disrupt choice behaviors, and alter mPFC&ndash;HPC oscillatory synchrony. To test this hypothesis, we recorded local field potentials from the mPFC and dorsal HPC as male and female AE and sham-intubated (SI) rats performed a spatial working memory task in adulthood and implemented algorithms to detect vicarious trial and errors (VTEs), behaviors associated with deliberative decision-making. We found that, compared with the SI group, the AE group performed fewer VTEs and demonstrated a disturbed relationship between VTEs and choice outcomes, while spatial working memory was unimpaired. This behavioral disruption was accompanied by alterations to mPFC and HPC oscillatory activity in the theta and beta bands, respectively, and a reduced prevalence of mPFC&ndash;HPC synchronous events. When trained on multiple behavioral variables, a machine learning algorithm could accurately predict whether rats were in the AE or SI group, thus characterizing a potential phenotype following third trimester AE. Together, these findings indicate that third trimester AE disrupts mPFC&ndash;HPC oscillatory interactions and choice behaviors.</p>

                <p>Cerebral amyloid-beta (A&beta;) accumulation, a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), precedes clinical impairment by two to three decades. However, it is unclear whether A&beta; contributes to subtle memory deficits observed during the preclinical stage. The heterogeneous emergence of A&beta; deposition may selectively impact certain memory domains, which rely on distinct underlying neural circuits. In this context, we tested whether specific domains of mnemonic discrimination, a neural computation essential for episodic memory, exhibit specific deficits related to early A&beta; deposition. We tested 108 cognitively unimpaired human older adults (66% female) who underwent 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (A&beta;-PET) and a control group of 35 young adults, on a suite of mnemonic discrimination tasks taxing object, spatial, and temporal domains. We hypothesized that A&beta; pathology would be selectively associated with temporal discrimination performance due to A&beta;'s propensity to accumulate in the basal frontotemporal cortex, which supports temporal processing. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found a dissociation in which generalized age-related deficits were found for object and spatial mnemonic discrimination, while A&beta;-PET levels were selectively associated with deficits in temporal mnemonic discrimination. Furthermore, we found that higher A&beta;-PET levels in the medial orbitofrontal and inferior temporal cortex, regions supporting temporal processing, were associated with greater temporal mnemonic discrimination deficits, pointing to the selective vulnerability of circuits related to temporal processing early in AD progression. These results suggest that A&beta; accumulation within basal frontotemporal regions may disrupt temporal mnemonic discrimination in preclinical AD, and future work is needed to determine whether assessing temporal mnemonic discrimination can aid in predicting emerging AD progression.</p>

                <p>The brain's activity fluctuations have different temporal scales across the brain regions, with associative regions displaying slower timescales than sensory areas. This hierarchy of timescales has been shown to correlate with both structural brain connectivity and intrinsic regional properties. Here, using publicly available human resting-state fMRI and dMRI data, it was found that, while more structurally connected brain regions presented activity fluctuations with longer timescales, their activity fluctuations presented lower variance. The opposite relationships between the structural connectivity and the variance and temporal scales of resting-state fluctuations, respectively, were not trivially explained by simple network propagation principles. To understand these structure&ndash;function relationships, two commonly used whole-brain models were studied, namely, the Hopf and Wilson&ndash;Cowan models. These models use the brain's connectome to couple local nodes (representing brain regions) displaying noise-driven oscillations. The models show that the variance and temporal scales of activity fluctuations can oppositely relate to connectivity within specific parameter regions, even when all nodes have the same intrinsic dynamics&mdash;but also when intrinsic dynamics are constrained by the myelinization-related macroscopic gradient. These results show that, setting aside intrinsic regional differences, connectivity and network state are sufficient to explain the regional differences in fluctuations&rsquo; scales. State dependence supports the vision that structure&ndash;function relationships can serve as biomarkers of altered brain states. Finally, the results indicate that the hierarchies of timescales and variances reflect a balance between stability and responsivity, with greater and faster responsiveness at the network periphery, while the network core ensures overall system robustness.</p>

                <p>Regulation of food intake and energy balance is critical to survival. Hunger develops as a response to energy deficit and drives food-seeking and consumption. However, motivations to eat are varied in nature and promoted by factors other than energy deficit. When dysregulated, nonhomeostatic drives to consume can contribute to disorders of food intake, adding to the increasing prevalence of restrictive eating disorders and obesity. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons have been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior, in addition to a number of other fundamental behaviors including sleep, anxiety, and maternal behavior. Several studies suggest that MCH peptide increases food consumption, while studies of MCH neurons show effects only on cued feeding, and others show no effect of MCH neuron manipulation on feeding. MCH neurons have widespread projections to diverse downstream brain regions, yet few studies have investigated the function of specific projections or differentiated the behaviors they regulate. Here we use optogenetics, in combination with different behavioral paradigms, to elucidate the role of MCH projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in sleep and feeding behavior. We show that MCH neurons projecting to the NAc do not induce changes in baseline feeding or REM sleep but do enhance the preference for a food paired with optogenetic stimulation. Furthermore, this effect is diminished in female mice relative to males, in line with previous results suggesting sex differences in the functional role of MCH neurons. These results suggest that MCH projections to the NAc can enhance the rewarding value of consumed food.</p>

                <p>GABAergic neurons in basal forebrain (BF) nuclei project densely to all layers of the mouse main olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay in odor information processing. However, BF projection neurons are diverse, and the contribution of each subtype to odor information processing is not known. In the present study, we used retrograde and anterograde tracing methods together with whole-brain light&ndash;sheet analyses, patch-clamp recordings coupled with optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches during spontaneous odor discrimination, and go/no-go odor discrimination/learning tests to characterize the synaptic targets in the OB of BF calretinin-expressing (CR+) GABAergic cells and to reveal their functional implications. We used mice of either sex to show that OB-projecting CR+ neurons innervate the bulbar granule cell (GC) layer but not the glomerular layer. Optogenetic stimulation of CR+ axonal projections in OB slices elicited monosynaptic GABAergic currents in GCs. Retrograde rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing experiments confirmed these synaptic connections and further suggested that CR+ neurons provide the principal, if not the unique, BF input onto GCs. Chemogenetic inhibition of CR+ neurons in the BF of male mice did not affect odor discrimination in habituation/dishabituation tasks but led to impairment in odor learning during go/no-go odor&ndash;associative tasks. Our results revealed a subtype-specific projection pattern in the OB of a select population of BF neurons and suggested that distinct BF GABAergic projections have distinct effects on odor information processing and learning.</p>

                <p>Sensory systems enable organisms to detect and respond to environmental signals relevant for their survival and reproduction. A crucial aspect of any sensory signal is its intensity; understanding how sensory signals guide behavior requires probing sensory system function across the range of stimulus intensities naturally experienced by an organism. In olfaction, defining the range of natural odorant concentrations is difficult. Odors are complex mixtures of airborne chemicals emitting from a source in an irregular pattern that varies across time and space, necessitating specialized methods to obtain an accurate measurement of concentration. Perhaps as a result, experimentalists often choose stimulus concentrations based on empirical considerations rather than with respect to ecological or behavioral context. Here, we attempt to determine naturally relevant concentration ranges for olfactory stimuli by reviewing and integrating data from diverse disciplines. We compare odorant concentrations used in experimental studies in rodents and insects with those reported in different settings including ambient natural environments, the headspace of natural sources, and within the sources themselves. We also compare these values to psychophysical measurements of odorant detection threshold in rodents, where thresholds have been extensively measured. Odorant concentrations in natural regimes rarely exceed a few parts per billion, while most experimental studies investigating olfactory coding and behavior exceed these concentrations by several orders of magnitude. We discuss the implications of this mismatch and the importance of testing odorants in their natural concentration range for understanding neural mechanisms underlying olfactory sensation and odor-guided behaviors.</p>

                <p>Dynamic reconfigurations of the functional connectome across different connectivity states are highly heritable, predictive of cognitive abilities, and linked to mental health. Despite their established heritability, the specific polymorphisms that shape connectome dynamics are largely unknown. Given the widespread regulatory impact of modulatory neurotransmitters on functional connectivity, we comprehensively investigated a large set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of their receptors, metabolic enzymes, and transporters in 674 healthy adult subjects (347 females) from the Human Connectome Project. Preregistered modulatory neurotransmitter SNPs and dynamic connectome features entered a Stability Selection procedure with resampling. We found that specific subsets of these SNPs explain individual differences in temporal phenotypes of fMRI-derived connectome dynamics for which we previously established heritability. Specifically, noradrenergic polymorphisms explained Fractional Occupancy, i.e., the proportion of time spent in each connectome state, and cholinergic polymorphisms explained Transition Probability, i.e., the probability to transition between state pairs, respectively. This work identifies specific genetic effects on connectome dynamics via the regulatory impact of modulatory neurotransmitter systems. Our observations highlight the potential of dynamic connectome features as endophenotypes for neurotransmitter-focused precision psychiatry.</p>

                <p>Singular strategies for promoting axon regeneration and motor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) have been attempted with limited success. For instance, the deletion of <I>RhoA</I> and phosphatase and tensin homolog (<I>Pten</I>) (an extrinsic and intrinsic modulating factor, respectively) in corticospinal neurons (CSNs) promotes axon sprouting after thoracic SCI; however, it is unable to restore motor function. Here, we examine the effects of combining <I>RhoA/Pten</I> deletion in CSNs with chemogenetic neuronal stimulation on axonal growth and motor recovery after SCI in mice. We find that this combinatorial approach promotes greater axonal growth and presynaptic bouton formation in CSNs within the spinal cord compared with <I>RhoA</I>;<I>Pten</I> deletion alone. Furthermore, chemogenetic neuronal stimulation of <I>RhoA</I>;<I>Pten</I>-deleted CSNs improves forelimb performance in behavioral tasks after SCI compared with <I>RhoA</I>;<I>Pten</I> deletion alone. These results demonstrate that combination therapies pairing genetic modifications with neuronal stimulation can promote greater presynaptic formation and motor recovery following SCI than either strategy alone.</p>

                <p>Mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) act as an input convergence hub and transmit information to higher olfactory areas. Since first characterized, they have been classed as distinct projection neurons based on size and location: laminarly arranged MCs with a diameter larger than 20&nbsp;&micro;m in the mitral layer (ML) and smaller TCs spread across both the ML and external plexiform layers (EPL). Recent in vivo work has shown that these neurons encode complementary olfactory information, akin to parallel channels in other sensory systems. Yet, many ex vivo studies still collapse them into a single class, mitral/tufted, when describing their physiological properties and impact on circuit function. Using immunohistochemistry and whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp electrophysiology in fixed or acute slices from adult mice, we attempted to align in vivo and ex vivo data and test a soma size-based classifier of bulbar projection neurons using passive and intrinsic firing properties. We found that there is no clear separation between cell types based on passive or active properties. Rather, there is a heterogeneous continuum with three loosely clustered subgroups: TCs in the EPL, and putative tufted or putative MCs in the ML. These findings illustrate the large functional heterogeneity present within the OB projection neurons and complement existing literature highlighting how heterogeneity in sensory systems is preponderant and possibly used in the OB to decode complex olfactory information.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia are linked to accelerated aging leading to reduced lifespan, health span and cognitive decline. Cellular senescence, in which cells lose proliferative capacity and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), plays a role in this process. Emerging research suggests that the senolytic regimen of dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q) reduces senescent cells, potentially mitigating age-related health and cognitive decline. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of D+Q in older adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods This single-center study will recruit 30 participants total aged 50 years or older with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or 60 years or older with TRD; the difference in age limits is because individuals with schizophrenia are biologically about 10 years older than general population owing to metabolic burden. Each participant will receive two consecutive days of 100 mg oral dasatinib plus 1250 mg oral quercetin at baseline and weeks one through three, (i.e., two days on, five days off ) along with lifestyle risk management education. Questionnaires and assessments will measure health and cognitive function as well as psychiatric function at baseline, week 10, and one year. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will measure structural and functional brain health at baseline and 10 weeks. Blood sampling for SASP testing will occur at seven time points: baseline, weeks one through four, week 10, and one year. Conclusion This pilot aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the senolytic regimen and D+Q’s potential to counteract accelerated aging in adults with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and TRD. Trial registration Dasatinib Plus Quercetin for Accelerated Aging in Mental Disorders is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05838560; posted May 1, 2023.

                Background Physical activity is the second largest contributor to our total daily energy expenditure (EE). Uncovering ways to increase EE during activity could yield new approaches to treat obesity. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates body weight by modulating muscle metabolism and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The VMH also mediates behavioral responses to predator threat. This thermogenic response is associated with weight loss and increased EE even when controlling for physical activity. While the VMH is a potential mediator of metabolic responses to predator threat, the mechanisms are unknown. Methods and Results Exposing rats to predator odor (PO) causes a rapid increase in skeletal muscle thermogenesis that peaks between 20-30 min and dissipates to baseline by 4 hr. To probe potential targets of PO-induced metabolic responses in the VMH, we first performed qPCR for genes known to be involved in brain regulation of muscle metabolism using VMH samples from rats exposed to PO or control odor for either 30 min or 4 hr. Next, to uncover novel, relevant genes, we performed RNA-sequencing on VMH samples of rats exposed to either PO or control odor for 20 min. qPCR results show that after 4 hr of PO exposure, Bdnf and Sirt1 expression were increased. RNA-sequencing analyses further identified 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that showed at least 1.5-fold change in expression due to PO exposure. Functional and Gene Ontology annotation showed that pathways related to immune response, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity were overrepresented among these DEGs. Discussion Taken together, these findings suggest that acute PO exposure induces both rapid and delayed changes in VMH gene expression that likely have downstream metabolic consequences.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1076/v2?src=rss">Prevalence, satisfaction and preference of tooth shades and their correlation with age, gender and skin shade: A cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Shade selection is one of the most important factors that determines the satisfaction of the patient with the dental prosthesis and thus the overall success of the treatment. Conventional methods of shade selection require the presence of existing teeth or past dental/photographic records. Despite the presence of these records, shade selection continues to be challenging, subjective and arbitrarily based on the patient’s age and gender especially if the visual method is employed. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades in a cross section of the local Indian population, investigating their correlation with age, gender, and skin color in a diverse sample of 120 participants visiting the outpatient department of this Institution. Methods A total of 120 participants, 60 males and 60 females, categorized into four age (n=15): groups 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, & 50-60 yrs were recruited randomly and evaluated visually using the VITA 3D Master in the study. Participants were also asked about their satisfaction with existing tooth shades and their preferences. Results The most common existing tooth shade was Value 2 (52.5%). Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests revealed that Value 2 was the most desired shade among males and females alike, particularly in the age group of 41 to 50 years (p < 0.001). Shade 2L1.5 was the most prevalent (n=26), with Value 2 (59.16%) being the most sought-after shade, followed by Shade 2L1.5 (n=21), Shade 2M1 (n=18), Shade 1M1 (n=15), and Shade 2R1.5 (n=14). Existing tooth shades of Value 0 were the least common. The highest satisfaction with existing shades was observed in males aged 41 to 50 (n=15), followed by males aged 51 to 60 (n=14) and females aged 31 to 40 (n=12) and 41 to 50 (n=12). Significant differences in satisfaction were noted among males (p < 0.001). Conclusions This study reveals a consistent and strong preference among both males and females for tooth shades classified as Value 2, following the VITA Tooth-Guide 3D Master shade guide. This universal preference suggests the relevance and acceptance of this shade category across diverse patient groups.

                Background A growing movement of researcher-driven publishing projects has emerged in response to several challenges and shifts within the academic publishing landscape. One publishing initiative in this area are what we term community-led publishing projects (CPPs), which are produced entirely by academics, librarians and students without any involvement of the commercial publishing industry. CPPs are part of a growing global movement but their values and practices remain underexplored. This article presents findings on the landscape of CPPs at the University of Cambridge. Methods A landscape analysis was undertaken to identify and describe the various CPPs at Cambridge. A subset of 10 journal editors were subsequently interviewed to explore the practices, motivations and needs of these initiatives. Results Thirty-four CPPs were identified across a range of disciplines with a variety of publishing practices, open access status and professionalisation. From the interviews, CPPs were driven by an array of motivations including volunteers who are dedicated to their disciplines, who care for publishing, have a responsibility to disseminate their own research and who acknowledge the value these projects bring. They have complicated relationships with open access, being encouraged by public access to knowledge while maintaining a desire for print and being critical of some cultures of publishing brought on by the turn to openness. Practically, they employ a “DIY” approach due to the availability of resources but in doing so adhere to professional standards. Their success relies on collaboration and support, leveraging networks, technical and financial backing, and ensuring sustainability through careful handover. Conclusions This study helps us better understand the scope and practices of community-led publishing at a research-intensive university in the UK. It shows that CPPs are valuable for a variety of reasons and that universities, funders and governments should support such projects to ensure the preservation of unique scholarly content.

                Abstract* Background The rapid adoption of short-form video content has significantly transformed online content consumption patterns. This study investigates measures to mitigate the dual social and environmental impacts of short-form video platforms, addressing a critical gap in current literature where these dimensions have typically been studied in isolation. Methods Utilizing a dynamic data-driven simulation model, which is openly available for further research, and taking TikTok™ as a representative case study, we evaluate mitigation strategies across financial, content-based, and design interventions. Results Results indicate that while financial measures effectively reduce impacts, they could significantly affect platform revenue. Content-focused strategies and non-punitive design modifications show promise in promoting behavioural change and reducing addictive behaviours. A balanced combination of these approaches yields optimal outcomes, highlighting the necessity of a realistic and multi-pronged strategy for sustainable short-form video platforms. Conclusions This research provides valuable insights and tools for policymakers, platform designers, and companies, focused on creating a more sustainable short-form video industry. This work serves as a call to action, emphasizing the need for further sustainable advances in regulation and business models in the short-form video industry.

<p>• Overview of challenges in defining and measuring intelligence in neuroscience, considering evolutionary diversity and ecological niches.</p>
<p>• Insights from humans, macaques, ferrets, crows, octopuses, bees, and flies, including how intelligence manifests in their respective contexts.</p>
<p>• In order to more equivocally define intelligence - both in behaviors, and in the neural circuits from which they arise - a return to more comparative work is essential.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Defining intelligence is a challenging and fraught task, but one that neuroscientists are repeatedly confronted with. A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how phenomena like intelligent behaviors emerge from nervous systems. This requires some determination of what defines intelligence and how to measure it. The challenge is multifaceted. For instance, as we begin to describe and understand the brain in increasingly specific physical terms (e.g., anatomy, cell types, activity patterns), we amplify an ever-growing divide in how we connect measurable properties of the brain to less tangible concepts like intelligence. As our appreciation for evolutionary diversity in neuroscience grows, we are further confronted with whether there can be a unifying theory of intelligence. The National Science Foundation (NSF) NeuroNex consortium recently gathered experts from multiple animal model systems to discuss intelligence across species. We summarize here the different perspectives offered by the consortium, with the goal of promoting thought and debate of this ancient question from a modern perspective, and asking whether defining intelligence is a useful exercise in neuroscience or an ill-posed and distracting question. We present data from the vantage points of humans, macaques, ferrets, crows, octopuses, bees, and flies, highlighting some of the noteworthy capabilities of each species within the context of each species’ ecological niche and how these may be challenged by climate change. We also include a remarkable example of convergent evolution between primates and crows in the circuit and molecular basis for working memory in these highly divergent animal species.</p>

                Using an organoid model of glutamate excitotoxicity, Berlind and Lai et al. show that excess glutamate induces early tau oligomerization and neuron death, which is enhanced in MAPT-mutant FTD neurons. The authors identify KCTD20 suppression as protective in this model, in part via enhanced lysosomal exocytosis to clear oligomeric tau.

                Kane et al. show that adhesion measurements of cancer cells can be used to retrospectively predict metastatic capacity within an in vivo murine model. Additionally, adhesion can be used to stratify human patient samples into healthy reduction tissue, non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101114">Regeneration following tissue necrosis is mediated by non-apoptotic caspase activity</a></h4>

              
                Tissue necrosis is a devastating complication for many human diseases and injuries. Unfortunately, our understanding of necrosis and how it impacts surrounding healthy tissue – an essential consideration when developing effective methods to treat such injuries – has been limited by a lack of robust genetically tractable models. Our lab previously established a method to study necrosis-induced regeneration in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, which revealed a unique phenomenon whereby cells at a distance from the injury upregulate caspase activity in a process called Necrosis-induced Apoptosis (NiA) that is vital for regeneration. Here, we have further investigated this phenomenon, showing that NiA is predominantly associated with the highly regenerative pouch region of the disc, shaped by genetic factors present in the presumptive hinge. Furthermore, we find that a proportion of NiA fail to undergo apoptosis, instead surviving effector caspase activation to persist within the tissue and stimulate reparative proliferation late in regeneration. This proliferation relies on the initiator caspase Dronc, and occurs independent of JNK, ROS or mitogens associated with the previously characterized Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP) mechanism. These data reveal a new means by which non-apoptotic Dronc signaling promotes regenerative proliferation in response to necrotic damage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102986">Acetylcholine modulates prefrontal outcome coding during threat learning under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Outcomes can vary even when choices are repeated. Such ambiguity necessitates adjusting how much to learn from each outcome by tracking its variability. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been reported to signal the expected outcome and its discrepancy from the actual outcome (prediction error), two variables essential for controlling the learning rate. However, the source of signals that shape these coding properties remains unknown. Here, we investigated the contribution of cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain because they carry precisely timed signals about outcomes. One-photon calcium imaging revealed that as mice learned different probabilities of threat occurrence on two paths, some mPFC cells responded to threats on one of the paths, while other cells gained responses to threat omission. These threat- and omission-evoked responses were scaled to the unexpectedness of outcomes, some exhibiting a reversal in response direction when encountering surprising threats as opposed to surprising omissions. This selectivity for signed prediction errors was enhanced by optogenetic stimulation of local cholinergic terminals during threats. The enhanced threat-evoked cholinergic signals also made mice erroneously abandon the correct choice after a single threat that violated expectations, thereby decoupling their path choice from the history of threat occurrence on each path. Thus, acetylcholine modulates the encoding of surprising outcomes in the mPFC to control how much they dictate future decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103260">Dopamine activity encodes the changing valence of the same stimulus in conditioned taste aversion paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Mesolimbic dopamine encoding of non-contingent rewards and reward-predictive cues has been well established. Considerable debate remains over how mesolimbic dopamine responds to aversion and in the context of aversive conditioning. Inconsistencies may arise from the use of aversive stimuli that are transduced along different neural paths relative to reward or the conflation of responses to avoidance and aversion. Here, we made intraoral infusions of sucrose and measured how dopamine and behavioral responses varied to the changing valence of sucrose. Pairing intraoral sucrose with malaise via injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) caused the development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA), which rendered the typically rewarding taste of sucrose aversive upon subsequent re-exposure. Following CTA formation, intraoral sucrose suppressed the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (VTA<sub>DA</sub>) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine release. This pattern of dopamine signaling after CTA is similar to intraoral infusions of innately aversive quinine and contrasts with responses to sucrose when it was novel or not paired with LiCl. Dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioral reactivity to intraoral sucrose and predicted home cage sucrose preference. Further, dopamine responses scaled with the strength of the CTA, which was increased by repeated LiCl pairings and weakened through extinction. Thus, the findings demonstrate differential dopamine encoding of the same taste stimulus according to its valence, which is aligned to distinct behavioral responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100949">Discovering root causal genes with high-throughput perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Root causal gene expression levels – or <i>root causal genes</i> for short – correspond to the initial changes to gene expression that generate patient symptoms as a downstream effect. Identifying root causal genes is critical towards developing treatments that modify disease near its onset, but no existing algorithms attempt to identify root causal genes from data. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data introduces challenges such as measurement error, high dimensionality and non-linearity that compromise accurate estimation of root causal effects even with state-of-the-art approaches. We therefore instead leverage Perturb-seq, or high-throughput perturbations with single-cell RNA-seq readout, to learn the causal order between the genes. We then transfer the causal order to bulk RNA-seq and identify root causal genes specific to a given patient for the first time using a novel statistic. Experiments demonstrate large improvements in performance. Applications to macular degeneration and multiple sclerosis also reveal root causal genes that lie on known pathogenic pathways, delineate patient subgroups and implicate a newly defined omnigenic root causal model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98485">A deep learning framework for automated and generalized synaptic event analysis</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative information about synaptic transmission is key to our understanding of neural function. Spontaneously occurring synaptic events carry fundamental information about synaptic function and plasticity. However, their stochastic nature and low signal-to-noise ratio present major challenges for the reliable and consistent analysis. Here, we introduce miniML, a supervised deep learning-based method for accurate classification and automated detection of spontaneous synaptic events. Comparative analysis using simulated ground-truth data shows that miniML outperforms existing event analysis methods in terms of both precision and recall. miniML enables precise detection and quantification of synaptic events in electrophysiological recordings. We demonstrate that the deep learning approach generalizes easily to diverse synaptic preparations, different electrophysiological and optical recording techniques, and across animal species. miniML provides not only a comprehensive and robust framework for automated, reliable, and standardized analysis of synaptic events, but also opens new avenues for high-throughput investigations of neural function and dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91765">Post-ejaculatory inhibition of female sexual drive via heterogeneous neuronal ensembles in the medial preoptic area</a></h4>

              
                Male ejaculation acutely suppresses sexual motivation in male mice. In contrast, relatively little is known about how male ejaculation affects sexual motivation and sexual behavior in female mice. How the brain responds to the completion of mating is also unclear. Here, by using a self-paced mating assay, we first demonstrate that female mice show decreased sexual motivation acutely after experiencing male ejaculation. By using brain-wide analysis of activity-dependent labeling, we next pin-pointed the medial preoptic area as a brain region strongly activated during the post-ejaculatory period. Furthermore, using freely moving <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging to compare the neural activity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the medial preoptic area, we revealed that a subset of the neurons in this region responds significantly and specifically to male ejaculation but not to female-to-male sniffing or to male mounting. While there were excitatory and inhibitory neurons that showed increased response to male ejaculation, the response magnitude as well as the proportion of neurons responding to the event was significantly larger in the inhibitory neuron population. Next, by unbiased classification of their responses, we also found a subpopulation of neurons that increase their activity late after the onset of male ejaculation. These neurons were all inhibitory indicating that male ejaculation induces a prolonged inhibitory activity in the medial preoptic area. Lastly, we found that chemogenetic activation of medial preoptic area neurons that were active during the post-ejaculatory period, but not during appetitive or consummatory periods, were sufficient to suppress female sexual motivation. Together, our data illuminate the importance of the medial preoptic area as a brain node which encodes a negative signal that sustains a low sexual motivation state after the female mice experience ejaculation.

">Sleep Deprivation Alters Hippocampal Dendritic Spines in a Contextual Fear Memory Engram</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is critically involved in strengthening memories. However, our understanding of the morphological changes underlying this process is still emerging. Recent studies suggest that specific subsets of dendritic spines are strengthened during sleep in specific neurons involved in recent learning. Contextual memories associated with traumatic experiences are involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and represent recent learning that may be strengthened during sleep. We tested the hypothesis that dendritic spines encoding contextual fear memories are selectively strengthened during sleep. Furthermore, we tested how sleep deprivation after initial fear learning impacts dendritic spines following re-exposure to fear conditioning. We used ArcCreERT2 mice to visualize neurons that encode contextual fear learning (Arc+ neurons), and concomitantly labeled neurons that did not encode contextual fear learning (Arc- neurons). Dendritic branches of Arc+ and Arc- neurons were sampled using confocal imaging to assess spine densities using three-dimensional image analysis from either sleep deprived (SD) or control mice allowed to sleep normally. Mushroom spines in Arc+ branches displayed decreased density in SD mice, indicating upscaling of mushroom spines during sleep following fear learning. In comparison, no changes were observed in dendritic spines from Arc- branches. When animals were re-exposed to contextual fear conditioning 4 weeks later, we observed lower density of mushroom spines in both Arc+ and Arc- branches, as well as lower density of thin spines in Arc- branches in mice that were SD following the initial fear conditioning trial. Our findings indicate that sleep strengthens dendritic spines in neurons that recently encoded fear memory, and sleep deprivation following initial fear learning impairs dendritic spine strengthening initially and following later re-exposure. SD following a traumatic experience thus may be a viable strategy in weakening the strength of contextual memories associated with trauma and PTSD.

">Temporal variation in the acoustic dynamic range is a confounding factor in EEG-based tracking of absolute auditory attention to speech</a></h4>

              
                Many studies have demonstrated that auditory attention to natural speech can be decoded from EEG data. However, most studies focus on selective auditory attention decoding (sAAD) with competing speakers, while the dynamics of absolute auditory attention decoding (aAAD) to a single target remains underexplored. The goal of aAAD is to measure the degree of attention to a single speaker, has applications for objective measurements of attention in psychological and educational contexts. To investigate this aAAD paradigm, we designed an experiment where subjects listened to a video lecture under varying attentive conditions. We trained neural decoders to reconstruct the speech envelope from EEG in the baseline attentive condition and use the correlation coefficient between the decoded and real speech envelope as a metric for attention to the speech. Our analysis shows that the envelope standard deviation (SD) of the speech envelope in the 1-4 Hz band strongly correlates with this metric across different segments of the speech stimulus. However, this correlation weakens in the 0.1-4 Hz band, where the degree of separation between the attentive and inattentive state becomes more pronounced. This highlights the unique contribution of the 0.1-1 Hz range, which enhances the distinction of attentional states and remains less affected by confounding factors such as the time-varying dynamic range of the speech envelope.

">Motifs of brain cortical folding from birth to adulthood: structural asymmetry and folding-functional links</a></h4>

              
                Cortical folding of brain is widely regarded as an interplay between genetic programming and biomechanical forces, closely linked to cytoarchitectonic regionalisation. Abnormal folding patterns are frequently observed in neurodevelopmental conditions and psychiatric disorders. However, significant inter-individual variability of secondary and tertiary folds obscures detection of shape biomarkers and confounds investigation of folding-functional relationships. Here we investigate cortical folding heterogeneity at fine scale, using novel hierarchical surface registration (MSM-HT) to parse cortical folding patterns into a representative family of distinct anatomical templates. By applying this technique both to young adults from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and neonates in the Developing HCP and Brain Imaging in Babies (BIBS) cohorts, we identify and characterize common lobe-wise folding patterns: observing consistency across both age groups, with neonatal samples showing less variation. Crucially, we highlight significant hemispheric asymmetry within the temporal lobe for both adults and neonates, and show that improved correspondence of shape does not translate to improved areal correspondence, affirming previous studies that have pointed to dissociation of folding and functional organisation. This study provides a critical step towards understanding brain asymmetry and complex relationships between folding and function, offering a robust framework to generalise the uncovered cortical folding motifs across datasets and developmental stages.

">mTORC1 activation drives astrocyte reactivity in cortical tubers and brain organoid models of TSC</a></h4>

              
                Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with early onset epilepsy, intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disorders. A hallmark of the disorder is cortical tubers, which are focal malformations of brain development that contain dysplastic cells with hyperactive mTORC1 signaling. One barrier to developing therapeutic approaches and understanding the origins of tuber cells is the lack of a model system that recapitulates this pathology. To address this, we established a genetically mosaic cortical organoid system that models a somatic second-hit mutation, which is thought to drive the formation of tubers in TSC. With this model, we find that loss of TSC2 cell-autonomously promotes the differentiation of astrocytes, which exhibit features of a disease-associated reactive state. TSC-/- astrocytes have pronounced changes in morphology and upregulation of proteins that are risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, such as clusterin and APOE. Using multiplexed immunofluorescence in primary tubers from TSC patients, we show that tuber cells with hyperactive mTORC1 activity also express reactive astrocyte proteins, and we identify a unique population of cells with expression profiles that match the those observed in organoids. Together, this work reveals that reactive astrogliosis is a primary feature of TSC that arises early in cortical development. Dysfunctional glia are therefore poised to be drivers of pathophysiology, nominating a potential therapeutic target for treating TSC and related mTORopathies.

">Biological subtyping of autism via cross-species fMRI</a></h4>

              
                It is frequently assumed that the phenotypic heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder reflects underlying pathobiological variation. However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we leverage cross-species functional neuroimaging to examine whether variability in brain functional connectivity reflects distinct biological mechanisms. We find that fMRI connectivity alterations in 20 distinct mouse models of autism (n=549 individual mice) can be clustered into two prominent hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes. We show that these connectivity profiles are linked to distinct signaling pathways, with hypoconnectivity being associated with synaptic dysfunction, and hyperconnectivity reflecting transcriptional and immune-related alterations. Extending these findings to humans, we identify analogous hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes in a large, multicenter resting state fMRI dataset of n=940 autistic and n=1036 neurotypical individuals. Remarkably, hypo- and hyperconnectivity autism subtypes are replicable across independent cohorts (accounting for 25.1% of all autism data), exhibit distinct functional network architecture, are behaviorally dissociable, and recapitulate synaptic and immune mechanisms identified in corresponding mouse subtypes. Our cross-species investigation, thus, decodes the heterogeneity of fMRI connectivity in autism into distinct pathway-specific etiologies, offering a new empirical framework for targeted subtyping of autism.

">Alpha and beta cortico-motor synchronization shape visuomotor control on a single-trial basis</a></h4>

              
                A central question in sensorimotor neuroscience is how sensory inputs are mapped onto motor outputs to enable swift and accurate responses, even in the face of unexpected environmental changes. In this study, we leverage cortico-motor phase synchronization as a window into the dynamics of sensorimotor loops and explore how it relates to online visuomotor control. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed an isometric tracking task that involved transient, unpredictable visual perturbations. Our results show that synchronization between cortical activity and motor output (force) in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) is associated with faster motor responses, while beta-band synchronization (18-30 Hz) promotes more accurate control, which is in turn linked to a higher likelihood of obtaining rewards. Both effects are most pronounced immediately before perturbation onset, underscoring the predictive value of cortico-motor phase synchronization for sensorimotor performance. Single-trial analyses further reveal that deviations from the preferred cortico-motor phase relationship are associated with longer reaction times and larger errors, and these phase effects are independent of power effects. Thus, beta-band synchronization may reflect a cautious, reward-oriented control strategy, while alpha-band synchronization enables quicker, though not necessarily efficient, motor responses, indicating a complementary, more reactive control mode. These results highlight the finely tuned nature of sensorimotor control, where different aspects of sensory-to-motor transformations are governed by frequency-specific neural synchronization on a moment-to-moment basis. By linking neural dynamics to motor output, this study sheds light on the spectrotemporal organization of sensorimotor networks and their distinct contribution to goal-directed behavior.

">Distinct molecular mechanisms of stress habituation in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress is a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, making the ability to adapt to repeated stress a crucial determinant of mental health. On a molecular level, it remains unclear whether repeated exposure to stress is characterized by habituation - a decreased responsiveness to the same stimulus - or by the emergence of new, adaptive responses. Here, we explore how the tightly regulated molecular response triggered by acute restraint stress becomes altered after repeated restraint exposure. Transcriptomic sampling of the mouse hippocampus at multiple time points revealed that repeated stress leads to widespread habituation, damping stress-induced gene expression of all stress-responsive genes. However, we find no evidence for the emergence of new response profiles or alterations in baseline gene expression. Using single-cell multi-omics, we show that these findings hold true across cell types, and we reveal cell type specific patterns of habituation. Transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles identify two distinct mechanisms that contribute to the observed habituation patterns: an early cAMP-associated mechanism that is related to blunted transcription after chronic stress, and a late corticosterone-dependent mechanism that is linked to a shortened transcriptional response. These extensive data are integrated, along with our previous work, into an interactive app, providing a uniquely detailed molecular resource that characterizes the acute stress response and the process of habituation across the genome.

">Functional stability and recurrent STDP in rhythmogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Synapses in the nervous system show considerable volatility, raising the question of how the brain maintains functional stability despite continuous synaptic motility. Previous studies have suggested that functionality may be maintained by an ongoing process of activity-dependent plasticity. Here, we address this question in the context of rhythmogenesis. Specifically, we investigated the hypothesis that rhythmic activity in the brain can develop and be stabilized via activity-dependent plasticity in the form of spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP), extending our previous work that demonstrated rhythmogenesis in a toy model of two effective neurons. We examined STDP dynamics in large recurrent networks in two stages. We first derived the effective dynamics of the order parameters of the synaptic connectivity. Then, a perturbative approach was applied to investigate stability. We show that for a wide range of parameters STDP can induce rhythmogenesis. Moreover, STDP can suppress synaptic fluctuations that disrupt functionality. Interestingly, STDP can channel fluctuations in the synaptic weights into a manifold on which the network activity is not affected, thus, maintaining functionality while allowing a subspace in which synaptic weights can be widely distributed.

">Growing Minds, Integrating Senses: Neural and Computational Insights into Age-related Changes in Audio-Visual and Tactile-Visual Learning in Children</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory processing and learning shape cognitive and language development, influencing how we perceive and interact with the world from an early age. While multisensory processes mature into adolescence, it remains poorly understood how age influences multisensory associative learning. This study investigated age-related effects on multisensory processing and learning during audio-visual and tactile-visual learning in 67 children (5.7-13 years) by integrating behavioural and neuroimaging data with computational methods. A reward-learning drift diffusion model revealed that older children processed information faster and made more efficient decisions on multisensory associations. These age-related increases coincided with higher activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control, multisensory integration, and memory retrieval, specifically during audio-visual learning. Notably, the anterior insula exhibited heightened activation in response to lower reward prediction errors, indicative of increased sensitivity to negative feedback with development. Finally, reward prediction errors and values modulated activation in reward processing and cognitive control regions, with this modulation remaining modality-independent and largely stable across age. In conclusion, while children employ similar learning strategies, older children make decisions more efficiently and engage neural resources more strongly. Our findings reflect ongoing maturation of neural networks supporting multisensory learning in middle childhood, enabling more adaptive learning in later childhood.

">Learning reorganizes dendritic and stabilizes axonal initial segment inhibitory synapses in CA1 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Structural synaptic plasticity underlies the changes in brain connectivity required for learning and memory. Inhibitory synapses (INS) target all subcellular domains of excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs), including dendrites, somata and axon initial segments (AIS). These subcellular domains have distinct molecular, structural and physiological profiles which underlie their functions. How structural plasticity of INS supports these functions as well as emerging properties such as memory is largely unknown. To tackle these questions we tracked INS on dendrites, somata and AIS of PNs in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area of mice over two weeks. Size and temporal dynamics of INS showed a strong compartmentalization and dendritic INS were less dynamic than dendritic spines. Trace fear conditioning led to reorganization of dendritic INS and to stabilization of AIS INS but had a minimal effect on dendritic spines. Finally, mathematical modelling allowed us to probe the mechanisms underlying stabilization of INS upon learning.

">Exploring brain dynamics within the Approach-Avoidance Bias</a></h4>

              
                Approach-avoidance behaviors (AAB) are fundamental mechanisms that guide interactions with the environment based on the emotional valence of stimuli. While previous research has extensively explored behavioral aspects of the AAB, the neural dynamics underlying these processes remain insufficiently understood. The present study employs electroencephalography (EEG) to systematically investigate the neural correlates of AAB in a non-clinical population, focusing on stimulus- and response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs). Forty-three participants performed a classic Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) while EEG activity was recorded. Behavioral results confirmed the AAB effect, with faster reaction times in congruent compared to incongruent trials, as well for positive versus negative trials. ERP analyses revealed significant differences in the Valence factor, with early effects for stimulus-locked trials and late differences at the parietal-occipital region for response-locked trials. However, no significant effects were found for the Condition factor, suggesting that the neural mechanisms differentiating congruent and incongruent responses might not be optimally captured through EEG. Additionally, frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) analyses showed no significant differences between conditions, aligning with the literature. These findings provide novel insights into the temporal and spatial characteristics of AAB-related neural activity, emphasizing the role of early visual processing and motor preparation in affect-driven decision-making. Future research should incorporate methodological approaches for assessing AAB in ecologically valid settings.

">Restoration of excitation/inhibition balance enhances neuronal signal-to-noise ratio and rescues social deficits in autism-associated Scn2a-deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Social behavior is critical for survival and adaptation, which is profoundly disrupted in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Social withdrawal due to information overload was often described in ASD, and it was suspected that increased basal noise, i.e., excessive background neuronal activities in the brain could be a disease mechanism. However, experimental test of this hypothesis is limited. Loss-of-function mutations (deficiency) in SCN2A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, have been revealed as a leading monogenic cause of profound ASD. Here, we revealed that Scn2a deficiency results in robust and multifaceted social impairments in mice. Scn2a-deficient neurons displayed an increased excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio, contributing to elevated basal neuronal noise and diminished signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during social interactions. Notably, the restoration of Scn2a expression in adulthood is able to rescue both SNR and social deficits. By balancing the E/I ratio and reducing basal neuronal firing, an FDA-approved GABAA receptor-positive allosteric modulator improves sociability in Scn2a-deficient mice and normalizes neuronal activities in translationally relevant human brain organoids carrying autism-associated SCN2A nonsense mutation. Collectively, our findings revealed a critical role of the NaV1.2 channel in the regulation of social behaviors, and identified molecular, cellular, and circuitry mechanisms underlying SCN2A-associated disorders.

">Precisely phase-locked acoustic stimuli globally enhance slow oscillations, but depress fast spindles</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Several studies have shown manipulation of slow oscillations (SO) and sigma power through auditory stimulation during sleep. Most of the evidence, however, regards effects immediately following stimulation rather than enduring effects. Moreover, effects on discrete fast and slow spindles have as yet not been assessed. Materials and Methods: Here we use a modeling-based approach to predict upcoming oscillatory activity in the EEG and precisely phase-lock subtle acoustic stimuli to the start of the SO positive deflection. We assess the effects of stimulation on discrete slow oscillations, fast and slow spindles in the seconds after stimulation and on the longer term. We relate our findings to observations at the level of spectral measures and stimulus evoked responses. Results: Our observations show that slow wave measures were consistently increased, as apparent in measures of discrete SO's, SO and delta power and deflections in the ERP. On the other hand, fast spindle measures showed a temporally localized increase during a stimulus-induced SO positive deflection around 1 second after stimulation, but were globally decreased, both on the short and long term. The latter was apparent in measures of discrete fast spindles and PSD across longer periods of sleep. Conclusions: Acoustic stimuli, precisely phase locked to the SO onset, increase SO's and delta power globally, therewith deepening sleep. On the other hand, fast sleep spindles are globally depressed. This appears to be due, in part, to interruption of ongoing spindles by the stimulus and may furthermore reflect a depressing influence of slow oscillations on fast spindle dynamics. Future studies could evaluate the therapeutic potential of sleep deepening with acoustic stimulation in clinical populations who suffer from reduced deep sleep, such as in insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder.

	<p>(1) Background: Working memory, which involves temporary storage, information processing, and regulating attention resources, is a fundamental cognitive process and constitutes a significant component of neuroscience research. This study aimed to evaluate brain activation patterns by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series data collected during a designed N-back working memory task with varying cognitive demands. (2) Methods: We utilized a novel transformer model, blood oxygen level-dependent transformer (BolT), to extract the activation level features of brain regions in the cognitive process, thereby obtaining the influence weights of regions of interest (ROIs) on the corresponding tasks. (3) Results: Compared with previous studies, our work reached similar conclusions in major brain region performance and provides a more precise analysis for identifying brain activation patterns. For each type of working memory task, we selected the top 5 percent of the most influential ROIs and conducted a comprehensive analysis and discussion. Additionally, we explored the effect of prior knowledge conditions on the performance of different tasks in the same period and the same tasks at different times. (4) Conclusions: The comparison results reflect the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s adaptive strategies and dependencies in coping with different levels of cognitive demands and the stability optimization of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive processing. This study introduces innovative methodologies for understanding brain function and cognitive processes, highlighting the potential of transformer in cognitive neuroscience. Its findings offer new insights into brain activity patterns associated with working memory, contributing to the broader landscape of neuroscience research.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bruxism and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are common conditions of the stomatognathic system. Some studies suggest a potential link with traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is gaining increasing interest among researchers. The aim of this scoping review is to map the available evidence on the association between TBI and bruxism or TBI and TMDs. Methods: The review was conducted by analyzing four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration database. A total of 340 studies were reviewed in this work, and 4 studies examining the connections between TBI were included in the analysis (with n = 3 focusing on the association between bruxism and TBI, and n = 1 on the association between TMDs and TBI). Results: Analyzing the publications on bruxism and TMDs in relation to TBI, at this stage it can be concluded that there is no solid evidence confirming the impact of TBI on the studied conditions. This is due to the quantity and quality of the collected evidence. Conclusions: In light of the presented review, it must be concluded that the quantity and quality of the evidence are insufficient to assert that TBI is a factor in the onset of bruxism or TMDs. Further research on this phenomenon is recommended, particularly focusing on the effects of different severities of TBI and various regions of brain injury.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Impaired balance leads to loss of function, e.g., the inability to walk safely. Therefore, restoring balance is a common goal of rehabilitation after a stroke. An innovative motor imaging and robotic device, the Erigo&amp;amp;reg;Pro walking table, was used to improve balance in patients who had suffered an acute stroke. Materials and Methods: Sixty-six stroke patients in the acute phase with an average age of 64.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.62 years were randomly assigned to one of three groups (22 subjects each) and treated with different therapies (conventional, conventional with Erigo&amp;amp;reg;Pro, and conventional with Erigo&amp;amp;reg;Pro enriched with motor imaging). The duration of therapy was two weeks. Patients were assessed before and after completion of therapy. The study used the trunk stability test and the Berg Balance Scale to assess balance, and the Riablo&amp;amp;trade; device to measure static balance. In addition, an assessment of the superficial tension of the transversus abdominis and multifidus muscles was performed. The clinical trial registration URL unique identifier was NCT06276075. Results: In each of the groups studied, the therapies applied resulted in significant improvement in functional assessment of trunk stability and balance (TCT &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 and BBS &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The assessment of balance in the frontal (p = 0.023) and sagittal (p = 0.074) planes with the Riablo&amp;amp;trade; device confirmed the superiority of motor imaging-enhanced therapy at the level of a statistical trend. The tension of the transversus abdominis was higher at the second measurement (M = 14.41; SE = 3.31). Conclusions: Motor imagery-enhanced therapy is most important, both for trunk stability and functional improvement of body balance parameters and for increasing transversus abdominis muscle tension.</p>

	<p>Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often demonstrate both cognitive and physical dysfunctions, particularly with greater age and lower physical activity levels, and there is evidence of a relationship between these outcomes (i.e., cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling) in MS. To date, little is known about cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling when controlling for chronological age and levels of physical activity. Objectives: We examined cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling in people with MS while accounting for chronological age and physical activity. Methods: The sample included 290 people with MS between the ages of 22 and 77 years. Participants underwent the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) for cognitive processing speed and the California Verbal Learning and Memory Test&amp;amp;ndash;Second Edition (CVLT-II) for verbal learning and memory. Participants completed the 6-Minute Walk and the Timed 25-Foot Walk tests for walking endurance and speed, respectively. Participants wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: The bivariate correlation analyses indicated that cognitive function had moderate-to-strong associations with motor function (range of rs between 0.433 and 0.459). The linear regression analyses indicated cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling between SDMT and motor function (with a range of &amp;amp;beta; between 0.139 and 0.145) when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. The regression analyses further indicated that the CVLT-II was associated with motor function (with a range of &amp;amp;beta; between 0.125 and 0.135) when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. When age and MVPA were entered into the regression analyses, SDMT was still associated with the motor function of individuals (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.119), and CVLT-II was still associated with the motor function of individuals (with a range of &amp;amp;beta; between 0.115 and 0.124). Conclusions: Cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling is present in people with MS independent of chronological age and levels of physical activity. This warrants further investigation of the underlying mechanism and potential approaches for the management of co-occurring MS-related dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Facial paralysis is characterized by an injury to the facial nerve, causing the loss of the functions of the structures that it innervates, as well as changes in the motor cortex. Current models have some limitations for the study of facial paralysis, such as movement restriction, the absence of studying awake animals in behavioral contexts, and the lack of a model that fully evaluates facial movements. The development of an algorithm capable of automatically inferring facial paralysis and overcoming the existing limitations is proposed in this work. In C57/BL6J mice, we produced both irreversible and reversible facial paralysis. Video recordings were made of the faces of paralyzed mice to develop an algorithm for detecting facial paralysis applied to mice, which allows us to predict the presence of reversible and irreversible facial paralysis automatically. At the same time, the algorithm was used to track facial movement during gustatory stimulation and extracellular electrophysiological recordings in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). In the basal state, mice can make facial expressions, whereas the algorithm can detect this movement. Simultaneously, such movement is correlated with the activation in the ALM. In the presence of facial paralysis, the algorithm cannot detect movement. Furthermore, it predicts that the condition exists, and the neuronal activity in the cortex is affected with respect to the evolution of facial paralysis. This way, we conclude that the facial paralysis algorithm applied to mice allows for inferring the presence of experimental facial paralysis and its neuronal correlates for further studies.</p>
