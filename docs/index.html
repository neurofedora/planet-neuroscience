	<p>Background: Anticholinergic adverse effects pose a relevant threat to patients, in particular elderly and cognitively impaired patients. Patients with Parkinsonian syndromes are especially at risk from anticholinergic adverse effects due to the often-required complex drug therapy. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of the anticholinergic burden on motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Methods: This cross-sectional, monocentric retrospective data analysis included 151 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), 63 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 36 with multiple system atrophy (MSA). The anticholinergic burden of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; medications was determined using two established scores: the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS) and the German Anticholinergic Burden Scale (GABS). These scores were compared between the different diseases and correlated with several disease-specific scores. Results: Anticholinergic burden was higher in patients with PD, in particular, compared to PSP. In the PD group, anticholinergic burden showed a weak correlation with almost all analyzed clinical scores and the number of administered drugs. The UMSARS I and II showed a significant correlation with the anticholinergic burden in MSA patients. In general, the GABS-measured anticholinergic burden was significantly higher compared to the ADS-measured. Conclusions: The calculated anticholinergic burden affected motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with various Parkinsonian syndromes poorly. Since the GABS also contains basic anti-parkinsonian drugs, this score tended to overestimate the anticholinergic burden in patients with Parkinsonian syndromes and, therefore, seemed less appropriate for this application.</p>

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex condition that can resolve over time but all too often leads to persistent symptoms, and the risk of poor patient outcomes increases with aging. TBI damages neurons and long axons within white matter tracts that are critical for communication between brain regions; this causes slowed information processing and neuronal circuit dysfunction. This review focuses on white matter injury after TBI and the multifactorial processes that underlie white matter damage, potential for recovery, and progression of degeneration. A multiscale perspective across clinical and preclinical advances is presented to encourage interdisciplinary insights from whole-brain neuroimaging of white matter tracts down to cellular and molecular responses of axons, myelin, and glial cells within white matter tissue.

">Neural Mechanism Underlying Successful Classification of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Multi-Sensory-Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The diagnosis, prognosis, and management of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) remains challenging. Early detection of aMCI is crucial for timely interventions. Method This study combines scalp recordings of auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli with a flexible and interpretable support vector machine classification pipeline to differentiate individuals diagnosed with aMCI from healthy controls. Results Event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional connectivity (FC) matrices from each modality successfully predicted aMCI. We got optimal classification accuracy (96.1%), sensitivity (97.7%) and specificity (94.3%) when combining information from all sensory conditions than when using information from a single modality. Reduced ERP amplitude, higher FC in frontal region which predicted worse cognitive performance, and lower FC in posterior regions from delta to alpha frequency in aMCI contributed to classification. Conclusions The results highlight the clinical potential of sensory-evoked potentials in detecting aMCI, with optimal classification using both amplitude and oscillatory-based FC measures from multiple modalities.

">The inattentional rhythm in audition</a></h4>

              
                The detection of temporally unpredictable visual targets depends on the preceding phase of alpha oscillations (~7-12 Hz). In audition, however, such an effect seemed to be absent. Due to the transient nature of its input, the auditory system might be particularly vulnerable to information loss that occurs if relevant information coincides with the low excitability phase of the oscillation. We therefore hypothesised that effects of oscillatory phase in audition will be restored if auditory events are made task-irrelevant and information loss can be tolerated. To this end, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 29 human participants (21F) while they detected pure tones at one sound frequency and ignored others. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that the neural response to task-irrelevant but not to task-relevant tones depends on the pre-stimulus phase of neural oscillations. Alpha oscillations modulated early stages of stimulus processing, whereas theta oscillations (~3-7 Hz) affected later components, possibly related to distractor inhibition. We also found evidence that alpha oscillations alternate between sound frequencies during divided attention. Together, our results suggest that the efficacy of auditory oscillations depends on the context they operate in, and demonstrate how they can be employed in a system that heavily relies on information unfolding over time.

">Type I TARPs regulate Kv7.2 potassium channels andsusceptibility to seizures</a></h4>

              
                The M-current is a low-threshold potassium current that modulates neuronal excitability and suppresses repetitive firing. However, the mechanisms regulating M-channel function remain unclear. We identified type I Transmembrane AMPA receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs) as M-channel Kv7.2 subunit interactors in cortical neurons, with their interaction increasing upon neuronal depolarization. Co-expression of TARPs with Kv7.2 increased channel surface expression and Kv7.2 mediated currents, while disrupting TARP-{gamma}2 expression in neurons perturbed dendritic Kv7.2 nano clusters and decreased M-currents. Knock-in mice with an intellectual disability-associated TARP-{gamma}2 variant showed reduced hippocampal M-currents and increased seizure susceptibility, indicating that disrupting TARP-{gamma}2 regulation of Kv7.2-M-channels is epileptogenic. These findings show that TARP-{gamma}2, a synaptic protein crucial for excitatory transmission, also controls intrinsic excitability via M-channels. This discovery provides a link between synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, with implications for disease, as the interplay between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity is pivotal to how the brain adapts to varying input signals.

">Correlation and Matching Representations of Binocular Disparity across the Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Seeing three-dimensional objects requires multiple stages of representational transformation, beginning in the primary visual cortex (V1). Here, neurons compute binocular disparity from the left and right retinal inputs through a mechanism similar to local cross-correlation. However, correlation-based representation is ambiguous because it is sensitive to disparities in both similar and dissimilar features between the eyes. Along the visual pathways, the representation transforms to a cross-matching basis, eliminating responses to falsely matched disparities. We investigated this transformation across the human visual areas using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. By fitting a linear weighted sum of cross-correlation and cross-matching model representations to the brain's representational structure of disparity, we found that areas V1-V3 exhibited stronger cross-correlation components, V3A/B, V7, and hV4 were slightly inclined towards cross-matching, and hMT+ was strongly engaged in cross-matching. To explore the underlying mechanism, we identified a deep neural network optimized for estimating disparity in natural scenes that matched human depth judgment in the random-dot stereograms used in the fMRI experiments. Despite not being constrained to match fMRI data, the network units' responses progressed from cross-correlation to cross-matching across layers. Activation maximization analysis on the network suggests that the transformation incorporates three phases, each emphasizing different aspects of binocular similarity and dissimilarity for depth extraction. Our findings suggest a systematic distribution of both components throughout the visual cortex, with cross-matching playing a greater role in areas anterior to V3, and that the transformation exploits responses to false matches rather than discarding them.

">Spatial transcriptomic data reveals pure cell types via the mosaic hypothesis</a></h4>

              
                Neurons display remarkable diversity in their anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties. Although observed stereotypy in subsets of neurons is a pillar of neuroscience, clustering in high-dimensional feature spaces, such as those defined by single cell RNA-seq data, is often inconclusive and cells seemingly occupy continuous, rather than discrete, regions. In the retina, a layered structure, neurons of the same discrete type avoid spatial proximity with each other. While this principle, which is independent of clustering in feature space, has been a gold standard for retinal cell types, its applicability to the cortex has been only sparsely explored. Here, we provide evidence for such a mosaic hypothesis by developing a statistical point process analysis framework for spatial transcriptomic data. We demonstrate spatial avoidance across many excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types. Spatial avoidance disappears when cell types are merged, potentially offering a gold standard metric for evaluating the purity of putative cell types.

">Lipidomic and Proteomic Insights from Extracellular Vesicles in Postmortem Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Reveal Substance Use Disorder-Induced Brain Changes</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorder (SUD) significantly increases the risk of neurotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired neuroplasticity. The activation of inflammatory pathways by substances may lead to glial activation and chronic neuroinflammation, potentially mediated by the release of extracellular particles (EPs), such as extracellular condensates (ECs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). These particles, which reflect the physiological, pathophysiological, and metabolic states of their cells of origin, might carry molecular signatures indicative of SUD. In particular, our study investigated neuroinflammatory signatures in SUD by isolating EVs from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) Brodmann's area 9 (BA9) in postmortem subjects. We isolated BA9-derived EVs from postmortem brain tissues of eight individuals (controls: n=4, SUD: n=4). The EVs were analyzed for physical properties (concentration, size, zeta potential, morphology) and subjected to integrative multi-omics analysis to profile the lipidomic and proteomic characteristics. We assessed the interactions and bioactivity of EVs by evaluating their uptake by glial cells. We further assessed the effects of EVs on complement mRNA expression in glial cells as well as their effects on microglial migration. No significant differences in EV concentration, size, zeta potential, or surface markers were observed between SUD and control groups. However, lipidomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of glycerophosphoinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) in SUD EVs. Proteomic analysis indicates downregulation of SERPINB12, ACYP2, CAMK1D, DSC1, and FLNB, and upregulation of C4A, C3, and ALB in SUD EVs. Gene ontology and protein-protein interactome analyses highlight functions such as cell motility, focal adhesion, and acute phase response signaling that is associated with the identified proteins. Both control and SUD EVs increased C3 and C4 mRNA expression in microglia, but only SUD EVs upregulated these genes in astrocytes. SUD EVs also significantly enhanced microglial migration in a wound healing assay.This study successfully isolated EVs from postmortem brains and used a multi-omics approach to identify EV-associated lipids and proteins in SUD. Elevated C3 and C4 in SUD EVs and the distinct effects of EVs on glial cells suggest a crucial role in acute phase response signaling and neuroinflammation.

">A qMRI approach for mapping microscopic water populations and tissue relaxivity in the in vivo human brain.</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) enables non-invasive mapping of brain tissue microstructure and is widely used for monitoring various physiological and pathological brain processes. Here, we introduce a qMRI approach for enriching the microstructural characterization of the sub-voxel environment. Inspired by pioneering magnetization transfer (MT) models, this approach employs MT saturation to differentiate between various water populations within each voxel. Our in vivo results align well with theoretical predictions and are reproducible using standard qMRI protocols. We present an array of new quantitative maps, highlighting different aspects of the tissue's water. Furthermore, by manipulating the effective water content and relaxation rate with MT, we approximate within the voxel the tissue relaxivity. This property reflects the dependency of R1 on the macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) and is associated with the lipid and macromolecular composition of the brain. Our approach also enables biophysically-informed modulation of the R1 contrast, resulting in a set of unique cortical profiles. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in imaging the common pathology of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), revealing tissue degradation and molecular alterations.

">Sleep defined by arousal threshold reveals decreases in corticocortical functional correlations independently from the conventional sleep stages</a></h4>

              
                Sleep research and sleep medicine have benefited from the use of polysomnography but have also suffered from an overreliance on the conventional, polysomnography-defined sleep stages. For example, reports of sleep-specific brain activity patterns have, with few exceptions, been constrained by assessing brain function as it relates to the conventional sleep stages. This limits the variety of sleep states and underlying activity patterns that one can discover. If undiscovered brain activity patterns exist during sleep, then removing the constraint of a stage-specific analysis may uncover them. The current study used all-night functional magnetic resonance imaging sleep data and defined sleep behaviorally with auditory arousal threshold (AAT) to begin to search for new brain states. It was hypothesized that, during sleep compared to wakefulness, corticocortical functional correlations would decrease. Functional correlation values calculated in a window immediately before the determination of AAT were entered into a linear mixed effects model, allowing multiple arousals across the night per subject into the analysis. The hypothesis was supported using both correlation matrices of brain networks and single seed-region analyses showing whole-brain maps. This represents a novel approach to studying the neuroanatomical correlates of sleep with high spatial resolution by defining sleep in a way that was independent from the conventional sleep stages. This work provides initial evidence to justify searching for sleep stages that are more neuroanatomically localized and unrelated to the conventional sleep stages.

	<p>Suicidality in adolescents has been associated with emotional distress, stressful life events, relationship issues, and nightmares to name a few. This study explored the actual dream content and the mood at pre-sleep, during a reported dream, and in the morning in 33 adolescents admitted to the hospital on account of a suicide attempt. In all aspects, hospitalized adolescents were compared to 33 matched adolescents who had followed the same protocol. In accordance with the Continuity and the Threat Simulation theories of dream formation, it was hypothesized that the waking-life experiences of suicidal adolescents would transpire in both dream mood and content as well as in the frequency of nightmares. Dreams were analyzed by independent judges using traditional dream content scales, including for the presence of negative and destructive themes and types of interpersonal relationships. As predicted, more suicidal adolescents experienced frequent nightmares, which was significant. A higher negative mood at pre-sleep, within dreams, and at post-sleep was also observed. Furthermore, their dreams contained a higher prevalence of destructive themes and failures, as well as self-directed and death-resulting aggressions. Regression analyses indicated that morning mood was most accurately predicted by positive and negative dream mood in the normative adolescents, whereas only negative dream mood appeared to predict subsequent waking affect in suicidal participants. Our results underline the valuable potential of implementing nightmare-reducing therapies in the presence of suicidal adolescents who suffer from frequent nightmares.</p>

	<p>Mental fatigue is a variation in the psychophysiological state that subjects encounter during or after prolonged cognitive activity periods, affecting top-down attention and cognitive control. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mental fatigue on attention in the context of the three attention networks according to the Posnerian model (alerting, orienting, and executive networks) by combining the Attentional Network Test (ANT) and event-related potentials technique. Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. A continuous arithmetic task lasting one hour induced mental fatigue, and EEG recordings were conducted before and after the task while subjects were performing the ANT. The efficiencies of three networks were comparable between groups, while RTs shortened only in the control group and the accuracy related to the alerting and conflict networks declined only after mental effort. Mental fatigue reduced N1 amplitude during alerting network engagement and p3 amplitude during orienting. It also reduced N2 and P3 amplitude during the conflict, particularly the incongruent target-locked response. These findings underscore the covert effects of mental fatigue on attention, suggesting that even in healthy young subjects, compensatory mechanisms may maintain adequate overt performances, but fatigue still has a detrimental effect on top-down attentional mechanisms.</p>

	<p>The presence of artificial light at night has emerged as an anthropogenic stressor in recent years. Various sources of light pollution have been shown to affect circadian physiology with serious consequences for metabolic pathways, possibly disrupting pineal melatonin production with multiple adverse health effects. The suppression of melatonin at night may also affect human mental health and contribute to the development or exacerbation of psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals. Due to the high burden of circadian disruption in affective disorders, it has been hypothesized that light pollution impacts mental health, mainly affecting mood regulation. Hence, the aim of this review was to critically summarize the evidence on the effects of light pollution on mood symptoms, with a particular focus on the role of circadian rhythms in mediating this relationship. We conducted a narrative review of the literature in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science datasets. After the screening process, eighteen papers were eligible for inclusion. The results clearly indicate a link between light pollution and the development of affective symptoms, with a central role of sleep disturbances in the emergence of mood alterations. Risk perception also represents a crucial topic, possibly modulating the development of affective symptoms in response to light pollution. The results of this review should encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the design of healthier environments, including lighting conditions among the key determinants of human mental health.</p>

                <p>The electrophysiological response to rewards recorded during laboratory tasks has been well documented, yet little is known about the neural response patterns in a more naturalistic setting. Here, we combined a mobile-EEG system with an augmented reality headset to record event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants engaged in a naturalistic operant task to find rewards. Twenty-five participants were asked to navigate toward a west or east goal location marked by floating orbs, and once participants reached the goal location, the orb would then signify a reward (5 cents) or no-reward (0 cents) outcome. Following the outcome, participants returned to a start location marked by floating purple rings, and once standing in the middle, a 3 s counter signaled the next trial, for a total of 200 trials. Consistent with previous research, reward feedback evoked the reward positivity, an ERP component believed to index the sensitivity of the anterior cingulate cortex to reward prediction error signals. The reward positivity peaked ~230 ms with a maximal at channel FCz (M = &ndash;0.695 &mu;V, &plusmn;0.23) and was significantly different than zero (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.01). Participants took ~3.38 s to reach the goal location and exhibited a general lose-shift (68.3% &plusmn;3.5) response strategy and posterror slowing. Overall, these novel findings provide support for the idea that combining mobile-EEG with augmented reality technology is a feasible solution to enhance the ecological validity of human electrophysiological studies of goal-directed behavior and a step toward a new era of human cognitive neuroscience research that blurs the line between laboratory and reality.</p>

                Background We propose the creation of a journal transparency tool (JTT), which will allow users to obtain information about a given scholarly journal’s operations and policies. We are obtaining preferences from different stakeholders to inform the development of this tool. This study aimed to identify the publishing community’s preferences for the JTT. Methods We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey. Representatives from publishing houses and journal publishers were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling. The first two Delphi rounds involved an online survey with items about JTT metrics and user features. During the third round, participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 within a virtual consensus meeting. We defined consensus as 80% agreement to include or exclude an item in the JTT. Results Eighty-six participants completed the round 1 survey, and 43 participants (50% of round 1) completed the round 2 survey. In both rounds, respondents voted on JTT user feature and JTT metric item preferences and answered open-ended survey questions regarding the JTT. In round 3, a total of 21 participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 during an online consensus group meeting. Fifteen out of 30 JTT metric items and none of the four JTT user feature items reached the 80% consensus threshold after all rounds of voting. Analysis of the round 3 online consensus group transcript resulted in two themes: ‘factors impacting support for JTT metrics’ and ‘suggestions for user clarity.’ Conclusions Participants suggested that the publishing community’s primary concerns for a JTT are to ensure that the tool is relevant, user-friendly, accessible, and equitable. The outcomes of this research will contribute to developing and refining the tool in accordance with publishing preferences.

Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to recall and enter the age at which they attained menarche. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Questionnaire (GAD-7) to measure the severity of their present anxiety symptoms. Results The results showed a significant increase in anxiety symptoms in participants who had early menarche compared to those who did not have early menarche. The mean score on the GAD-7 Questionnaire for the cases was 9.93 and the control group was 6.89. The GAD-7 scores among the cases group were significantly higher in the GAD-7 scores than in the control group. Conclusions This study concluded that early menarche is associated with higher anxiety levels in young adults.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-281/v2?src=rss">Osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of graphene oxide nano coated dental implants: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Osseointegration stands as a pivotal concept within the realm of dental implants, signifying the intricate process through which a dental implant integrates with the adjoining bone tissue. Graphene oxide (GO) has been shown to promote osseointegration, the process by which the implant fuses with the surrounding bone. The objective of this study was to assess the osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of GO nano coated dental implants. Methods A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) to identify relevant studies published. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that evaluated the effects of GO nano coating on osseointegrative and antimicrobial characteristics of dental implants. Studies not written in English and published before 2012 were excluded. Results The initial search yielded a total of 127 potential studies, of which six met the inclusion criteria and five were included in the review. These studies provided data on GO nano coated dental implants and their osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties. All the included studies showed moderate risk of bias. None of the studies provided information related to sample size calculation or sampling technique. Discussion The findings from the included studies demonstrated that GO nano coating had a positive impact on osseointegrative properties of dental implants. Enhanced bone-implant contact and increased bone density were observed in animals and humans receiving GO nano coated implants. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of GO nano coating were found to inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on the implant surface, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. Conclusion The findings indicate that GO nano coating holds promise in enhancing the success rate and longevity of dental implants. However, more studies with larger sample sizes, are needed to further strengthen the evidence and determine the long-term effects of GO nano coated dental implants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1364/v3?src=rss">Factors contributing to online child sexual abuse in Bangladesh: A qualitative inquiry [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Children globally, including in Bangladesh, are facing various forms of online sexual abuse including sextortion, exploitation, body shaming, and blackmail. They are also coerced into engaging in intimate activities, harassed through the sending of sexual content, among other forms of abuse. We aimed to explore the root cause of online child sexual abuse (OCSA) in Bangladesh. Methods This qualitative research design utilized in-depth interviews (IDIs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) between February and April 2022. The study sample comprised 21 school-going children aged 13−17 years, selected from two different geographical settings (10 from rural areas and 11 from urban areas) in Bangladesh using purposive sampling techniques. They participated in in-depth interviews (IDIs) while additional data was obtained through key informant interviews (KIIs) with 11 multidisciplinary stakeholders. Results Children from both rural and urban areas reported facing abuse in various ways, such as being asked to send naked photos, being invited to be naked in video calls, and being invited to have virtual sex, among others, over the internet. Conclusions The government should consider integrating OCSA education into secondary levels. Additionally, there should be efforts to ensure a safe online environment through content scrutiny, promotion of outdoor activities, and community campaigns. An anonymous reporting system must be implemented, and strict measures under the Children's Act must be enforced against perpetrators. Further intervention studies are needed to ensure effective child protection measures in Bangladesh.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-514/v4?src=rss">Comparative evaluation of the effect of 2% graphene oxide and 5% hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in isolation and in combination on micro tensile bond strength of 5th generation adhesive [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and stiffest imaginable material. The biocompatible property of graphene oxide can initiate and facilitate cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of periodontal ligament, osteogenic, and oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, the antibiofilm and anti-adhesion properties of graphene oxide in the prevention of dental biofilm infections, dental caries, and dental erosion as well as for implant surface modification and as an anti-quorum sensing agent. Composites are the most often utilized materials for restoration in the field of dentistry due to adhesive resins' improved mechanical and cosmetic properties. To safeguard the dentin and prevent dental cavities, dentin adhesives are utilized to affix hydrophobic resin composites to hydrophilic dentin tissue. Materials and Method Dental adhesives have a harder time adhering to dentin because it contains more water and is less mineralized than enamel. This makes the method more sensitive. Result As a result, it was chosen to assess and contrast the impact of 5% Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and 2% Graphene oxide nanoparticles, both separately and together, on the Micro tensile bond strength of 5th generation adhesive. Conclusion Graphene oxide is the most versatile form of Graphite in structural and functional configuration. Graphene oxide possesses extraordinary physical, chemical, optical, electrical and mechanical properties. Among the graphene family nanomaterials, the reduced form of Graphite adding the oxygenated functional group to the structure increases the surface area and therefore exhibits enviable excellent interaction ability with metal and ions as well as organic species. Graphene oxide in dentistry has provided outstanding results in antimicrobial action, regenerative dentistry, bone tissue engineering, drug delivery, physicochemical properties, enhancement of dental biomaterials and oral cancer treatment.

                Background Pain is a complication in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). There are several mechanisms underlying pain in people with thalassemia and low hemoglobin at the end of the transfusion cycle was the most etiology. Pain can develop into chronic pain and interfere with the quality of life. The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) can help identify pain in people with TDT. The present study aimed to compare pain before and after transfusion in adult TDT patients. Methods It was an analytical observational study using a cross-sectional design on adult TDT patients with pain who came to the Haemato-Oncology Clinic of Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung. This study was conducted from December 2020 to July 2021. All subjects were assisted in filling out the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF questionnaire hemoglobin levels were examined and before and after transfusion, then paired test analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon Test. Results This study is conducted on 60 adult TDT patients with symptoms of pain. The median value of pain intensity and pain interferes with life obtained from the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF score after transfusion decreased significantly compared to before transfusion (NRS 5 vs. 0 and 2.8 vs. 0; p=0.0001). Conclusion There is a significant difference in pain intensity and pain interfere with life in adults with TDT before and after transfusion. It is necessary to carry out pain assessments for thalassemia patients.

                Background Microbial communities are mainly composed of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi, and are present in the gut, mouth, nose, skin, lungs, vagina, and bladder, among other places. In recent years, research has highlighted the critical role that these highly complex communities play in health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have resulted in the development of high-dimensional data, which are challenging to effectively analyze and visualize. In this context, traditional stacked bar-plot visualizations, while widely used, fall short of conveying the fundamental phylogenic relationships between community members and are thus difficult to interpret. Methods StackbarExtended is implemented in native R, required version (≥ 4.0), and is platform independent, with its source code available on GitHub and archived on Zenodo. Results StackbarExtended allows for the plotting of relative abundance at user-defined taxonomic levels while displaying phylogenetic information using color gradients. Additionally, StackbarExtended integrates differential abundance statistics directly into the visualization process and performs clustering of low-abundance taxa. Conclusions StackbarExtended offers researchers a user-friendly tool for rapid visualization, presentation, and analysis of the microbiota composition.

                <p>by Simon Syga, Harish P. Jain, Marcus Krellner, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Andreas Deutsch</p>

Cancer is a significant global health issue, with treatment challenges arising from intratumor heterogeneity. This heterogeneity stems mainly from somatic evolution, causing genetic diversity within the tumor, and phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells leading to reversible phenotypic changes. However, the interplay of both factors has not been rigorously investigated. Here, we examine the complex relationship between somatic evolution and phenotypic plasticity, explicitly focusing on the interplay between cell migration and proliferation. This type of phenotypic plasticity is essential in glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain tumor. We propose that somatic evolution alters the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in tumor cells, specifically the reaction to changes in the microenvironment. We study this hypothesis using a novel, spatially explicit model that tracks individual cells’ phenotypic and genetic states. We assume cells change between migratory and proliferative states controlled by inherited and mutation-driven genotypes and the cells’ microenvironment. We observe that cells at the tumor edge evolve to favor migration over proliferation and vice versa in the tumor bulk. Notably, different genetic configurations can result in this pattern of phenotypic heterogeneity. We analytically predict the outcome of the evolutionary process, showing that it depends on the tumor microenvironment. Synthetic tumors display varying levels of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which we show are predictors of tumor recurrence time after treatment. Interestingly, higher phenotypic heterogeneity predicts poor treatment outcomes, unlike genetic heterogeneity. Our research offers a novel explanation for heterogeneous patterns of tumor recurrence in glioblastoma patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-913/v1?src=rss">The Nexus of Climate Change, Food Insecurity, and Conflict in Somalia: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multifaceted Challenges and Resilience Strategies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Climate change poses a significant threat to Somalia’s food security and stability. This review examines the complex interplay between climate change impacts, food insecurity, and conflict in Somalia. Recent climate data and forecasts paint a concerning picture: the rainfall probabilistic forecast for April- June 2024 indicates a high likelihood of above-normal rainfall across much of Somalia, thus increasing the flood risks. Concurrently, temperature forecasts project above-normal temperatures, potentially exacerbating drought conditions between the rainy seasons. Historical climatology data reveal Somalia’s vulnerability, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C and significant seasonal variations affecting agriculture and water resources. These climate trends, combined with ongoing political instability and weak governance, have created a storm of challenges. This perspective explores how recurrent droughts and floods disrupt agricultural production, decimate livestock, and displace vulnerable populations, particularly those affecting rural and nomadic communities. It also examines how environmental stress exacerbates poverty and conflict, thereby creating a vicious cycle of vulnerability. This analysis draws on recent data on poverty rates, food expenditure patterns, and climate-related displacement, to illustrate the multifaceted nature of the crisis. Finally, this perspective proposed recommendations for building climate resilience, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainable development in Somalia, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that combine immediate humanitarian assistance with long-term adaptation strategies.

                Marked dysregulation of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) characterises a variety of anxiety disorders, and its amelioration is a key feature of treatment success. Overall treatment response, however, is highly variable, and about a third of patients are resistant to treatment. In this review we hypothesise that a major contributor to this variation in treatment response are the multiple faces of anxiety induced by distinct forms of frontal cortex dysregulation. Comparison of findings from humans and non-human primates reveals marked similarity in the functional organisation of threat regulation across the frontal lobes. This organisation is discussed in relation to the ‘predatory imminence continuum’ model of threat and the differential engagement of executive functions at the core of both emotion generation and regulation strategies.

                Huber et al. demonstrate that gain-of-function and loss-of-expression TP53 mutations drive gastric disease progression to aggressive carcinomas with synchronous metastasis. While STAT3 signaling remains rate limiting throughout gastric cancer progression, its cytokine dependency switches from IL-11 to IL-6 in response to the TP53 mutations observed during the transition to carcinomas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94573">The transcriptional landscape underlying larval development and metamorphosis in the Malabar grouper (Epinephelus malabaricus)</a></h4>

              
                Most teleost fishes exhibit a biphasic life history with a larval oceanic phase that is transformed into morphologically and physiologically different demersal, benthic, or pelagic juveniles. This process of transformation is characterized by a myriad of hormone-induced changes, during the often abrupt transition between larval and juvenile phases called metamorphosis. Thyroid hormones (TH) are known to be instrumental in triggering and coordinating this transformation but other hormonal systems such as corticoids, might be also involved as it is the case in amphibians. In order to investigate the potential involvement of these two hormonal pathways in marine fish post-embryonic development, we used the Malabar grouper (<i>Epinephelus malabaricus</i>) as a model system. We assembled a chromosome-scale genome sequence and conducted a transcriptomic analysis of nine larval developmental stages. We studied the expression patterns of genes involved in TH and corticoid pathways, as well as four biological processes known to be regulated by TH in other teleost species: ossification, pigmentation, visual perception, and metabolism. Surprisingly, we observed an activation of many of the same pathways involved in metamorphosis also at an early stage of the larval development, suggesting an additional implication of these pathways in the formation of early larval features. Overall, our data brings new evidence to the controversial interplay between corticoids and thyroid hormones during metamorphosis as well as, surprisingly, during the early larval development. Further experiments will be needed to investigate the precise role of both pathways during these two distinct periods and whether an early activation of both corticoid and TH pathways occurs in other teleost species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86181">Combining mutation and recombination statistics to infer clonal families in antibody repertoires</a></h4>

              
                B-cell repertoires are characterized by a diverse set of receptors of distinct specificities generated through two processes of somatic diversification: V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutations. B cell clonal families stem from the same V(D)J recombination event, but differ in their hypermutations. Clonal families identification is key to understanding B-cell repertoire function, evolution and dynamics. We present HILARy (High-precision Inference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise method to identify clonal families from single- or paired-chain repertoire sequencing datasets. HILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and selection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently high inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of shared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high sensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties such as the site frequency spectrum and &#x1D451;&#x1D441;∕&#x1D451;&#x1D446; ratio do not depend on the junction length. We also identify a broad range of selection pressures spanning two orders of magnitude.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88675">Circulating small extracellular vesicle RNA profiling for the detection of T1a stage colorectal cancer and precancerous advanced adenoma</a></h4>

              
                It takes more than 20 years for normal colorectal mucosa to develop into metastatic carcinoma. The long time window provides a golden opportunity for early detection to terminate the malignant progression. Here, we aim to enable liquid biopsy of T1a stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous advanced adenoma (AA) by profiling circulating small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-derived RNAs. We exhibited a full RNA landscape for the circulating sEVs isolated from 60 participants. A total of 58,333 annotated RNAs were detected from plasma sEVs, among which 1,615 and 888 sEV-RNAs were found differentially expressed in plasma from T1a stage CRC and AA compared to normal controls (NC). Then we further categorized these sEV-RNAs into six modules by a weighted gene coexpression network analysis and constructed a 60-gene t-SNE model consisting of the top 10 RNAs of each module that could well distinguish T1a stage CRC/AA from NC samples. Some sEV-RNAs were also identified as indicators of specific endoscopic and morphological features of different colorectal lesions. The top-ranked biomarkers were further verified by RT-qPCR, proving that these candidate sEV-RNAs successfully identified T1a stage CRC/AA from NC in another cohort of 124 participants. Finally, we adopted different algorithms to improve the performance of RT-qPCR-based models and successfully constructed an optimized classifier with 79.3% specificity and 99.0% sensitivity. In conclusion, circulating sEVs of T1a stage CRC and AA patients have distinct RNA profiles, which successfully enable the detection of both T1a stage CRC and AA via liquid biopsy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96523">Endocannabinoids and their receptors modulate endometriosis pathogenesis and immune response</a></h4>

              
                Endometriosis (EM), characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility in females of reproductive age. Despite its high prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying EM pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to influence several cardinal features of this complex disease including pain, vascularization, and overall lesion survival, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Utilizing CNR1 knockout (k/o), CNR2 k/o, and wild-type (WT) mouse models of EM, we reveal contributions of ECS and these receptors in disease initiation, progression, and immune modulation. Particularly, we identified EM-specific T cell dysfunction in the CNR2 k/o mouse model of EM. We also demonstrate the impact of decidualization-induced changes on ECS components, and the unique disease-associated transcriptional landscape of ECS components in EM. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis revealed distinct features of the microenvironment between CNR1, CNR2, and WT genotypes in the presence or absence of decidualization. This study, for the first time, provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of the ECS in EM pathogenesis and lays the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87881">Revealing unexpected complex encoding but simple decoding mechanisms in motor cortex via separating behaviorally relevant neural signals</a></h4>

              
                In motor cortex, behaviorally relevant neural responses are entangled with irrelevant signals, which complicates the study of encoding and decoding mechanisms. It remains unclear whether behaviorally irrelevant signals could conceal some critical truth. One solution is to accurately separate behaviorally relevant and irrelevant signals at both single-neuron and single-trial levels, but this approach remains elusive due to the unknown ground truth of behaviorally relevant signals. Therefore, we propose a framework to define, extract, and validate behaviorally relevant signals. Analyzing separated signals in three monkeys performing different reaching tasks, we found neural responses previously considered to contain little information actually encode rich behavioral information in complex nonlinear ways. These responses are critical for neuronal redundancy and reveal movement behaviors occupy a higher-dimensional neural space than previously expected. Surprisingly, when incorporating often-ignored neural dimensions, behaviorally relevant signals can be decoded linearly with comparable performance to nonlinear decoding, suggesting linear readout may be performed in motor cortex. Our findings prompt that separating behaviorally relevant signals may help uncover more hidden cortical mechanisms.

">Overexpression of the Apoe gene in the frontal cortex of mice causes sex-dependent changes in learning, attention, and anxiety-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein that is important for lipid storage, transport, and metabolism. APOE gene variants are associated with Alzheimers disease (AD), as well as attentional function in healthy humans. Previous research has shown that Apoe transcription is increased following stimulation of the pathway between the locus coeruleus (LC) and frontal cortex (FC) in mice. This result suggests that Apoe may affect attentional function by virtue of its expression in circuits that control attention. Does Apoe causally regulate attention, or is its expression simply a byproduct of neuronal activity in the LC and FC? To answer this question, we synthetically induced Apoe transcription in the FC of male and female mice, and subsequently tested their ability to learn a touchscreen-based rodent version of the continuous performance test of sustained attention (the rCPT). We found that increased Apoe transcription impaired performance when attentional demand was increased in male mice, while in female mice, increased Apoe transcription significantly accelerated rCPT learning. We further found that this increase in Apoe transcription affected subsequent anxiety-like behavior and cellular activity in the FC in a sex-dependent manner. The results of this study provide insight into how Apoe causally regulates translationally relevant behaviors in rodent models.

">Do transformers and CNNs learn different concepts of brain age?</a></h4>

              
                "Predicted brain age" refers to a biomarker of structural brain health derived from machine learning analysis of T1- weighted brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. A range of machine learning methods have been used to predict brain age, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently yielding state-of-the-art accuracies. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced transformers, which are conceptually distinct from CNNs, and appear to set new benchmarks in various domains of computer vision. However, transformers have not yet been applied to brain age prediction. Thus, we address two research questions: First, are transformers superior to CNNs in predicting brain age? Second, do conceptually different deep learning model architectures learn similar or different "concepts of brain age"? We adapted a Simple Vision Transformer (sViT) and a Shifted Window Transformer (SwinT) to predict brain age, and compared both models with a ResNet50 on 46,381 T1-weighted structural MR images from the UK Biobank. We found that SwinT and ResNet performed on par, while additional training samples will most likely give SwinT the edge in prediction accuracy. We identified that different model architectures may characterize different (sub-)sets of brain aging effects, representing diverging concepts of brain age. Thus, we systematically tested whether sViT, SwinT and ResNet focus on different concepts of brain age by examining variations in their predictions and clinical utility for indicating deviations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Reassuringly, we did not find substantial differences in the structure of brain age predictions between model architectures. Based on our results, the choice of deep learning model architecture does not appear to have a confounding effect on brain age studies.

">Ultrastructure of immature synaptic inputs in the lateral superior olive of the rodent brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO), which compute intensity differences between the two ears, receive two primary inputs, an ipsilaterally arising excitatory input and a contralaterally arising inhibitory input, that are precisely matched for stimulus frequency. Circuit refinement to establish this precise match takes place within the first few postnatal weeks through elimination of single-fiber inputs and concomitant strengthening of the remaining inputs. However, little is known about the ultrastructure of these young synapses and about how changes in physical features of these synapses could contribute to refinement. To characterize pre-hearing postnatal development of somatic synapses in the LSO, we performed transmission electron microscopy and examined synapses in the rodent LSO from birth to hearing onset at postnatal day 13. Synaptic vesicles and mitochondria in putative synaptic boutons were surprisingly scarce at birth. During the second week, bouton enlargement was accompanied by an increase in the number of vesicles and mitochondria. The size of mitochondria also increased, pointing to changes in functional and metabolic needs of synapses. Our results reveal extensive remodeling at individual presynaptic terminals that could strengthen single-fiber inputs and contribute to the development of robust synaptic transmission.

">Hierarchical Bayesian Augmented Hebbian Reweighting Model of Perceptual Learning</a></h4>

              
                The Augmented Hebbian Reweighting Model (AHRM) has been effectively utilized to model the collective performance of observers in various perceptual learning studies. In this work, we have introduced a novel hierarchical Bayesian Augmented Hebbian Reweighting Model (HB-AHRM) to simultaneously model the learning curves of individual participants and the entire population within a single framework. We have compared its performance to that of a Bayesian Inference Procedure (BIP), which independently estimates the posterior distributions of model parameters for each individual subject without employing a hierarchical structure. To cope with the substantial computational demands, we developed an approach to approximate the likelihood function in the AHRM with feature engineering and linear regression, increasing the speed of the estimation procedure by 20,000 times. The HB-AHRM has enabled us to compute the joint posterior distribution of hyperparameters and parameters at the population, observer, and test levels, facilitating statistical inferences across these levels. While we have developed this methodology within the context of a single experiment, the HB-AHRM and the associated modeling techniques can be readily applied to analyze data from various perceptual learning experiments and provide predictions of human performance at both the population and individual levels. The likelihood approximation concept introduced in this study may have broader utility in fitting other stochastic models lacking analytic forms.

">Identifying patterns differing between high-dimensional datasets with generalized contrastive PCA</a></h4>

              
                High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.

">Confidence and insight into working memories are shaped by attention and recent performance</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from WM is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgements regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgements are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retro-cues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgements. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgements and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgements and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retro-cueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Further, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgements to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.

">Delta opioid receptors engage multiple signaling cascades to differentially modulate prefrontal GABA release with input and target specificity</a></h4>

              
                Opioids regulate circuits associated with motivation and reward across the brain. Of the opioid receptor types, delta opioid receptors (DORs) appear to have a unique role in regulating the activity of circuits related to reward without a liability for abuse. In neocortex, DORs are expressed primarily in interneurons, including parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons that inhibit somatic and dendritic compartments of excitatory pyramidal cells, respectively. But how DORs regulate transmission from these key interneuron classes is unclear. We found that DORs regulate inhibition from these interneuron classes using different G-protein signaling pathways that both converge on presynaptic calcium channels, but regulate distinct aspects of calcium channel function. This imposes different temporal filtering effects, via short-term plasticity, that depend on how calcium channels are regulated. Thus, DORs engage differential signaling cascades to regulate inhibition depending on the postsynaptic target compartment, with different effects on synaptic information transfer in somatic and dendritic domains.

">Bayes vs. Weber: how to break a law of psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                A classic tenet of psychophysics due to Weber is that human perceptual judgments are more variable for larger magnitudes. The more recent Bayesian paradigm proposes that human perception results from an optimal statistical inference conducted on the basis of noisy internal signals. Both are supported by a wealth of empirical evidence. Do the two conflict, and if so, which best reproduces human behavior? In two preregistered experiments, we manipulate the prior distribution and the reward function in a numerosity-estimation task. When the large numerosities are more frequent, and when they are more rewarding, the Bayesian observer exhibits an 'anti-Weber' behavior, in which larger magnitudes results in less variable responses. Human subjects exhibit a similar pattern, thus breaking a long-standing law of psychophysics by showing the opposite behavior. This allows subjects to minimize the errors they make about the more frequent or the more rewarding magnitudes. Nevertheless, model fitting suggests that subjects' responses are best captured by a model that features a logarithmic encoding, a proposal of Fechner often regarded as accounting for Weber's law. We thus obtain an anti-Weber behavior together with a Fechner encoding. Our results suggest that Weber's law may be primarily due to the skewness of natural priors.

">Investigating orientation adaptation following naturalistic film viewing</a></h4>

              
                Humans display marked changes to their perceptual experience of a stimulus following prolonged or repeated exposure to a preceding stimulus. A well-studied example of such perceptual adaptation is the tilt-aftereffect. Here, prolonged exposure to one orientation leads to a shift in the perception of subsequent orientations. Such a capacity to adapt suggests the visual system is dynamically tuned to our current visual environment. However, it remains unclear to what extent adaptation occurs in response to systematic features in naturalistic scenes. We therefore investigated orientation adaptation in response to natural viewing of filtered live-action film stimuli. Within a session, participants freely viewed 45 minutes of a film which had been filtered to include increased contrast energy within a specified orientation band (0, 45, 90, or 135 degrees; i.e., the adaptor). To measure adaptation effects, the film was intermittently interrupted to have participants perform a simple orientation judgement task. Having participants complete behavioural trials throughout the testing session, including 45 minutes of total adaptation time, allowed investigation of the accumulation of response biases and changes in such biases over the course of the session. We found participants exhibited stronger adaptation effects in response to cardinal adaptors compared to obliques. However, overall adaptation effects were weaker than those observed under typical tilt-aftereffect paradigms. Further, within a single session, adaptation effects developed inconsistently. The current findings therefore demonstrate a resistance to adaptation in response to naturalistic viewing conditions, suggesting barriers to understanding perceptual adaptation as experienced in nature.

">Geometric eigenmode brain fingerprinting and its longitudinal associations with adolescent mental health and wellbeing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain fingerprinting research posits that individual uniqueness can be identified by structural and functional features that may also be linked to mental health outcomes. Global structural features of the brain can be succinctly and directly captured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) via the eigenmodes of the cortical surface - known as geometric eigenmodes. This research investigates how the uniqueness of geometric eigenmodes changes across adolescence and their longitudinal relation to mental health and wellbeing. Methods: The current study utilised n=613 MRI, self-report and demographic datasets from N=116 community-recruited adolescents enrolled in the Longitudinal Adolescent Brain Study (LABS), between the ages of 12-17 years. MPRAGE scans at each participants visit were used to derive 225 left-hemisphere geometric eigenmodes. Eigenmodes were clustered into 14 eigengroups and developmental trajectories of their uniqueness and longitudinal associations with mental wellbeing and psychological distress were examined. Results: All eigengroups become significantly more unique longitudinally, and higher mode (shorter wavelength) eigengroups were more unique than lower mode groups in adolescence. Less uniqueness in eigengroup 6 was significantly associated with higher psychological distress and lower mental wellbeing at concurrent and future timepoints. Conclusion: Geometric eigengroup brain fingerprinting offers a novel way to examine neurodevelopment. This study provides evidence that eigengroups have distinct trajectories from adolescence to adulthood, consistent with other imaging studies demonstrating increasing uniqueness in this period. Importantly, they are associated with mental health state and thus may represent neurobiological markers for mental illness onset, building on previous LABS research demonstrating that the functional uniqueness of the cognitive control network predicts psychological distress four months later.

">Seed-competent alpha-synuclein pathology in metachromatic leukodystrophy: the expanding spectrum of alpha-synucleinopathy in sphingolipidoses</a></h4>

              
                Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare - typically paediatric - sphingolipid storage disorder resulting from bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the ARSA gene, encoding the lysosomal arylsulphatase A (ASA). Heterozygous variants in ARSA are associated with risk of Lewy body diseases (LBD), a group of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders characterised by the accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein; however, no study has yet determined whether alpha-synuclein with putative pathological features is observed in MLD brain tissue. We examined post-mortem brain tissue from MLD cases (N=5, age 2-33) compared to matched control cases using histological approaches and alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay (SAA). Juvenile-onset MLD cases exhibited granular alpha-synuclein deposits in neurons of regions prone to neuronal pathology in MLD, and seed-competent conformers that generated atypical short, twisted fibrils on SAA. In contrast, infantile-onset MLD cases gave only variably positive reactions on SAA. In summary, this study suggests MLD cases manifest alpha-synuclein pathology reminiscent of that observed in LBD, even in juvenile populations, further expanding the spectrum of sphingolipid storage disorders associated with the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. These findings have important implications for understanding the disease process of both LBD and MLD, potentially highlighting novel pathways for therapeutic interventions in both conditions.

">Characterization of Postsynaptic Glutamate Transporter Functionality in the Zebrafish Retinal First Synapse Across Different Wavelengths</a></h4>

              
                In the zebrafish retina, incident light undergoes wavelength-dependent processing encompassing mechanisms such as color opponency, contrast enhancement, and motion detection prior to neural transmission to the brain proper. In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here we demonstrate that knockout of eaat5b and eaat7 disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli. Such a behavioral assay targeting short and long wavelengths indicate that EAAT5b and EAAT7 influence UV-dependent prey detection and motion sensing differently. Our findings highlight the importance of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in modulating light integration dynamics in the zebrafish retina.

">Pharmacogenomic screening identifies and repurposes leucovorin and dyclonine as pro-oligodendrogenic compounds in brain repair</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system (CNS), with oligodendroglial pathologies leading to strong disabilities, from early preterm-birth brain injury (PBI) to adult multiple sclerosis (MS). No medication presenting convincing repair capacity in humans has been approved for these pathologies so far. Here, we present a pharmacogenomic approach leading to the identification of small bioactive molecules with a large pro-oligodendrogenic activity, selected through an expert curation scoring strategy (OligoScore) of their large impact on transcriptional programs controlling oligodendrogenesis and (re)myelination. We demonstrate the pro-oligodendrogenic activity of these compounds in vitro, using neural and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures, as well as ex vivo, using organotypic cerebellar explant cultures. Focusing on the two most promising molecules, i.e. leucovorin and dyclonine, we tested their therapeutic efficacy using a mouse model of neonatal chronic hypoxia, which faithfully mimics aspects of PBI. In this model, both compounds promoted proliferation and oligodendroglial fate acquisition from neural stem/progenitor cells, with leucovorin also promoting their differentiation. We extended these findings to an adult focal de/remyelination mouse MS model, in which both compounds improved lesion repair by promoting OPC differentiation while maintaining the pool of OPCs, and in parallel, by accelerating the transition from pro inflammatory to pro-regenerative microglial profiles and myelin debris clearance. This study paves the way for clinical trials aimed at repurposing these FDA-approved compounds to treat myelin pathologies such as PBI and MS.

">Neurofibromin deficiency alters the patterning and prioritization of motor behaviors in a state-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 increase vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from loss-of-function mutations in the neurofibromin gene and subsequent reduction in the neurofibromin protein (Nf1). While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a Drosophila model of neurofibromatosis type 1. Loss of Nf1 increases spontaneous grooming in a nonlinear spatial and temporal pattern, differentially increasing grooming of certain body parts, including the abdomen, head, and wings. This increase in grooming was internal state-dependent, and could be overridden by hunger in food-deprived foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect on grooming is plastic and internal state-dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, with nf1 mutants exhibiting reductions in wing grooming when coated with dust, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or gait. Thus, loss of Nf1 alters motor function without affecting overall motor coordination, in contrast to other genetic disorders that impair coordination. Overall, these results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without affecting motor coordination.

">Aperiodic neural activity distinguishes between phasic and tonic REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Traditionally categorized as a uniform sleep phase, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibits substantial heterogeneity with its phasic and tonic constituents showing marked differences regarding neuronal network activity, environmental alertness and information processing. Here, we investigate how tonic and phasic states differ with respect to aperiodic neural activity, a marker of arousal levels, sleep stages, depth of sleep and sleep intensity. We also attempt to challenge the binary categorisation of REM sleep states by introducing graduality into their definition. Specifically, we quantify the intensity of phasic oculomotor events and investigate their temporal relationships with aperiodic activity. Method: We analyzed 57 polysomnographic recordings from three open-access datasets of healthy young volunteers aged 21.7 {+/-} 1.4 years. REM sleep heterogeneity was assessed using either binary phasic-tonic categorization or quantification of eye movement (EM) amplitudes detected by electrooculography with the YASA algorithm. Slopes of the aperiodic power component measured by electroencephalography in the low (2 - 30Hz) and high (30 - 48Hz) frequency bands were calculated using the Irregularly Resampled Auto-Spectral Analysis. For statistical analyses, we used ANOVA, Spearman correlations and cross-correlations. Results: The binary approach revealed that the phasic state is characterized by steeper low-band aperiodic slopes compared to the tonic state with the strongest effect observed over the frontal area. The phasic state also showed flatter high-band slopes with the strongest effect over central and parietal areas. The gradual approach confirmed this result further showing that higher EM amplitudes are linked to steeper low-band and flatter high-band aperiodic slopes. The temporal analysis within REM episodes revealed that aperiodic activity preceding or following EM events did not cross-correlate with EM amplitudes. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that aperiodic slopes can serve as a reliable objective marker able to differentiate between phasic and tonic constituents of REM sleep and reflect the intensity of phasic oculomotor events for instantaneous measurements. However, EM events could not be predicted by preceding aperiodic activity and vice versa, at least not with scalp electroencephalography.

">Enhancement of response learning in male rats with intrastriatal infusions of a BDNF -TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone</a></h4>

              
                Enhancement of learning and memory by cognitive and physical exercise may be mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acting at tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Upregulation of BDNF and systemic administration of a TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), enhance learning of several hippocampus-sensitive tasks in rodents. Although BDNF and 7,8-DHF enhance functions of other brain areas too, these effects have mainly targeted non-cognitive functions. One goal of the present study was to determine whether 7,8-DHF would act beyond the hippocampus to enhance cognitive functions sensitive to manipulations of the striatum. Here, we examined the effects of intrastriatal infusions of 7,8-DHF on learning a striatum-sensitive response maze and on phosphorylation of TrkB receptors in 3-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Most prior studies of BDNF and 7,8-DHF effects on learning and memory have administered the drugs for days to months before assessing effects on cognition. A second goal of the present study was to determine whether a single drug treatment near the time of training would effectively enhance learning. Moreover, 7,8-DHF is often tested for its ability to reverse impairments in learning and memory rather than to enhance these functions in the absence of impairments. Thus, a third goal of this experiment was to evaluate the efficacy of 7,8-DHF in enhancing learning in unimpaired rats. In untrained rats, intrastriatal infusions of 7,8-DHF resulted in phosphorylation of TrkB receptors, suggesting that 7,8-DHF acted as a TrkB agonist and BDNF mimic. The findings that a single, intra-striatal infusion of 7,8-DHF 20 min before training enhanced response learning in rats suggest that, in addition to its trophic effects, BDNF modulates learning and memory through receptor mediated cell signaling events.

">Ion channels that mediate calcium-dependent control of spike patterns are spatially organized across the soma in relation to a cytoskeletal assembly</a></h4>

              
                Sodium and potassium channels that regulate axonal spike propagation are highly organized at nodes of Ranvier by a spectrin-actin membrane periodic skeleton. STORM-TIRF microscopy was used to define the spatial organization over the soma of a complex of Cav1.3 calcium, RyR2, and IK potassium chan-nels (CaRyK complex) that generate a slow AHP in hippocampal neurons. Nearest neighbor distance and non-negative matrix factorization analyses identified two spatial patterns as linear rows of 3-8 immuno-labeled clusters with 155 nm periodicity that extended to branchpoints, or as isolated clusters with 600-800 nm separation. The rows and isolated clusters for each of the CaRyK complex proteins closely over-lapped with the patterns for spectrin {beta}II and the actin linking proteins actinin I and II. Together the data reveal a close correspondence between the placement of CaRyK complex proteins and that of a net-like organization of spectrin {beta}II across the soma. The regularity in the pattern of expression of these proteins at ER-PM junctions suggest their role as functional nodes of calcium- and calcium-gated potassium chan-nels to control the pattern of spike output at the soma.

">Magnetoencephalography dimensionality reduction informed by dynamic brain states</a></h4>

              
                Complex spontaneous brain dynamics mirror the large number of interactions taking place among regions, supporting higher functions. Such complexity is manifested in the inter-regional dependencies among signals derived from different brain areas, as observed utilising neuroimaging techniques, like magnetoencephalography. The dynamics of this data produce numerous subsets of active regions at any moment as they evolve. Notably, converging evidence shows that these states can be understood in terms of transient coordinated events that spread across the brain over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Those can be used as a proxy of the effectiveness of the dynamics, as they become stereotyped or disorganised in neurological diseases. However, given the high dimensional nature of the data, representing them has been challenging thus far. Dimensionality reduction techniques are typically deployed to describe complex interdependencies and improve their interpretability. However, many dimensionality reduction techniques lose information about the sequence of configurations that took place. Here, we leverage a newly described algorithm, PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding), specifically designed to preserve the dynamics of the system in the low-dimensional embedding space. We analysed source-reconstructed resting-state magnetoencephalography from 18 healthy subjects to represent the dynamics of the configuration in low-dimensional space. After reduction with PHATE, unsupervised clustering via K-means is applied to identify distinct clusters. The topography of the states is described, and the dynamics are represented as a transition matrix. All the results have been checked against null models, providing a parsimonious account of the large-scale, fast, aperiodic dynamics during resting-state.

">Myo-inositol and total NAA in the hippocampus are linked to CSF tau pathology in cognitively normal older adults</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Understanding relationships between in vivo neurometabolic changes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the hippocampus, a region vulnerable to early changes in AD, will support early diagnosis. METHODS: Two studies using 1H-MRS examined concentrations of myo-inositol (MI), total creatine (tCr) and total NAA (tNAA) in the hippocampus. The first study compared hippocampal metabolite concentrations in healthy young and older adults and the second study assessed relationships between hippocampal metabolites and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of A{beta}42, phosphotau 181 (pTau181), and total tau (t-Tau) while adjusting for demographic covariates and spectral characteristics (linewidth, signal-to-noise ratio) in a separate group of older adults ranging from cognitively normal (CN) to AD-dementia. RESULTS: Hippocampal MI, but not tCr or tNAA, was increased in cognitively normal older versus young adults. Within the second older adult group, MI and tNAA, but not tCr, were linked to increases in CSF pTau181 and t-Tau, but not A{beta}42. DISCUSSION: Tau deposition in cognitively normal individuals is associated with biochemical changes related to glial reactivity and neural integrity in the hippocampus.

">Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals HDAC Inhibition Modulates Microglial Dynamics to Protect Against Ischemic Stroke in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke significantly contributes to global morbidity and disability through a cascade of neurological responses. Microglia, the immune modulators within the brain, exhibit dual roles in exacerbating and ameliorating ischemic injury through neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective roles, respectively. Despite emerging insights into microglia's role in neuronal support, the potential of epigenetic intervention to modulate microglial activity remains largely unexplored. We have previously shown that sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) epigenetically regulates inflammatory response of microglia after ischemic stroke and this study was aimed to characterize the transcriptomic profiles of microglia and their spatial distribution in the stroke brain followed by HDACi administration. We hypothesized that the administration of HDACi epigenetically modulates microglial activation and a region-specific microglial phenotype in the stroke brain, shifting their phenotype from neurotoxic to neuroprotective and facilitating neuronal repair and recovery in the ischemic penumbra. Utilizing a rodent model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), spatial transcriptomics and 3D morphometric reconstruction techniques were employed to investigate microglial responses in critical penumbral regions, such as the hippocampus, thalamus, cortex and striatum following HDACi administration. We found that HDACi significantly altered the microglial transcriptomic landscape involving biological pathways of neuroinflammation, neuroprotection and phagocytosis as well as morphological phenotype, promoting a shift towards reparative, neurotrophic profiles within the ischemic penumbra. These changes were also associated with enhanced neuronal survival and reduced neuroinflammation in specific regions in the ischemic brain. By elucidating the mechanisms through which HDAC inhibition influences microglial function, our findings propose therapeutic avenues for neuroprotection and rehabilitation in ischemic stroke, and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions that involve microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.

">The neural correlates of social rejection in the cyberball paradigm: An arterial spin labelling study</a></h4>

              
                The cyberball paradigm has been used in numerous neuroimaging studies to elicit activation in neural substrates of social exclusion. Using arterial spin labelling, an approach allowing quantitative estimates of blood perfusion, we replicate findings of meta-analyses of this paradigm in the inferior frontal gyrus and ventral cingular cortex, but show that these areas were also active in a watch condition (in which participants were not excluded), although less so. These findings relativize a simple interpretation of these areas as the neural substrates of social exclusion, as in previous studies. In a broader experimental context, similar activations have been reported by neuroimaging studies when semantic disambiguation and evaluation of action goals are required, an interpretation that may apply also to the cyberball effects.

">Fidelity of focal sound source reproduction by higher (9th) order ambisonics and perceptual effects of reproduction errors</a></h4>

              
                Higher-order ambisonic rendering is an increasingly common acoustic field reproduction technique that enables presentation of virtual sounds at nearly any location in 3D space, relatively unconstrained by the veridical locations of loudspeakers. We evaluated whether 3D sound reproduction through a 9th order ambisonic system was sufficiently accurate to probe the limits of human spatial perception. In Experiment 1, we estimated minimum audible angles for human listeners at a variety of reference points on the horizontal plane. Our estimated values are similar to absolute thresholds obtained using single-channel free-field presentation for locations within {+/-}51{degrees} on the horizontal plane, including values approaching 1{degrees} on the midline, regardless of speaker density. This demonstrates the adequacy of the AudioDome for studies of human auditory spatial perception, at least for displacement in the horizontal plane. In Experiment 2 we estimated monaural and binaural localization cues by presenting linear chirp sweeps (0-22050 Hz) at the horizontal reference points tested in Experiment 1 and recorded ear canal signals through a head and torso simulator. Although localization cues for low-frequency components were well preserved, they were distorted for components above 4000 Hz. In Experiment 3 we provide evidence that these high-frequency distortions are processed as cues to elevation.

	<p>Although free-floating thrombus (FFT) poses a significant risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), optimal management strategies are uncertain. To determine the state-of-the-art of medical interventions for FFT, we conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of various medical interventions and factors influencing FFT resolution and recurrence. A comprehensive search of Embase, PubMed, and ScienceDirect identified 61 studies encompassing 179 patients with FFT-related stroke or TIA treated with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or their combinations. Primary outcomes assessed were stroke recurrence and thrombus resolution. Statistical analyses (Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact test, chi-square test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney test, and Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis test) utilized significance set at p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Over a median follow-up of 7 months, thrombus resolution occurred in 65% of patients, while 11.2% experienced recurrence, primarily as TIAs. Cardioembolism was significantly less common in resolved cases (p = 0.025). Combination therapy (antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and statins) significantly enhanced clot resolution (OR 11.4; 95% CI 1.436&amp;amp;ndash;91.91; p = 0.021) compared to monotherapies. Ulcerated plaque was a significant predictor of recurrence (OR 8.2; 95% CI 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;66.07; p = 0.048). These findings underscore the superiority of combination therapy in FFT management and highlight the need for targeted interventions in patients with ulcerated plaques to mitigate recurrence risk.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1% of people aged over 60. Currently, there is only symptomatic relief for PD patients, with levodopa being the gold standard of PD treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical option to treat PD patients. DBS improves motor functions and may also allow a significant reduction in dopaminergic medication. Important parameters for DBS outcomes are the disease duration, the age of disease onset, responsiveness to levodopa and cognitive or psychiatric comorbidities. Emerging data also highlight the need to carefully consider the genetic background in the preoperative assessment of PD patients who are candidates for DBS, as genetic factors may affect the effectiveness of DBS in these patients. This review article discusses the role of genetics in DBS for PD patients, in an attempt to better understand inter-individual variability in DBS response, control of motor PD symptoms and appearance of non-motor symptoms, especially cognitive decline.</p>

	<p>Cerebral vascular angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is essential for diagnosing neurological conditions but poses radiation risks. This study aims to analyze the impact of examination parameters and patient characteristics on the radiation dose received during DSA to optimize safety and minimize exposure. A retrospective analysis of 251 DSA procedures using the GE Innova IGS 630 dual-plane instrument was conducted. Data on dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (KERMA), along with patient and examination details, were collected. Statistical analyses, including Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis, and Spearman rank correlation tests, assessed the relationships between variables and radiation dose outcomes. Significant correlations were found between the sides examined (left, right, or both) and DAP (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and KERMA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) values, with bilateral studies showing the highest values. The post hoc Dunn tests showed that the &amp;amp;lsquo;L + P&amp;amp;rsquo; group significantly differs from both the right group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and the left group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). There is no significant difference between the &amp;amp;lsquo;P&amp;amp;rsquo; group and the &amp;amp;lsquo;L&amp;amp;rsquo; group (p-value = 0.53). These results suggest that the right and left (both) group have unique KERMA mGy values compared to the other two groups. A strong correlation (rS = 0.87) existed between DAP and KERMA. The number of projections significantly impacted radiation dose (rS = 0.61). Tube parameters (kV and mA) and skull size had low correlations with DAP and KERMA. Optimizing imaging protocols and individualizing parameters can significantly enhance patient safety and diagnostic efficacy while also reducing occupational exposure for medical staff.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmenting auditory feedback through an error-augmentation paradigm could facilitate the perception and correction of gait asymmetry in stroke survivors, but how such a paradigm should be tailored to individual asymmetry profiles remains unclear. Before implementing the paradigm in rehabilitation, we need to investigate the instantaneous effects of distorted footstep sound feedback on gait symmetry in healthy young adults. Methods: Participants (n = 12) walked on a self-paced treadmill while listening to their footstep sounds, which were distorted unilaterally according to five conditions presented randomly: small delay; small advance; large delay; large advance; or unmodified (control). The primary outcomes were swing time ratio (SWR) and step length ratio (SLR). Secondary outcomes included walking speed, bilateral swing time, step length, and maximum toe height, as well as hip, knee, and ankle angle excursions. Results: SWR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but not SLR (p &amp;amp;ge; 0.05) was increased in all distorted feedback conditions compared to the control condition. Increased swing time on the perturbed side ipsilateral to feedback distortion was observed in the advanced conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while swing time increased bilaterally in the delayed conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but to a larger extent on the unperturbed side contralateral to feedback distortion. Increases in swing time were accompanied by larger maximum toe height as well as larger hip and knee joint excursions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 to p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). No differences in any outcomes were observed between small and large feedback distortion magnitudes. Conclusions: Distorted footstep sound feedback successfully elicits adaptation in temporal gait symmetry (SWR), with distinct modulation patterns for advanced vs. delayed footstep sounds. Spatial symmetry (SLR) remains unaltered, likely because auditory feedback primarily conveys temporal information. This research lays the groundwork to implement personalized augmented auditory feedback in neurorehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis is a condition that is characterized by hypersensitivity to normal everyday sounds or reduced sound tolerance and can affect patients in distressing ways. Sound therapy is a treatment intervention that is used to desensitize patients. However, as yet, there is a lack of understanding on how it is used in clinical practice, the different types of devices, or how to use them. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the current use of sound therapy in adults with hyperacusis and identify any factors that may influence treatment. Methodology: An established methodological framework was used to formulate the research question and guide the search strategy and reporting. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting adult (&amp;amp;gt;18 years) populations with hyperacusis and sound therapy treatments which were published in any language. Searches of electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline (EBSCO), Scopus, PsycINFO) identified 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria (completed in April 2024). Data from included records were collated and summarized descriptively.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze the cross-linguistic influence of previously learned languages and working memory capacities on the vocabulary performance of two different typological languages. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the working memory capacities of bilingual adults in relation to the vocabulary performance of two different languages never learned by the participants, and (2) to analyze to what extent the typology of previously learned languages influences working memory capacities in relation to the vocabulary performance of French and Nahuatl. A group of 43 Mexican Spanish college students participated in this experimental study. The participants completed a series of working memory tasks in Nahuatl and French. The results showed that working memory capacities were lower in Nahuatl than in French. Thus, a correlation was found between their first and second language and vocabulary performance in French. We can consider the influence of previously learned languages as a significant factor in vocabulary acquisition in accordance with the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; working memory capacities.</p>

                <p>Recent neurophysiological studies provide inconsistent results of frontoparietal network (FPN) stimulation for altering working memory (WM) capacity. This study aimed to boost WM capacity by manipulating the activity of the FPN via dual-site high&ndash;definition transcranial direct current stimulation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to three stimulation groups, receiving either simultaneous anodal stimulation of the frontal and parietal areas (double stimulation), or stimulation of the frontal area only (single stimulation), or the placebo stimulation (sham) to frontal and parietal areas. After the stimulation, we used an operation span task to test memory accuracy, mathematical accuracy, time of calculation and memorizing, and recall response time across the three groups. The results revealed an enhancement of memory accuracy and a reduction of time of calculation in the double stimulation group compared with that in others. In addition, recall response time was significantly decreased in the double and single stimulation groups compared with that in sham. No differences in mathematical accuracy were observed. Our results confirm the pivotal role of the FPN in WM and suggest its functional dissociation, with the frontal component more implicated in the retrieval stage and the parietal component in the processing and retention stages.</p>

                <p>Single-unit (SU) activity&mdash;action potentials isolated from one neuron&mdash;has traditionally been employed to relate neuronal activity to behavior. However, recent investigations have shown that multiunit (MU) activity&mdash;ensemble neural activity recorded within the vicinity of one microelectrode&mdash;may also contain accurate estimations of task-related neural population dynamics. Here, using an established model-fitting approach, we compared the spatial codes of SU response fields with corresponding MU response fields recorded from the frontal eye fields (FEFs) in head-unrestrained monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) during a memory-guided saccade task. Overall, both SU and MU populations showed a simple visuomotor transformation: the visual response coded target-in-eye coordinates, transitioning progressively during the delay toward a future gaze-in-eye code in the saccade motor response. However, the SU population showed additional secondary codes, including a predictive gaze code in the visual response and retention of a target code in the motor response. Further, when SUs were separated into regular/fast spiking neurons, these cell types showed different spatial code progressions during the late delay period, only converging toward gaze coding during the final saccade motor response. Finally, reconstructing MU populations (by summing SU data within the same sites) failed to replicate either the SU or MU pattern. These results confirm the theoretical and practical potential of MU activity recordings as a biomarker for fundamental sensorimotor transformations (e.g., target-to-gaze coding in the oculomotor system), while also highlighting the importance of SU activity for coding more subtle (e.g., predictive/memory) aspects of sensorimotor behavior.</p>

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 45 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 who have DM have a higher risk compared to those without DM. Among COVID-19 patients with DM admitted to hospitals, they were older compared to those without DM and prothrombin time values similar but slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with DM.

                Background To ensure the validity and therapeutic utility of the Neck disability index (NDI) scale, translations, cultural adaptations and psychometric evidence is necessary. This study aimed to address the absence of a suitable and validated Hindi version of the NDI for the rural population. The specific objectives were to translate, adapt, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed Hindi version of the NDI. Methods Following guidelines provided by the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, the original English NDI scale was cross-culturally adapted into Hindi. The adaptation process included translations (forward and backward), expert committee review, pre-testing and cognitive debriefing with 30 individuals experiencing chronic non-specific neck pain. The outcome of this process was the creation of the Hindi version of the NDI, termed NDI-Hi. Subsequently, NDI-Hi was administered to 211 participants with neck pain from multiple centers for psychometric testing. The evaluation involved test-retest reliability over a 48-hour interval, factor analysis, assessment of internal reliability measures, and criterion-related validity by comparing it with the NPAD-Hindi version. Results The NDI-Hi version exhibited favorable psychometric properties, including good test-retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.87. Internal consistency of the scale was high, indicated by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α) of 0.96. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was determined to be 2.58, and the minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated to be 7.15. Furthermore, the NDI-Hi showed significant correlation with the NPAD-Hindi version, with a correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.86, and a p-value of less than 0.001. Conclusions The NDI-Hi demonstrated validity and reliability as an outcome tool for assessing neck disability. It can be effectively utilized in clinical practice and research settings involving Hindi-speaking individuals with chronic non-specific neck pain. The adapted scale is particularly well-suited for the rural Northern Indian Hindi-speaking population.

                Introduction Antiphospholipids syndrome is a rare autoimmune whose Clinical manifestations are very wide and different. Vaso-occlusive manifestations are the most frequent ones. Vessels of all organs can be involved. Ocular involvement is among the rarest. We report a case of retinal arterial thrombosis in the context of APS. Case report A 46-year-old patient with no previous medical history was admitted to the ophthalmology department for visual field amputation of the right eye without other associated signs. On the fundus, the left side was without abnormality and the right side was the site of a mixed arterial and superior temporal venous occlusion. Retinal angiography revealed a retinal focus in the superior temporal region with mixed occlusion of arterial and venous branches with ischemia of the superior temporal quadrant on the right and a retinal focus in the superficial inferior temporal region without occlusion on the left. Optical coherence tomography revealed ischemia of the superficial layers with alteration of the macular microvascularization in the right superior temporal quadrant. Immunological work-up showed antinuclear antibodies to be positive at 160 and anti-bgp1 positive with an IgG level of 118 IgM higher than 118 IgA at 101. The patient was put on effective anticoagulation with good clinical evolution. Conclusion Ocular involvement is rare in APS and associated with poor prognosis, it seems to be difficult to diagnose but also to manage. Larger studies are required to establish guidelines on how and when to screen asymptomatic APS patients for ocular damage, but also on how to prevent and treat it.

                ‘Research capacity strengthening’ (RCS) is an umbrella term that can be used to describe a wide variety of activities conducted in support of diverse objectives premised upon distinct, potentially opposing, views. Despite this, the ultimate objective of RCS activities is rarely made explicit which can be problematic when diverse objectives are possible. By ‘ultimate’ objective we are referring to the overarching (often long-term) goal an RCS initiative is intended to contribute towards (e.g. better population health) as opposed to the more immediate ‘proximate’ (often short-term) objectives of any such activity (e.g. improved capacity to undertake infectious disease research). We argue a need for those funding, designing and implementing RCS initiatives to make clear statements as to the ultimate objective that they foresee their respective initiative contributing towards as well as the proposed pathway and associated assumptions that underlie their approach. Examples of distinct ultimate objectives for RCS initiatives are presented alongside fictitious examples of how they may be transparently reported from both a funder and implementor perspective. Such transparency should be routine within the scope of funding calls for RCS activities (even when such activities are only a minor component of the call), subsequent applications to those calls and any description of an applied RCS activity/ies and/or the associated outcomes thereof. The process of determining one’s ultimate objective will further cause funders and actors to think through their respective initiatives more thoroughly and make informed choices and better designed RCS projects. Doing so would reduce any ambiguity associated with the use of the term ‘research capacity strengthening’ and would provide a stronger foundation for robust programme evaluation.

                Background Dental caries is a common chronic oral disease, posing a serious public health issue. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning shows potential in addressing this problem. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore emerging topics, collaborations, key authors, and research trends in Southeast Asia related to the application of machine learning in dental caries management. Methods A comprehensive selection using the Scopus database to obtain relevant research, covering publications from inception to July 2024 was done. We employed the Bibliometric approaches, including co-authorship networks, yearly publishing trends, institutional and national partnerships, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and citation analysis, for the collected data. To explore the visualization and network analysis, we employed the tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix in R package. Results The final bibliometric analysis included 246 papers. We found that Malaysia became the top contributor with 59 publications, followed by Indonesia (37) and Thailand (29). Malaysia had the highest Multiple Country Publications (MCP) ratio at 0.407. Top institutions including the Universiti Sains Malaysia led with 39 articles, followed by Chiang Mai University (36) and the National University of Singapore (30) became the leader. Co-authorship analysis using VOSviewer revealed six distinct clusters. A total of 1220 scholars contributed to these publications. The top 10 keywords, including ‘human’ and ‘dental caries,’ indicated research hotspots. Conclusion We found growing evidence of machine learning applications to address dental caries in Southeast Asia. The bibliometric analysis highlights key authors, collaborative networks, and emerging topics, revealing research trends since 2014. This study underscores the importance of bibliometric analysis in tackling this public health issue.

                <p>by Keyvan Mahjoory, Andreas Bahmer, Molly J. Henry</p>

Human listeners have the ability to direct their attention to a single speaker in a multi-talker environment. The neural correlates of selective attention can be decoded from a single trial of electroencephalography (EEG) data. In this study, leveraging the source-reconstructed and anatomically-resolved EEG data as inputs, we sought to employ CNN as an interpretable model to uncover task-specific interactions between brain regions, rather than simply to utilize it as a black box decoder. To this end, our CNN model was specifically designed to learn pairwise interaction representations for 10 cortical regions from five-second inputs. By exclusively utilizing these features for decoding, our model was able to attain a median accuracy of 77.56% for within-participant and 65.14% for cross-participant classification. Through ablation analysis together with dissecting the features of the models and applying cluster analysis, we were able to discern the presence of alpha-band-dominated inter-hemisphere interactions, as well as alpha- and beta-band dominant interactions that were either hemisphere-specific or were characterized by a contrasting pattern between the right and left hemispheres. These interactions were more pronounced in parietal and central regions for within-participant decoding, but in parietal, central, and partly frontal regions for cross-participant decoding. These findings demonstrate that our CNN model can effectively utilize features known to be important in auditory attention tasks and suggest that the application of domain knowledge inspired CNNs on source-reconstructed EEG data can offer a novel computational framework for studying task-relevant brain interactions.

                <p>by Yunfeng Xiong, Chuntian Wang, Yuan Zhang</p>

Human behaviors have non-negligible impacts on spread of contagious disease. For instance, large-scale gathering and high mobility of population could lead to accelerated disease transmission, while public behavioral changes in response to pandemics may effectively reduce contacts and suppress the peak of the outbreak. In order to understand how spatial characteristics like population mobility and clustering interplay with epidemic outbreaks, we formulate a stochastic-statistical environment-epidemic dynamic system (SEEDS) via an agent-based biased random walk model on a two-dimensional lattice. The “popularity” and “awareness” variables are taken into consideration to capture human natural and preventive behavioral factors, which are assumed to guide and bias agent movement in a combined way. It is found that the presence of the spatial heterogeneity, like social influence locality and spatial clustering induced by self-aggregation, potentially suppresses the contacts between agents and consequently flats the epidemic curve. Surprisedly, disease responses might not necessarily reduce the susceptibility of informed individuals and even aggravate disease outbreak if each individual responds independently upon their awareness. The disease control is achieved effectively only if there are coordinated public-health interventions and public compliance to these measures. Therefore, our model may be useful for quantitative evaluations of a variety of public-health policies.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool in genomics research, enabling the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level. However, scRNA-seq data often suffer from a high rate of dropouts, where certain genes fail to be detected in specific cells due to technical limitations. This missing data can introduce biases and hinder downstream analysis. To overcome this challenge, the development of effective imputation methods has become crucial in the field of scRNA-seq data analysis. Here, we propose an imputation method based on robust and non-negative matrix factorization (scRNMF). Instead of other matrix factorization algorithms, scRNMF integrates two loss functions: <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> loss and C-loss. The <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> loss function is highly sensitive to outliers, which can introduce substantial errors. We utilize the C-loss function when dealing with zero values in the raw data. The primary advantage of the C-loss function is that it imposes a smaller punishment for larger errors, which results in more robust factorization when handling outliers. Various datasets of different sizes and zero rates are used to evaluate the performance of scRNMF against other state-of-the-art methods. Our method demonstrates its power and stability as a tool for imputation of scRNA-seq data.

                <p>by Ksenia Guseva, Moritz Mohrlok, Lauren Alteio, Hannes Schmidt, Shaul Pollak, Christina Kaiser</p>

Although depolymerization of complex carbohydrates is a growth-limiting bottleneck for microbial decomposers, we still lack understanding about how the production of different types of extracellular enzymes affect individual microbes and in turn the performance of whole decomposer communities. In this work we use a theoretical model to evaluate the potential trade-offs faced by microorganisms in biopolymer decomposition which arise due to the varied biochemistry of different depolymerizing enzyme classes. We specifically consider two broad classes of depolymerizing extracellular enzymes, which are widespread across microbial taxa: exo-enzymes that cleave small units from the ends of polymer chains and endo-enzymes that act at random positions generating degradation products of varied sizes. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the production of these enzymes, which is independent of system’s complexity and which appears solely from the intrinsically different temporal depolymerization dynamics. As a consequence, specialists that produce either exo- or only endo-enzymes limit their growth to high or low substrate conditions, respectively. Conversely, generalists that produce both enzymes in an optimal ratio expand their niche and benefit from the synergy between the two enzymes. Finally, our results show that, in spatially-explicit environments, consortia composed of endo- and exo-specialists can only exist under oligotrophic conditions. In summary, our analysis demonstrates that the (evolutionary or ecological) selection of a depolymerization pathway will affect microbial fitness under low- or high substrate conditions, with impacts on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities. It provides a possible explanation why many polysaccharide degraders in nature show the genetic potential to produce both of these enzyme classes.

                <p>by Ioana Bouros, Edward M. Hill, Matt J. Keeling, Sam Moore, Robin N. Thompson</p>

The rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In most countries, vaccinations were initially targeted at high-risk populations, including older individuals and healthcare workers. Now, despite substantial infection- and vaccine-induced immunity in host populations worldwide, waning immunity and the emergence of novel variants continue to cause significant waves of infection and disease. Policy makers must determine how to deploy booster vaccinations, particularly when constraints in vaccine supply, delivery and cost mean that booster vaccines cannot be administered to everyone. A key question is therefore whether older individuals should again be prioritised for vaccination, or whether alternative strategies (e.g. offering booster vaccines to the individuals who have most contacts with others and therefore drive infection) can instead offer indirect protection to older individuals. Here, we use mathematical modelling to address this question, considering SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a range of countries with different socio-economic backgrounds. We show that the population structures of different countries can have a pronounced effect on the impact of booster vaccination, even when identical booster vaccination targeting strategies are adopted. However, under the assumed transmission model, prioritising older individuals for booster vaccination consistently leads to the most favourable public health outcomes in every setting considered. This remains true for a range of assumptions about booster vaccine supply and timing, and for different assumed policy objectives of booster vaccination.

<i>In silico</i> clinical trials (ISCTs) are an emerging method in modeling and simulation where medical interventions are evaluated using computational models of patients. ISCTs have the potential to provide cost-effective, time-efficient, and ethically favorable alternatives for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. However, ensuring the credibility of ISCT results is a significant challenge. This paper aims to identify unique considerations for assessing the credibility of ISCTs and proposes an ISCT credibility assessment workflow based on recently published model assessment frameworks. First, we review various ISCTs described in the literature, carefully selected to showcase the range of methodological options available. These studies cover a wide variety of devices, reasons for conducting ISCTs, patient model generation approaches including subject-specific versus ‘synthetic’ virtual patients, complexity levels of devices and patient models, incorporation of clinician or clinical outcome models, and methods for integrating ISCT results with real-world clinical trials. We next discuss how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification apply to ISCTs, considering the range of ISCT approaches identified. Based on our analysis, we then present a hierarchical workflow for assessing ISCT credibility, using a general credibility assessment framework recently published by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Overall, this work aims to promote standardization in ISCTs and contribute to the wider adoption and acceptance of ISCTs as a reliable tool for evaluating medical devices.

In life sciences, tracking objects from movies enables researchers to quantify the behavior of single particles, organelles, bacteria, cells, and even whole animals. While numerous tools now allow automated tracking from video, a significant challenge persists in compiling, analyzing, and exploring the large datasets generated by these approaches. Here, we introduce CellTracksColab, a platform tailored to simplify the exploration and analysis of cell tracking data. CellTracksColab facilitates the compiling and analysis of results across multiple fields of view, conditions, and repeats, ensuring a holistic dataset overview. CellTracksColab also harnesses the power of high-dimensional data reduction and clustering, enabling researchers to identify distinct behavioral patterns and trends without bias. Finally, CellTracksColab also includes specialized analysis modules enabling spatial analyses (clustering, proximity to specific regions of interest). We demonstrate CellTracksColab capabilities with 3 use cases, including T cells and cancer cell migration, as well as filopodia dynamics. CellTracksColab is available for the broader scientific community at https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab.

                <p>by Wade R. Roberts, Adam M. Siepielski, Andrew J. Alverson</p>

A principal goal in ecology is to identify the determinants of species abundances in nature. Body size has emerged as a fundamental and repeatable predictor of abundance, with smaller organisms occurring in greater numbers than larger ones. A biogeographic component, known as Bergmann’s rule, describes the preponderance, across taxonomic groups, of larger-bodied organisms in colder areas. Although undeniably important, the extent to which body size is the key trait underlying these patterns is unclear. We explored these questions in diatoms, unicellular algae of global importance for their roles in carbon fixation and energy flow through marine food webs. Using a phylogenomic dataset from a single lineage with worldwide distribution, we found that body size (cell volume) was strongly correlated with genome size, which varied by 50-fold across species and was driven by differences in the amount of repetitive DNA. However, directional models identified temperature and genome size, not cell size, as having the greatest influence on maximum population growth rate. A global metabarcoding dataset further identified genome size as a strong predictor of species abundance in the ocean, but only in colder regions at high and low latitudes where diatoms with large genomes dominated, a pattern consistent with Bergmann’s rule. Although species abundances are shaped by myriad interacting abiotic and biotic factors, genome size alone was a remarkably strong predictor of abundance. Taken together, these results highlight the cascading cellular and ecological consequences of macroevolutionary changes in an emergent trait, genome size, one of the most fundamental and irreducible properties of an organism.

                Background To evaluate the NETosis biomarkers citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), neutrophil elastase (ELA), calprotectin (CALPRO), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as indicators of inflammation in the severe stages of periodontitis III and IV in both (smokers and nonsmokers) patients, and to determine the correlation between NETosis biomarkers and clinical periodontal parameters. Methods This study recruited male subjects with an age range of (20-60) years; 60 were stage III and stage IV periodontitis patients, 30 were cigarette smoker, and 30 were nonsmokers. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate their eligibility for recruitment, 25 control subjects with a healthy periodontal status and good oral hygiene maintenance were included. Unstimulated saliva was obtained and evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the following periodontal parameters were documented: [plaque index, bleeding on probing, periodontal pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss]. Results The mean levels of all salivary NETosis biomarkers citH3, ELA, CALPRO, and MPO were elevated in the periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) than in controls. Moreover, the mean NETosis biomarker‘s mean levels were significantly higher in smoker than in nonsmokers. In addition, the correlations were significant between CALPRO and CitH3 in smokers and between ELA and CitH3 in nonsmokers. Conclusions The results of this study showed that the chosen salivary biomarkers of NETosis revealed elevated clinical accuracy in differentiating the studied periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) from controls. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the risk of periodontitis, and neutrophils in smokers with periodontitis exhibited more susceptibility to form neutrophil extracellular traps when compared with nonsmokers.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a triplet repeat expansion within the gene huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>). Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory of aging that posits that some genes, facilitating individual fitness early in life through adaptive evolutionary changes, also augment detrimental aging-related processes. Antagonistic pleiotropy theory may explain a positive evolutionary pressure toward functionally advantageous brain development that is vulnerable to rapid degeneration. The current study investigated antagonistic pleiotropy in HD using a years-to-onset paradigm in a unique sample of children and young adults at risk for HD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive, behavioral, motor, and brain structural measures from premanifest gene-expanded (n = 79) and gene nonexpanded (n = 112) participants (6–21 years) in the Kids-HD study were examined. All measures in the gene-expanded group were modeled using a mixed-effects regression approach to assess years-to-onset-based changes while controlling for normal growth. Simultaneously, structure–function associations were also examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Decades from motor onset, gene-expanded participants showed significantly better cognitive, behavioral, and motor scores versus gene nonexpanded controls, along with larger cerebral volumes and cortical features. After this initial peak, a prolonged deterioration was observed in both functional and structural measures. Far from onset, brain measures were positively correlated with functional measures, supporting the view that functional advantages were mediated by structural differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mutant <i>HTT</i> may drive the development of a larger than normal brain that subserves superior early-life function. These findings support the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of <i>HTT</i> in HD, where this gene drives early advantage followed by accelerated aging processes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Complex mechanisms govern the transport and action of oxytocin (Oxt), a neuropeptide and hormone that mediates diverse physiologic processes. While Oxt exerts site-specific and rapid effects in the brain via axonal and somatodendritic release, volume transmission via CSF and the neurovascular interface can act as an additional mechanism to distribute Oxt signals across distant brain regions on a slower timescale. This review focuses on modes of Oxt transport and action in the CNS, with particular emphasis on the roles of perivascular spaces, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and circumventricular organs in coordinating the triadic interaction among circulating blood, CSF, and parenchyma. Perivascular spaces, critical conduits for CSF flow, play a pivotal role in Oxt diffusion and distribution within the CNS and reciprocally undergo Oxt-mediated structural and functional reconstruction. While the BBB modulates the movement of Oxt between systemic and cerebral circulation in a majority of brain regions, circumventricular organs without a functional BBB can allow for diffusion, monitoring, and feedback regulation of bloodborne peripheral signals such as Oxt. Recognition of these additional transport mechanisms provides enhanced insight into the systemic propagation and regulation of Oxt activity.

                Zhao et al. discover that mRNA and protein expression of phosphate importer SLC20A2 is compromised by intronic mutations, which resulted in increased cryptic-exon incorporation. Splice-switching ASOs targeting cryptic exons restore SLC20A2 expression and brain phosphate homeostasis and suppress brain calcification, providing a therapeutic strategy for PFBC patients with SLC20A2 haploinsufficiency.

                Drainas et al. identify GCN2 as a factor influencing small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) response to the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775. AZD1775 directly activates the GCN2 stress response pathway, increasing its effectiveness in killing SCLC cells. Thus, activating the GCN2 pathway presents a novel opportunity to enhance WEE1 inhibitor efficacy in SCLC.

                Yu et al. demonstrate that, in the absence of Rab27a, endosomal Toll-like receptors are retained at amphisomes and CpG internalization is delayed. CpG-stimulated Rab27a-deficient neutrophils present selective defects in cytokine secretion. Defective nucleic acid sensing and altered cytokine secretion in Rab27a deficiency contribute to infection susceptibility and inflammatory disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80687">BRCA1/BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 regulate DNA repair pathway engagement during C. elegans meiosis</a></h4>

              
                The preservation of genome integrity during sperm and egg development is vital for reproductive success. During meiosis, the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BRC-1 and structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 (SMC-5/6) complex genetically interact to promote high fidelity DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, but the specific DSB repair outcomes these proteins regulate remain unknown. Using genetic and cytological methods to monitor resolution of DSBs with different repair partners in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we demonstrate that both BRC-1 and SMC-5 repress intersister crossover recombination events. Sequencing analysis of conversion tracts from homolog-independent DSB repair events further indicates that BRC-1 regulates intersister/intrachromatid noncrossover conversion tract length. Moreover, we find that BRC-1 specifically inhibits error prone repair of DSBs induced at mid-pachytene. Finally, we reveal functional interactions of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 in regulating repair pathway engagement: BRC-1 is required for localization of recombinase proteins to DSBs in <i>smc-5</i> mutants and enhances DSB repair defects in <i>smc-5</i> mutants by repressing theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). These results are consistent with a model in which some functions of BRC-1 act upstream of SMC-5/6 to promote recombination and inhibit error-prone DSB repair, while SMC-5/6 acts downstream of BRC-1 to regulate the formation or resolution of recombination intermediates. Taken together, our study illuminates the coordinate interplay of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 to regulate DSB repair outcomes in the germline.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94842">Differential conformational dynamics in two type-A RNA-binding domains drive the double-stranded RNA recognition and binding</a></h4>

              
                Trans-activation response (TAR) RNA-binding protein (TRBP) has emerged as a key player in the RNA interference pathway, wherein it binds to different pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), each varying in sequence and/or structure. We hypothesize that TRBP displays dynamic adaptability to accommodate heterogeneity in target RNA structures. Thus, it is crucial to ascertain the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced protein dynamics in RNA recognition and binding. We have previously elucidated the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational exchange in the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1) of TRBP in shape-dependent RNA recognition. The current study delves into the intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics of the TRBP-dsRBD2 and then compares it with the dsRBD1 study carried out previously. Remarkably, the two domains exhibit differential binding affinity to a 12-bp dsRNA owing to the presence of critical residues and structural plasticity. Furthermore, we report that dsRBD2 depicts constrained conformational plasticity when compared to dsRBD1. Although, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes induced conformational exchange within the designated RNA-binding regions and other residues, the amplitude of the motions remains modest when compared to those observed in dsRBD1. We propose a dynamics-driven model of the two tandem domains of TRBP, substantiating their contributions to the versatility of dsRNA recognition and binding.

	<p>Bodily self-consciousness (BSC), a subject of interdisciplinary interest, refers to the awareness of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s bodily states. Previous studies have noted the existence of individual differences in BSC, while neglecting the underlying factors and neural basis of such individual differences. Considering that BSC relied on integration from both internal and external self-relevant information, we here review previous findings on individual differences in BSC through a three-level-self model, which includes interoceptive, exteroceptive, and mental self-processing. The data show that cross-level factors influenced individual differences in BSC, involving internal bodily signal perceptibility, multisensory processing principles, personal traits shaped by environment, and interaction modes that integrate multiple levels of self-processing. Furthermore, in interoceptive processing, regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and insula show correlations with different perceptions of internal sensations. For exteroception, the parietal lobe integrates sensory inputs, coordinating various BSC responses. Mental self-processing modulates differences in BSC through areas like the medial prefrontal cortex. For interactions between multiple levels of self-processing, regions like the intraparietal sulcus involve individual differences in BSC. We propose that diverse experiences of BSC can be attributed to different levels of self-processing, which moderates one&amp;amp;rsquo;s perception of their body. Overall, considering individual differences in BSC is worth amalgamating diverse methodologies for the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases.</p>

	<p>Aggression is a fundamental behavior with essential roles in dominance assertion, resource acquisition, and self-defense across the animal kingdom. However, dysregulation of the aggression circuitry can have severe consequences in humans, leading to economic, emotional, and societal burdens. Previous inconsistencies in aggression research have been due to limitations in techniques for studying these neurons at a high spatial resolution, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying aggression. Recent advancements in optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and in vivo electrophysiology have provided new insights into this complex circuitry. This review aims to explore the aggression-provoking stimuli and their detection in rodents, particularly through the olfactory systems. Additionally, we will examine the core regions associated with aggression, their interactions, and their connection with the prefrontal cortex. We will also discuss the significance of top-down cognitive control systems in regulating atypical expressions of aggressive behavior. While the focus will primarily be on rodent circuitry, we will briefly touch upon the modulation of aggression in humans through the prefrontal cortex and discuss emerging therapeutic interventions that may benefit individuals with aggression disorders. This comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates of aggression will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and clinical interventions. This approach contrasts with the broader perspective on neural mechanisms of aggression across species, aiming for a more focused analysis of specific pathways and their implications for therapeutic interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0140242024?rss=1">D-Serine Inhibits Non-ionotropic NMDA Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are widely recognized as master regulators of synaptic plasticity, most notably for driving long-term changes in synapse size and strength that support learning. NMDARs are unique among neurotransmitter receptors in that they require binding of both neurotransmitter (glutamate) and co-agonist (e.g., <scp>d</scp>-serine) to open the receptor channel, which leads to the influx of calcium ions that drive synaptic plasticity. Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated that NMDARs also support synaptic plasticity via ion flux-independent (non-ionotropic) signaling upon the binding of glutamate in the absence of co-agonist, although conflicting results have led to significant controversy. Here, we hypothesized that a major source of contradictory results might be attributed to variable occupancy of the co-agonist binding site under different experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated co-agonist availability in acute hippocampal slices from mice of both sexes. We found that enzymatic scavenging of endogenous co-agonists enhanced the magnitude of long-term depression (LTD) induced by non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling in the presence of the NMDAR pore blocker MK801. Conversely, a saturating concentration of <scp>d</scp>-serine completely inhibited LTD and spine shrinkage induced by glutamate binding in the presence of MK801 or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay in cultured neurons, we further found that <scp>d</scp>-serine completely blocked NMDA-induced conformational movements of the GluN1 cytoplasmic domains in the presence of MK801. Our results support a model in which <scp>d</scp>-serine availability serves to modulate NMDAR signaling and synaptic plasticity even when the NMDAR is blocked by magnesium.</p>

                <p>Recent work demonstrated that activation of spinal D1 and D5 dopamine receptors (D1/D5Rs) facilitates non-Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) at primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons. However, the cellular localization of the D1/D5Rs driving non-Hebbian LTP in spinal nociceptive circuits remains unknown, and it is also unclear whether D1/D5R signaling must occur concurrently with sensory input in order to promote non-Hebbian LTP at these synapses. Here we investigate these issues using cell-type&ndash;selective knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs from lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, or astrocytes in adult mice of either sex using Cre recombinase-based genetic strategies. The LTP evoked by low-frequency stimulation of primary afferents in the presence of the selective D1/D5R agonist SKF82958 persisted following the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinoparabrachial neurons, suggesting that postsynaptic D1/D5R signaling was dispensable for non-Hebbian plasticity at sensory synapses onto these key output neurons of the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). Similarly, the knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs in DRG neurons failed to influence SKF82958-enabled LTP in lamina I projection neurons. In contrast, SKF82958-induced LTP was suppressed by the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinal astrocytes. Furthermore, the data indicate that the activation of D1R/D5Rs in spinal astrocytes can either retroactively or proactively drive non-Hebbian LTP in spinoparabrachial neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that dopaminergic signaling in astrocytes can strongly promote activity-dependent LTP in the SDH, which is predicted to significantly enhance the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission from the spinal cord to the brain.</p>

                <p>MicroRNAs are emerging as crucial regulators within the complex, dynamic environment of the synapse, and they offer a promising new avenue for the treatment of neurological disease. These small noncoding RNAs modify gene expression in several ways, including posttranscriptional modulation via binding to complementary and semicomplementary sites on target mRNAs. This rapid, finely tuned regulation of gene expression is essential to meet the dynamic demands of the synapse. Here, we provide a detailed review of the multifaceted world of synaptic microRNA regulation. We discuss the many mechanisms by which microRNAs regulate gene expression at the synapse, particularly in the context of neuronal plasticity. We also describe the various factors, such as age, sex, and neurological disease, that can influence microRNA expression and activity in neurons. In summary, microRNAs play a crucial role in the intricate and quickly changing functional requirements of the synapse, and context is essential in the study of microRNAs and their potential therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>During natural behavior, an action often needs to be suddenly stopped in response to an unexpected sensory input&mdash;referred to as reactive stopping. Reactive stopping has been mostly investigated in humans, which led to hypotheses about the involvement of different brain structures, in particular the hyperdirect pathway. Here, we directly investigate the contribution and interaction of two key regions of the hyperdirect pathway, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), using dual-area, multielectrode recordings in male rats performing a stop-signal task. In this task, rats have to initiate movement to a go-signal, and occasionally stop their movement to the go-signal side after a stop-signal, presented at various stop-signal delays. Both the OFC and STN show near-simultaneous field potential reductions in the beta frequency range (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) compared with the period preceding the go-signal and the movement period. These transient reductions (~200&nbsp;ms) only happen during reactive stopping, which is when the stop-signal was received after action initiation, and are well timed after stop-signal onset and before the estimated time of stopping. Phase synchronization analysis also showed a transient attenuation of synchronization between the OFC and STN in the beta range during reactive stopping. The present results provide the first direct quantification of local neural oscillatory activity in the OFC and STN and interareal synchronization specifically timed during reactive stopping.</p>

                <p>The mechanisms utilized by neurons to regulate the efficacy of phasic and tonic inhibition and their impacts on synaptic plasticity and behavior are incompletely understood. Cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (Clptm1) is a membrane-spanning protein that interacts with multiple -aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) subunits, trapping them in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network. Overexpression and knock-down studies suggest that Clptm1 modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-mediated phasic inhibition and tonic inhibition as well as activity-induced inhibitory synaptic homeostasis in cultured hippocampal neurons. To investigate the role of Clptm1 in the modulation of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in vivo, we generated Clptm1 knock-out (KO) mice. Here, we show that genetic KO of Clptm1 elevated phasic and tonic inhibitory transmission in both male and female heterozygous mice. Although basal excitatory synaptic transmission was not affected, Clptm1 haploinsufficiency significantly blocked high-frequency stimulation-induced long&ndash;term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA3-&gt;CA1 synapses. In the hippocampus-dependent contextual fear-conditioning behavior task, both male and female Clptm1 heterozygous KO mice exhibited impairment in contextual fear memory. In addition, LTP and contextual fear memory were rescued by application of L-655,708, a negative allosteric modulator of the extrasynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R &alpha;5 subunit. These results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Clptm1 contributes to cognitive deficits through altered synaptic transmission and plasticity by elevation of inhibitory neurotransmission, with tonic inhibition playing a major role.</p>

                <p>Activity of central amygdala (CeA) PKC expressing neurons has been linked to appetite regulation, anxiety-like behaviors, pain sensitivity, and addiction-related behaviors. Studies of the role that CeA PKC+ neurons play in these behaviors have largely been carried out in mice, and genetic tools that would allow selective manipulation of PKC+ cells in rats have been lacking. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate a transgenic <I>Prkcd</I>-cre knock-in rat and characterized this model using anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches in both sexes. In the CeA, Cre was selectively expressed in PKC+ cells. Anterograde projections of PKC+ neurons to cortical regions, subcortical regions, several hypothalamic nuclei, the amygdala complex, and midbrain dopaminergic regions were largely consistent with published mouse data. In a behavioral screen, we found no differences between Cre<sup>+</sup> rats and Cre<sup>&ndash;</sup> wild-type littermates. Optogenetic stimulation of CeA PKC+ neurons in a palatable food intake assay resulted in an increased latency to first feeding and decreased total food intake, once again replicating published mouse findings. Lastly, using a real-time place preference task, we found that stimulation of PKC+ neurons promoted aversion, without affecting locomotor activity. Collectively, these findings establish the novel <I>Prkcd</I>-Cre rat line as a valuable tool that complements available mouse lines for investigating the functional role of PKC+ neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0629242024?rss=1">The Consolidation of Newly Learned Movements Depends upon the Somatosensory Cortex in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Studies using magnetic brain stimulation indicate the involvement of somatosensory regions in the acquisition and retention of newly learned movements. Recent work found an impairment in motor memory when retention was tested shortly after the application of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to the primary somatosensory cortex, compared with stimulation of the primary motor cortex or a control zone. This finding that the somatosensory cortex is involved in motor memory retention whereas the motor cortex is not, if confirmed, could alter our understanding of human motor learning. It would indicate that plasticity in sensory systems underlies newly learned movements, which is different than the commonly held view that adaptation learning involves updates to a motor controller. Here we test this idea. Participants were trained in a visuomotor adaptation task, with visual feedback gradually shifted. Following adaptation, cTBS was applied either to M1, S1, or an occipital cortex control area. Participants were tested for retention 24&nbsp;h later. It was observed that S1 stimulation led to reduced retention of prior learning, compared with stimulation of M1 or the control area (with no significant difference between M1 and control). In a further control, cTBS was applied to S1 following training with unrotated feedback, in which no learning occurred. This had no effect on movement in the retention test indicating the effects of S1 stimulation on movement are learning specific. The findings are consistent with the S1 participation in the encoding of learning-related changes to movements and in the retention of human motor memory.</p>

                <p>Sleep slow waves are the hallmark of deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep. It is generally assumed that gray matter properties predict slow-wave density, morphology, and spectral power in healthy adults. Here, we tested the association between gray matter volume (GMV) and slow-wave characteristics in 27 patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI, 32.0 &plusmn; 12.2&nbsp;years old, eight women) and compared that with 32 healthy controls (29.2 &plusmn; 11.5&nbsp;years old, nine women). Participants underwent overnight polysomnography and cerebral MRI with a 3&nbsp;Tesla scanner. A whole-brain voxel&ndash;wise analysis was performed to compare GMV between groups. Slow-wave density, morphology, and spectral power (0.4&ndash;6&nbsp;Hz) were computed, and GMV was extracted from the thalamus, cingulate, insula, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex to test the relationship between slow waves and gray matter in regions implicated in the generation and/or propagation of slow waves. Compared with controls, TBI patients had significantly lower frontal and temporal GMV and exhibited a subtle decrease in slow-wave frequency. Moreover, higher GMV in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, and precuneus was associated with higher slow-wave frequency and slope, but only in healthy controls. Higher orbitofrontal GMV was also associated with higher slow-wave density in healthy participants. While we observed the expected associations between GMV and slow-wave characteristics in healthy controls, no such associations were observed in the TBI group despite lower GMV. This finding challenges the presumed role of GMV in slow-wave generation and morphology.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e1868232024?rss=1">Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality Is Associated with Increased Reactivity to Uncertain Threat in the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis, Not the Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE)&mdash;the tendency to experience anxiety, fear, and other negative emotions&mdash;is a fundamental dimension of temperament with profound consequences for health, wealth, and well-being. Elevated N/NE is associated with a panoply of adverse outcomes, from reduced socioeconomic attainment to psychiatric illness. Animal research suggests that N/NE reflects heightened reactivity to uncertain threat in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce), but the relevance of these discoveries to humans has remained unclear. Here we used a novel combination of psychometric, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging approaches to test this hypothesis in an ethnoracially diverse, sex-balanced sample of 220 emerging adults selectively recruited to encompass a broad spectrum of N/NE. Cross-validated robust-regression analyses demonstrated that N/NE is preferentially associated with heightened BST activation during the uncertain anticipation of a genuinely distressing threat (aversive multimodal stimulation), whereas N/NE was unrelated to BST activation during certain-threat anticipation, Ce activation during either type of threat anticipation, or BST/Ce reactivity to threat-related faces. It is often assumed that different threat paradigms are interchangeable assays of individual differences in brain function, yet this has rarely been tested. Our results revealed negligible associations between BST/Ce reactivity to the anticipation of threat and the presentation of threat-related faces, indicating that the two tasks are nonfungible. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing emotional traits and disorders; for guiding the design and interpretation of biobank and other neuroimaging studies of psychiatric risk, disease, and treatment; and for refining mechanistic research.</p>

                <p>Overexpression of the agouti-signaling protein (<I>asip1</I>), an endogenous melanocortin antagonist, under the control of a constitutive promoter in zebrafish [Tg(Xla.Eef1a1:Cau.Asip1]iim4] (<I>asip1</I>-Tg) increases food intake by reducing sensitivity of the central satiety systems and abolish circadian activity rhythms. The phenotype also shows increased linear growth and body weight, yet no enhanced aggressiveness in dyadic fights is observed. In fact, <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals choose to flee to safer areas rather than face a potential threat, thus suggesting a potential anxiety-like behavior (ALB). Standard behavioral tests, i.e., the open field test (OFT), the novel object test (NOT), and the novel tank dive test (NTDT), were used to investigate thigmotaxis and ALB in male and female zebrafish. Results showed that the <I>asip1</I>-Tg strain exhibited severe ALB in every test, mainly characterized by pronounced freezing behavior and increased linear and angular swimming velocities. <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals exhibited low central serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) levels and high turnover rates, thus suggesting that central monoaminergic pathways might mediate melanocortin antagonist-induced ALB. Accordingly, the treatment of <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reversed the ALB phenotype in NTDT as well as 5-HT turnover. Genomic and anatomical data further supported neuronal interaction between melanocortinergic and serotonergic systems. These results suggest that inhibition of the melanocortin system by ubiquitous overexpression of endogenous antagonist has an anxiogenic effect mediated by serotonergic transmission.</p>

                <p>Little is known about the electrophysiologic activity of the intact human spinal cord during volitional movement. We analyzed epidural spinal recordings from a total of five human subjects of both sexes during a variety of upper extremity movements and found that these spinal epidural electrograms contain spectral information distinguishing periods of movement, rest, and sensation. Cervical epidural electrograms also contained spectral changes time-locked with movement. We found that these changes were primarily associated with increased power in the theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) band and feature increased theta phase to gamma amplitude coupling, and this increase in theta power can be used to topographically map distinct upper extremity movements onto the cervical spinal cord in accordance with established myotome maps of the upper extremity. Our findings have implications for the development of neurostimulation protocols and devices focused on motor rehabilitation for the upper extremity, and the approach presented here may facilitate spatiotemporal mapping of naturalistic movements.</p>

                <p>Serial dependence has shown seemingly contradictory effects on visual perception and working memory. While serial dependence promotes perpetual and mnemonic stability, it biases behavioral reports toward prior information. The neural mechanisms that drive both biasing and adaptive stabilizing effects are not well understood. We proposed and tested a reactivation and integration mechanism that can account for these contradictory effects. We used multivariate pattern analyses of EEG data (26 human participants, 17 females, 9 males) to examine the reactivation of prior reported orientation during the delay period of a visual working memory task. The reactivation strength of prior reports, but not prior sensory items, was predictive of the magnitude of serial dependency biases. These reactivated representations integrated with the representation of the current memory item and improved the ability to decode the current contents of memory. Overall, our data provide convergent evidence suggesting that prior reports in a visual working memory task are reactivated on the subsequent trial and become integrated with current memory representations. This similarity-dependent reactivation mechanism drives both report biasing and stabilization effects attributed to serial dependence in working memory.</p>

                <p>It has long been assumed that activity patterns persist in neuronal circuits after they are first experienced, as part of the process of information processing and storage by the brain. However, these "reverberations" of current activity have not been directly observed on a single-neuron level in a mammalian system. Here we demonstrate that specific induced activity patterns are retained in mature cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. Neurons within the network are induced to fire at a single frequency or in a more complex pattern containing two distinct frequencies. After the stimulation was stopped, the subsequent neuronal activity of hundreds of neurons in the network was monitored. In the case of single-frequency stimulation, it was observed that many of the neurons continue to fire at the same frequency that they were stimulated to fire at. Using a recurrent neural network trained to detect specific, more complex patterns, we found that the multiple-frequency stimulation patterns were also retained within the neuronal network. Moreover, it appears that the component frequencies of the more complex patterns are stored in different populations of neurons and neuron subtypes.</p>

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concomitant illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months after the ethics committee’s approval. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in early identification and prevention of DDIs, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

Vinculin binds to specific sites of mechanically unfolded talin rod domains to reinforce the coupling of the cell’s exterior to its force generation machinery. Force-dependent vinculin–talin complexation and dissociation was previously observed as contraction or extension of the unfolded talin domains respectively using magnetic tweezers. However, the structural mechanism underlying vinculin recognition of unfolded vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in talin remains unknown. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that a VBS dynamically refolds under force, and that vinculin can recognize and bind to partially unfolded VBS states. Vinculin binding enables refolding of the mechanically strained VBS and stabilizes its folded α-helical conformation, providing resistance against mechanical stress. Together, these results provide an understanding of a recognition mechanism of proteins unfolded by force and insight into the initial moments of how vinculin binds unfolded talin rod domains during the assembly of this mechanosensing meshwork.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012329">Bird song comparison using deep learning trained from avian perceptual judgments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lies Zandberg, Veronica Morfi, Julia M. George, David F. Clayton, Dan Stowell, Robert F. Lachlan</p>

Our understanding of bird song, a model system for animal communication and the neurobiology of learning, depends critically on making reliable, validated comparisons between the complex multidimensional syllables that are used in songs. However, most assessments of song similarity are based on human inspection of spectrograms, or computational methods developed from human intuitions. Using a novel automated operant conditioning system, we collected a large corpus of zebra finches’ (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) decisions about song syllable similarity. We use this dataset to compare and externally validate similarity algorithms in widely-used publicly available software (Raven, Sound Analysis Pro, Luscinia). Although these methods all perform better than chance, they do not closely emulate the avian assessments. We then introduce a novel deep learning method that can produce perceptual similarity judgements trained on such avian decisions. We find that this new method outperforms the established methods in accuracy and more closely approaches the avian assessments. Inconsistent (hence ambiguous) decisions are a common occurrence in animal behavioural data; we show that a modification of the deep learning training that accommodates these leads to the strongest performance. We argue this approach is the best way to validate methods to compare song similarity, that our dataset can be used to validate novel methods, and that the general approach can easily be extended to other species.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012282">Protein superfolds are characterised as frustration-free topologies: A case study of pure parallel β-sheet topologies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hiroto Murata, Kazuma Toko, George Chikenji</p>

A protein superfold is a type of protein fold that is observed in at least three distinct, non-homologous protein families. Structural classification studies have revealed a limited number of prevalent superfolds alongside several infrequent occurring folds, and in <i>α</i>/<i>β</i> type superfolds, the C-terminal <i>β</i>-strand tends to favor the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet, while the N-terminal <i>β</i>-strand is often found in the middle. The reasons behind these observations, whether they are due to evolutionary sampling bias or physical interactions, remain unclear. This article offers a physics-based explanation for these observations, specifically for pure parallel <i>β</i>-sheet topologies. Our investigation is grounded in several established structural rules that are based on physical interactions. We have identified “frustration-free topologies” which are topologies that can satisfy all the rules simultaneously. In contrast, topologies that cannot are termed “frustrated topologies.” Our findings reveal that frustration-free topologies represent only a fraction of all theoretically possible patterns, these topologies strongly favor positioning the C-terminal <i>β</i>-strand at the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet and the N-terminal <i>β</i>-strand in the middle, and there is significant overlap between frustration-free topologies and superfolds. We also used a lattice protein model to thoroughly investigate sequence-structure relationships. Our results show that frustration-free structures are highly designable, while frustrated structures are poorly designable. These findings suggest that superfolds are highly designable due to their lack of frustration, and the preference for positioning C-terminal <i>β</i>-strands at the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet is a direct result of frustration-free topologies. These insights not only enhance our understanding of sequence-structure relationships but also have significant implications for de novo protein design.

Understanding the dynamic evolution of <i>Salmonella</i> is vital for effective bacterial infection management. This study explores the role of the flexible genome, organised in regions of genomic plasticity (RGP), in shaping the pathogenicity of <i>Salmonella</i> lineages. Through comprehensive genomic analysis of 12,244 <i>Salmonella</i> spp. genomes covering 2 species, 6 subspecies, and 46 serovars, we uncover distinct integration patterns of pathogenicity-related gene clusters into RGP, challenging traditional views of gene distribution. These RGP exhibit distinct preferences for specific genomic spots, and the presence or absence of such spots across <i>Salmonella</i> lineages profoundly shapes strain pathogenicity. RGP preferences are guided by conserved flanking genes surrounding integration spots, implicating their involvement in regulatory networks and functional synergies with integrated gene clusters. Additionally, we emphasise the multifaceted contributions of plasmids and prophages to the pathogenicity of diverse <i>Salmonella</i> lineages. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive blueprint of the pathogenicity potential of <i>Salmonella</i>. This unique insight identifies genomic spots in nonpathogenic lineages that hold the potential for harbouring pathogenicity genes, providing a foundation for predicting future adaptations and developing targeted strategies against emerging human pathogenic strains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-904/v1?src=rss">Stage 2 Registered Report Personal factors and group creative outcomes: A correlational meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has indicated that individual differences play a role in group creativity. Group creativity activities have different outcomes, leading to numerous ways to assess the effectiveness of these creative activities. To date, no meta-analysis has been performed on the relationship between the outcomes of the creative activity and personal factors of the group members. In this Registered Report, we conducted a meta-analysis (n = 11, k = 72) on the relationship between personal factors and group creativity outcomes. We found weak support for a positive correlation between self-efficacy and group creativity outcomes, between r = .04 and r = .67. We found weak support for a moderation effect of time constraint, with stronger relationships for conditions limited to 20 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes. Finally, we found that only a few studies could be included in the meta-analysis, because many studies (1) did not directly measure creativity, or (2) measured other, less common personal factors. We call for a more systematic and direct approach to measuring creativity and an improvement of open science practices in the field.
