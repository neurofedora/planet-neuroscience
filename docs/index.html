              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15875">A Model-Free Method to Quantify Memory Utilization in Neural Point Processes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the predictive capacity of a neural system, intended as the capability to store information and actively use it for dynamic system evolution, is a key component of neural information processing. Information storage (IS), the main measure quantifying the active utilization of memory in a dynamic system, is only defined for discrete-time processes. While recent theoretical work laid the foundations for the continuous-time analysis of the predictive capacity stored in a process, methods for the effective computation of the related measures are needed to favor widespread utilization on neural data. This work introduces a method for the model-free estimation of the so-called memory utilization rate (MUR), the continuous-time counterpart of the IS, specifically designed to quantify the predictive capacity stored in neural point processes. The method employs nearest-neighbor entropy estimation applied to the inter-spike intervals measured from point-process realizations to quantify the extent of memory used by a spike train. An empirical procedure based on surrogate data is implemented to compensate the estimation bias and detect statistically significant levels of memory. The method is validated in simulated Poisson processes and in realistic models of coupled cortical dynamics and heartbeat dynamics. It is then applied to real spike trains reflecting central and autonomic nervous system activities: in spontaneously growing cortical neuron cultures, the MUR detected increasing memory utilization across maturation stages, associated to emergent bursting synchronized activity; in the study of the neuro-autonomic modulation of human heartbeats, the MUR reflected the sympathetic activation occurring with postural but not with mental stress. The proposed approach offers a computationally reliable tool to analyze spike train data in computational neuroscience and physiology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15982">Thoughtseeds: Evolutionary Priors, Nested Markov Blankets, and the Emergence of Embodied Cognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neurocomputational mechanisms. This paper introduces the "thoughtseed" framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called "thoughtseeds." We leverage evolutionary theory, "neuronal packets," and the "Inner Screen" hypothesis within Free Energy Principle, and propose a four-level hierarchical model of the cognitive agent's internal states: Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), thoughtseeds network, and meta-cognition. The dynamic interplay within this hierarchy, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. The framework further explores the role of the organism's Umwelt and the principles of active inference, especially the generative model at each nested level, in shaping the selection and activation of thoughtseeds, leading to adaptive behavior through surprise minimization. The "Inner Screen" is posited as the locus of conscious experience, where the content of the dominant thoughtseed is projected, maintaining a unitary conscious experience. Active thoughtseeds are proposed as the fundamental units of thought that contribute to the "content of consciousness." We present a mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory. The thoughtseed framework represents an initial but promising step towards a novel, biologically-grounded model for understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, offering a unified account of cognitive phenomena, from basic physiological regulation to higher-order thought processes, and potentially bridge neuroscience and contemplative traditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05645">Geometric Neural Network based on Phase Space for BCI-EEG decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.05645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on brain signal analysis is still in its nascent stages compared to their success in fields like Computer Vision. This is particularly true for BCI, where the brain activity is decoded to control external devices without requiring muscle control. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. Approach: Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method and the framework of SPDNet, we propose the Phase-SPDNet architecture and analyze its performance and the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. Main results: The results of our Phase-SPDNet demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. Significance: This new architecture is explainable and with a low number of trainable parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12091">Unsupervised discovery of the shared and private geometry in multi-view data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.12091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern applications often leverage multiple views of a subject of study. Within neuroscience, there is growing interest in large-scale simultaneous recordings across multiple brain regions. Understanding the relationship between views (e.g., the neural activity in each region recorded) can reveal fundamental principles about the characteristics of each representation and about the system. However, existing methods to characterize such relationships either lack the expressivity required to capture complex nonlinearities, describe only sources of variance that are shared between views, or discard geometric information that is crucial to interpreting the data. Here, we develop a nonlinear neural network-based method that, given paired samples of high-dimensional views, disentangles low-dimensional shared and private latent variables underlying these views while preserving intrinsic data geometry. Across multiple simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms competing methods. Using simulated populations of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 neurons we demonstrate our model's ability to discover interpretable shared and private structure across different noise conditions. On a dataset of unrotated and corresponding but randomly rotated MNIST digits, we recover private latents for the rotated view that encode rotation angle regardless of digit class, and places the angle representation on a 1-d manifold, while shared latents encode digit class but not rotation angle. Applying our method to simultaneous Neuropixels recordings of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex while mice run on a linear track, we discover a low-dimensional shared latent space that encodes the animal's position. We propose our approach as a general-purpose method for finding succinct and interpretable descriptions of paired data sets in terms of disentangled shared and private latent variables.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15800">Emulating Brain-like Rapid Learning in Neuromorphic Edge Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving personalized intelligence at the edge with real-time learning capabilities holds enormous promise in enhancing our daily experiences and helping decision making, planning, and sensing. However, efficient and reliable edge learning remains difficult with current technology due to the lack of personalized data, insufficient hardware capabilities, and inherent challenges posed by online learning.
  Over time and across multiple developmental stages, the brain has evolved to efficiently incorporate new knowledge by gradually building on previous knowledge. In this work, we emulate the multiple stages of learning with digital neuromorphic technology that simulates the neural and synaptic processes of the brain using two stages of learning. First, a meta-training stage trains the hyperparameters of synaptic plasticity for one-shot learning using a differentiable simulation of the neuromorphic hardware. This meta-training process refines a hardware local three-factor synaptic plasticity rule and its associated hyperparameters to align with the trained task domain. In a subsequent deployment stage, these optimized hyperparameters enable fast, data-efficient, and accurate learning of new classes. We demonstrate our approach using event-driven vision sensor data and the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor with its plasticity dynamics, achieving real-time one-shot learning of new classes that is vastly improved over transfer learning. Our methodology can be deployed with arbitrary plasticity models and can be applied to situations demanding quick learning and adaptation at the edge, such as navigating unfamiliar environments or learning unexpected categories of data through user engagement.

                arXiv:2408.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of multifunctionality has enabled reservoir computers (RCs), a type of dynamical system that is typically realised as an artificial neural network, to reconstruct multiple attractors simultaneously using the same set of trained weights. However there are many additional phenomena that arise when training a RC to reconstruct more than one attractor. Previous studies have found that, in certain cases, if the RC fails to reconstruct a coexistence of attractors then it exhibits a form of metastability whereby, without any external input, the state of the RC switches between different modes of behaviour that resemble properties of the attractors it failed to reconstruct. In this paper we explore the origins of these switching dynamics in a paradigmatic setting via the `seeing double' problem.

                arXiv:2408.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.

                arXiv:2408.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has advanced in medicine, its widespread use in clinical applications, especially in predicting breast cancer metastasis, is still limited. We have been dedicated to constructing a DFNN model to predict breast cancer metastasis n years in advance. However, the challenge lies in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameter values through grid search, given the constraints of time and resources. Issues such as the infinite possibilities for continuous hyperparameters like l1 and l2, as well as the time-consuming and costly process, further complicate the task. To address these challenges, we developed Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) strategy, serving as a preselection method before grid search. Our experiments with SHGS applied to DFNN models for breast cancer metastasis prediction focus on analyzing eight target hyperparameters: epochs, batch size, dropout, L1, L2, learning rate, decay, and momentum. We created three figures, each depicting the experiment results obtained from three LSM-I-10-Plus-year datasets. These figures illustrate the relationship between model performance and the target hyperparameter values. For each hyperparameter, we analyzed whether changes in this hyperparameter would affect model performance, examined if there were specific patterns, and explored how to choose values for the particular hyperparameter. Our experimental findings reveal that the optimal value of a hyperparameter is not only dependent on the dataset but is also significantly influenced by the settings of other hyperparameters. Additionally, our experiments suggested some reduced range of values for a target hyperparameter, which may be helpful for low-budget grid search. This approach serves as a prior experience and foundation for subsequent use of grid search to enhance model performance.

                arXiv:2408.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind flow can be highly unpredictable and can suffer substantial fluctuations in speed and direction due to the shape and height of hills, mountains, and valleys, making accurate wind speed (WS) forecasting essential in complex terrain. This paper presents a novel and adaptive model for short-term forecasting of WS. The paper's key contributions are as follows: (a) The Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) is utilised to minimise the dimension of the set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), hence reducing training time; (b) The sample entropy (SampEn) was used to calculate the complexity of the reduced set of IMFs. The proposed technique is adaptive since a specific Deep Learning (DL) model-feature combination was chosen based on complexity; (c) A novel bidirectional feature-LSTM framework for complicated IMFs has been suggested, resulting in improved forecasting accuracy; (d) The proposed model shows superior forecasting performance compared to the persistence, hybrid, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)-based deep learning models. It has achieved the lowest variance in terms of forecasting accuracy between simple and complex terrain conditions 0.70%. Dimension reduction of IMF's and complexity-based model-feature selection helps reduce the training time by 68.77% and improve forecasting quality by 58.58% on average.

                arXiv:2405.02850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address general optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating general optimization problems and providing valuable insights into its performance. The test of HEO in Pressure Vessel Design and Tubular Column Design infers its feasibility and potential in real-time applications. Further validation in Osmancik-97 and Cammeo Rice Classification proves the effectiveness of HEO and achieves a higher accuracy record.

                arXiv:2408.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining popularity in the computational simulation and artificial intelligence fields owing to their biological plausibility and computational efficiency. This paper explores the historical development of SNN and concludes that these two fields are intersecting and merging rapidly. Following the successful application of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS), SNNs have found some proper paradigms, such as continuous visual signal tracking, automatic speech recognition, and reinforcement learning for continuous control, that have extensively supported their key features, including spike encoding, neuronal heterogeneity, specific functional circuits, and multiscale plasticity. Compared to these real-world paradigms, the brain contains a spiking version of the biology-world paradigm, which exhibits a similar level of complexity and is usually considered a mirror of the real world. Considering the projected rapid development of invasive and parallel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as well as the new BCI-based paradigms that include online pattern recognition and stimulus control of biological spike trains, SNNs naturally leverage their advantages in energy efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The biological brain has inspired the present study of SNNs and effective SNN machine-learning algorithms, which can help enhance neuroscience discoveries in the brain by applying them to the new BCI paradigm. Such two-way interactions with positive feedback can accelerate brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence technology.

	<p>(1) Background: Our team has previously introduced the Single-Step Pedicle Screw System (SSPSS), which eliminates the need for K-wires, as a safe and effective method for percutaneous minimally invasive spine (MIS) pedicle screw placement. Despite this, there are ongoing concerns about the reliability and accuracy of screw placement in MIS procedures without traditional tools like K-wires and Jamshidi needles. To address these concerns, we evaluated the accuracy of the SSPSS workflow by comparing the planned intraoperative screw trajectories with the final screw positions. Traditionally, screw placement accuracy has been assessed by grading the final screw position using postoperative CT scans. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent lumbar interbody fusion, using intraoperative 3D navigation for screw placement. The planned screw trajectories were saved in the navigation system during each procedure, and postoperative CT scans were used to evaluate the implanted screws. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the Gertzbein and Robbins classification scores of the planned trajectories and the final screw positions. Accuracy was defined as a final screw position matching the classification of the planned trajectory. (3) Results: Out of 206 screws, 196 (95%) were accurately placed, with no recorded complications. (4) Conclusions: The SSPSS workflow, even without K-wires and other traditional instruments, facilitates accurate and reliable pedicle screw placement.</p>

	<p>A two-factor account has been proposed as an explanatory model for the formation and maintenance of delusions. The first factor refers to a neurocognitive process leading to a significant change in subjective experience; the second factor has been regarded as a failure in hypothesis evaluation characterized by an impairment in metacognitive ability. This study was focused on the assessment of metacognition in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the study were to measure the overconfidence in metacognitive judgments through the prediction of word list recall and to analyze the correlation between basic neurocognition (memory and executive function) and metacognition through a metamemory test and the severity of psychotic symptoms. Method: Fifty-one participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were evaluated. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms, and the subtest of metamemory included in the Executive Functions and Frontal Lobe-2 battery (BANFE-2) was used to evaluate overconfidence and underestimation errors, intrusion and perseverative response, total volume of recall, and Brief Functioning Assessment Scale (FAST) for social functioning. Results: The strongest correlation is observed between overconfidence errors and the positive factor of the PANSS (r = 0.774, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). For the enter model in the multiple linear regression (r = 0.78, r2 = 0.61; F = 24.57, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), the only significant predictor was overconfidence errors. Conclusion: Our results highlight the relevance of a metacognitive bias of overconfidence, strongly correlated with psychotic symptoms, and support the hypothesis that metacognitive defects contribute to the failure to reject contradictory evidence. From our perspective, these findings align with current mechanistic models of schizophrenia that focus on the role of the prefrontal cortex.</p>

                Background In recent years, the incidence of early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) has increased. Several studies comparing the survival of patients with EOPC to those with average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC) have reported mixed results. We aimed, therefore, to perform a meta-analysis summarizing the current evidence. Methods We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for relevant articles published through March 2024. Articles comparing the survival of patients with EOPC – defined as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed at ≤ 50 years of age – and AOPC were included in the present meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), and the risk of bias analysis was performed using the Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies tool. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Results A total of 17 studies were eligible for the primary analysis, the results of which indicated that patients with EOPC had a longer overall survival than those with AOPC (aHR = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74–0.86; P < 0.001). The rate of distant metastasis was higher in EOPC than AOPC; however, patients with EOPC also received more treatments than those with AOPC. Conclusions Patients with EOPC had a better prognosis than those with AOPC. Clinicians must ensure that patients with PDAC receive early and appropriate treatment to improve their survival.

                Background Measurement is essential for methods of instruction to be successful. Having an instrument that is reliable and validated in the given setting is vital. The primary goal of this research project is to validate the instructional practice scale (IPS) for university instructors in the Ethiopian context. Methods By implementing a cross-sectional descriptive survey research design, 1,254 participants across four public universities – Arbaminch, Dilla, Wachamo, and Jinka representing the first, second, third, and fourth generations, respectively were randomly selected and participated. The data was split in half and underwent an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results The three components of the EFA were alternately filled with seventeen items that satisfied certain standards, had a loading value of > .5, and a Cronbach alpha of ≥ .874. The factors identified in the EFA have been confirmed to be the thirteen items with loading, Cronbach alpha, Raykov’s rho coefficient (rho_A), composite reliability (CR) value of >.7, and Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of > .5. Tests of measurement and structural models showed a good fit. The Fornell-Larcker criterion, which is employed in discriminant validity analysis, demonstrates that the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlation it exhibits with other constructs. The correlations’ heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) ratio is getting close to zero, and there isn’t one in the confidence interval at the.05 significance level. Both guaranteed strong discriminant validity. Conclusion For university instructors, the 13 items generally have powerful psychometric properties. The three subsections of the instruction practice scale—planning (4 indicators), delivering (4 indicators), and assessment (5 indicators) — are meant to measure the instructional practice effectively. Implications of the findings were further discussed.

                <p>Sensory axons projecting to the central nervous system are organized into topographic maps that represent the locations of sensory stimuli. In some sensory systems, even adjacent sensory axons are arranged topographically, forming "fine-scale" topographic maps. Although several broad molecular gradients are known to instruct coarse topography, we know little about the molecular signaling that regulates fine-scale topography at the level of two adjacent axons. Here, we provide evidence that transsynaptic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling mediates local interneuronal communication to regulate fine-scale topography in the nociceptive system of <I>Drosophila</I> larvae. We first show that the topographic separation of the axon terminals of adjacent nociceptors requires their common postsynaptic target, the A08n neurons. This phenotype is recapitulated by knockdown of the BMP ligand, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), in these neurons. In addition, removing the Type 2 BMP receptors or their effector (Mad transcription factor) in single nociceptors impairs the fine-scale topography, suggesting the contribution of BMP signaling originated from A08n. This signaling is likely mediated by phospho-Mad in the presynaptic terminals of nociceptors to ensure local interneuronal communication. Finally, reducing Dpp levels in A08n reduces the nociceptor-A08n synaptic contacts. Our data support that transsynaptic BMP signaling establishes the fine-scale topography by facilitating the formation of topographically correct synapses. Local BMP signaling for synapse formation may be a developmental strategy that independently regulates neighboring axon terminals for fine-scale topography.</p>

                <p>Animal studies consistently demonstrate that testosterone is protective against pain in multiple models, including an animal model of activity-induced muscle pain. In this model, females develop widespread muscle hyperalgesia, and reducing testosterone levels in males results in widespread muscle hyperalgesia. Widespread pain is believed to be mediated by changes in the central nervous system, including the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). The enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol, aromatase, is highly expressed in the RVM. Therefore, we hypothesized that testosterone is converted by aromatase to estradiol locally in the RVM to prevent development of widespread muscle hyperalgesia in male mice. This was tested through pharmacological inhibition of estrogen receptors (ERs), aromatase, or ER-&alpha; in the RVM which resulted in contralateral hyperalgesia in male mice (C57BL/6J). ER inhibition in the RVM had no effect on hyperalgesia in female mice. As prior studies show modulation of estradiol signaling alters GABA receptor and transporter expression, we examined if removal of testosterone in males would decrease mRNA expression of GABA receptor subunits and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). However, there were no differences in mRNA expression of GABA receptor subunits of VGAT between gonadectomized and sham control males. Lastly, we used RNAscope to determine expression of ER-&alpha; in the RVM and show expression in inhibitory (VGAT+), serotonergic (tryptophan hydroxylase 2+), and &mu;-opioid receptor expressing (MOR+) cells. In conclusion, testosterone protects males from development of widespread hyperalgesia through aromatization to estradiol and activation of ER-&alpha; which is widely expressed in multiple cell types in the RVM.</p>

                <p>Comorbid chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety is a common disease that represents a major clinical challenge. The underlying mechanisms of chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety are not entirely understood, which limits the exploration of effective treatment methods. Glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) have been implicated in regulating pain, but the potential roles of the vlPAG in neuropathic pain-induced anxiety have not been investigated. Herein, whole-cell recording and immunofluorescence showed that the excitability of CamkII&alpha; neurons in the vlPAG (vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons) was decreased in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), while electroacupuncture (EA) activated these neurons. We also showed that chemogenetic inhibition of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons resulted in allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors in naive mice. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons reduced anxiety-like behaviors and allodynia in mice with SNI, and EA had a similar effect in alleviating these symptoms. Nevertheless, EA combined with chemogenetic activation failed to further relieve allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors. Artificial inhibition of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons abolished the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of EA. Overall, our study reveals a novel mechanism of neuropathic pain-induced anxiety and shows that EA may relieve comorbid chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety by activating vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/8/ENEURO.0481-23.2024?rss=1">A Method for Evaluating Hunger and Thirst in Monkeys by Measuring Blood Ghrelin and Osmolality Levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hunger and thirst drive animals&rsquo; consumption behavior and regulate their decision-making concerning rewards. We previously assessed the thirst states of monkeys by measuring blood osmolality under controlled water access and examined how these thirst states influenced their risk-taking behavior in decisions involving fluid rewards. However, hunger assessment in monkeys remains poorly performed. Moreover, the lack of precise measures for hunger states leads to another issue regarding how hunger and thirst states interact with each other in each individual. Thus, when controlling food access to motivate performance, it remains unclear how these two physiological needs are satisfied in captive monkeys. Here, we measured blood ghrelin and osmolality levels to respectively assess hunger and thirst in four captive macaques. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we identified that the levels of blood ghrelin, a widely measured hunger-related peptide hormone in humans, were high after 20&nbsp;h of no food access (with <I>ad libitum</I> water). This reflects a typical controlled food access condition. One hour after consuming a regular dry meal, the blood ghrelin levels in three out of four monkeys decreased to within their baseline range. Additionally, blood osmolality measured from the same blood sample, the standard hematological index of hydration status, increased after consuming the regular dry meal with no water access. Thus, ghrelin and osmolality may reflect the physiological states of individual monkeys regarding hunger and thirst, suggesting that these indices can be used as tools for monitoring hunger and thirst levels that mediate an animal's decision to consume rewards.</p>

                <p>Recent advances in extracellular electrophysiology now facilitate the recording of spikes from hundreds or thousands of neurons simultaneously. This has necessitated both the development of new computational methods for spike sorting and better methods to determine spike-sorting accuracy. One long-standing method of assessing the false discovery rate (FDR) of spike sorting&mdash;the rate at which spikes are assigned to the wrong cluster&mdash;has been the rate of interspike interval (ISI) violations. Despite their near ubiquitous usage in spike sorting, our understanding of how exactly ISI violations relate to FDR, as well as best practices for using ISI violations as a quality metric, remains limited. Here, we describe an analytical solution that can be used to predict FDR from the ISI violation rate (ISI<SUB>v</SUB>). We test this model in silico through Monte Carlo simulation and apply it to publicly available spike-sorted electrophysiology datasets. We find that the relationship between ISI<SUB>v</SUB> and FDR is highly nonlinear, with additional dependencies on firing frequency, the correlation in activity between neurons, and contaminant neuron count. Predicted median FDRs in public datasets recorded in mice were found to range from 3.1 to 50.0%. We found that stochasticity in the occurrence of ISI violations as well as uncertainty in cluster-specific parameters make it difficult to predict FDR for single clusters with high confidence but that FDR can be estimated accurately across a population of clusters. Our findings will help the growing community of researchers using extracellular electrophysiology assess spike-sorting accuracy in a principled manner.</p>

                <p><I>ATP1A3</I> is a Na,K-ATPase gene expressed specifically in neurons in the brain. Human mutations are dominant and produce an unusually wide spectrum of neurological phenotypes, most notably rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). Here we compared heterozygotes of two mouse lines, a line with little or no expression (<I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup>) and a knock-in expressing p.Asp801Tyr (D801Y, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup>). Both mouse lines had normal lifespans, but <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> had mild perinatal mortality contrasting with D801N mice (<I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801N</sup>), which had high mortality. The phenotypes of <I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> and <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> were different, and testing of each strain was tailored to its symptom range. <I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> mice displayed little at baseline, but repeated ethanol intoxication produced hyperkinetic motor abnormalities not seen in littermate controls. <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice displayed robust phenotypes: hyperactivity, diminished posture consistent with hypotonia, and deficiencies in beam walk and wire hang tests. Symptoms also included qualitative motor abnormalities that are not well quantified by conventional tests. Paradoxically, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> showed sustained better performance than wild type on the accelerating rotarod. <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were overactive in forced swimming and afterward had intense shivering, transient dystonic postures, and delayed recovery. Remarkably, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were refractory to ketamine anesthesia, which elicited hyperactivity and dyskinesia even at higher dose. Neither mouse line exhibited fixed dystonia (typical of RDP patients), spontaneous paroxysmal weakness (typical of AHC patients), or seizures but had consistent, measurable neurological abnormalities. A gradient of variation supports the importance of studying multiple <I>Atp1a3</I> mutations in animal models to understand the roles of this gene in human disease.</p>

                <p>Long-term aluminum (Al) exposure increases the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of the present study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of Al-induced MCI. In our study, a total of 52 individuals with occupational Al exposure &gt;10&nbsp;years were enrolled and divided into two groups: MCI (Al-MCI) and healthy controls (Al-HC). Plasma Al concentrations and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were collected for all participants. And diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to examine changes of white matter (WM) and functional connectivity (FC). There was a negative correlation between MoCA score and plasma Al concentration. Compared with the Al-HC, fractional anisotropy value for the right fornix (cres)/stria terminalis (FX/ST) was higher in the Al-MCI. Furthermore, there was a difference in FC between participants with and without MCI under Al exposure. We defined the regions with differing FC as a "pathway," specifically the connectivity from the right temporal pole to the right FX/ST, then to the right sagittal stratum, and further to the right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri and right inferior frontal gyrus, orbital part. In summary, we believe that the observed differences in WM integrity and FC in the right FX/ST between participants with and without MCI under long-term Al exposure may represent the neural mechanisms underlying MCI induced by Al exposure.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key cortical region for pain perception and emotion. Different forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), have been reported in the ACC. Synaptic tagging of LTP plays an important role in hippocampus-related associative memory. In this study, we demonstrate that synaptic tagging of LTD is detected in the ACC of adult male and female mice. This form of tagged LTD requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1). The induction of tagged LTD is time-related with the strongest tagged LTD appearing when the interval between two independent stimuli is 30&nbsp;min. Inhibitors of mGluR1 blocked the induction of tagged LTD; however, blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors did not affect the induction of tagged LTD. Nimodipine, an inhibitor of L-type voltage&ndash;gated calcium channels, also blocked tagged LTD. In an animal model of amputation, we found that tagged LTD was either reduced or completely blocked. Together with our previous report of tagged LTP in the ACC, this study strongly suggests that excitatory synapses in the adult ACC are highly plastic. The biphasic tagging of synaptic transmission provides a new form of heterosynaptic plasticity in the ACC which has functional and pathophysiological significance in phantom pain.</p>

                <p>Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) is generally considered to be a proxy for phasic firing of the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA<SUB>DA</SUB>) neurons. Thus, dopamine release in NAcC is hypothesized to reflect a unitary role in reward prediction error signaling. However, recent studies reveal more diverse roles of dopamine neurons, which support an emerging idea that dopamine regulates learning differently in distinct circuits. To understand whether the NAcC might regulate a unique component of learning, we recorded dopamine release in NAcC while male rats performed a backward conditioning task where a reward is followed by a neutral cue. We used this task because we can delineate different components of learning, which include sensory-specific inhibitory and general excitatory components. Furthermore, we have shown that VTA<SUB>DA</SUB> neurons are necessary for both the specific and general components of backward associations. Here, we found that dopamine release in NAcC increased to the reward across learning while reducing to the cue that followed as it became more expected. This mirrors the dopamine prediction error signal seen during forward conditioning and cannot be accounted for temporal-difference reinforcement learning. Subsequent tests allowed us to dissociate these learning components and revealed that dopamine release in NAcC reflects the general excitatory component of backward associations, but not their sensory-specific component. These results emphasize the importance of examining distinct functions of different dopamine projections in reinforcement learning.</p>

                <p>In retinitis pigmentosa (RP), rod and cone photoreceptors degenerate, depriving downstream neurons of light-sensitive input, leading to vision impairment or blindness. Although downstream neurons survive, some undergo morphological and physiological remodeling. Bipolar cells (BCs) link photoreceptors, which sense light, to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send information to the brain. While photoreceptor loss disrupts input synapses to BCs, whether BC output synapses remodel has remained unknown. Here we report that synaptic output from BCs plummets in RP mouse models of both sexes owing to loss of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Remodeling reduces the reliability of synaptic output to repeated optogenetic stimuli, causing RGC firing to fail at high-stimulus frequencies. Fortunately, functional remodeling of BCs can be reversed by inhibiting the retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR inhibitors targeted to BCs present a new therapeutic opportunity for mitigating detrimental effects of remodeling on signals initiated either by surviving photoreceptors or by vision-restoring tools.</p>

                <p>TFEB and TFE3 (TFEB/3), key regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, play diverse roles depending on cell type. This study highlights a hitherto unrecognized role of TFEB/3 crucial for peripheral nerve repair. Specifically, they promote the generation of progenitor-like repair Schwann cells after axonal injury. In Schwann cell-specific TFEB/3 double knock-out mice of either sex, the TFEB/3 loss disrupts the transcriptomic reprogramming that is essential for the formation of repair Schwann cells. Consequently, mutant mice fail to populate the injured nerve with repair Schwann cells and exhibit defects in axon regrowth, target reinnervation, and functional recovery. TFEB/3 deficiency inhibits the expression of injury-responsive repair Schwann cell genes, despite the continued expression of c<I>-jun</I>, a previously identified regulator of repair Schwann cell function. TFEB/3 binding motifs are enriched in the enhancer regions of injury-responsive genes, suggesting their role in repair gene activation. Autophagy-dependent myelin breakdown is not impaired despite TFEB/3 deficiency. These findings underscore a unique role of TFEB/3 in adult Schwann cells that is required for proper peripheral nerve regeneration.</p>

                <p>The ventral frontal cortex (VFC) in macaques is involved in many affective and cognitive processes and has a key role in flexibly guiding reward-based decision-making. VFC is composed of a set of anatomically distinct subdivisions that are within the orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. In part, because prior studies have lacked the resolution to test for differences, it is unclear if neural representations related to decision-making are dissociable across these subdivisions. Here we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons within eight anatomically defined subdivisions of VFC in male macaque monkeys performing a two-choice probabilistic task for different fruit juice outcomes. We found substantial variation in the encoding of decision variables across these eight subdivisions. Notably, ventrolateral Area 12l was unique relative to the other areas that we recorded from as the activity of single neurons integrated multiple attributes when monkeys evaluated the different choice options. Activity within Area 12o, in contrast, more closely represented reward probability and whether reward was received on a given trial. Orbitofrontal Area 11m/l contained more specific representations of the quality of the outcome that could be earned later on. We also found that reward delivery encoding was highly distributed across all VFC subdivisions, while the properties of the reward, such as its flavor, were more strongly represented in Areas 11m/l and 13m. Taken together, our work reveals the diversity of encoding within the various anatomically distinct subdivisions of VFC in primates.</p>

                <p>Mitochondrial population maintenance in neurons is essential for neuron function and survival. Contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are poised to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. These contact sites can facilitate transfer of calcium and lipids between the organelles and have been shown to regulate aspects of mitochondrial dynamics. Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VapB) is an ER membrane protein present at a subset of ER&ndash;mitochondrial contact sites. A proline-to-serine mutation in VapB at amino acid 56 (P56S) correlates with susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) type 8. Given the relationship between failed mitochondrial health and neurodegenerative disease, we investigated the function of VapB in mitochondrial population maintenance. We demonstrated that transgenic expression of VapB<sup>P56S</sup> in zebrafish larvae (sex undetermined) increased mitochondrial biogenesis, causing increased mitochondrial population size in the axon terminal. Expression of wild-type VapB did not alter biogenesis but, instead, increased mitophagy in the axon terminal. Using genetic manipulations to independently increase mitochondrial biogenesis, we show that biogenesis is normally balanced by mitophagy to maintain a constant mitochondrial population size. VapB<sup>P56S</sup> transgenics fail to increase mitophagy to compensate for the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting an impaired mitophagic response. Finally, using a synthetic ER&ndash;mitochondrial tether, we show that VapB's function in mitochondrial turnover is likely independent of ER&ndash;mitochondrial tethering by contact sites. Our findings demonstrate that VapB can control mitochondrial turnover in the axon terminal, and this function is altered by the P56S ALS-linked mutation.</p>

                <p>The cerebral cortex contains multiple, distinct areas that individually perform specific computations. A particular strength of the cortex is the communication of signals between cortical areas that allows the outputs of these compartmentalized computations to influence and build on each other, thereby dramatically increasing the processing power of the cortex and its role in sensation, action, and cognition. Determining how the cortex communicates signals between individual areas is, therefore, critical for understanding cortical function. Historically, corticocortical communication was thought to occur exclusively by direct anatomical connections between areas that often sequentially linked cortical areas in a hierarchical fashion. More recently, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence is accumulating indicating a role for the higher-order thalamus in corticocortical communication. Specifically, the transthalamic pathway involves projections from one area of the cortex to neurons in the higher-order thalamus that, in turn, project to another area of the cortex. Here, we consider the evidence for and implications of having two routes for corticocortical communication with an emphasis on unique processing available in the transthalamic pathway and the consequences of disorders and diseases that affect transthalamic communication.</p>

                <p>Infection causes reduced activity, anorexia, and sleep, which are components of the phylogenetically conserved but poorly understood sickness behavior. We developed a <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> model to study quiescence during chronic infection, using infection with the Orsay virus. The Orsay virus infects intestinal cells yet strongly affects behavior, indicating gut-to-nervous system communication. Infection quiescence has the sleep properties of reduced responsiveness and rapid reversibility. Both the ALA and RIS neurons regulate virus-induced quiescence though ALA plays a more prominent role. Quiescence-defective animals have decreased survival when infected, indicating a benefit of quiescence during chronic infectious disease. The survival benefit of quiescence is not explained by a difference in viral load, indicating that it improves resilience rather than resistance to infection. Orsay infection is associated with a decrease in ATP levels, and this decrease is more severe in quiescence-defective animals. We propose that quiescence preserves energetic resources by reducing energy expenditures and/or by increasing extraction of energy from nutrients. This model presents an opportunity to explore the role of sleep and fatigue in chronic infectious illness.</p>

                <p>The fluid movement of an arm requires multiple spatiotemporal parameters to be set independently. Recent studies have argued that arm movements are generated by the collective dynamics of neurons in motor cortex. An untested prediction of this hypothesis is that independent parameters of movement must map to independent components of the neural dynamics. Using a task where three male monkeys made a sequence of reaching movements to randomly placed targets, we show that the spatial and temporal parameters of arm movements are independently encoded in the low-dimensional trajectories of population activity in motor cortex: each movement&rsquo;s direction corresponds to a fixed neural trajectory through neural state space and its speed to how quickly that trajectory is traversed. Recurrent neural network models show that this coding allows independent control over the spatial and temporal parameters of movement by separate network parameters. Our results support a key prediction of the dynamical systems view of motor cortex, and also argue that not all parameters of movement are defined by different trajectories of population activity.</p>

                <p>Protein synthesis in response to neuronal activity, known as activity-dependent translation, is critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. However, the signaling cascades that couple neuronal activity to the translational events remain elusive. In this study, we identified the role of calmodulin (CaM), a conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein, in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis in neurons. We found the CaM-regulated rRNA synthesis is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and necessary for nascent protein synthesis and axon growth in hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, CaM interacts with nucleolar DEAD (Asp&ndash;Glu&ndash;Ala&ndash;Asp) box RNA helicase (DDX21) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner to regulate nascent rRNA transcription within nucleoli. We further found CaM alters the conformation of DDX21 to liberate the DDX21-sequestered RPA194, the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase I, to facilitate transcription of ribosomal DNA. Using high-throughput screening, we identified the small molecules batefenterol and indacaterol that attenuate the CaM-DDX21 interaction and suppress nascent rRNA synthesis and axon growth in hippocampal neurons. These results unveiled the previously unrecognized role of CaM as a messenger to link the activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to the nucleolar events essential for protein synthesis. We thus identified the ability of CaM to transmit information to the nucleoli of neurons in response to stimulation.</p>

                <p>Sleep control depends on a delicate interplay among brain regions. This generates a complex temporal architecture with numerous sleep-stage transitions and intermittent fluctuations to micro-states and brief arousals. These temporal dynamics exhibit hallmarks of criticality, suggesting that tuning to criticality is essential for spontaneous sleep-stage and arousal transitions. However, how the brain maintains criticality remains not understood. Here, we investigate <I></I>- and <I></I>-burst dynamics during the sleep&ndash;wake cycle of rats (Sprague&ndash;Dawley, adult male) with lesion in the wake-promoting locus coeruleus (LC). We show that, in control rats, <I></I>- and <I></I>-bursts exhibit power-law (<I></I>-bursts, active phase) and exponential-like (<I></I>-bursts, quiescent phase) duration distributions, as well as power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs)&mdash;typical of non-equilibrium systems self-organizing at criticality. Furthermore, consecutive <I></I>- and <I></I>-bursts durations are characterized by anti-correlated coupling, indicating a new class of self-organized criticality that emerges from underlying feedback between neuronal populations and brain areas involved in generating arousals and sleep states. In contrast, we uncover that LC lesion leads to alteration of <I></I>- and <I></I>-burst critical features, with change in duration distributions and correlation properties, and increase in <I></I>&ndash;<I></I> coupling. Notably, these LC-lesion effects are opposite to those observed for lesions in the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) nucleus. Our findings indicate that critical dynamics of <I></I>- and <I></I>-bursts arise from a balanced interplay of LC and VLPO, which maintains brain tuning to criticality across the sleep&ndash;wake cycle&mdash;a non-equilibrium behavior in sleep micro-architecture at short timescales that coexists with large-scale sleep&ndash;wake homeostasis.</p>

                Objective This systematic literature review aimed to study the relationship between CML and hearing loss. Database review Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy associated with high levels of white blood cells (WBCs). Changes in otolaryngology are observed in CML. Methodology This systematic literature review of the literature was conducted by searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, WPRIM, LILAC Sand SciELO databases. Studies published between 2013 and 2023 that met inclusion criteria were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Results Of the 142 identified articles, 13 were included for final evaluation with a total sample size of 75 cases diagnosed with CML with hearing defect. CML patients with WBCs above 250 x 109/L were at higher risk of ototoxicity. Males accounted for 85% of cases; with a mean age of 38.9 years. Hearing loss as the first manifestation of CML was among 61.5% of cases, it was bilateral in 83.3% of cases, and in 90% of cases were irreversible defect. Conclusion Acute sudden hearing loss has been associated with high levels of WBC in patients with CML. Neither aggressive leukoreduction nor leukapheresis has positive effect on the reversibility of the hearing loss.

                Introduction Sexual dysfunctions are common yet underreported side effects of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, affecting 30-80% of treated individuals. These side effects can severely impact social interactions and treatment adherence for individuals with schizophrenia, but comprehensive comparative evidence assessing the risk profiles of different antipsychotics is lacking. This study aims to address this gap using network meta-analysis that integrates data from both randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS). Protocol This systematic review will include both RCTs and NRS focusing on participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses, without restrictions on symptoms, gender, ethnicity, age, or setting. For interventions, all second-generation antipsychotics will be included. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one sexual adverse event of any kind. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of any sexual adverse event evaluated in men and women separately, and any adverse event related to the three phases of sexual response cycle separately: desire (e.g. libido, sexual thoughts), arousal (e.g. erection, lubrication) and orgasm (e.g. ejaculation, anorgasmia), and any adverse effect related to breast dysfunction and menstruation irregularities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 and ROBINS-I will be employed to evaluate the risk of bias for RCTs and NRS, respectively. Single-arm meta-analysis of proportions will synthesize the average frequency of sexual adverse events in treated participants. Pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs and NRS will be used to evaluate comparative tolerability. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will explore possible heterogeneity in results and validate the findings’ robustness. The quality of the evidence will be evaluated using GRADE. Discussion This study will provide vital insights into the sexual side effects of antipsychotics by combining evidence from clinical trials and real-world practice, facilitating better decision-making in choosing the optimal antipsychotic for individuals.

Recent studies show that cellular neighborhoods play an important role in evolving biological events such as cancer and diabetes. Therefore, it is critical to accurately and efficiently identify cellular neighborhoods from spatially-resolved single-cell transcriptomic data or single-cell resolution tissue imaging data. In this work, we develop CNTools, a computational toolbox for end-to-end cellular neighborhood analysis on annotated cell images, comprising both the identification and analysis steps. It includes state-of-the-art cellular neighborhood identification methods and post-identification smoothing techniques, with our newly proposed Cellular Neighbor Embedding (CNE) method and Naive Smoothing technique, as well as several established downstream analysis approaches. We applied CNTools on three real-world CODEX datasets and evaluated identification methods with smoothing techniques quantitatively and qualitatively. It shows that CNE with Naive Smoothing overall outperformed other methods and revealed more convincing biological insights. We also provided suggestions on how to choose proper identification methods and smoothing techniques according to input data.

                \textbf{Background:}Rhizomania counts as the most important disease in sugar beet (\textit{Beta vulgaris} L.) for which no plant protection is available, leaving plant breeding as the only defence strategy at the moment. Five resistance genes have been detected on the same chromosome and further studies suggested that these might be different alleles at two resistance clusters. Nevertheless, it was postulated that rhizomania resistance might be a quantitative trait with multiple unknown minor resistance genes. Here, we present a first attempt at genomic prediction of rhizomania resistance in a population that was genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. \newline \textbf{Methods:} First, genomic prediction was performed using all SNPs. Next, we calculated the variable importance for each SNP using machine learning and performed genomic prediction by including the SNPs incrementally in the prediction model based on their variable importance. Using this method, we selected the optimal number of SNPs that maximised the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we performed genomic prediction with SNP pairs. We also performed feature selection with SNP pairs using the information about the variable importance of the single SNPs. \newline \textbf{Results:} From the four methods under investigation, the latter led to the highest prediction accuracy. These results lead to the following conclusions: (I) The genotypes that were resistant at all known resistance genes, provided the highest possible variation of virus concentrations that the machine can measure. Thus, it can be assumed that more genes must be involved in the resistance towards rhizomania. (II) We show that prediction models that include SNP interactions increased the prediction accuracy. \newline \textbf{Conclusions:} Altogether, our findings suggest that rhizomania resistance is a complex quantitative trait that is affected by multiple genes as well as their interaction.

                Introduction Poweromin X Ten (PXT) is a polyherbal formulation, traditionally used to enhance male sexual function. However, the safety and benefits of PXT have not been scientifically evaluated. Therefore, the present study investigated the toxicity and aphrodisiac potential of PXT in male rats and explored its principal mechanisms of action. Methods Male Wistar rats were orally administered PXT (50 or 100 mg/kg) for 28 days, and sexual activity parameters, including latency and frequency of mounting and intromissions, were studied. The reproductive toxicity and spermatogenic potential were also examined. Furthermore, dopamine and serotonin levels in brain regions associated with sexual activity were assessed. Network analysis was used to identify the key bioactive compounds and their core targets involved in their beneficial actions. Results Treatment with PXT improved sexual activity in male rats, as evidenced by reduced mounting and intromission latency and a significant increase in mount frequency. Moreover, PXT exhibited spermatogenic potential and did not induce reproductive toxicity. Notably, treatment with 50 mg/kg PXT elevated dopamine levels in median preoptic area and hypothalamus. Pathway analysis indicated that PXT primarily modulated the PI3K-Akt, calcium, and MAPK signalling pathways to enhance male sexual function. Network analysis identified macelignan, β-estradiol, testosterone, and paniculatine as key bioactive components of PXT, which likely act through core targets, such as androgen receptor (AR), Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate the improvement of male sexual function. Conclusion Study results suggest that PXT is a safer alternative with aphrodisiac and spermatogenic potential. These effects are partly attributed to the enhanced dopamine levels in the brain. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the specific signalling pathways and bioactive compounds that underlie the improvements in male sexual function associated with PXT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-642/v2?src=rss">Evaluation of centralised and decentralised models of care during the 2020 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo: A brief report [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditionally in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), centralised Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been set exclusively for Ebola virus disease (EVD) case management during outbreaks. During the 2020 EVD outbreak in DRC’s Equateur Province, existing health centres were equipped as decentralised treatment centres (DTC) to improve access for patients with suspected EVD. Between ETCs and DTCs, we compared the time from symptom onset to admission and diagnosis among patients with suspected EVD. Methods This was a cohort study based on analysis of a line-list containing demographic and clinical information of patients with suspected EVD admitted to any EVD health facility during the outbreak. Results Of 2359 patients with suspected EVD, 363 (15%) were first admitted to a DTC. Of 1996 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to an ETC, 72 (4%) were confirmed as EVD-positive. Of 363 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to a DTC, 6 (2%) were confirmed and managed as EVD-positive in the DTC. Among all EVD-suspected patients, the median (interquartile range) duration between symptom onset and admission was 2 (1-4) days in a DTC compared to 4 (2-7) days in an ETC (p<0.001). Similarly, time from symptom onset to admission was significantly shorter among EVD-suspected patients ultimately diagnosed as EVD-negative. Conclusions Since <5% of the EVD-suspected patients admitted were eventually diagnosed with EVD, there is a need for better screening to optimise resource utilization and outbreak control. Only one in seven EVD-suspected patients were admitted to a DTC first, as the DTCs were piloted in a limited and phased manner. However, there is a case to be made for considering decentralized care especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas in places like the DRC to facilitate early access to care, contain viral shedding by patients with EVD and ensure no disrupted provision of non-EVD services.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The transcriptional heterogeneity at a single-nucleus level in human Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) dystrophic muscle has not been explored. Here, we aimed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity associated with myonuclei, as well as other mononucleated cell types that underly BMD pathogenesis by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We profiled single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle samples from 7 BMD patients and 3 normal controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 17,216 nuclei (12,879 from BMD patients and 4,337 from controls) were classified into 13 known cell types, including 9 myogenic lineages and 4 non-myogenic lineages, and 1 unclassified nuclear type according to their cell identities. Among them, type IIx myonuclei were the first to degenerate in response to dystrophin reduction. Differential expression analysis revealed that the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) population had the largest transcriptional changes among all cell types. Sub-clustering analysis identified a significantly compositional increase in the activated FAPs (aFAPs) subpopulation in BMD muscles. Pseudotime analysis, regulon inference, and deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data derived from 29 BMD patients revealed that the aFAPs subpopulation, a distinctive and previously unrecognized mononuclear subtype, was profibrogenic and expanded in BMD patients. Muscle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of the aFAPs markers including <i>LUM</i>, <i>DCN</i>, and <i>COL1A1</i> in BMD patients were significantly higher than those in controls, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity of human BMD muscle at a single-nucleus resolution and new potential targets for anti-fibrosis therapies in BMD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27069?af=R">Mapping Functional Connectivity Signatures of Pharmacoresistant Focal Cortical Dysplasia‐Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine common network alterations in focal cortical dysplasia pharmacoresistant epilepsy (FCD-PRE) using functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective imaging cohort from Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA) from January, 2011 to January, 2022. Patients with 3-T MRI-confirmed FCD-PRE underwent rsfMRI as part of routine clinical care. Patients were included if they were age 5–22 years at the time of the scan, and had a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. Healthy, typically-developing controls were included from Children's National Hospital (n = 16) and matched from Human Connectome Project-Development public dataset (n = 100).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 42 FCD-PRE patients (20 M:22 F, aged 14.2 ± 4.1 years) and 116 healthy controls (56 M:60 F, aged 13.7 ± 3.3 years) with rsfMRI were included. Seed-based functional connectivity maps were generated for each FCD, and each seed was used to generate a patient-specific z-scored connectivity map on 116 controls. FCD-PRE patients had mutual altered connectivity in regions of dorsal attention, default mode, and control networks. Functional connectivity was diminished within the FCD dominant functional network, as well as in homotopic regions. Cluster specific connectivity patterns varied by pathological subtype. Higher FCD connectivity to the limbic network was associated with increased odds of Engel I outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates diminished functional connectivity patterns in FCD-PRE, which may represent a neuromarker for the disease, independent of FCD location, involving the dorsal attention, default mode, and control functional networks. Higher connectivity to the limbic network is associated with a seizure-free outcome. Future multicenter, prospective studies are needed to allow for much earlier detection of signatures of treatment-resistant epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Amiri et al. report that fluid forces cause upstream migration of confined cells via mechanisms involving the cytoskeleton, nucleus, and ion channels. This migration is less likely under conditions of chemotaxis or high hydraulic resistance. Metastatic cells with low levels of lamin A/C display reduced mechanosensitivity, resulting in downstream migration.

                Bats are reservoir hosts of many viruses, harboring these viruses using unique mechanisms of viral tolerance. However, immunological study has been impaired by a lack of suitable tools. Chen et al. address this limitation by the usage of a panel of bat-specific monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometry.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that MOF regulates LPS-induced macrophage activation via PRDX1 K197 acetylation. Loss of MOF-mediated PRDX1 acetylation increases LPS-induced hydrogen peroxide accumulation, specifically augments ERK1/2 phosphorylation, enhances glycolytic metabolism, and ultimately primes the transcriptional activation of inflammatory genes via H3 S28 phosphorylation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96534">Sex-dependent, lateralized engagement of anterior insular cortex inputs to the dorsolateral striatum in binge alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                How does alcohol consumption alter synaptic transmission across time, and do these alcohol-induced neuroadaptations occur similarly in both male and female mice? Previously we identified that anterior insular cortex (AIC) projections to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are uniquely sensitive to alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in male, but not female mice, and play a role in governing binge alcohol consumption in male mice (Haggerty et al., 2022). Here, by using high-resolution behavior data paired with in-vivo fiber photometry, we show how similar levels of alcohol intake are achieved via different behavioral strategies across sexes, and how inter-drinking session thirst states predict future alcohol intakes in females, but not males. Furthermore, we show how presynaptic calcium activity recorded from AIC synaptic inputs in the DLS across 3 weeks of water consumption followed by 3 weeks of binge alcohol consumption changes across, fluid, time, sex, and brain circuit lateralization. By time-locking presynaptic calcium activity from AIC inputs to the DLS to peri-initiation of drinking events we also show that AIC inputs into the left DLS robustly encode binge alcohol intake behaviors relative to water consumption. These findings suggest a fluid-, sex-, and lateralization-dependent role for the engagement of AIC inputs into the DLS that encode binge alcohol consumption behaviors and further contextualize alcohol-induced neuroadaptations at AIC inputs to the DLS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95229">Senescent cells inhibit mouse myoblast differentiation via the SASP-lipid 15d-PGJ2 mediated modification and control of HRas</a></h4>

              
                Senescent cells are characterized by multiple features such as increased expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA β-gal) and cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 or p16. They accumulate with tissue damage and dysregulate tissue homeostasis. In the context of skeletal muscle, it is known that agents used for chemotherapy such as Doxorubicin (Doxo) cause buildup of senescent cells, leading to the inhibition of tissue regeneration. Senescent cells influence the neighboring cells via numerous secreted factors which form the senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP). Lipids are emerging as a key component of SASP that can control tissue homeostasis. Arachidonic acid-derived lipids have been shown to accumulate within senescent cells, specifically 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, which is an electrophilic lipid produced by the non-enzymatic dehydration of the prostaglandin PGD<sub>2</sub>. This study shows that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is also released by Doxo-induced senescent cells as an SASP factor. Treatment of skeletal muscle myoblasts with the conditioned medium from these senescent cells inhibits myoblast fusion during differentiation. Inhibition of L-PTGDS, the enzyme that synthesizes PGD<sub>2</sub>, diminishes the release of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> by senescent cells and restores muscle differentiation. We further show that this lipid post-translationally modifies Cys184 of HRas in C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts, causing a reduction in the localization of HRas to the Golgi, increased HRas binding to Ras Binding Domain (RBD) of RAF Kinase (RAF-RBD), and activation of cellular Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) kinase–Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (Erk) signaling (but not the Akt signaling). Mutating C184 of HRas prevents the ability of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> to inhibit the differentiation of muscle cells and control the activity of HRas. This work shows that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> released from senescent cells could be targeted to restore muscle homeostasis after chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93510">Structure of the human heparan-α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT)</a></h4>

              
                Degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) comprised of repeating units of <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid, begins in the cytosol and is completed in the lysosomes. Acetylation of the terminal non-reducing amino group of α-D-glucosamine of HS is essential for its complete breakdown into monosaccharides and free sulfate. Heparan-α-glucosaminide <i>N</i>-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT), a resident of the lysosomal membrane, catalyzes this essential acetylation reaction by accepting and transferring the acetyl group from cytosolic acetyl-CoA to terminal α-D-glucosamine of HS in the lysosomal lumen. Mutation-induced dysfunction in HGSNAT causes abnormal accumulation of HS within the lysosomes and leads to an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC). There are no approved drugs or treatment strategies to cure or manage the symptoms of, MPS IIIC. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a high-resolution structure of the HGSNAT-acetyl-CoA complex, the first step in the HGSNAT-catalyzed acetyltransferase reaction. In addition, we map the known MPS IIIC mutations onto the structure and elucidate the molecular basis for mutation-induced HGSNAT dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94438">Insights into metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer gained from fluorescence lifetime imaging</a></h4>

              
                Heterogeneity of tumor metabolism is an important, but still poorly understood aspect of tumor biology. Present work is focused on the visualization and quantification of cellular metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of redox cofactor NAD(P)H. FLIM-microscopy of NAD(P)H was performed in vitro in four cancer cell lines (HT29, HCT116, CaCo2 and CT26), in vivo in the four types of colorectal tumors in mice and ex vivo in patients’ tumor samples. The dispersion and bimodality of the decay parameters were evaluated to quantify the intercellular metabolic heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that patients’ colorectal tumors have significantly higher heterogeneity of energy metabolism compared with cultured cells and tumor xenografts, which was displayed as a wider and frequently bimodal distribution of a contribution of a free (glycolytic) fraction of NAD(P)H within a sample. Among patients’ tumors, the dispersion was larger in the high-grade and early stage ones, without, however, any association with bimodality. These results indicate that cell-level metabolic heterogeneity assessed from NAD(P)H FLIM has a potential to become a clinical prognostic factor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92806">Botulinum toxin intoxication requires retrograde transport and membrane translocation at the ER in RenVM neurons</a></h4>

              
                Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) is a highly potent proteolytic toxin specific for neurons with numerous clinical and cosmetic uses. After uptake at the synapse, the protein is proposed to translocate from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol through a self-formed channel. Surprisingly, we found that after intoxication proteolysis of a fluorescent reporter occurs in the neuron soma first and then centrifugally in neurites. To investigate the molecular mechanisms at play, we use a genome-wide siRNA screen in genetically engineered neurons and identify over three hundred genes. An organelle-specific split-mNG complementation indicates BoNT/A traffic from the synapse to the soma-localized Golgi in a retromer-dependent fashion. The toxin then moves to the ER and appears to require the Sec61 complex for retro-translocation to the cytosol. Our study identifies genes and trafficking processes hijacked by the toxin, revealing a new pathway mediating BoNT/A cellular toxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93978">Feedback inhibition by a descending GABAergic neuron regulates timing of escape behavior in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Escape behaviors help animals avoid harm from predators and other threats in the environment. Successful escape relies on integrating information from multiple stimulus modalities (of external or internal origin) to compute trajectories toward safe locations, choose between actions that satisfy competing motivations, and execute other strategies that ensure survival. To this end, escape behaviors must be adaptive. When a <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larva encounters a noxious stimulus, such as the focal pressure a parasitic wasp applies to the larval cuticle via its ovipositor, it initiates a characteristic escape response. The escape sequence consists of an initial abrupt bending, lateral rolling, and finally rapid crawling. Previous work has shown that the detection of noxious stimuli primarily relies on class IV multi-dendritic arborization neurons (Class IV neurons) located beneath the body wall, and more recent studies have identified several important components in the nociceptive neural circuitry involved in rolling. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie the rolling-escape sequence remain unclear. Here, we present both functional and anatomical evidence suggesting that bilateral descending neurons within the subesophageal zone of <i>D. melanogaster</i> larva play a crucial role in regulating the termination of rolling and subsequent transition to escape crawling. We demonstrate that these descending neurons (designated SeIN128) are inhibitory and receive inputs from a second-order interneuron upstream (Basin-2) and an ascending neuron downstream of Basin-2 (A00c). Together with optogenetic experiments showing that co-activation of SeIN128 neurons and Basin-2 influence the temporal dynamics of rolling, our findings collectively suggest that the ensemble of SeIN128, Basin-2, and A00c neurons forms a GABAergic feedback loop onto Basin-2, which inhibits rolling and thereby facilitates the shift to escape crawling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/78206">CCL28 modulates neutrophil responses during infection with mucosal pathogens</a></h4>

              
                The chemokine CCL28 is highly expressed in mucosal tissues, but its role during infection is not well understood. Here we show that CCL28 promotes neutrophil accumulation in the gut of mice infected with <i>Salmonella</i> and in the lung of mice infected with <i>Acinetobacter</i>. Neutrophils isolated from the infected mucosa expressed the CCL28 receptors CCR3 and, to a lesser extent, CCR10, on their surface. The functional consequences of CCL28 deficiency varied between the two infections: <i>Ccl28</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were highly susceptible to <i>Salmonella</i> gut infection but highly resistant to otherwise lethal <i>Acinetobacter</i> lung infection. <i>In vitro</i>, unstimulated neutrophils harbored pre-formed intracellular CCR3 that was rapidly mobilized to the cell surface following phagocytosis or inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, CCL28 stimulation enhanced neutrophil antimicrobial activity, production of reactive oxygen species, and formation of extracellular traps, all processes largely dependent on CCR3. Consistent with the different outcomes in the two infection models, neutrophil stimulation with CCL28 boosted the killing of <i>Salmonella</i> but not <i>Acinetobacter</i>. CCL28 thus plays a critical role in the immune response to mucosal pathogens by increasing neutrophil accumulation and activation, which can enhance pathogen clearance but also exacerbate disease depending on the mucosal site and the infectious agent.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93562">On the pH-dependence of α-synuclein amyloid polymorphism and the role of secondary nucleation in seed-based amyloid propagation</a></h4>

              
                The aggregation of the protein α-synuclein is closely associated with several neurodegenerative disorders and as such the structures of the amyloid fibril aggregates have high scientific and medical significance. However, there are dozens of unique atomic-resolution structures of these aggregates, and such a highly polymorphic nature of the α-synuclein fibrils hampers efforts in disease-relevant in vitro studies on α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. In order to better understand the factors that affect polymorph selection, we studied the structures of α-synuclein fibrils in vitro as a function of pH and buffer using cryo-EM helical reconstruction. We find that in the physiological range of pH 5.8–7.4, a pH-dependent selection between Type 1, 2, and 3 polymorphs occurs. Our results indicate that even in the presence of seeds, the polymorph selection during aggregation is highly dependent on the buffer conditions, attributed to the non-polymorph-specific nature of secondary nucleation. We also uncovered two new polymorphs that occur at pH 7.0 in phosphate-buffered saline. The first is a monofilament Type 1 fibril that highly resembles the structure of the juvenile-onset synucleinopathy polymorph found in patient-derived material. The second is a new Type 5 polymorph that resembles a polymorph that has been recently reported in a study that used diseased tissues to seed aggregation. Taken together, our results highlight the shallow amyloid energy hypersurface that can be altered by subtle changes in the environment, including the pH which is shown to play a major role in polymorph selection and in many cases appears to be the determining factor in seeded aggregation. The results also suggest the possibility of producing disease-relevant structure in vitro.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88805">Dynamic control of sequential retrieval speed in networks with heterogeneous learning rules</a></h4>

              
                Temporal rescaling of sequential neural activity has been observed in multiple brain areas during behaviors involving time estimation and motor execution at variable speeds. Temporally asymmetric Hebbian rules have been used in network models to learn and retrieve sequential activity, with characteristics that are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. However, in these models sequential activity is retrieved at a fixed speed. Here, we investigate the effects of a heterogeneity of plasticity rules on network dynamics. In a model in which neurons differ by the degree of temporal symmetry of their plasticity rule, we find that retrieval speed can be controlled by varying external inputs to the network. Neurons with temporally symmetric plasticity rules act as brakes and tend to slow down the dynamics, while neurons with temporally asymmetric rules act as accelerators of the dynamics. We also find that such networks can naturally generate separate ‘preparatory’ and ‘execution’ activity patterns with appropriate external inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91745">Recent evolutionary origin and localized diversity hotspots of mammalian coronaviruses</a></h4>

              
                Several coronaviruses infect humans, with three, including the SARS-CoV2, causing diseases. While coronaviruses are especially prone to induce pandemics, we know little about their evolutionary history, host-to-host transmissions, and biogeography. One of the difficulties lies in dating the origination of the family, a particularly challenging task for RNA viruses in general. Previous cophylogenetic tests of virus-host associations, including in the Coronaviridae family, have suggested a virus-host codiversification history stretching many millions of years. Here, we establish a framework for robustly testing scenarios of ancient origination and codiversification <i>versus</i> recent origination and diversification by host switches. Applied to coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts, our results support a scenario of recent origination of coronaviruses in bats and diversification by host switches, with preferential host switches within mammalian orders. Hotspots of coronavirus diversity, concentrated in East Asia and Europe, are consistent with this scenario of relatively recent origination and localized host switches. Spillovers from bats to other species are rare, but have the highest probability to be towards humans than to any other mammal species, implicating humans as the evolutionary intermediate host. The high host-switching rates within orders, as well as between humans, domesticated mammals, and non-flying wild mammals, indicates the potential for rapid additional spreading of coronaviruses across the world. Our results suggest that the evolutionary history of extant mammalian coronaviruses is recent, and that cases of long-term virus–host codiversification have been largely over-estimated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87634">Differential increase of hippocampal subfield volume after socio-affective mental training relates to reductions in diurnal cortisol</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis, impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure, function, and behavior. The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing (a) attention-based mindfulness, (b) socio-affective, or (c) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress. We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults. We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume (CA1-3) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills (<i>Affect</i> module), as compared to socio-cognitive skills (<i>Perspective</i> module) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills. Furthermore, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, using a multivariate approach, we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults.

">Information-making processes in the speaker's brain drive human conversations forward</a></h4>

              
                A conversation following an overly predictable pattern is likely boring and uninformative; conversely, if it lacks structure, it is likely nonsensical. The delicate balance between predictability and surprise has been well studied using information theory during speech perception, focusing on how listeners predict upcoming words based on context and respond to unexpected information. However, less is known about how speakers' brains generate structured yet surprisingly informative speech. This study uses continuous electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings during free, 24/7 conversations to investigate the neural basis of speech production and comprehension. We employed large language models (Llama-2 and GPT-2) to calculate word probabilities based on context and categorized words into probable (top 30%) and improbable (bottom 30%) groups. We then extracted word embeddings from the LLMs and used encoding models to estimate the neural activity while producing or listening to probable and improbable words. Our findings indicate that before word-onset, the human brain functions in opposing, perhaps complementary, ways while listening and speaking. Results show that listeners exhibit increased neural encoding for predictable words before word onset, while speakers show increased encoding for surprising, improbable words. Speakers also show a lower speech production rate before articulating unexpected words, suggesting additional cognitive processes are involved in producing novel information. This indicates that human speech production includes information-making processes for generating informative words that are absent in language models, which primarily rely on statistical probabilities to generate contextually appropriate speech.

">Effects of connectivity hyperalignment (CHA) on estimated brain network properties: from coarse-scale to fine-scale</a></h4>

              
                Recent gains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been driven by increasingly sophisticated statistical and computational techniques and the ability to capture brain data at finer spatial and temporal resolution. These advances allow researchers to develop population-level models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status, and prognosis. However, even following conventional preprocessing pipelines, considerable inter-individual disparities in functional localization persist, posing a hurdle to performing compelling population-level inference. Persistent misalignment in functional topography after registration and spatial normalization will reduce power in developing predictive models and biomarkers, reduce the specificity of estimated brain responses and patterns, and provide misleading results on local neural representations and individual differences. This study aims to determine how connectivity hyperalignment (CHA), an analytic approach for handling functional misalignment, can change estimated functional brain network topologies at various spatial scales from the coarsest set of parcels down to the vertex-level scale. The findings highlight the role of CHA in improving inter-subject similarities, while retaining individual-specific information and idiosyncrasies at finer spatial granularities. This highlights the potential for fine-grained connectivity analysis using this approach to reveal previously unexplored facets of brain structure and function.

">Flanker task parameters are related to the strength of association between the ERN and anxiety: a meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                The error-related negativity (ERN), an index of error monitoring, is associated with anxiety symptomatology. Although recent work suggests associations between the ERN and anxiety are relatively modest, little attention has been paid to how variation in task parameters may influence the strength of ERN-anxiety associations. To close this gap, the current meta-analysis assesses the possible influence of task parameter variation in the Flanker task, the most commonly used task to elicit the ERN, on observed ERN-anxiety associations. Here, we leveraged an existing open database of published/unpublished ERN-anxiety effect sizes, supplementing this database by further coding for variation in stimulus type (letter vs. arrow), response type (one-handed vs. two-handed), and block-level feedback (with vs. without). We then performed meta-regression analyses to assess whether variation in these Flanker task parameters moderated the effect size of ERN-anxiety associations. No evidence for an effect of stimulus type was identified. However, both response type and block-level feedback significantly moderated the magnitude of ERN-anxiety associations. Specifically, studies employing either a two-handed (vs. one-handed) task, or those with (vs. without) block-level feedback exhibited more than a two-fold increase in the estimated ERN-anxiety effect size. Thus, accounting for common variation in task parameters may at least partially explain apparent inconsistencies in the literature regarding the magnitude of ERN-anxiety associations. At a practical level, these data can inform the design of studies seeking to maximize ERN-anxiety associations. At a theoretical level, the results also inform testable hypotheses regarding the exact nature of the association between the ERN and anxiety.

                Scientific interest in the cerebellum has surged in the last few decades with an emerging consensus on a multifaceted functionality and intricate, but not yet fully understood, functional topography over the cerebellar cortex. To further refine this structure-function relationship and quantify its inter-subject variability, a high-resolution digital anatomical atlas is fundamental. Using a combination of manual labeling and image processing, we turned a recently published reconstruction of the human cerebellum, the first such reconstruction fine enough to resolve the individual folia, into a digital atlas with both surface and volumetric representations. Its unprecedented granularity (0.16 mm) and detailed expert labeling make the atlas usable as an anatomical ground truth, enabling new ways of analyzing and visualizing cerebellar data through its digital format.

                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for higher cognitive functions, including working memory, decision making, and emotional control. In vivo recordings of neuronal activity in the mPFC have been achieved via invasive electrical and optical approaches. Here we apply low invasive three-photon in vivo imaging in the mPFC of the mouse at unprecedented depth. Specifically, we measure neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+-transient parameters in awake head-fixed mice up to a depth of 1700 micrometer. Furthermore, we longitudinally record dendritic spine density (0.41 +/-0.07 per micrometer) deeper than 1 mm for a week. Using 1650 nm wavelength to excite red fluorescent microglia, we quantify their processes motility (58.9 +/-2% turnover rate) at previously unreachable depths (1100 micrometer). We establish three-photon imaging of the mPFC enabling neuronal and glial recordings with subcellular resolution that will pave the way for novel discoveries in this brain region.

">EEG During Dynamic Facial Emotion Processing Reveals Neural Activity Patterns Associated with Autistic Traits in Children</a></h4>

              
                Altered brain connectivity and atypical neural oscillations have been observed in autism, yet their relationship with autistic traits in non-clinical populations remains underexplored. Here, we employ electroencephalography (EEG) to examine functional connectivity, oscillatory power, and broadband aperiodic activity during a dynamic facial emotion processing (FEP) task in 101 typically developing children aged 4-12 years. We investigate associations between these electrophysiological measures of brain dynamics and autistic traits as assessed by the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition (SRS-2). Our results revealed that increased FEP-related connectivity across theta (4-7 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequencies correlated positively with higher SRS-2 scores, predominantly in right-lateralized (theta) and bilateral (beta) cortical networks. Additionally, a steeper 1/f-like aperiodic slope (spectral exponent) across fronto-central electrodes was associated with higher SRS-2 scores. Greater aperiodic-adjusted theta and alpha oscillatory power further correlated with both higher SRS-2 scores and steeper aperiodic slopes. These findings underscore important links between FEP-related brain dynamics and autistic traits in typically developing children. Future work could extend these findings to assess these EEG-derived markers as potential mechanisms underlying behavioural difficulties in autism.

                Purpose: To introduce and demonstrate the functionality of ERGtools2, an open-source R package for processing and analysing of visual electrophysiology data, with a focus on data integrity, shareability and long-term preservation. Methods: A dataset comprising Electroretinogram(ERG) recordings from both eyes of C57Bl/6J mice, subjected to standard ISCEV stimuli, was used to present the functionality of ERGtools2. ERGtools2 stores and organizes all recordings, metadata, and measurement information from individual examination in a single object, maintaining raw data throughout the analysis process. Results: A standard workflow is presented exemplifying how ERGtools2 can be used to efficiently import, preprocess and analyse ERG data. Following this workflow basic ERG measurements like a and B-wave amplitudes and visualisation of a single exam as well as group statistics are obtained. Moreover, special use cases are described, including for the handling of noisy data and the storage of data in the HDF5 format to ensure long-term preservation and accessibility. ERGtools2 also provides a graphical interface. Conclusions: ERGtools2 provides a comprehensive, flexible, and device-independent solution for visual electrophysiology data analysis. Its emphasis on maintaining raw data integrity, combined with advanced processing and analysis capabilities, makes it a useful tool research and potentially also clinical applications. The open-source nature and the use of open data formats promote reproducibility and data sharing in visual neurosciences. Translational Relevance: ERGtools2 allows for sophisticated preclinical and clinical visual electrophysiology analyses. This will be helpful, for instance, in the context optogenetic vision-restoring, where signal shapes and amplitudes may be substantially different from normal vision.

">Auditory perception and neural representation of temporal fine structure are impaired by age but not by cochlear synaptopathy</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss is a complex phenomenon. The earliest-onset degenerative event is the gradual loss of neural connections between cochlea and auditory brainstem. To probe for perceptual deficits that might arise from this loss, cochlear synaptopathy was induced pharmacologically in young-adult gerbils which were then tested in a challenging listening task for the perception of temporal fine structure. Treated gerbils behaved no differently than normal-hearing, young-adult animals. In contrast, old gerbils, which typically express many cochlear and central-neural pathologies, showed impaired perception. To probe for the underlying mechanisms, single-unit responses were obtained from the auditory nerve to the same test stimuli. Responses from old gerbils showed no impairment in temporal locking to the stimulus fine structure. However, responses were significantly more driven by slower temporal fluctuations of the stimulus envelope, suggesting that the central auditory system may be unable to extract the relevant information for discrimination from such altered inputs.

                Background: For the purpose of improving the ability to distinguish the activity of closely related drugs on psychostimulant use to enable more specific drug effect characterization, we have developed a new model termed the baseline-effect shift tracking (BEST) model. BEST compares/contrasts the baseline-drug activity relationship(s). Aim: To compare the current model to our BEST model to determine which was more effective in distinguishing the effects of combinations of a dopamine transporter inhibitor (methylphenidate, MPD) and selective sigma1 (BD1063) and non-selective (BD1008) sigma receptor antagonists on cocaine consumption. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (n = 9, 0.32 mg/kg/infusion) or sucrose pellets (n = 6, 20 mg pellets/delivery). We determined the effects for cocaine/sucrose of combinations of MPD (1 mg/kg i.p) and 1) BD1063 (0, 3.2, 10 mg/kg i.p), and 2) BD1008 (0, 3.2, 10 mg/kg i.p) on a) consumption at zero price (Q0), and b) essential value (eValue, demand elasticity) estimated using behavioral economic analysis of within-session demand curves, and c) the total intake under the price response curve (TIPR). We compared the models using ANOVA/ regression analysis. Results: The current model did not detect any differences in the effects of these drug combinations on cocaine/ sucrose taking behavior. For cocaine, but not for sucrose, the BEST model detected differences in the effects of these drug combinations on TIPR in subjects with higher baseline activity. Conclusion: BEST model (with TIPR analysis) is more sensitive than the current models in differentiating the drug effects on cocaine consumption.

">Cell type-specific impact of aging and Alzheimer disease on hippocampal CA1 perforant path input</a></h4>

              
                The perforant path (PP) carries direct inputs from entorhinal cortex to CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), with an impact dependent on PN position across transverse (CA1a/CA1c) and radial (superficial/deep) axes. It remains unclear how aging and Alzheimer disease (AD) affect PP input, despite its critical role in memory and early AD. Applying ex vivo recordings and two-photon microscopy in slices from mice up to 30 months old, we interrogated PP responses across PN subpopulations and compared them to Schaffer collateral and intrinsic excitability changes. We found that aging uniquely impacts PP excitatory responses, abolishing transverse and radial differences via a mechanism independent of presynaptic and membrane excitability change. This is amplified in aged 3xTg-AD mice, with further weakening of PP inputs to CA1a superficial PNs associated with distal dendritic spine loss. This demonstrates a unique feature of aging related circuit dysfunction, with mechanistic implications related to memory impairment and synaptic vulnerability.

">Neuronal heterogeneity in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca: classes and continua</a></h4>

              
                The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca is known for its diverse populations of cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons and their behaviorally relevant functions. Behavioral studies and cell-specific manipulations within this region have underscored its involvement in a diverse array of mouse behaviors, implying the presence of a more intricate and complex cellular landscape than previously acknowledged. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to thoroughly characterize the heterogeneity of septal neurons. Our findings confirmed previously known neuronal classes and uncovered previously undescribed subclasses, as well as expression gradients. We identified transcriptomic identities of molecularly defined cell populations and validated the expression of cell type-specific marker genes using spatial transcriptomic datasets, mapping distinct patterns of cell distribution. Taken together, our analyses provide a comprehensive description of MSDB cell type diversity and novel marker genes to investigate the intricate neuronal composition of the medial septal region.

">Differential encoding of mammalian proprioception by voltage-gated sodium channels</a></h4>

              
                Animals that require purposeful movement for survival are endowed with mechanosensory neurons called proprioceptors that provide essential sensory feedback from muscles and joints to spinal cord circuits, which modulates motor output. Despite the essential nature of proprioceptive signaling in daily life, the mechanisms governing proprioceptor activity are poorly understood. Here, we have identified distinct and nonredundant roles for two voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs), Nav1.1 and Nav1.6, in mammalian proprioception. Deletion of Nav1.6 in somatosensory neurons (Nav1.6cKO mice) causes severe motor deficits accompanied by complete loss of proprioceptive transmission, which contrasts with our previous findings using similar mouse models to target NaV1.1 (Nav1.1cKO). In Nav1.6cKO animals, loss of proprioceptive feedback caused non-cell-autonomous impairments in proprioceptor end-organs and skeletal muscle that were absent in Nav1.1cKO mice. We attribute the differential contribution of Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 in proprioceptor function to distinct cellular localization patterns. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence that Nav subtypes uniquely shape neurotransmission within a somatosensory modality.

">Non-spatial hippocampal behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity during working memory is gated by entorhinal inputs</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) is a form of synaptic potentiation where the occurrence of a single large plateau potential in CA1 hippocampal neurons leads to the formation of reliable place fields during spatial learning tasks. We asked whether BTSP could also be a plasticity mechanism for generation of non-spatial responses in the hippocampus and what roles the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) play in driving non-spatial BTSP. By performing simultaneous calcium imaging of dorsal CA1 neurons and chemogenetic inhibition of LEC or MEC while mice performed an olfactory working memory task, we discovered BTSP-like events which formed stable odor-specific fields. Critically, the success rate of calcium events generating a significant odor-field increased with event amplitude, and large events exhibited asymmetrical formation with the newly formed odor-fields preceding the timepoint of their induction event. We found that MEC and LEC play distinct roles in modulating BTSP: MEC inhibition reduced the frequency of large calcium events, while LEC inhibition reduced the success rate of odor-field generation. Using two-photon calcium imaging of LEC and MEC temporammonic axons projecting to CA1, we found that LEC projections to CA1 were strongly odor selective even early in task learning, while MEC projection odor-selectivity increased with task learning but remained weaker than LEC. Finally, we found that LEC and MEC inhibition both slowed representational drift of odor representations in CA1 across 48 hours. Altogether, odor-specific information from LEC and strong odor-timed activity from MEC are crucial for driving BTSP in CA1, which is a synaptic plasticity mechanism for generation of both spatial and non-spatial responses in the hippocampus that may play a role in explaining representational drift and one-shot learning of non-spatial information.

">Reconfiguration of Functional Brain Hierarchy in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                The multidimensional nature of schizophrenia requires a comprehensive exploration of the functional and structural brain networks. While prior research has provided valuable insights into these aspects, our study goes a step further to investigate the reconfiguration of the hierarchy of brain dynamics, which can help understand how brain regions interact and coordinate in schizophrenia. We applied an innovative thermodynamic framework, which allows for a quantification of the degree of functional hierarchical organization by analysing resting state fMRI-data. Our findings reveal increased hierarchical organization at the whole-brain level and within specific resting-state networks in individuals with schizophrenia, which correlated with negative symptoms, positive formal thought disorder and apathy. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we showed that hierarchy measures allow a robust diagnostic separation between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the nature of functional connectivity anomalies in schizophrenia, suggesting that they could be caused by the breakdown of the functional orchestration of brain dynamics.

">Developmental trajectory of thalamus topography during the late preterm and perinatal period in normal development, after premature birth and in congenital heart defects</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus plays a critical role in neural circuit maturation and brain connectivity. It is well known to show a characteristic topographical organization of local and long-range connectivity, yet developmental changes in this topography remains incompletely understood. Our study aims to first validate the use of diffusion MRI for the topographic delineation of thalamic subdivisions (nuclei), to characterize thalamic topography during development and assess the impact of congenital heart defects (CHD) on thalamus development. We used local fiber orientation distribution functions, derived from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, to subdivide the thalamus into seven clusters. We first evaluated the within-subject reproducibility of a dMRI based clustering method across 30 adults scan-rescan datasets using K-means clustering, achieving reproducible segmentation of the thalamus into seven parts. This was applied to a large developmental cohort comprising normally developing infants, preterm-born newborns ranging from 29.2 to 48.7 corrected gestational weeks, as well as one case of postmortem fetal specimen. Cluster volumes were analyzed as a function of age using multivariate linear regression, while differences in the cluster volumes between control subjects and newborns with CHD were analyzed with a variance analysis, controlling for sex, age at MRI scan. The clustering on average had a within-subject overlap of 0.811 (Dice overlap metric). While absolute thalamus volumes in-creased with age, their relative volumes remained stable in the studied developmental period. CHD infants shown reduced absolute volumes in six of the seven thalamic nuclei, with significant increasing in the relative volume of the cluster overlapping with the mediodorsal nucleus. While the perinatal period comprises rapid developmental events including the maturation of white matter, the topography of thalamic circuitry remains stable. Our study highlights alterations in thalamic topology and potential impacts on brain connectivity in CHD infants. By leveraging local diffusion properties from diffusion MRI, our validated segmentation technique offers a robust, data-centric approach to thalamic delineation.

">Conditional Knockout of Striatal Gnal Produces Dystonia-like Motor Phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in GNAL have been linked to an adult-onset, isolated dystonia that is largely indistinguishable from idiopathic dystonia. GNAL encodes Golf, a heterotrimeric G-protein  subunit with a defined molecular function to increase the production of the second messenger cAMP. Golf is abundant in the striatum, and is the only stimulatory G-protein in many cell types of the striatum. Due to the defined molecular signaling pathway and expression pattern of Golf, the clear genetic link to dystonia makes GNAL an exciting target to understand the pathological mechanisms of not only this genetic dystonia, but also the larger idiopathic disease. To better understand GNAL-linked dystonia, we generated a novel genetic mouse model that allows us to conditionally knock out Gnal in a site and time-specific manner. In the current study we used genetic or AAV based approaches to express Cre to knockout striatal Gnal in our novel Gnal fl/fl model. We then performed motor behavioral testing and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of striatal spiny projection neurons to interrogate how loss of Gnal leads to dystonia. Mice with conditional striatal knockout of Gnal show hindlimb clasping, other dystonia-like postures, less motor coordination, slowness, and torticollis as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, striatal spiny projection neurons show increased excitability in Gnal knockout animals. These exciting data are the first to report uninduced, overt dystonia in a mouse model of GNAL-linked dystonia, and directly correlate these with changes in spiny projection neuron electrophysiological properties. Our results show that adult loss of Gnal in the striatum leads to the development of dystonia, through homeostatic, paradoxical increases in spiny projection neuron excitability, and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing this hyperexcitable phenotype may provide symptomatic relief for patients with disease.

">Modeling Decision-Making Under Uncertainty with Qualitative Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Modeling decision-making under uncertainty typically relies on quantitative outcomes. Many decisions, however, are qualitative in nature, posing problems for traditional models. Here, we aimed to model uncertainty attitudes in decisions with qualitative outcomes. Participants made choices between certain outcomes and the chance for more favorable outcomes in quantitative (monetary) and qualitative (medical) modalities. Using computational modeling, we estimated the values participants assigned to qualitative outcomes and compared uncertainty attitudes across domains. Our model provided a good fit for the data, including quantitative estimates for qualitative outcomes. The model outperformed a utility function in quantitative decisions. Additionally, we found an association between ambiguity attitudes across domains. Results were replicated in an independent sample. We demonstrate the ability to extract quantitative measures from qualitative outcomes, leading to better estimation of subjective values. This allows for the characterization of individual behavior traits under a wide range of conditions.

                Objectives: To study whether a mobile, unguided Cognitive Behavior Therapy-based Intervention for Sleep Disturbance, Sleep2 is feasible, acceptable, and reduces mental health/sleep disturbance symptoms among the Ukrainian population during the ongoing war. Methods: A single-arm, open-label, uncontrolled pre-post evaluation study was conducted with 487 registered participants: 283 started, out of which 95 completed without an ambulatory heart rate (HR) sensor and 65 with. Assessments were conducted using online questionnaires and continuous objective measurements via HR sensors. Key outcome measures included sleep disturbance, insomnia, fear of sleep, anxiety, depression, PTSD, perceived stress, and somatic symptoms. Results: Engagement with the program was robust, achieving an 80.72% compliance rate, alongside high levels of feasibility and acceptance. Participants reported significant pre-post reductions in the severity of sleep disturbance (by 22.60%), insomnia (by 35.08%), fear of sleep (by 32.43%), anxiety (by 27.72%), depression (by 28.67%), PTSD (by 32.41%), somatic symptoms (by 24.52%), and perceived stress (by 17.90%), all with medium to high effect sizes. Objective sleep measurements showed a slight reduction in sleep onset latency. Conclusion: The  Sleep2Ukraine program demonstrated high feasibility and acceptance, with significant improvements in subjective sleep and mental health measures among participants. These findings demonstrate the potential of scalable mobile-based CBT-I interventions in war-torn regions with or without the instrument, based on the heart rate assessment.

                This paper introduces the "NEBULA101 - Neuro-behavioural Understanding of Language Aptitude" dataset, which comprises behavioural and brain imaging data from 101 healthy adults to examine individual differences in language and cognition. Human language, a multifaceted behaviour, varies significantly among individuals, at different processing levels. Recent advances in cognitive science have embraced an integrated approach, combining behavioural and brain studies to explore these differences comprehensively. The NEBULA101 dataset offers brain structural, diffusion-weighted, task-based and resting-state MRI data, alongside extensive linguistic and non-linguistic behavioural measures to explore the complex interaction of language and cognition in a highly multilingual sample. By sharing this multimodal dataset, we hope to promote research on the neuroscience of language, cognition and multilingualism, enabling the field to deepen its understanding of the multivariate panorama of individual differences and ultimately contributing to open science.

	<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a prodromal stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. This study aimed at developing a fully-automated machine learning framework for the prediction of phenoconversion in patients with iRBD by using data recorded during polysomnography (PSG). A total of 66 patients with iRBD were included, of whom 18 converted to an overt alpha-synucleinopathy within 2.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.0 years. For each patient, a baseline PSG was available. Sleep stages were scored automatically, and time and frequency domain features were derived from electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals in REM and non-REM sleep. Random survival forest was employed to predict the time to phenoconversion, using a four-fold cross-validation scheme and by testing several combinations of features. The best test performances were obtained when considering EEG features in REM sleep only (Harrel&amp;amp;rsquo;s C-index: 0.723 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.113; Uno&amp;amp;rsquo;s C-index: 0.741 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.11; integrated Brier score: 0.174 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.06). Features describing EEG slowing had high importance for the machine learning model. This is the first study employing machine learning applied to PSG to predict phenoconversion in patients with iRBD. If confirmed in larger cohorts, these findings might contribute to improving the design of clinical trials for neuroprotective treatments.</p>

	<p>The association between epilepsy and myasthenia gravis has rarely been reported, and when it has been reported, it has only been in a small case series. The aim of the present study was to report the frequency of epilepsy and myasthenia gravis and to describe a case series of patients with myasthenia gravis and epilepsy, focusing on their clinical characteristics and searching for a possible physiopathological mechanism. A retrospective, observational, adult center study was conducted in 2022. Patients were recruited from the database of the outpatient clinic of the Myasthenia Gravis and Epilepsy Unit of the Neurology Service, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge. Five patients were included. The frequency of epilepsy in the myasthenia gravis cohort was 5/469 (1.1%), and the frequency of myasthenia gravis in the epilepsy cohort was 5/1432 (0.35%). All patients suffered from focal epilepsy, mainly temporo-central, which was drug-resistant in 3/5 Myasthenia gravis, which was generalized and with exacerbations in 3/5. Three patients were thymectomized (anatomopathology: thymic hyperplasia). Other autoimmune diseases were found in two (40%). Epilepsy onset preceded myasthenia gravis onset in all patients. Both diseases were considered autoimmune-related in 3/5, related to genetic predisposition due to altered innate immune system in 1/5, and due to chance or to treatment in 1/5. Epilepsy and myasthenia gravis are only infrequently associated. In adult patients, epilepsy onset precedes myasthenia onset in most cases. In some cases, epilepsy has an autoimmune etiology and coexists with other autoimmune conditions.</p>

	<p>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with psychological disturbances, the etiopathogenesis of which is still not clear. One hypothesis implicates inflammatory cytokines in increasing central and peripheral sensitization along with neuroinflammation, leading to an elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin-17A (IL-17A), enhanced in FM patients and animal models. The intermittent cold stress (ICS)-induced FM-like model in C57BL/6 mice has been developed since 2008 and proved to have features which mimic the clinical pattern in FM patients such as mechanical allodynia, hyperalgesia, and female predominance of pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective treatment for relieving pain in FM patients, but its mechanism is not totally clear. It was reported as attenuating pain-like behaviors in the ICS mice model through the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) pathway. Limited information indicates that TRPV1-positive neurons trigger IL-17A-mediated inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the IL-17A would be inactivated by EA and TRPV1 deletion in the ICS-induced FM-like model in mice. We distributed mice into a control (CON) group, ICS-induced FM model (FM) group, FM model with EA treatment (EA) group, FM model with sham EA treatment (Sham) group, and TRPV1 gene deletion (Trpv1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus;) group. In the result, ICS-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia increased pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-17, TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, and IFN&amp;amp;gamma; in the plasma, as well as TRPV1, IL-17RA, pPI3K, pAkt, pERK, pp38, pJNK, and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B in the somatosensory cortex (SSC) and cerebellum (CB) lobes V, VI, and VII. Moreover, EA and Trpv1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; but not sham EA countered these effects significantly. The molecular mechanism may involve the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-17, TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, and IFN&amp;amp;gamma;. IL-17A&amp;amp;ndash;IL-17RA play a crucial role in peripheral and central sensitization as well as neuroinflammation and cannot be activated without TRPV1 in the ICS mice model. EA alleviated FM-pain-like behaviors, possibly by abolishing the TRPV1- and IL-17A-related pathways. It suggests that EA is an effective and potential therapeutic strategy in FM.</p>

	<p>Detailed studies of the equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task have allowed for the development of a sequential-processing model of the perceptual and cognitive processes involved. These processes are reflected in various components differentiating the Go and NoGo event-related potentials (ERPs). It has long been established that electroencephalography (EEG) changes through normal lifespan development. It is also known that ERPs and behaviour in the equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task change from children to young adults, and again in older adults. Here, we provide a novel examination of links between in-task prestimulus EEG, poststimulus ERPs, and behaviour in three gender-matched groups: children (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 years), young adults (18&amp;amp;ndash;24 years), and older adults (59&amp;amp;ndash;74 years). We used a frequency Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) to estimate prestimulus EEG components and a temporal Principal Component Analysis (t-PCA) to separately estimate poststimulus ERP Go and NoGo components in each age group to avoid misallocation of variance. The links between EEG components, ERP components, and behavioural measures differed markedly between the groups. The young adults performed best and accomplished this with the simplest EEG&amp;amp;ndash;ERP&amp;amp;ndash;behaviour brain dynamics pattern. The children performed worst, and this was reflected in the most complex brain dynamics pattern. The older adults showed some reduction in performance, reflected in an EEG&amp;amp;ndash;ERP&amp;amp;ndash;behaviour pattern with intermediate complexity between those of the children and young adults. These novel brain dynamics patterns hold promise for future developmental research.</p>

	<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) represents a distinctive technique for non-invasive brain stimulation. Recent advancements in image processing have enabled the enhancement of TMS by integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities with TMS via a neuronavigation system. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of navigated TMS for cortical mapping in comparison to surgical mapping using direct electrical stimulation (DES). This study involved 30 neurosurgical procedures for tumors located in or adjacent to the precentral gyrus. The DES points were compared with TMS responses based on the original distances of vectorial modules. There was a notable similarity in the points obtained from the two mapping methods. The distances between the geometric centers of TMS and DCS were 4.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.89 mm. A strong correlation was identified between these vectorial points (r = 0.901, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The motor threshold in TMS was highest in the motor cortex adjacent to the tumor compared to the normal cortex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients with deficits exhibited excellent accuracy in both methods. In view of this, TMS demonstrated reliable and precise application in brain mapping, which is a promising method for preoperative functional mapping in motor cortex tumor surgery.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive neurological disease that affects the central nervous system, resulting in a wide spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and physical deficits. The progressive course of MS poses significant challenges to patients and has a profound impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The style of coping adopted plays a critical role in determining how individuals with MS adapt to and face the challenges of the disease and their overall well-being. This paper aims to examine the impact of coping strategies on HRQoL in young adults un-/minimally impaired (&amp;amp;lt;5 years, EDSS &amp;amp;le; 2.5) by MS (age 18&amp;amp;ndash;35 years). This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study included 98 young adults (33 males and 65 females) with relapsing&amp;amp;ndash;remitting MS who underwent neurological assessment using the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Participants completed the Italian version of the Multiple Sclerosis QoL-54 (MSQoL-54), which provides a physical and mental health score, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief-COPE). The results showed a significant relationship between COPE scores and physical and mental health. Subjects affected by MS who tend to use more frequent coping strategies such as active planning, personal growth, and acceptance showed a better overall well-being and quality of life. These findings are relevant to clinical practice given the need to understand the coping variable to improve HRQoL. Understanding these relationships is crucial for developing effective interventions to enhance the well-being of MS subjects.</p>

                Abstract* The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) is a Critically Endangered migratory parrot that breeds in Tasmania and winters on the Australian mainland. Here we provide a reference genome assembly for the swift parrot. We sequence PacBio HiFi reads to create a high-quality reference assembly and identify a complete mitochondrial sequence. We also generate a reference transcriptome from five organs to inform genome annotation. The genome was 1.24 Gb in length and consisted of 847 contigs with a contig N50 of 18.97 Gb and L50 of 20 contigs. This study provides an annotated reference assembly and transcriptomic resources for the swift parrot to assist in future conservation genomic research.

                This report presents the successful orthodontic management of a case of odontoma associated with impaction of the mandibular right permanent canine and Molar-incisor-hypomineralization (MIH). Although case studies have reported the management of odontomas and MIH as separate entities, there is a lack of evidence regarding the comprehensive management of patients presenting with a combination of odontoma, dental impaction, and MIH. A 15-year, 7-month-old female patient complained of the appearance of her smile and the delayed eruption of her mandibular right permanent canine. She was diagnosed with Angle’s Class I molar relationship and Class II canine relationship with the maxillary permanent right lateral incisor in a lingual crossbite. Furthermore, she had mandibular right permanent canine impaction, retained mandibular right primary canine, and MIH in the permanent anterior teeth and first molars. The management involved the removal of the odontoma to allow for orthodontic traction of the lower permanent right canine. After that, the esthetic appearance of the teeth was improved through restorative treatment.

                Background Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the learning pattern of medical students shifted from onsite to online. This transition may contribute to what has been called “Zoom fatigue.” This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Zoom fatigue related to online learning, identify associated factors of Zoom fatigue, and explore its correlation with depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1st to 6th-year Thai medical students. The online survey was administered using a demographic and health behavior questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Thai version of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF-T). Results Among the 386 participating students, 221 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 20.6 years. The prevalence of high Zoom fatigue was 9.6%. In the multivariable regression analysis, a lower academic year and a higher number of online learning sessions were significant predictors of Zoom fatigue (p < 0.001), while regular exercise emerged as a protective factor (p = 0.009). The prevalence of depressive disorder was 61.9%, and a significant correlation was found between having a depressive disorder and experiencing Zoom fatigue (p = 0.004). Conclusion Zoom fatigue among medical students was correlated with depression. Consequently, medical students experiencing Zoom fatigue should undergo further assessment for depression. It is crucial to closely monitor medical students in lower academic years with a high number of online sessions for signs of Zoom fatigue. Additionally, implementing strategies, such as reducing the frequency of online sessions and promoting regular exercise, may help alleviate the symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-365/v4?src=rss">Views and practices on medical cannabis of unlicensed providers in Thailand: a qualitative study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the legalization of cannabis use for medical purposes in Thailand in February 2019, illicit providers are still widespread and accessible. This study aimed to understand why people still chose to receive medical cannabis treatment or products from unlicensed or illegal providers. The practices of unlicensed or illegal providers in provision of medical cannabis products or treatment services were also examined. Methods Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted among medical cannabis providers and users, including 36 unlicensed and 7 licensed providers and 25 users in 2019-2021. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants until saturation of data was achieved. Interviews included open-ended questions about the providers’ practices and attitudes towards medical cannabis. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was performed. Results Overall, six reasons were identified to answer why unlicensed/illicit providers were still popular, including: 1) easy accessibility; 2) familiarity with the unlicensed providers before the legal scheme became available; 3) favorable characters (kind, supportive, non-judgmental) of unlicensed providers; 4) affordable treatment fees; 5) trust in the quality of the medicines; and 6) lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards cannabis from healthcare professionals. Most providers started their career as medical cannabis providers by using it themselves or with their relatives and being satisfied with the results. They used cannabis products to treat all diseases, including skin, eyes, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases and all kinds of cancers. Additionally, they believed that it was effective, with no or minimal adverse effects. Conclusions This study suggests that some patients will continue receiving medical cannabis treatment and products from unlicensed or illegal providers. More attention should be paid on increasing the capacity of medical cannabis service systems within public health hospitals, and the certification of unlicensed providers, so as to integrate them into a regulated system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-802/v2?src=rss">Unraveling the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus: Focus on mecA and PVL Genes [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Staphylococcus aureus infections, including Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-Sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), present significant challenges in healthcare due to rising antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluates the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus, focusing on key resistance-associated genes mecA and PVL. Methods A total of 568 clinical specimens were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. Demographic data were collected to assess age-dependent prevalence. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted to evaluate resistance patterns. The prevalence of the mecA and PVL genes was determined using molecular techniques. Results S. aureus was identified in 37.9% of cases, with the highest prevalence (60-79 age group). All S. aureus isolates showed 100% resistance to penicillin. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains accounted for 84.19% of isolates, with a significant presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. The mecA gene was prevalent in 82.79% of MRSA isolates, indicating its strong association with methicillin resistance. Additionally, 41.86% of all S. aureus isolates were positive for the PVL gene, highlighting its widespread distribution. Conclusions The high prevalence of mecA and PVL genes in S. aureus strains underscores the challenges in managing these infections. These findings emphasize the necessity for judicious antibiotic use and enhanced collaborative efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance. Understanding the genetic basis of resistance can inform more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in S. aureus infections.

                <p>Moving effectively is essential for any animal. Thus, many different kinds of brain processes likely contribute to learning and adapting movement. How these contributions are combined is unknown. Nevertheless, the field of motor adaptation has been working under the assumption that measures of explicit and implicit motor adaptation can simply be added in total adaptation. While this has been tested, we show that these tests were insufficient. We put this additivity assumption to the test in various ways and find that measures of implicit and explicit adaptation are not additive. This means that future studies should measure both implicit and explicit adaptation directly. It also challenges us to disentangle how various motor adaptation processes do combine when producing movements and may have implications for our understanding of other kinds of learning as well (data and code: <A HREF="https://osf.io/3yhw5">https://osf.io/3yhw5</A>).</p>

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in regulating working memory, executive function, and self-regulatory behaviors. Dysfunction in the mPFC circuits is a characteristic feature of several neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Chronic stress (CS) is widely recognized as a major triggering factor for the onset of these disorders. Although evidence suggests synaptic dysfunction in mPFC circuits following CS exposure, it remains unclear how different neuronal populations in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices are affected in terms of synaptic inhibition/excitation balance (<I>I</I>/<I>E</I> ratio). Here, using neuroproteomic analysis and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in pyramidal neurons (PNs) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons within the PL and IL cortices, we examined the synaptic changes after 21&nbsp;d of chronic unpredictable stress, in male mice. Our results reveal distinct impacts of CS on PL and IL PNs, resulting in an increased <I>I</I>/<I>E</I> ratio in both subregions but through different mechanisms: CS increases inhibitory synaptic drive in the PL while decreasing excitatory synaptic drive in the IL. Notably, the <I>I</I>/<I>E</I> ratio and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive of PV interneurons remained unaffected in both PL and IL circuits following CS exposure. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights into the influence of CS on mPFC circuits and support the hypothesis of stress-induced mPFC hypofunction.</p>

                <p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a measure of subcortical activity in response to auditory stimuli. The wave V peak of the ABR depends on the stimulus intensity level, and has been widely used for clinical hearing assessment. Conventional methods estimate the ABR average electroencephalography (EEG) responses to short unnatural stimuli such as clicks. Recent work has moved toward more ecologically relevant continuous speech stimuli using linear deconvolution models called temporal response functions (TRFs). Investigating whether the TRF waveform changes with stimulus intensity is a crucial step toward the use of natural speech stimuli for hearing assessments involving subcortical responses. Here, we develop methods to estimate level-dependent subcortical TRFs using EEG data collected from 21 participants listening to continuous speech presented at 4 different intensity levels. We find that level-dependent changes can be detected in the wave V peak of the subcortical TRF for almost all participants, and are consistent with level-dependent changes in click-ABR wave V. We also investigate the most suitable peripheral auditory model to generate predictors for level-dependent subcortical TRFs and find that simple gammatone filterbanks perform the best. Additionally, around 6 min of data may be sufficient for detecting level-dependent effects and wave V peaks above the noise floor for speech segments with higher intensity. Finally, we show a proof-of-concept that level-dependent subcortical TRFs can be detected even for the inherent intensity fluctuations in natural continuous speech.</p>

                Background The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Methods We used Maestro, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, we have used different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction we used Qikprop, Docking studies we used Glide module, Binding energy prediction we used Prime and Molecular dynamic simulation studies by Desmond Results Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; we first drew an imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IMID 2) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, we selected nine compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamic simulation studies. Conclusions Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions. Further experiments and studies are required to confirm these results.

                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

The hospital must conduct evaluation, coordination, and education for home care patients to ensure proper care and expedite their recovery. This service also introduces a new concept to the community, as it can help save on costs and equipment Methods A systematic review examined the factors influencing patient satisfaction using home care services by following the PRISMA guidelines. PROSPERO submitted and approved the study protocol with the following numbers: CRD42023482315. Result Researchers have searched articles through the ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Two hundred eighty-eight articles were selected, but 10 met the inclusion criteria. It was found that factors influenced patient satisfaction with home care services and two things that did not affect them: financial aspects and working time. Conclusion Fifteen aspects influence patient satisfaction and two aspects that do not influence patient satisfaction.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to instructions and suggestions from governments and experts to maintain social (physical) distance between people to prevent aerosol transmission of the virus, which is now becoming the norm. Thus, we examined whether the pandemic extended the distance between personal belongings. Methods: We recruited 68 university students and instructed them to place their belongings on a long table following another participant (i.e., confederate). We measured the physical distance between the two belongings (i.e., the participant’s and the confederate’s). We collected data between June 10, 2022 and January 23, 2023. Pre-pandemic data was from Ariga (2016). Analysis was completed with one-tailed t-tests. Results: Compared with the pre-pandemic results, via one-tailed t-test, the distance between the two belongings during the pandemic was significantly longer. Our results supported the hypothesis that the psychological framework for processing people’s belongings has dramatically changed during this pandemic. Conclusion: This change may have been driven by social distancing practices or an increase in perceived vulnerability to disease. Our results provide new implications for future public spatial design, in other words, not only the distance between people, but also the distance between their belongings.

                <p>by Aurélie Chazot, Claire Zimberger, Mikael Feracci, Adel Moussa, Steven Good, Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Karine Alvarez, François Ferron, Bruno Canard</p>

Bemnifosbuvir (AT-527) and AT-752 are guanosine analogues currently in clinical trials against several RNA viruses. Here, we show that these drugs require a minimal set of 5 cellular enzymes for activation to their common 5′-triphosphate AT-9010, with an obligate order of reactions. AT-9010 selectively inhibits essential viral enzymes, accounting for antiviral potency. Functional and structural data at atomic resolution decipher <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-purine deamination compatible with its metabolic activation. Crystal structures of human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1, adenosine deaminase-like protein 1, guanylate kinase 1, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase at 2.09, 2.44, 1.76, and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively, with cognate precursors of AT-9010 illuminate the activation pathway from the orally available bemnifosbuvir to AT-9010, pointing to key drug–protein contacts along the activation pathway. Our work provides a framework to integrate the design of antiviral nucleotide analogues, confronting requirements and constraints associated with activation enzymes along the 5′-triphosphate assembly line.

                A 56-year-old female with a medical history of unspecified hyperthyroidism and a recent thyroid storm presented to the ED with tachycardia, hypertension, and bilateral enlarged parotid glands. During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves’ disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves’ disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves’ disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases. This necessitates future research into the reaction mechanisms and optimal treatment.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Background Cassava is an outcrossing, highly heterozygous plant that is reported to suffer from inbreeding depression. However, unraveling recessive traits and exploring additive genes would require a limited level of inbreeding for the genetic improvement of cassava. Method The impact of inbreeding depression (ID) on agronomic and biotic tolerance of cassava was evaluated using the S1 progenies of five African cassava varieties (TMS 30572, TME 419, TMS 98/0505, TMS 01/1371, and TMS 98/0002) at the seedling and clonal evaluation stages. Results At both trial stages, the effects of ID were severe on average performance of fresh root yield and fresh foliage yield; moderate on harvest index, dry matter content, vigor, and tolerance to cassava mosaic disease, cassava bacterial blight, and cassava anthracnose diseases; and less severe on plant height. Further examination of S1 families using molecular markers showed varying levels of heterozygosity at several loci across the genome. In addition, the degree of heterozygosity and ID varied by the S1 family. The TMS 01/1371 family showed the lowest degree of heterozygosity and ID on the average performance of different agronomic attributes, indicating that inbreeding may be strategically explored in this family to increase genetic gain and identify useful recessive traits. Lastly, the observed depression from inbreeding was higher in seedling evaluation than in clonal evaluation trials for fresh root yield, fresh foliage yield, harvest index, and dry matter content. Conclusion S1 individuals showing relatively low heterozygosity based on SNP data were selected as parents to advance genetic gain in cassava. Generally, reduced heterozygosity was prominent in traits with severe ID impacts on average phenotypic performance. Our results highlight the relative importance of exploring non-additive genetic effects and transgressive segregations for favorable allele combinations in cassava improvement.

                Background: Clinical treatments involving autologous cell-based therapies (ACBT) remain prevalent despite a lack of scientific backing and an evolving regulatory landscape aimed at assessing their safety and efficacy for clinical adoption. This study seeks to assess patients’ experiences and perceptions of clinical treatments involving ACBT and their knowledge and views of the regulatory context and associated governance issues. Methods: An anonymous online survey of 181 participants who have been treated or are in the process of being treated with ACBT was conducted. Recruitment was via social media platforms. Data was collected through Qualtrics and analyzed using SPSS 29 for the quantitative responses and NVivo 1.7.1 for the qualitative responses. Results: Several themes emerged from the data, including the prominent role of healthcare providers throughout the patient journey, informational practices during the clinical encounter, the high prevalence of pay-for-participation trials, patients’ gaps in regulatory knowledge, and patients’ priorities regarding clinical trials and regulation of ACBT. Conclusions: The study makes a novel contribution to the literature by providing the first analysis of patients’ experiences and perceptions of an emerging cell-based therapy within an evolving regulatory landscape. The findings serve as a valuable resource for developing policy, promoting scientific rigor, and ensuring ethical oversight of ACBT and other upcoming cell-based therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93758">Disentangling the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 in the US</a></h4>

              
                Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US. We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause (MC) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data. Nationally in 2020, MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13,600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2–7%) than cancers with a poor survival rate (lung and pancreatic, 0–1%). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer’s (19%). To understand these differences, we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96789">Hosts manipulate lifestyle switch and pathogenicity heterogeneity of opportunistic pathogens in the single-cell resolution</a></h4>

              
                Host-microbe interactions are virtually bidirectional, but how the host affects their microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we report that the host is a critical modulator to regulate the lifestyle switch and pathogenicity heterogeneity of the opportunistic pathogens <i>Serratia marcescens</i> utilizing the <i>Drosophila</i> and bacterium model system. First, we find that <i>Drosophila</i> larvae efficiently outcompete <i>S. marcescens</i> and typically drive a bacterial switch from pathogenicity to commensalism toward the fly. Furthermore, <i>Drosophila</i> larvae reshape the transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of <i>S. marcescens</i> characterized by a lifestyle switch. More importantly, the host alters pathogenicity and heterogeneity of <i>S. marcescens</i> in the single-cell resolution. Finally, we find that larvae-derived AMPs are required to recapitulate the response of <i>S. marcescens</i> to larvae. Altogether, our findings provide an insight into the pivotal roles of the host in harnessing the life history and heterogeneity of symbiotic bacterial cells, advancing knowledge of the reciprocal relationships between the host and pathogen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88762">Auditory confounds can drive online effects of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly emerging as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique. TUS is already well-established in animal models, providing foundations to now optimize neuromodulatory efficacy for human applications. Across multiple studies, one promising protocol, pulsed at 1000 Hz, has consistently resulted in motor cortical inhibition in humans (Fomenko et al., 2020). At the same time, a parallel research line has highlighted the potentially confounding influence of peripheral auditory stimulation arising from TUS pulsing at audible frequencies. In this study, we disentangle direct neuromodulatory and indirect auditory contributions to motor inhibitory effects of TUS. To this end, we include tightly matched control conditions across four experiments, one preregistered, conducted independently at three institutions. We employed a combined transcranial ultrasonic and magnetic stimulation paradigm, where TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) served as an index of corticospinal excitability. First, we replicated motor inhibitory effects of TUS but showed through both tight controls and manipulation of stimulation intensity, duration, and auditory masking conditions that this inhibition was driven by peripheral auditory stimulation, not direct neuromodulation. Furthermore, we consider neuromodulation beyond driving overall excitation/inhibition and show preliminary evidence of how TUS might interact with ongoing neural dynamics instead. Primarily, this study highlights the substantial shortcomings in accounting for the auditory confound in prior TUS-TMS work where only a flip-over sham and no active control was used. The field must critically reevaluate previous findings given the demonstrated impact of peripheral confounds. Furthermore, rigorous experimental design via (in)active control conditions is required to make substantiated claims in future TUS studies. Only when direct effects are disentangled from those driven by peripheral confounds can TUS fully realize its potential for research and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92599">Epigenetic insights into GABAergic development in Dravet Syndrome iPSC and therapeutic implications</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a devastating early-onset refractory epilepsy syndrome caused by variants in the <i>SCN1A</i> gene. A disturbed GABAergic interneuron function is implicated in the progression to DS but the underlying developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, in particularly at the chromatin level. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from DS cases and healthy donors were used to model disease-associated epigenetic abnormalities of GABAergic development. Chromatin accessibility was assessed at multiple time points (Day 0, Day 19, Day 35, and Day 65) of GABAergic differentiation. Additionally, the effects of the commonly used anti-seizure drug valproic acid (VPA) on chromatin accessibility were elucidated in GABAergic cells. The distinct dynamics in the chromatin profile of DS iPSC predicted accelerated early GABAergic development, evident at D19, and diverged further from the pattern in control iPSC with continued differentiation, indicating a disrupted GABAergic maturation. Exposure to VPA at D65 reshaped the chromatin landscape at a variable extent in different iPSC-lines and rescued the observed dysfunctional development of some DS iPSC-GABA. The comprehensive investigation on the chromatin landscape of GABAergic differentiation in DS-patient iPSC offers valuable insights into the epigenetic dysregulations associated with interneuronal dysfunction in DS. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the chromatin changes induced by VPA in iPSC-GABA holds the potential to improve the development of personalized and targeted anti-epileptic therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88971">Transposon mutagenesis screen in Klebsiella pneumoniae identifies genetic determinants required for growth in human urine and serum</a></h4>

              
                <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is a global public health concern due to the rising myriad of hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant clones both alarmingly associated with high mortality. The molecular mechanisms underpinning these recalcitrant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infection, and how virulence is coupled with the emergence of lineages resistant to nearly all present-day clinically important antimicrobials, are unclear. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screen in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> ECL8, a member of the endemic K2-ST375 pathotype most often reported in Asia, to define genes essential for growth in a nutrient-rich laboratory medium (Luria-Bertani [LB] medium), human urine, and serum. Through transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), a total of 427 genes were identified as essential for growth on LB agar, whereas transposon insertions in 11 and 144 genes decreased fitness for growth in either urine or serum, respectively. These studies not only provide further knowledge on the genetics of this pathogen but also provide a strong impetus for discovering new antimicrobial targets to improve current therapeutic options for <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infections.

                <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> is a parasitic flatworm that causes the major neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. The miracidium is the first larval stage of the life cycle. It swims and infects a freshwater snail, transforms into a mother sporocyst, where its stem cells generate daughter sporocysts that give rise to human-infective cercariae larvae. To understand the miracidium at cellular and molecular levels, we created a whole-body atlas of its ~365 cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 19 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. In situ hybridisation of tissue-specific genes revealed that 93% of the cells in the larva are somatic (57% neural, 19% muscle, 13% epidermal or tegument, 2% parenchyma, and 2% protonephridia) and 7% are stem. Whereas neurons represent the most diverse somatic cell types, trajectory analysis of the two main stem cell populations indicates that one of them is the origin of the tegument lineage and the other likely contains pluripotent cells. Furthermore, unlike the somatic cells, each of these stem populations shows sex-biased transcriptional signatures suggesting a cell-type-specific gene dosage compensation for sex chromosome-linked loci. The miracidium represents a simple developmental stage with which to gain a fundamental understanding of the molecular biology and spatial architecture of schistosome cells.

                Organelle heterogeneity and inter-organelle contacts within a single cell contribute to the limited sensitivity of current organelle separation techniques, thus hindering organelle subpopulation characterization. Here, we use direct current insulator-based dielectrophoresis (DC-iDEP) as an unbiased separation method and demonstrate its capability by identifying distinct distribution patterns of insulin vesicles from INS-1E insulinoma cells. A multiple voltage DC-iDEP strategy with increased range and sensitivity has been applied, and a differentiation factor (ratio of electrokinetic to dielectrophoretic mobility) has been used to characterize features of insulin vesicle distribution patterns. We observed a significant difference in the distribution pattern of insulin vesicles isolated from glucose-stimulated cells relative to unstimulated cells, in accordance with maturation of vesicles upon glucose stimulation. We interpret the difference in distribution pattern to be indicative of high-resolution separation of vesicle subpopulations. DC-iDEP provides a path for future characterization of subtle biochemical differences of organelle subpopulations within any biological system.

                Veins have emerged as the origin of all other endothelial cell subtypes needed to expand vascular networks during developmental and pathological neoangiogenesis. Here, we uncover the significant role of the angioneurin Fibronectin Leucine Rich Transmembrane protein (FLRT) 2 in central nervous system (CNS) vascular development in the mouse. Early postnatal FLRT2 deletion reveals specific defects in retinal veins, impacting endothelial cell proliferation, sprouting and polarity that result in reduced tip cells at the vascular front. FLRT2 interacts with VE-cadherin and together with the endocytic adaptor protein Numb contribute to the modulation of adherens junction morphology in both retina and cerebral cortex in vivo. Utilizing expansion microscopy, we visualize the altered dynamic distribution of VE-cadherin in tissue of FLRT2 endothelial mutants. Additionally, FLRT2 in cortical vessels regulates the crosstalk between adherens and tight junctions, influencing blood-brain barrier development. Our findings position FLRT2 as a vein-specific crucial regulator of CNS vascular development.

">Dissociating External and Internal Attentional Selection</a></h4>

              
                Visual Working Memory (VWM) stores visual information for upcoming actions. Just as attention can shift externally towards relevant objects in the visual environment, attention can shift internally towards (i.e., prioritize) VWM content that is relevant for upcoming tasks. Internal and external attentional selection share a number of key neural and functional characteristics, which include their spatial organization: recent work has shown that spatial attention is directed towards the previous location of a prioritized memory item, similar to how a perceived stimulus is prioritized. Attending stimuli that are physically present is useful, as it enhances processing of the relevant visual input. When prioritizing items in memory, however, attending the prior stimulus location cannot serve this purpose, as there is no visual input to enhance. Here, we address this apparent contradiction which highlights the gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying external and internal visual attention. In two EEG experiments, we compare location-specific sensory enhancement during the attentional selection of external (perceived) as compared to internal (memorized) stimuli. During both internal and external selection we observed a lateralization of alpha oscillations and gaze position bias toward the previous locations of prioritized items, confirming earlier findings that suggested an inherent spatial organization within VWM. Critically, using Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), we show that sensory enhancement at the attended location is only observed during external attentional selection of (perceived) stimuli. No such location-specific sensory enhancement was observed during attentional selection of items in VWM. Furthermore, we found no clear relationship across trials between alpha lateralization and sensory enhancement (measured through RIFT) during external attention, suggesting that these two metrics indeed reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms. In sum, using a novel combination of EEG and RIFT, we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between the neural mechanisms underlying the selection of perceived and memorized objects. Both types of selection operate within a spatial reference frame, but only external selection modulates early sensory processing. Our findings suggest that the visual system is not vestigially recruiting existing mechanisms of external attention for prioritization in VWM, but is instead using space as an organizational principle to store and select items in VWM.

">Exosomes can modulate the early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons with ASD-associated Shank3 mutation.</a></h4>

              
                Shank3, a scaffolding protein, is critical for synaptic structure and function, particularly for the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines. Shank3 mutations are strongly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neuropsychiatric conditions such as Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) also known as the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. Previous work has recognized early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons derived from ASD patients with various gene mutations as a potential common endophenotype. In this study, we examined the effects of exosomes extracted from several cell types on the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons derived from Shank3 (c.3679insG mutation) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). First, we sought to understand the implications of exosome-based intercellular communication on the neurophysiology of Shank3 mutant and control neurons by switching their respective exosomes. We found that while control neuron-derived exosomes do not change the neurophysiology of Shank3 neurons, the Shank3 neuron-derived exosomes transfer the early hyperexcitability and other ASD-related phenotypes to control neurons. Next, we also explored the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and iPSC-derived exosomes from healthy donors in the Shank3 cortical neurons. We demonstrate that both MSC and iPSC-derived exosomes rescue the early hyperexcitability and accelerated maturation of Shank3 neurons. Proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from Shank3 mutant and control neurons, as well as from exosomes derived from MSCs and iPSCs, revealed distinct protein cargoes that may cause changes in the neurophysiological properties of the recipient neurons. Our results hence provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of ASD emphasizing the importance of exosomes in intercellular communication and their potential to influence intrinsic and network properties of neurons. Moreover, our findings support the need for further exploration of exosome-based interventions as potential therapeutics for treating neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Therapeutic suppression of Tubb4a rescues H-ABC leukodystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Hypomyelination and atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) is a rare leukodystrophy associated with causal variants in {beta}-tubulin 4A (TUBB4A). The recurring variant p.Asp249Asn (D249N) presents in infancy with dystonia, communication deficits, and loss of ambulation during the first decade of life. In this study, we characterized a genetic murine series (Tubb4aKO/KO, Tubb4aD249N/+, Tubb4aD249N/KO, and Tubb4aD249N/D249N) to demonstrate that disease severity correlates with the expression of mutant Tubb4a and relative preservation of WT tubulin. To further evaluate the translational potential of Tubb4a suppression as a therapy in H-ABC, we identified a well-tolerated Tubb4a-targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) candidate that selectively reduces Tubb4a in vitro and in vivo. Notably, single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of ASO in postnatal Tubb4aD249N/KO mice drastically extends its lifespan, improves motor phenotypes, and reduces seizures. Neuropathologically, ASO treatment in Tubb4aD249N/KO mice restores myelin and oligodendrocyte survival. Furthermore, in vivo visual evoked potential latencies recover in ASO-treated Tubb4aD249N/KO mice. This is the first preclinical proof-of-concept for Tubb4a suppression via ASO as a disease-modifying therapy for H-ABC.

">Circuit firing homeostasis following synaptic perturbation ensures robust behavior</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic regulation of excitability and synaptic transmission ensures stable neural circuit output under changing conditions. We find that pre- or postsynaptic weakening of motor neuron (MN) to muscle glutamatergic transmission in Drosophila larva has little impact on locomotion, suggesting non-synaptic compensatory mechanisms. In vivo imaging of MN to muscle synaptic transmission and MN activity both show that synaptic weakening increases activity in tonic type Ib MNs, but not in the phasic type Is MN that innervate the same muscles. Additionally, an inhibitory class of pre-MNs that innervates type Ib-but not Is-MNs decreases activity. Our experiments suggest that weakening of MN evoked synaptic release onto the muscle is compensated for by an increase in MN firing due to a combined cell-autonomous increase in excitability and decreased inhibitory central drive. Selectivity for type Ib MNs may serve to restore tonic drive while absence of firing adjustment in the convergent Is MN can maintain the contraction wave dynamics needed for locomotion.

                Volume electron microscopy (vEM) datasets such as those generated for connectome studies allow nanoscale quantifications and comparisons of the cell biological features underpinning circuit architectures. Quantifications of cell biological relationships in the connectome result in rich multidimensional datasets that benefit from data science approaches, including dimensionality reduction and integrated graphical representations of neuronal relationships. We developed NeuroSCAN, an online open-source platform that bridges sophisticated graph analytics from data science approaches with the underlying cell biological features in the connectome. We apply NeuroSCAN to a complete published record of C. elegans brain neuropils and demonstrate how these integrated representations of neuronal relationships facilitate comparisons across connectomes, catalyzing new insights on the structure-function of the circuits and their changes during development. NeuroSCAN is designed for intuitive examination and comparisons across connectomes, enabling synthesis of knowledge from high-level abstractions of neuronal relationships derived from data science techniques to the detailed identification of the cell biological features underpinning these abstractions.

">Behavioral screening defines three molecular Parkinsonism subgroups in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsonism is defined by motor dysfunction, but the specific upstream molecular causes of these clinical symptoms can vary widely. We hypothesize that these causes converge onto a limited number of core cellular pathways. To investigate this, we created a new collection of 24 genetically very well-controlled animal models of familial forms of parkinsonism. Using unbiased behavioral screening and machine learning we identified three clusters of mutants that converge on (1) mitochondrial function; (2) retromer/vesicle trafficking; and (3) proteostasis/autophagy. Genes within each cluster have a similar genetic interaction profile and compounds that target specific molecular pathways ameliorate dopaminergic neuron dysfunction in a cluster-specific manner. This suggests that familial parkinsonism can be stratified into three broad functional groups and our findings pave the way for targeted biomarker discovery and drug development.

                The G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the major genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9-ALS/FTD). Despite considerable efforts, the development of mouse models of C9-ALS/FTD useful for therapeutic development has proven challenging due to the intricate interplay of genetic and molecular factors underlying this neurodegenerative disorder, in addition to species differences. This study presents a robust investigation of the cellular pathophysiology and behavioral outcomes in a previously described AAV mouse model of C9-ALS expressing 66 G4C2 hexanucleotide repeats. Despite displaying key molecular ALS pathological markers including RNA foci, dipeptide repeat (DPR) protein aggregation, p62 positive stress granule formation as well as mild gliosis, the AAV-(G4C2)66 mouse model in this study exhibits negligible neuronal loss, no motor deficits, and functionally unimpaired TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43). While our findings indicate and support that this is a robust and pharmacologically tractable model for investigating the molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of (G4C2) repeat driven DPR pathology, it is not suitable for investigating the development of disease associated neurodegeneration, TDP-43 dysfunction, gliosis, and motor performance. Our findings underscore the complexity of ALS pathogenesis involving genetic mutations and protein dysregulation and highlight the need for more comprehensive model systems that reliably replicate the multifaceted cellular and behavioral aspects of C9-ALS.

">Birth order specified recruitment of motor circuits during spontaneous neural activity in zebrafish embryo</a></h4>

              
                Modular organization of spinal neural circuits control dynamic regulation of locomotion. However, it is unknown when or how the distinct microcircuits emerge during development. We carried out high-resolution calcium imaging of neural activity driving the first motor behavior in the zebrafish embryo. During this period, at least two waves of neurogenesis occur to generate primary and secondary motoneurons. We found that embryos containing only primary motoneurons exhibit a single highly synchronized rhythmic circuit between the interneurons and motoneurons. Later, embryos with both primary and secondary motoneurons have two distinct interneuron-motoneuron circuits, one containing primary motoneurons displaying low-frequency activity and the other containing secondary motoneurons with high-frequency activity. The results indicate a mode of birth order determined microcircuits where neurons that are born together are recruited together. Nicotine affected neuronal activity frequency, revealing a functional role for cholinergic signaling in the emergence of patterned spinal microcircuits. Indeed, we found aberrant arrhythmic synchronized activity in mutants for cholineacetyltransferase-a where acetylcholine is no longer synthesized. Overall, we reveal the sequential recruitment of birth order specified microcircuits during the emergence of the earliest motor behavior and highlight a conserved role for cholinergic signaling in regulating rhythmic neural activity in the embryonic spinal cord.

">Would you agree if N is three?On statistical inference for small N.</a></h4>

              
                Non-human primate studies traditionally use two or three animals. We previously used standard statistics to argue for using either one animal, for an inference about that sample, or five or more animals, for a useful inference about the population. A recently proposed framework argued for testing three animals and accepting the outcome found in the majority as the outcome that is most representative for the population. The proposal tests this framework under various assumptions about the true probability of the representative outcome in the population, i.e. its typicality. On this basis, it argues that the framework is valid across a wide range of typicalities. Here, we show (1) that the error rate of the framework depends strongly on the typicality of the representative outcome, (2) that an acceptable error rate requires this typicality to be very high (87% for a single type of outlier), which actually renders empirical testing beyond a single animal obsolete, (3) that moving from one to three animals decreases error rates mainly for typicality values of 70-90%, and much less for both lower and higher values. Furthermore, we use conjunction analysis to demonstrate that two out of three animals with a given outcome only allow to infer a lower bound to typicality of 9%, which is of limited value. Thus, the use of two or three animals does not allow a useful inference about the population, and if this option is nevertheless chosen, the inferred lower bound of typicality should be reported.

">Neural tracking of auditory statistical regularities is reduced in adults with dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Listeners implicitly use statistical regularities to segment continuous sound input into meaningful units, e.g., transitional probabilities between syllables to segment a speech stream into separate words. Implicit learning of such statistical regularities in a novel stimulus stream is reflected in a synchronisation of neural responses to the sequential stimulus structure. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that neural tracking of the statistical stimulus structure is reduced in individuals with dyslexia who have weaker reading and spelling skills, and possibly also weaker statistical learning abilities in general, compared to healthy controls. To this end, adults with and without dyslexia were presented with continuous streams of (non-speech) tones, which were arranged into triplets, such that transitional probabilities between single tones were high within triplets and low between triplets. We found that neural tracking of the triplet structure, i.e., phase coherence of EEG response at the triplet rate relative to the tone rate, was reduced in adults with dyslexia compared to the control group. Moreover, enhanced neural tracking of the statistical structure was associated with better spelling skills. These results suggest that individuals with dyslexia have a rather broad deficit in processing structure in sound instead of a merely phonological deficit.

	<p>Background: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder affecting 2&amp;amp;ndash;3% of the global population, and is associated with several comorbidities, including psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to identify factors influencing anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with psoriasis. Methods: This observational study included 112 patients diagnosed with psoriasis. Dermatological and psychiatric assessments were conducted using Psodisk, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and multivariate regression models were employed. Results: The sample was predominantly middle-aged males (mean age 48.91 years). Females (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), patients with arthritis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and those with a sedentary lifestyle (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) showed higher anxiety and depression scores. Psodisk subscales significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms and QoL measures (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Pain (B: 0.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05; B: &amp;amp;minus;2.03, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and sleep disturbances (B: 0.68, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01; B: 0.60, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01; B: &amp;amp;minus;1.46, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01; B: &amp;amp;minus;1.57, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05; B: 3.91, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) emerged as major predictors of poor mental health and reduced QoL. Conclusions. The study underscores the complex relationship between psoriasis, psychiatric comorbidities, and QoL. Key factors exacerbating anxiety and depression include female gender, arthritis, and sedentary lifestyle. Comprehensive management of psoriasis should address both dermatological and psychological aspects, with a focus on pain relief and improving sleep quality to enhance overall patient well-being.</p>

	<p>In recent research, dendritic neuron-based models have shown promise in effectively learning and recognizing object motion direction within binary images. Leveraging the dendritic neuron structure and On&amp;amp;ndash;Off Response mechanism within the primary cortex, this approach has notably reduced learning time and costs compared to traditional neural networks. This paper advances the existing model by integrating bio-inspired components into a learnable dendritic neuron-based artificial visual system (AVS), specifically incorporating mechanisms from horizontal and bipolar cells. This enhancement enables the model to proficiently identify object motion directions in grayscale images, aligning its threshold with human-like perception. The enhanced model demonstrates superior efficiency in motion direction recognition, requiring less data (90% less than other deep models) and less time for training. Experimental findings highlight the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s remarkable robustness, indicating significant potential for real-world applications. The integration of bio-inspired features not only enhances performance but also opens avenues for further exploration in neural network research. Notably, the application of this model to realistic object recognition yields convincing accuracy at nearly 100%, underscoring its practical utility.</p>

	<p>Background: Art therapy has a long history of applications in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. More recently, a growing body of scientific literature has highlighted the potential of virtual reality in neurorehabilitation, though it has focused more on the technology itself than on the principles adopted in digital scenarios. Methods: This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted on 40 patients with stroke, comparing conventional therapy (physical therapy for the upper and lower limbs, for posture and balance, cognitive therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and specific therapy for swallowing, bowel, and bladder dysfunctions) to a protocol in which the upper limb physical therapy was substituted with art therapy administered by means of virtual reality exploiting the so-called Michelangelo effect. Results: After 12 sessions, patients in the virtual art therapy group showed a significantly greater improvement in independence in activities of daily living, as assessed by the Barthel Index (interaction of time and group: p = 0.001). Significant differences were also found in terms of upper limb muscle strength (Manual Muscle Test, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and reduction in spasticity (Ashworth scale, p = 0.007) in favor of the experimental group. In the virtual art therapy group, the effectiveness of the intervention was significantly correlated with patient participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale: R = 0.41), patient satisfaction (R = 0.60), and the perceived utility of the intervention by the therapist (R = 0.43). Conclusions: These findings support the efficacy of virtual art therapy leveraging the Michelangelo effect. Further studies should also focus on cognitive domains that could benefit from this type of approach.</p>

	<p>Delirium is often the first symptom of incipient acute illness or complications and must therefore be detected promptly. Nevertheless, routine screening for delirium in acute care hospital wards is often inadequate. We recently implemented a simple, user-friendly delirium screening test (RMA) that can be administered during ward rounds and routine nursing care. The test was found to be non-inferior to 4AT in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, the dominant factors to take into account when assessing the performance of a test added to the routine work of busy acute care hospital wards are ease of administration, real-life amenability and the ability of the staff to adhere to testing requirements. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of daily RMA tests that were not administered as scheduled and the impact of these omissions on the overall real-world performance of RMA. Using point-in-time assessments of 4AT by an external rater, we found that complete RMA was administered in 88.8% of the days. Physicians omitted significantly more tests than nurses, but their results were more specific for delirium. Omissions reduced the sensitivity and specificity of RMA for delirium (compared to 4AT) from 90.7% to 81.7%, and from 99.2% to 87.8%, respectively. Ideally, the number of omitted RMA tests should be minimized. However, if over 85% of the daily quota of complete tests are administered, the sensitivity and specificity of RMA for diagnosing delirium as soon as it appears remain at acceptable levels.</p>

The identification of cancer driver genes is crucial for early detection, effective therapy, and precision medicine of cancer. Cancer is caused by the dysregulation of several genes at various levels of regulation. However, current techniques only capture a limited amount of regulatory information, which may hinder their efficacy. In this study, we present IMI-driver, a model that integrates multi-omics data into eight biological networks and applies Multi-view Collaborative Network Embedding to embed the gene regulation information from the biological networks into a low-dimensional vector space to identify cancer drivers. We apply IMI-driver to 29 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compare its performance with nine other methods on nine benchmark datasets. IMI-driver outperforms the other methods, demonstrating that multi-level network integration enhances prediction accuracy. We also perform a pan-cancer analysis using the genes identified by IMI-driver, which confirms almost all our selected candidate genes as known or potential drivers. Case studies of the new positive genes suggest their roles in cancer development and progression.

                <p>by Efrat Cohen-Davidi, Isana Veksler-Lublinsky</p>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. In animals, this regulation is achieved via base-pairing with partially complementary sequences on mainly 3’ UTR region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Computational approaches that predict miRNA target interactions (MTIs) facilitate the process of narrowing down potential targets for experimental validation. The availability of new datasets of high-throughput, direct MTIs has led to the development of machine learning (ML) based methods for MTI prediction. To train an ML algorithm, it is beneficial to provide entries from all class labels (i.e., positive and negative). Currently, no high-throughput assays exist for capturing negative examples. Therefore, current ML approaches must rely on either artificially generated or inferred negative examples deduced from experimentally identified positive miRNA-target datasets. Moreover, the lack of uniform standards for generating such data leads to biased results and hampers comparisons between studies. In this comprehensive study, we collected methods for generating negative data for animal miRNAs–target interactions and investigated their impact on the classification of true human MTIs. Our study relies on training ML models on a fixed positive dataset in combination with different negative datasets and evaluating their intra- and cross-dataset performance. As a result, we were able to examine each method independently and evaluate ML models’ sensitivity to the methodologies utilized in negative data generation. To achieve a deep understanding of the performance results, we analyzed unique features that distinguish between datasets. In addition, we examined whether one-class classification models that utilize solely positive interactions for training are suitable for the task of MTI classification. We demonstrate the importance of negative data in MTI classification, analyze specific methodological characteristics that differentiate negative datasets, and highlight the challenge of ML models generalizing interaction rules from training to testing sets derived from different approaches. This study provides valuable insights into the computational prediction of MTIs that can be further used to establish standards in the field.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves aggregation of amyloid β and tau, neuron loss, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammatory responses. Both resident microglia and peripheral immune cells have been associated with the immune component of AD. However, the relative contribution of resident and peripheral immune cell types to AD predisposition has not been thoroughly explored due to their similarity in gene expression and function. To study the effects of AD associated variants on <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) regression models that link genome sequence to cell type-specific levels of open chromatin, a proxy for regulatory element activity. We then use <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis of regulatory sequences to predict the relative impact of candidate variants across these cell types. We develop and apply criteria for evaluating our models and refine our models using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data. Our models identify multiple AD-associated variants with a greater predicted impact in peripheral cells relative to microglia or neurons. Our results support their use as models to study the effects of AD-associated variants and even suggest that peripheral immune cells themselves may mediate a component of AD predisposition. We make our library of CNN models and predictions available as a resource for the community to study immune and neurological disorders.

                <p>by Anubha Dey, Suresh Mudunuri, Manjari Kiran</p>

Synthetic lethality (SL) and synthetic viability (SV) are commonly studied genetic interactions in the targeted therapy approach in cancer. In SL, inhibiting either of the genes does not affect the cancer cell survival, but inhibiting both leads to a lethal phenotype. In SV, inhibiting the vulnerable gene makes the cancer cell sick; inhibiting the partner gene rescues and promotes cell viability. Many low and high-throughput experimental approaches have been employed to identify SLs and SVs, but they are time-consuming and expensive. The computational tools for SL prediction involve statistical and machine-learning approaches. Almost all machine learning tools are binary classifiers and involve only identifying SL pairs. Most importantly, there are limited properties known that best describe and discriminate SL from SV. We developed MAGICAL (<i>Multi-class Approach for Genetic Interaction in Cancer via Algorithm Learning</i>), a multi-class random forest based machine learning model for genetic interaction prediction. Network properties of protein derived from physical protein-protein interactions are used as features to classify SL and SV. The model results in an accuracy of ~80% for the training dataset (CGIdb, BioGRID, and SynLethDB) and performs well on DepMap and other experimentally derived reported datasets. Amongst all the network properties, the shortest path, average neighbor2, average betweenness, average triangle, and adhesion have significant discriminatory power. MAGICAL is the first multi-class model to identify discriminatory features of synthetic lethal and viable interactions. MAGICAL can predict SL and SV interactions with better accuracy and precision than any existing binary classifier.

In animals, mitosis involves the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and the sorting of individualized, condensed chromosomes. During mitotic exit, emerging nuclei reassemble a nuclear envelope around a single mass of interconnecting chromosomes. The molecular mechanisms of nuclear reassembly are incompletely understood. Moreover, the cellular and physiological consequences of defects in this process are largely unexplored. Here, we have characterized a mechanism essential for nuclear reassembly in <i>Drosophila</i>. We show that Ankle2 promotes the PP2A-dependent recruitment of BAF and Lamin at reassembling nuclei, and that failures in this mechanism result in severe nuclear defects after mitosis. We then took advantage of perturbations in this mechanism to investigate the physiological responses to nuclear reassembly defects during tissue development in vivo. Partial depletion of Ankle2, BAF, or Lamin in imaginal wing discs results in wing development defects accompanied by apoptosis. We found that blocking apoptosis strongly enhances developmental defects. Blocking p53 does not prevent apoptosis but enhances defects due to the loss of a cell cycle checkpoint. Our results suggest that apoptotic and p53-dependent responses play a crucial role in safeguarding tissue development in response to sporadic nuclear reassembly defects.

                <p>by Quinn K. Langdon, Jeffrey S. Groh, Stepfanie M. Aguillon, Daniel L. Powell, Theresa Gunn, Cheyenne Payne, John J. Baczenas, Alex Donny, Tristram O. Dodge, Kang Du, Manfred Schartl, Oscar Ríos-Cárdenas, Carla Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Molly Morris, Molly Schumer</p>

Over the past 2 decades, biologists have come to appreciate that hybridization, or genetic exchange between distinct lineages, is remarkably common—not just in particular lineages but in taxonomic groups across the tree of life. As a result, the genomes of many modern species harbor regions inherited from related species. This observation has raised fundamental questions about the degree to which the genomic outcomes of hybridization are repeatable and the degree to which natural selection drives such repeatability. However, a lack of appropriate systems to answer these questions has limited empirical progress in this area. Here, we leverage independently formed hybrid populations between the swordtail fish <i>Xiphophorus birchmanni</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>cortezi</i> to address this fundamental question. We find that local ancestry in one hybrid population is remarkably predictive of local ancestry in another, demographically independent hybrid population. Applying newly developed methods, we can attribute much of this repeatability to strong selection in the earliest generations after initial hybridization. We complement these analyses with time-series data that demonstrates that ancestry at regions under selection has remained stable over the past approximately 40 generations of evolution. Finally, we compare our results to the well-studied <i>X</i>. <i>birchmanni × X</i>. <i>malinche</i> hybrid populations and conclude that deeper evolutionary divergence has resulted in stronger selection and higher repeatability in patterns of local ancestry in hybrids between <i>X</i>. <i>birchmanni</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>cortezi</i>.

                <p>by Shawn D. Burton, Christina M. Malyshko, Nathaniel N. Urban</p>

Inhibitory circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) dynamically reformat olfactory information as it propagates from peripheral receptors to downstream cortex. To gain mechanistic insight into how specific OB interneuron types support this sensory processing, we examine unitary synaptic interactions between excitatory mitral and tufted cells (MTCs), the OB projection neurons, and a conserved population of anaxonic external plexiform layer interneurons (EPL-INs) using pair and quartet whole-cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices. Physiological, morphological, neurochemical, and synaptic analyses divide EPL-INs into distinct subtypes and reveal that parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking EPL-INs (FSIs) perisomatically innervate MTCs with release-competent dendrites and synaptically detonate to mediate fast, short-latency recurrent and lateral inhibition. Sparse MTC synchronization supralinearly increases this high-fidelity inhibition, while sensory afferent activation combined with single-cell silencing reveals that individual FSIs account for a substantial fraction of total network-driven MTC lateral inhibition. OB output is thus powerfully shaped by detonation-driven high-fidelity perisomatic inhibition.

                Recent work by Giusti and colleagues showed that circTulp4 modulates excitatory synaptic strength. Knocking down circTulp4 disrupts the excitation–inhibition (E/I) balance in mice and leads to hypersensitivity toward aversive stimuli. These observations update our appreciation of the functions of circular (circ)RNA in the nervous system and their potential implication in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Quiescence is a prolonged but reversible state of cell-cycle arrest that is an adaptive feature of most adult stem cell populations. In the brain, quiescence helps to protect adult neural stem cells from stress and supports lifelong neurogenesis. Unfortunately however, entry into a quiescent or a slow-cycling state is also a malignant feature of brain cancer stem cells. In glioblastoma, where the process has been best characterised, quiescent glioma stem cells preferentially survive chemoradiation, and after therapy, reactivate to regrow the tumour and drive recurrence. In this Review, we discuss the in vitro and in vivo models that have been developed for studying neural stem cell quiescence and how these tools may be used to deepen biological understanding and to develop novel therapies targeting quiescent glioma stem cells.

	<p>This study investigates the protective effects of magnesium sulfate on dopamine neurons in the retinas of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Rapidly progressing cognitive decline often precedes or coincides with the motor symptoms associated with PD. PD patients also frequently exhibit visual function abnormalities. However, the specific mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in PD patients are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether magnesium homeostasis affects dopaminergic neurons in the retina of PD rats. Thirty-six rats were divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) control with magnesium sulfate (control/MgSO4), (3) Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and (4) Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease with magnesium sulfate (PD/MgSO4). The apomorphine-induced (APO) rotation test assessed the success of the PD models. The open-field experiment measured the rats&amp;amp;rsquo; anxiety levels. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glutamate levels, indicators of dopamine neuron survival, were detected using immunofluorescence staining. Protein levels of solute carrier family 41 A1 (SCL41A1), magnesium transporter 1 (MagT1), and cyclin M2 (CNNM2) in the retina were analyzed using Western blot. Results showed that, compared to the PD group, rats in the PD/MgSO4 group had improved psychological states and motor performance at two and four weeks post-surgery. The PD/MgSO4 group also exhibited significantly higher TH fluorescence intensity in the left retinas and lower glutamate fluorescence intensity than the PD group. Additional experiments indicated that the protein levels of SLC41A1, MagT1, and CNNM2 were generally higher in the retinas of the PD/MgSO4 group, along with an increase in retinal magnesium ion content. This suggests that magnesium sulfate may reduce glutamate levels and protect dopamine neurons in the retina. Thus, magnesium sulfate might have therapeutic potential for visual functional impairments in PD patients.</p>

	<p>This study examines the feasibility of using event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings as biomarkers for long-term memory item classification. Previous studies have identified old/new effects in memory paradigms associated with explicit long-term memory and familiarity. Recent advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled the classification of ERP trials under different conditions and the identification of features related to neural processes at the single-trial level. We employed this approach to compare three CNN models with distinct architectures using experimental data. Participants (N = 25) performed an association memory task while recording ERPs that were used for training and validation of the CNN models. The EEGNET-based model achieved the most reliable performance in terms of precision, recall, and specificity compared with the shallow and deep convolutional approaches. The classification accuracy of this model reached 62% for known items and 66% for unknown items. Good overall accuracy requires a trade-off between recall and specificity and depends on the architecture of the model and the dataset size. These results suggest the possibility of integrating ERP and CNN into online learning tools and identifying the underlying processes related to long-term memorization.</p>

	<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is the most common four-repeat tauopathy. PSP cases are typically characterized by vertical gaze palsy and postural instability; however, various phenotypes have been reported, making antemortem diagnosis based on clinical symptoms challenging. The development of biomarkers reflecting brain pathology and the ability to diagnose patients based on these biomarkers are essential for developing future intervention strategies, including disease-modifying therapies. However, despite many dedicated efforts, no highly specific fluid biomarker for PSP has yet been established. Conversely, several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) have been established, and an AT(N) classification system has been proposed. Typically, among patients with AD, CSF amyloid &amp;amp;beta;42 (A&amp;amp;beta;42), but not A&amp;amp;beta;40, is decreased, resulting in a reduction in the A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 ratio, while tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and total tau (t-tau) are increased. Interestingly, the core CSF AD biomarkers show unique patterns in patients with PSP. Furthermore, reports have indicated that the CSF levels of both A&amp;amp;beta;42 and A&amp;amp;beta;40 are decreased independently of A&amp;amp;beta; accumulation in PSP. Therefore, the A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 ratio could potentially be used to differentiate PSP from AD. Additionally, studies have reported that CSF p-tau and t-tau are reduced in PSP, and that the neurofilament light chain is remarkably increased compared to healthy controls and patients with AD, even though PSP is a neurodegenerative disease associated with tau accumulation. These PSP-specific changes in AD-related core biomarkers may reflect the pathology of PSP and contribute to its diagnosis. As such, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the observed decreases in A&amp;amp;beta; and tau levels could facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PSP.</p>

	<p>The presence of anxiety in individuals with epilepsy significantly influences their medical treatment and quality of life and often goes unrecognized or untreated, posing a challenge to differential diagnosis. The study aimed to investigate the influence of epilepsy characteristics on anxiety. The research involved 155 patients with generalized and focal drug-sensitive [DSE] and drug-resistant [DRE] epilepsy. Hamilton anxiety rating scale [HAS] was used to assess the symptoms of anxiety at three time points [baseline, 12, and 18 months]. DSE patients exhibited significantly lower HAM-A scores than patients with DRE at the initial visit [p = 0.000] after 12 [p = 0.000] and 18-month follow-up [p = 0.000]. Focal DRE patients presented higher HAM-A scores than focal DSE patients in the initial visit [p = 0.000] after 12 [p = 0.000] and 18 months [p = 0.000]. Medication responsiveness, seizure type, and illness duration emerged as significant anxiety predictors [p = 0.000]. After 18 months of follow-up, significant contributors to anxiety were drug responsivity and illness duration [p = 0.000]. The occurrence of anxiety in epilepsy patients is most significantly influenced by well-controlled epilepsy and a positive response to medication.</p>

	<p>Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is the result of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to follow and entrain its oscillatory activity to the phase and frequency of periodic auditory stimulation. Gamma-band ASSR has been increasingly investigated with intentions to apply it in neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosis as well as in brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface technologies. However, it is still debatable whether attention can influence ASSR, as the results of the attention effects of ASSR are equivocal. In our study, we aimed to systemically review all known articles related to the attentional modulation of gamma-band ASSRs. The initial literature search resulted in 1283 papers. After the removal of duplicates and ineligible articles, 49 original studies were included in the final analysis. Most analyzed studies demonstrated ASSR modulation with differing attention levels; however, studies providing mixed or non-significant results were also identified. The high versatility of methodological approaches including the utilized stimulus type and ASSR recording modality, as well as tasks employed to modulate attention, were detected and emphasized as the main causality of result inconsistencies across studies. Also, the impact of training, inter-individual variability, and time of focus was addressed.</p>

	<p>This work aims to shed light on the differential diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD) within the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), which represents a highly innovative field of clinical research. To this end, a critical review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare the clinical patterns and symptomatic overlaps among cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD, with an emphasis on their manifestation in both IPV victims and offenders. The results show that despite some symptomatic similarities, cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD have distinct clinical patterns of interpersonal violence. Specifically, disturbances in self-organization (DSO) are more commonly found in offenders, while the diagnosis of cPTSD seems more aligned with the psychological functioning of victims. In addition, cPTSD and specific characteristics of BPD, such as fear of rejection and instability of identity, constitute risk factors for IPV victimization. cPTSD is shown as a predisposing factor not only for IPV victims but also for offenders, while PTSD emerges as a consequential factor. The specific pathways linking PTSD, cPTSD, and BPD with IPV have significant implications for clinical practice. Further research is needed to understand these profiles and the mechanisms linking trauma-related features to IPV, which is crucial for implementing effective violence prevention programs.</p>
