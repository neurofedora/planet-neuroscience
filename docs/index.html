                Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

                Background: The microtumor environment is an area where tumor cells are surrounded by several cells such as immune cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells as well as blood and lymphatic vessels. It is known that various cytokines and growth factors are released by various cells surrounding the tumor and affect the growth of tumor cells. Differences in chemical composition in the microtumor environment can be detected using spectrometry. The aim of this study was to examine the potential of scanning absorbance spectrometry in differentiating cells based on the chemical composition of endoscopic biopsies of colorectal cancer patients. Methods: An endoscopic biopsy of the patient from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta was collected and homogenized in phosphate buffer saline using TissueLyser. Scanning absorbance was performed using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The results of scanning absorbance were then processed using principal component analysis (PCA) in Orange Data-Mining version 3.28.0 software and the results were represented in a scatter plot diagram. Results: Based on the results of the analysis using PCA, three patients were identified in different quadrant regions, crc006 and crc011 obtained from patients with the differentiation status located close together while crc009 and undifferentiated were located far apart. Conclusion: This indicates the potential of scanning absorbance in differentiating the chemical composition of the tumor microenvironment from patient biopsies.

                Background: The aim of the study was to develop a research instrument to study the levels of health literacy for obesity prevention (HLFOP), as well as health behavior for obesity prevention (HBFOP). In addition, we investigated the causal model between health literacy and health behavior for obesity prevention among primary school students in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional study among 600 participants who were primary school students (aged 9-13 years) was conducted. The participants were selected from schools in all parts of Bangkok using multi-stage random sampling technique. The research instrument to assess HLFOP and HBFOP, constructed by the researchers, were utilized for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation model through linear structural relationship. Results: We found that HBFOP was directly influenced by heath literacy in the category of Critical Literacy with an effect size of 0.65 (p < 0.01), and was indirectly influenced in the category of Basic Literacy and Interactive Literacy through Critical Literacy with effect sizes of 0.46 and 0.58 (p<0.01), respectively. The model was consistent with the empirical data, with Chi-Square=13.68, df=7, p=0.05721, RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation)= 0.040,  SRMR (standardized root mean square residual)= 0.017 NFI (normal fit index)=0.99, GFI (goodness of fit index)=0.99, and AGFI (adjusted goodness of fit index)=0.97. Conclusions: HLFOP was influential on HBFOP in primary school students in the Bangkok Metropolis. The categories that were particularly influential were: 1) Basic Literacy: accessing health information skills; 2) Interactive Literacy: communication skills; and 3) Critical Literacy: media literacy and self-management skills.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal immune specificity at the intersection of host life history and parasite epidemiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander E. Downie, Andreas Mayer, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Andrea L. Graham</p>

Hosts diverge widely in how, and how well, they defend themselves against infection and immunopathology. Why are hosts so heterogeneous? Both epidemiology and life history are commonly hypothesized to influence host immune strategy, but the relationship between immune strategy and each factor has commonly been investigated in isolation. Here, we show that interactions between life history and epidemiology are crucial for determining optimal immune specificity and sensitivity. We propose a demographically-structured population dynamics model, in which we explore sensitivity and specificity of immune responses when epidemiological risks vary with age. We find that variation in life history traits associated with both reproduction and longevity alters optimal immune strategies–but the magnitude and sometimes even direction of these effects depends on how epidemiological risks vary across life. An especially compelling example that explains previously-puzzling empirical observations is that depending on whether infection risk declines or rises at reproductive maturity, later reproductive maturity can select for either greater or lower immune specificity, potentially illustrating why studies of lifespan and immune variation across taxa have been inconclusive. Thus, the sign of selection on the life history-immune specificity relationship can be reversed in different epidemiological contexts. Drawing on published life history data from a variety of chordate taxa, we generate testable predictions for this facet of the optimal immune strategy. Our results shed light on the causes of the heterogeneity found in immune defenses both within and among species and the ultimate variability of the relationship between life history and immune specificity.

                <p>by Akshaya V. Annapragada, Joseph L. Greenstein, Sanjukta N. Bose, Bradford D. Winters, Sridevi V. Sarma, Raimond L. Winslow</p>

Hypoxemia is a significant driver of mortality and poor clinical outcomes in conditions such as brain injury and cardiac arrest in critically ill patients, including COVID-19 patients. Given the host of negative clinical outcomes attributed to hypoxemia, identifying patients likely to experience hypoxemia would offer valuable opportunities for early and thus more effective intervention. We present SWIFT (SpO<sub>2</sub> Waveform ICU Forecasting Technique), a deep learning model that predicts blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) waveforms 5 and 30 minutes in the future using only prior SpO<sub>2</sub> values as inputs. When tested on novel data, SWIFT predicts more than 80% and 60% of hypoxemic events in critically ill and COVID-19 patients, respectively. SWIFT also predicts SpO<sub>2</sub> waveforms with average MSE below .0007. SWIFT predicts both occurrence and magnitude of potential hypoxemic events 30 minutes in the future, allowing it to be used to inform clinical interventions, patient triaging, and optimal resource allocation. SWIFT may be used in clinical decision support systems to inform the management of critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stress generation, relaxation and size control in confined tumor growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Huaming Yan, Daniel Ramirez-Guerrero, John Lowengrub, Min Wu</p>

Experiments on tumor spheroids have shown that compressive stress from their environment can reversibly decrease tumor expansion rates and final sizes. Stress release experiments show that nonuniform anisotropic elastic stresses can be distributed throughout. The elastic stresses are maintained by structural proteins and adhesive molecules, and can be actively relaxed by a variety of biophysical processes. In this paper, we present a new continuum model to investigate how the growth-induced elastic stresses and active stress relaxation, in conjunction with cell size control feedback machinery, regulate the cell density and stress distributions within growing tumors as well as the tumor sizes in the presence of external physical confinement and gradients of growth-promoting chemical fields. We introduce an adaptive reference map that relates the current position with the reference position but adapts to the current position in the Eulerian frame (lab coordinates) via relaxation. This type of stress relaxation is similar to but simpler than the classical Maxwell model of viscoelasticity in its formulation. By fitting the model to experimental data from two independent studies of tumor spheroid growth and their cell density distributions, treating the tumors as incompressible, neo-Hookean elastic materials, we find that the rates of stress relaxation of tumor tissues can be comparable to volumetric growth rates. Our study provides insight on how the biophysical properties of the tumor and host microenvironment, mechanical feedback control and diffusion-limited differential growth act in concert to regulate spatial patterns of stress and growth. When the tumor is stiffer than the host, our model predicts tumors are more able to change their size and mechanical state autonomously, which may help to explain why increased tumor stiffness is an established hallmark of malignant tumors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale model for forecasting Sabin 2 vaccine virus household and community transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Famulare, Wesley Wong, Rashidul Haque, James A. Platts-Mills, Parimalendu Saha, Asma B. Aziz, Tahmina Ahmed, Md Ohedul Islam, Md Jashim Uddin, Ananda S. Bandyopadhyay, Mohammed Yunus, Khalequ Zaman, Mami Taniuchi</p>

Since the global withdrawal of Sabin 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) from routine immunization, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has reported multiple circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks. Here, we generated an agent-based, mechanistic model designed to assess OPV-related vaccine virus transmission risk in populations with heterogeneous immunity, demography, and social mixing patterns. To showcase the utility of our model, we present a simulation of mOPV2-related Sabin 2 transmission in rural Matlab, Bangladesh based on stool samples collected from infants and their household contacts during an mOPV2 clinical trial. Sabin 2 transmission following the mOPV2 clinical trial was replicated by specifying multiple, heterogeneous contact rates based on household and community membership. Once calibrated, the model generated Matlab-specific insights regarding poliovirus transmission following an accidental point importation or mass vaccination event. We also show that assuming homogeneous contact rates (mass action), as is common of poliovirus forecast models, does not accurately represent the clinical trial and risks overestimating forecasted poliovirus outbreak probability. Our study identifies household and community structure as an important source of transmission heterogeneity when assessing OPV-related transmission risk and provides a calibratable framework for expanding these analyses to other populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conditional prediction of consecutive tumor evolution using cancer progression models: What genotype comes next?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juan Diaz-Colunga, Ramon Diaz-Uriarte</p>

Accurate prediction of tumor progression is key for adaptive therapy and precision medicine. Cancer progression models (CPMs) can be used to infer dependencies in mutation accumulation from cross-sectional data and provide predictions of tumor progression paths. However, their performance when predicting complete evolutionary trajectories is limited by violations of assumptions and the size of available data sets. Instead of predicting full tumor progression paths, here we focus on short-term predictions, more relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We examine whether five distinct CPMs can be used to answer the question “Given that a genotype with <i>n</i> mutations has been observed, what genotype with <i>n</i> + 1 mutations is next in the path of tumor progression?” or, shortly, “What genotype comes next?”. Using simulated data we find that under specific combinations of genotype and fitness landscape characteristics CPMs can provide predictions of short-term evolution that closely match the true probabilities, and that some genotype characteristics can be much more relevant than global features. Application of these methods to 25 cancer data sets shows that their use is hampered by a lack of information needed to make principled decisions about method choice. Fruitful use of these methods for short-term predictions requires adapting method’s use to local genotype characteristics and obtaining reliable indicators of performance; it will also be necessary to clarify the interpretation of the method’s results when key assumptions do not hold.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Evolutionary pathways to SARS-CoV-2 resistance are opened and closed by epistasis acting on ACE2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gianni M. Castiglione, Lingli Zhou, Zhenhua Xu, Zachary Neiman, Chien-Fu Hung, Elia J. Duh</p>

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously predicted, binding a diversity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologs despite extensive sequence divergence. Within this sequence degeneracy, we identify a rare sequence combination capable of conferring SARS-CoV-2 resistance. We demonstrate that this sequence was likely unattainable during human evolution due to deleterious effects on ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity, which has vasodilatory and cardioprotective functions in vivo. Across the 25 ACE2 sites implicated in viral binding, we identify 6 amino acid substitutions unique to mouse—one of the only known mammalian species immune to SARS-CoV-2. Substituting human variants at these positions is sufficient to confer binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to mouse ACE2, facilitating cellular infection. Conversely, substituting mouse variants into either human or dog ACE2 abolishes viral binding, diminishing cellular infection. However, these same substitutions decrease human ACE2 activity by 50% and are predicted as pathogenic, consistent with the extreme rarity of human polymorphisms at these sites. This trade-off can be avoided, however, depending on genetic background; if substituted simultaneously, these same mutations have no deleterious effect on dog ACE2 nor that of the rodent ancestor estimated to exist 70 million years ago. This genetic contingency (epistasis) may have therefore opened the road to resistance for some species, while making humans susceptible to viruses that use these ACE2 surfaces for binding, as does SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multiple gamma rhythms carry distinct spatial frequency information in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chuanliang Han, Tian Wang, Yi Yang, Yujie Wu, Yang Li, Weifeng Dai, Yange Zhang, Bin Wang, Guanzhong Yang, Ziqi Cao, Jian Kang, Gang Wang, Liang Li, Hongbo Yu, Chun-I Yeh, Dajun Xing</p>

Gamma rhythms in many brain regions, including the primary visual cortex (V1), are thought to play a role in information processing. Here, we report a surprising finding of 3 narrowband gamma rhythms in V1 that processed distinct spatial frequency (SF) signals and had different neural origins. The low gamma (LG; 25 to 40 Hz) rhythm was generated at the V1 superficial layer and preferred a higher SF compared with spike activity, whereas both the medium gamma (MG; 40 to 65 Hz), generated at the cortical level, and the high gamma HG; (65 to 85 Hz), originated precortically, preferred lower SF information. Furthermore, compared with the rates of spike activity, the powers of the 3 gammas had better performance in discriminating the edge and surface of simple objects. These findings suggest that gamma rhythms reflect the neural dynamics of neural circuitries that process different SF information in the visual system, which may be crucial for multiplexing SF information and synchronizing different features of an object.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Elevated temperature inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in respiratory epithelium independently of IFN-mediated innate immune defenses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vanessa Herder, Kieran Dee, Joanna K. Wojtus, Ilaria Epifano, Daniel Goldfarb, Christoforos Rozario, Quan Gu, Ana Da Silva Filipe, Kyriaki Nomikou, Jenna Nichols, Ruth F.

Murcia, Chris Boutell</p>

The pandemic spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents an ongoing international health crisis. A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41°C. Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 replication. Utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) air–liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory tissue incubated at 40°C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry but refractory to viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of viral RNA replication and apical shedding of infectious virus. We identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the differential regulation of epithelial host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that impact upon multiple pathways, including intracellular immune regulation, without disruption to general transcription or epithelium integrity. We present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in respiratory epithelia. Our data identify an important role for tissue temperature in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 independently of canonical interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defenses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multivariate analysis and characterization of low impact crime in Mexico City [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multivariate analysis is fast becoming a key instrument that can be used to address crimes or incidents. It may be helpful to assess government policies on crime prevention. Methods: To distinguish between the 25 official crime categories reported in Mexico City (Jan 2019 - Jun 2019), principal coordinates analysis was used to determine the quality of a characteristic in this context. This study used cluster analysis via K-means and Biplot based on time and location in terms of crime occurrence. Results: The results obtained from this preliminary analysis indicates that around 70% of crime occurrence is shown in the following boroughs: Cuauhtémoc, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero, Benito Juárez, Álvaro Obregón, Coyoacán, and Miguel Hidalgo. Conclusion: There are two factors that contribute to the difficulties in crime analysis in Mexico City, namely, the lack of people’s trust in authorities and the insufficiency of tools for data analysis. The latter is an integral part in achieving justice for the victims of crimes because it impedes the process of observing patterns and predicting the perpetrators’ next actions, which may help in solving a number of types of crimes. It is then imperative for law enforcement to utilize data analysis tools that aid in identifying crime patterns and trends, such that the occurrences of crime show a downward trend and consequentially increase the people’s trust in law enforcement agencies.

                The ability to detect and adapt to different levels of ambient light is critical for animal survival. Light detection is the basis of vision, but light also regulates eye development and drives several non-image-forming functions, including synchronizing circadian rhythms to the daily light/dark cycle, restricting pupils in response to changes in light intensity, and modulating mood in response to light. Until the early 2000s, these functions were thought to be solely mediated by ocular photoreceptors.

Phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of DDX5 by PAK5 enhances formation of a DDX5/Drosha/DGCR8 complex, thus promoting miR-10b processing posttranscriptionally, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for breast cancer treatment.

                Malignant cell transformation requires the cooperation of multiple oncogenic mutations. Here, we demonstrate that non-mutated genes function within a network of strong genetic interdependencies that are critical to the malignant state. Our network modeling methodology, TopNet, reveals a sparse topological gene network architecture, effectively pinpointing functionally relevant gene interactions.

Notably, T. cruzi HDACs tcDAC1 and tcDAC2 are essential. tcDAC2 has structural features unobserved in human HDACs that promote specific interactions with inhibitors. Thus, targeting atypical HDACs from pathogens can lead to anti-parasitic strategies.

Cheung et al. establish a high-throughput method, VECTORseq, to transcriptionally define projection neurons. The method reimagines transgenes expressed by widely used retrogradely infecting viruses as multiplexed RNA barcodes that are detected in single-cell sequencing.

                Tuong et al. generated a single-cell transcriptomic map of the human prostate immune landscape in health and show how this is perturbed in cancer. They identify a prostate-specific macrophage population that helps maintain tissue zinc and is associated with better outcomes in cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hemodynamic molecular imaging of tumor-associated enzyme activity in the living brain</a></h4>

              
                Molecular imaging could have great utility for detecting, classifying, and guiding treatment of brain disorders, but existing probes offer limited capability for assessing relevant physiological parameters. Here, we describe a potent approach for noninvasive mapping of cancer-associated enzyme activity using a molecular sensor that acts on the vasculature, providing a diagnostic readout via local changes in hemodynamic image contrast. The sensor is targeted at the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an extracellular dipeptidase and clinically relevant biomarker of brain tumor biology. Optimal FAP sensor variants were identified by screening a series of prototypes for responsiveness in a cell-based bioassay. The best variant was then applied for quantitative neuroimaging of FAP activity in rats, where it reveals nanomolar-scale FAP expression by xenografted cells. The activated probe also induces robust hemodynamic contrast in nonhuman primate brain. This work thus demonstrates a potentially translatable strategy for ultrasensitive functional imaging of molecular targets in neuromedicine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In silico-labeled ghost cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Characterization and isolation of a large population of cells are indispensable procedures in biological sciences. Flow cytometry is one of the standards that offers a method to characterize and isolate cells at high throughput. When performing flow cytometry, cells are molecularly stained with fluorescent labels to adopt biomolecular specificity which is essential for characterizing cells. However, molecular staining is costly and its chemical toxicity can cause side effects to the cells which becomes a critical issue when the cells are used downstream as medical products or for further analysis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput stain-free flow cytometry called in silico-labeled ghost cytometry which characterizes and sorts cells using machine-predicted labels. Instead of detecting molecular stains, we use machine learning to derive the molecular labels from compressive data obtained with diffractive and scattering imaging methods. By directly using the compressive ‘imaging’ data, our system can accurately assign the designated label to each cell in real time and perform sorting based on this judgment. With this method, we were able to distinguish different cell states, cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and subtypes of peripheral white blood cells using only stain-free modalities. Our method will find applications in cell manufacturing for regenerative medicine as well as in cell-based medical diagnostic assays in which fluorescence labeling of the cells is undesirable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary footprints of a cold relic in a rapidly warming world</a></h4>

              
                With accelerating global warming, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of plant adaptation to environmental change is increasingly urgent. Here we reveal the enigmatic history of the genus <i>Cochlearia </i>(Brassicaceae)<i>, </i>a Pleistocene relic that originated from a drought-adapted Mediterranean sister genus during the Miocene. <i>Cochlearia</i> rapidly diversified and adapted to circum-Arctic regions and other cold-characterized habitat types during the Pleistocene. This sudden change in ecological preferences was accompanied by a highly complex, reticulate polyploid evolution, which was apparently triggered by the impact of repeated Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Our results illustrate that two early diversified arctic-alpine diploid gene pools contributed differently to the evolution of this young polyploid genus now captured in a cold-adapted niche<i>.</i> Metabolomics revealed central carbon metabolism responses to cold in diverse species and ecotypes, likely due to continuous connections to cold habitats that may have facilitated widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats, and which we speculate were coopted from existing drought adaptations. Given the growing scientific interest in adaptive evolution of temperature-related traits, our results provide much-needed taxonomic and phylogenomic resolution of a model system as well as first insights into the origins of its adaptation to cold.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proton transfer pathway in anion channelrhodopsin-1</a></h4>

              
                Anion channelrhodopsin from <i>Guillardia theta</i> (<i>Gt</i>ACR1) has Asp234 (3.2 Å) and Glu68 (5.3 Å) near the protonated Schiff base. Here, we investigate mutant <i>Gt</i>ACR1s (e.g., E68Q/D234N) expressed in HEK293 cells. The influence of the acidic residues on the absorption wavelengths was also analyzed using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach. The calculated protonation pattern indicates that Asp234 is deprotonated and Glu68 is protonated in the original crystal structures. The D234E mutation and the E68Q/D234N mutation shorten and lengthen the measured and calculated absorption wavelengths, respectively, which suggests that Asp234 is deprotonated in the wild-type <i>Gt</i>ACR1. Molecular dynamics simulations show that upon mutation of deprotonated Asp234 to asparagine, deprotonated Glu68 reorients toward the Schiff base and the calculated absorption wavelength remains unchanged. The formation of the proton transfer pathway via Asp234 toward Glu68 and the disconnection of the anion conducting channel are likely a basis of the gating mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Determinants shaping the nanoscale architecture of the mouse rod outer segment</a></h4>

              
                The unique membrane organization of the rod outer segment (ROS), the specialized sensory cilium of rod photoreceptor cells, provides the foundation for phototransduction, the initial step in vision. ROS architecture is characterized by a stack of identically shaped and tightly packed membrane disks loaded with the visual receptor rhodopsin. A wide range of genetic aberrations have been reported to compromise ROS ultrastructure, impairing photoreceptor viability and function. Yet, the structural basis giving rise to the remarkably precise arrangement of ROS membrane stacks and the molecular mechanisms underlying genetically inherited diseases remain elusive. Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) performed on native ROS at molecular resolution provides insights into key structural determinants of ROS membrane architecture. Our data confirm the existence of two previously observed molecular connectors/spacers which likely contribute to the nanometer-scale precise stacking of the ROS disks. We further provide evidence that the extreme radius of curvature at the disk rims is enforced by a continuous supramolecular assembly composed of peripherin-2 (PRPH2) and rod outer segment membrane protein 1 (ROM1) oligomers. We suggest that together these molecular assemblies constitute the structural basis of the highly specialized ROS functional architecture. Our Cryo-ET data provide novel quantitative and structural information on the molecular architecture in ROS and substantiate previous results on proposed mechanisms underlying pathologies of certain PRPH2 mutations leading to blindness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mimicry can drive convergence in structural and light transmission features of transparent wings in Lepidoptera</a></h4>

              
                Müllerian mimicry is a positive interspecific interaction, whereby co-occurring defended prey species share a common aposematic signal. In Lepidoptera, aposematic species typically harbour conspicuous opaque wing colour patterns with convergent optical properties among co-mimetic species. Surprisingly, some aposematic mimetic species have partially transparent wings, raising the questions of whether optical properties of transparent patches are also convergent, and of how transparency is achieved. Here, we conducted a comparative study of wing optics, micro and nanostructures in neotropical mimetic clearwing Lepidoptera, using spectrophotometry and microscopy imaging. We show that transparency, as perceived by predators, is convergent among co-mimics in some mimicry rings. Underlying micro- and nanostructures are also sometimes convergent despite a large structural diversity. We reveal that while transparency is primarily produced by microstructure modifications, nanostructures largely influence light transmission, potentially enabling additional fine-tuning in transmission properties. This study shows that transparency might not only enable camouflage but can also be part of aposematic signals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of brilliant iridescent feather nanostructures</a></h4>

              
                The brilliant iridescent plumage of birds creates some of the most stunning color displays known in the natural world. Iridescent plumage colors are produced by nanostructures in feathers and have evolved in diverse birds. The building blocks of these structures—melanosomes (melanin-filled organelles)—come in a variety of forms, yet how these different forms contribute to color production across birds remains unclear. Here, we leverage evolutionary analyses, optical simulations, and reflectance spectrophotometry to uncover general principles that govern the production of brilliant iridescence. We find that a key feature that unites all melanosome forms in brilliant iridescent structures is thin melanin layers. Birds have achieved this in multiple ways: by decreasing the size of the melanosome directly, by hollowing out the interior, or by flattening the melanosome into a platelet. The evolution of thin melanin layers unlocks color-producing possibilities, more than doubling the range of colors that can be produced with a thick melanin layer and simultaneously increasing brightness. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of iridescent structures in birds and propose two evolutionary paths to brilliant iridescence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New Caledonian crows keep ‘valuable’ hooked tools safer than basic non-hooked tools</a></h4>

              
                The temporary storage and re-use of tools can significantly enhance foraging efficiency. New Caledonian crows in one of our study populations use two types of stick tools – hooked and non-hooked – which differ in raw material, manufacture costs, and foraging performance. Using a large sample of wild-caught, temporarily captive New Caledonian crows, we investigated experimentally whether individuals prefer one tool type over the other when given a choice and whether they take better care of their preferred tools between successive episodes of use, safely storing them underfoot or in nearby holes. Crows strongly preferred hooked stick tools made from <i>Desmanthus virgatus</i> stems over non-hooked stick tools. Importantly, this preference was also reflected in subsequent tool-handling behaviour, with subjects keeping hooked stick tools safe more often than non-hooked stick tools sourced from leaf litter. These results suggest that crows ‘value’ hooked stick tools, which are both costlier to procure and more efficient to use, more than non-hooked stick tools. Results from a series of control treatments suggested that crows altered their tool ‘safekeeping’ behaviour in response to a combination of factors, including tool type and raw material. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use safekeeping behaviour as a proxy for assessing how non-human animals value different tool types, establishing a novel paradigm for productive cross-taxonomic comparisons.

                We have used phase-contrast X-ray tomography to characterize the                    three-dimensional (3d) structure of cardiac tissue from patients who succumbed                    to Covid-19. By extending conventional histopathological examination by a third                    dimension, the delicate pathological changes of the vascular system of severe                    Covid-19 progressions can be analyzed, fully quantified and compared to other                    types of viral myocarditis and controls. To this end, cardiac samples with a                    cross section of 3:5mm were scanned at a laboratory setup as well as at a                    parallel beam setup at a synchrotron radiation facility. The vascular network                    was segmented by a deep learning architecture suitable for 3d datasets (V-net),                    trained by sparse manual annotations. Pathological alterations of vessels,                    concerning the variation of diameters and the amount of small holes, were                    observed, indicative of elevated occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis,                    also confirmed by high resolution cone beam X-ray tomography and scanning                    electron microscopy. Furthermore, we implemented a fully automated analysis of                    the tissue structure in form of shape measures based on the structure tensor.                    The corresponding distributions show that the histopathology of Covid-19 differs                    from both influenza and typical coxsackie virus myocarditis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">IL-2/JES6-1 mAb complexes dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS through IFN-γ production by CD25+Foxp3- T cells</a></h4>

              
                Complexes of IL-2 and JES6-1 mAb (IL-2/JES6) provide strong sustained IL-2 signal selective for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells and thus they potently expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells. IL-2/JES6 are effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in protecting against rejection of pancreatic islet allografts. However, we found that IL-2/JES6 also dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS-mediated shock in C57BL/6 mice. We demonstrate here that this phenomenon is dependent on endogenous IFN-γ and T cells, as it is not manifested in IFN-γ deficient and nude mice, respectively. Administration of IL-2/JES6 leads to the emergence of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in various organs, particularly in the liver. IL-2/JES6 also increase counts of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in the blood and the spleen with higher sensitivity to LPS in terms of TNF-α production and induce expression of CD25 in these cells. These findings indicate safety issue for potential use of IL-2/JES6 or similar IL-2-like immunotherapeutics.

                Background and Objectives: Positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid-ligands recently gained interest for evaluating white matter (WM) pathology. Here, we investigated the neurobiological underpinnings of the amyloid-PET signal in the WM using free water (FW) diffusion MRI in a mixed cohort of small vessel disease (SVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Methods: We included data from two large cohort imaging studies, including MITNEC-C6 with moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and ADNI-2 with mild-to-moderate WMH burden, covering the spectrum of cognitively normal to dementia. Subjects underwent diffusion MRI, 18F-AV45 amyloid-PET, and cognitive testing. We calculated WM diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). In addition, we applied a bi-tensor diffusion MRI model that differentiates between extracellular (FW fraction) and tissue-specific (FW-adjusted FA) compartments of the WM. We tested associations of all diffusion metrics with 18F-AV45 SUVR in regions of WMH vs. normal-appearing WM (NAWM), and with cognition. We further performed partial-least-square analysis to investigate how the diffusion metrics as well as age, sex, education, WMH volume, and cortical 18F-AV45 SUVR covary with WM 18F-AV45 SUVR. Results: 18F-AV45 SUVR was significantly lower in regions of WMH compared to NAWM (t=25.08, P<0.0001, n=115 subjects). Within WMH, lower 18F-AV45 SUVR was associated with higher FW ({beta}=-0.36{+/-}0.13, P=0.005) and lower FA ({beta}=+0.24{+/-}0.12, P=0.046), but not with the tissue-specific metric FW-adjusted FA. Partial-least-square analysis further confirmed that FW had the most influence on 18F-AV45 SUVR in regions of WMH. In contrast, FW-adjusted FA had more influence on 18F-AV45 SUVR in NAWM. Last, correlation with cognitive impairment was higher for FW than FW-adjusted FA, both in regions of WMH (MMSE: {beta}FW=-0.40{+/-}0.13, P=0.003; {beta}FW-adjustedFA=0.14{+/-}0.09, P=0.11) and NAWM (MMSE: {beta}FW=-0.30{+/-}0.11, P=0.01; {beta}FW-adjustedFA=0.21{+/-}0.09, P=0.02. Conclusion: In a cohort representative of the more common AD population, reduced amyloid-PET uptake in WM lesions may largely reflect the appearance of extracellular FW, while changes in NAWM may associate with tissue-specific damage. Ultimately, our findings may support FW and amyloid-PET as markers of WM abnormalities in SVD and AD.

                It is well-recognized that primary cilia regulate embryonic neurodevelopment, but little is known about their roles in postnatal neurodevelopment. The striatum pyramidal (SP) of hippocampal CA1 consists of superficial and deep sublayers, however, it is not well understood how early- and late-born pyramidal neurons position to two sublayers postnatally. Here we show that neuronal primary cilia emerge after CA1 pyramidal cells have reached SP, but before final neuronal positioning. The axonemes of primary cilia of early-born neurons point to the stratum oriens (SO), whereas late-born neuronal cilia orient toward the stratum radiatum (SR), reflecting an inside-out lamination pattern. Neuronal primary cilia in SP undergo marked changes in morphology and orientation from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P14, concurrent with pyramidal cell positioning to the deep and superficial sublayers and with neuronal maturation. Transgenic overexpression of Arl13B, a protein regulating ciliogenesis, not only elongates primary cilia and promotes earlier cilia protrusion, but also affects centriole positioning and cilia orientation in SP. The centrioles of late-born neurons migrate excessively to cluster at SP bottom before primary cilia protrusion and a reverse movement back to the main SP. Similarly, this pull-back movement of centriole/cilia is also identified on late-born cortical pyramidal neurons, although early- and late-born cortical neurons display the same cilia orientation. Together, this study provides the first evidence demonstrating that late-born pyramidal neurons exhibit a reverse movement for cell positioning, and primary cilia regulate pyramidal neuronal positioning to the deep and superficial sublayers in the hippocampus.

                Animals exhibit diverse behavioral responses, such as exploration and avoidance, to novel cues in the environment. However, it remains unclear how dopamine neuron-related novelty responses influence behavior. Here, we characterized dynamics of novelty exploration using multi-point tracking (DeepLabCut) and behavioral segmentation (MoSeq). Novelty elicits a characteristic sequence of behavior, starting with investigatory approach and culminating in object engagement or avoidance. Dopamine in the tail of striatum (TS) suppresses engagement, and dopamine responses were predictive of individual variability in behavior. Behavioral dynamics and individual variability were explained by a novel reinforcement learning (RL) model of threat prediction, in which behavior arises from a novelty-induced initial threat prediction (akin to shaping bonus), and a threat prediction that is learned through dopamine-mediated threat prediction errors. These results uncover an algorithmic similarity between reward- and threat-related dopamine sub-systems.

                The primary role of microglia in the maintenance of brain homeostasis is to respond to disturbances in the microenvironment. In this study, we cultured murine neonatal microglia and activated them with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and benzoyl ATP (bzATP) to characterize changes in the transcriptome in response to various in vivo stimuli caused by pathogens, injury, or toxins. Activation by bzATP, an agonist of purinergic receptors, induces a transient wave of transcriptional changes. However, a long-lasting transcriptional profile affecting thousands of genes occurs only following a combination of bzATP and LPS. This profile is dominated by a coordinated induction of cytokines (e.g., IL1-alpha; and IL1-beta), chemokines, and their direct regulators. Many of these inflammatory-related genes are up-regulated by several orders of magnitude. We identified the TNF-alpha and NF-kB pathways as the principal hubs for signaling of interleukin and chemokine induction in this cell system. We propose that primary microglia under controlled activation paradigms can be used for testing reagents that could attenuate their activated state. Such a microglial system could serve as a model for changes occurring in the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unsupervised functional neurocartography of the Aplysia buccal ganglion</a></h4>

              
                A major limitation of large-scale neuronal recordings is the difficulty in locating the same neuron in different subjects, referred to as the "correspondence" issue. This issue stems, at least in part, from the lack of a unique feature that unequivocally identifies each neuron. One promising approach to this problem is the functional neurocartography framework developed by Frady et al. (2016), in which neurons are identified by a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm using a combination of multiple selected features. Here, the framework was adapted to the buccal ganglia of Aplysia. Multiple features were derived from neuronal activity during motor pattern generation, responses to peripheral nerve stimulation, and the spatial properties of each cell. The feature set was optimized based on its potential usefulness in discriminating neurons from each other, and then used to match putatively homologous neurons across subjects with the functional neurocartography software. A matching method was developed based on a cyclic matching algorithm that allows for unsupervised extraction of groups of neurons, thereby enhancing scalability of the analysis. Cyclic matching was also used to automate the selection of high-quality matches, which allowed for unsupervised implementation of the machine learning algorithm. This study paves the way for investigating the roles of both well-characterized and previously uncharacterized neurons in Aplysia, as well as helps to adapt this framework to other systems.

                Optical microscopy has enabled in vivo monitoring of brain structures and functions with high spatial resolution. However, the strong optical scattering in turbid brain tissue and skull impedes the observation of microvasculature and neuronal structures at large depth. Herein, we proposed a strategy to overcome the influence induced by the high scattering effect of both skull and brain tissue via the combination of skull optical clearing (SOC) technique and thee-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM). The Visible-NIR-II compatible Skull Optical Clearing Agents (VNSOCA) we applied reduced the skull scattering and water absorption in long wavelength by refractive index matching and H2O replacement to D2O respectively. 3PM with the excitation in the 1300-nm window reached 1.5 mm cerebrovascular imaging depth in cranial window. Combining the two advanced technologies together, we achieved so far the largest cerebrovascular imaging depth of 1 mm and neuronal imaging depth of >700 m through intact mouse skull. Dual-channel through-skull imaging of both brain vessels and neurons was also successfully realized, giving an opportunity of non-invasively monitoring the deep brain structures and functions at single-cell level simultaneously.

                Interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) has been observed during social interactions and involves various factors, such as familiarity with the partner and type of social activity. A previous study has shown that face-to-face interactions in pairs of strangers increase IBS. However, it is unclear whether this can be observed when the nature of the interacting partners is different. Herein, we aimed to extend these findings to pairs of acquaintances. Neural activity in the frontal and temporal regions was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. Participants played an ultimatum game that required virtual economic exchange in two experimental settings: the face-to-face and face-blocked conditions. Random pair analysis confirmed whether IBS was induced by social interaction. Contrary to the aforementioned study, our results did not show any cooperative behavior or task-induced IBS increase. Conversely, the random pair analysis results revealed that the pair-specific IBS was significant only in the task condition at the left and right superior frontal, middle frontal, orbital superior frontal, right superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyri. Our results revealed that face-to-face interaction in acquainted pairs did not increase IBS and supported the idea that IBS is affected by "with whom we interact and how."

                To date, there is a consensus that there are at least two neuronal populations in the non-human primate (NHP) external globus pallidus (GPe): the low- and high-frequency discharge (LFD and HFD) neurons. Nevertheless, almost all NHP physiological studies have neglected the functional importance of LFD neurons. This study examined the discharge features of these two GPe neuronal subpopulations recorded in four NHPs engaged in a classical conditioning task with cues predicting reward, neutral and aversive outcomes. The results show that LFD neurons tended to burst, encoded the salience of behavioral cues, and exhibited correlated spiking activity. By contrast, the HFD neurons tended to pause, encoded cue valence, and exhibited uncorrelated spiking activity. Overall, these findings point to the dichotomic organization of the NHP GPe which is likely to be critical to the implementation of normal basal ganglia functions and computations.

                Sleep spindles are developmentally relevant cortical oscillatory patterns; however, they have mostly been studied by considering the entire spindle frequency range (11 to 15 Hz) without a distinction between the functionally and topographically different slow and fast spindles, using relatively few electrodes and analysing wide age-ranges. Here, we employ HD-EEG polysomnography in three age-groups between 12 to 20 years of age, with an equal distribution between the two genders, and analyse the adolescent developmental pattern of the four major parameters of slow and fast sleep spindles. Most of our findings corroborate those very few previous studies that also make a distinction between slow and fast spindles in their developmental analysis. We find spindle frequency increasing with age, although spindle density change is not obvious in our study. We confirm the declining tendencies for amplitude and duration, although within narrower, more specific age-windows than previously. Spindle frequency seems to be higher in females in the oldest age-group. Based on the pattern of our findings, we suggest that HD-EEG, specifically targeting slow and fast spindle ranges and relatively narrow age-ranges would advance the understanding of both adolescent development and the functional relevance of sleep spindles in general.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional signature in microglia isolated from an Alzheimers disease mouse model treated with scanning ultrasound</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Intracranial scanning ultrasound combined with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS+MB) transiently opens the blood-brain barrier and reduces amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD). This has been accomplished, at least in part, through the activation of microglial cells; however, their response to the SUS treatment is only incompletely understood. Methods: Wild-type (WT) and APP23 mice were subjected to SUS+MB, using non-SUS+MB-treated mice as sham controls. After 48 hours, the APP23 mice were injected with methoxy-XO4 to label Abeta aggregates, followed by microglial isolation into XO4+ and XO4- populations using flow cytometry. Both XO4+ and XO4- cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and their transcriptome was analyzed through a bioinformatics pipeline. Results: The transcriptomic analysis of the microglial cells revealed a clear segregation depending on genotype (AD model versus WT mice), as well as treatment (SUS+MB versus sham) and Abeta internalization (XO4+ versus XO4- microglia). Differential gene expression analysis detected 278 genes that were significantly changed by SUS+MB in the XO4+ cells (248 up/30 down) and 242 in XO- cells (225 up/17 down). Not surprisingly given previous findings of increased phagocytosis of plaques following SUS+MB, the pathway analysis highlighted that the treatment induced an enrichment in genes related to the phagosome pathway in XO4+ microglia; however, when comparing SUS+MB to sham, the analysis revealed an enrichment in genes involved in the cell cycle in both the XO4+ and XO4- microglial population. Conclusion: Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of microglia in an AD mouse model subjected to ultrasound treatment as a function of Abeta internalization, one of the defining hallmarks of AD. Several differentially expressed genes are highlighted, pointing to an ultrasound-induced activation of cell cycle mechanisms in microglial cells isolated from APP23 mice treated with SUS+MB.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical imaging and patterned stimulation with a one-photon endoscope</a></h4>

              
                While in vivo calcium imaging makes it possible to record activity in defined neuronal populations with cellular resolution, optogenetics allows selective manipulation of neural activity. Recently, these two tools have been combined to stimulate and record neural activity at the same time, but current approaches often rely on two-photon microscopes that are difficult to use in freely moving animals. To address these limitations, we have developed a new integrated system combining a one-photon endoscope and a digital micromirror device for simultaneous calcium imaging and precise optogenetic photo-stimulation with near cellular resolution (Miniscope with All-optical Patterned Stimulation and Imaging, MAPSI). Using this highly portable system in freely moving mice, we were able to image striatal neurons from either the direct pathway or the indirect pathway while simultaneously activating any neuron of choice in the field of view, or to synthesize arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns of photo-stimulation. We could also select neurons based on their relationship with behavior and recreate the behavior by mimicking the natural neural activity with photo-stimulation. MAPSI thus provides a powerful tool for interrogation of neural circuit function in freely moving animals.

                Working memory enables incorporation of recent experience into subsequent decision-making. This processing recruits both prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where neurons encode task cues, rules and outcomes. However, precisely which information is carried when, and by which neurons, remains unclear. Using population decoding of activity in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampal CA1, we confirm that mPFC populations lead in maintaining sample information across delays of an operant non-match to sample task, despite individual neurons firing only transiently. During sample encoding, distinct mPFC subpopulations joined distributed CA1-mPFC cell assemblies hallmarked by 4-5Hz rhythmic modulation; CA1-mPFC assemblies re-emerged during choice episodes, but were not 4-5Hz modulated. Delay-dependent errors arose when attenuated rhythmic assembly activity heralded collapse of sustained mPFC encoding; pharmacological disruption of CA1-mPFC assembly rhythmicity impaired task performance. Our results map component processes of memory-guided decisions onto heterogeneous CA1-mPFC subpopulations and the dynamics of physiologically distinct, distributed cell assemblies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A mechanistically interpretable model of the retinal neural code for natural scenes with multiscale adaptive dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The visual system processes stimuli over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales, with individual neurons receiving input from tens of thousands of neurons whose dynamics range from milliseconds to tens of seconds. This poses a challenge to create models that both accurately capture visual computations and are mechanistically interpretable. Here we present a model of salamander retinal ganglion cell spiking responses recorded with a multielectrode array that captures natural scene responses and slow adaptive dynamics. The model consists of a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) modified to include local recurrent synaptic dynamics taken from a linear-nonlinear-kinetic (LNK) model cite{ozuysal2012linking}. We presented alternating natural scenes and uniform field white noise stimuli designed to engage slow contrast adaptation. To overcome difficulties fitting slow and fast dynamics together, we first optimized all fast spatiotemporal parameters, then separately optimized recurrent slow synaptic parameters. The resulting full model reproduces a wide range of retinal computations and is mechanistically interpretable, having internal units that correspond to retinal interneurons with biophysically modeled synapses. This model allows us to study the contribution of model units to any retinal computation, and examine how long-term adaptation changes the retinal neural code for natural scenes through selective adaptation of retinal pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Testing for implicit emotion regulation in childhood</a></h4>

              
                Although implicit emotion regulation is thought to be critical for psychosocial development and mental wellbeing, few studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of this form of emotion regulation in children. We used a modified emotional Go/NoGo block design fMRI task to explore the neural correlates of implicit emotion regulation and individual differences in a sample of 40 children (50% female, mean age = 8.65 +/- 0.77). Conditions included happy, sad, neutral, and scrambled faces as implicit distractors within the actual Go/NoGo targets. We used a relatively standard preprocessing pipeline via fMRIprep, with T-contrasts for response inhibition and emotional effects, and a nonparametric multiple comparisons procedure, with SnPM, for our group-level analysis. There were multiple significant response inhibition effects, including larger NoGo vs Go activation in the IFG, insula, and MCC/ACC. Valence effects showed significantly greater right putamen activity for the Sad NoGo vs Go contrast and greater bilateral putamen and right pallidum activity for the Happy Go vs Sad Go contrast. These results provide preliminary findings of neural substrates, particularly the putamen, that may be associated with implicit emotion regulation in children.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In the back of your mind: Cortical mapping of tactile and proprioceptive paraspinal afferent inputs</a></h4>

              
                Persistent pain alters brain-body representations, highlighting their potential pathological significance. In chronic low back pain (LBP), sparse evidence points towards a shift of the cortical representation of sensory afferents of the back. However, systematic investigations of the cortical representation of tactile and proprioceptive paraspinal afferents along the thoracolumbar axis are lacking. Detailed cortical maps of paraspinal afferent input might be crucial to further explore potential relationships between brain changes and the development and maintenance of chronic LBP. We therefore validated a novel and functional magnetic resonance imaging- (fMRI-)compatible method of mapping cortical representations of tactile and proprioceptive afferents of the back, using pneumatic vibrotactile stimulation ("pneuVID") at varying frequencies and paraspinal locations, in conjunction with high-resolution fMRI. We hypothesised that: (i) high (80 Hz) frequency stimulation would lead to increased postural sway compared to low (20 Hz) stimulation, due to differential evoked mechanoreceptor contributions to postural control (proprioceptive vs tactile); and (ii) that high (80 Hz) versus low (20 Hz) frequency stimulation would be associated with neuronal activity in distinct primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortical targets of tactile and proprioceptive afferents (N=15, healthy volunteers). Additionally, we expected neural representations to vary spatially along the thoracolumbar axis. We found significant differences between neural representations of low and high frequency stimulation and between representations of thoracic and lumbar paraspinal locations, in several bilateral sensorimotor cortical regions. Proprioceptive (80 Hz) stimulation preferentially activated sub-regions S1 3a and M1 4p, while tactile (20 Hz) stimulation was more encoded in S1 3b and M1 4a. Moreover, in S1, lower back proprioceptive stimulation activated dorsal-posterior representations, compared to ventral-anterior representations activated by upper back stimulation. As per our hypotheses, we found distinct sensorimotor cortical tactile and proprioceptive representations, with the latter displaying clear topographic differences between the upper and lower back. This thus represents the first behavioural and neurobiological validation of the novel pneuVID method for stimulating muscle spindles and mapping cortical representations of paraspinal afferents. Future investigations of detailed cortical maps will be of major importance in elucidating the role of cortical reorganization in the pathophysiology of chronic LBP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different excitation-inhibition correlations between spontaneous and tone-evoked activity in primary auditory cortex neurons</a></h4>

              
                Tone-evoked synaptic excitation and inhibition are highly correlated in many neurons with V-shaped tuning curves in the primary auditory cortex of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. In contrast, there is less correlation between spontaneous excitation and inhibition in visual cortex neurons under the same anesthetic conditions. However, it was not known whether the primary auditory cortex resembles visual cortex in having spontaneous excitation and inhibition that is less correlated than tone-evoked excitation and inhibition. Here we report whole-cell voltage-clamp measurements of spontaneous excitation and inhibition in primary auditory cortex neurons of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The larger excursions of both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents appeared to consist of distinct events, with the inhibitory event rate typically lower than the excitatory event rate. We use the ratio of the excitatory event rate to the inhibitory event rate, and the assumption that the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents can each be reasonably described as a filtered Poisson process, to estimate the maximum spontaneous excitatory-inhibitory correlation for each neuron. In a subset of neurons, we also measured tone-evoked excitation and inhibition. In neurons with V-shaped tuning curves, although tone-evoked excitation and inhibition were highly correlated, the spontaneous inhibitory event rate was typically sufficiently lower than the spontaneous excitatory event rate to indicate a lower excitatory-inhibitory correlation for spontaneous activity than for tone-evoked responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellar GABA change during visuomotor adaptation relates to adaptation performance and cerebellar network connectivity: A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging study.</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation is crucial for performing accurate movements in a changing environment and relies on the cerebellum. Although cerebellar involvement has been well characterized, the neurochemical changes in the cerebellum that underpin human motor adaptation remain unknown. We used a novel Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) technique to measure changes in the major inhibitory neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human cerebellum during visuomotor adaptation. Participants used their right hand to adapt to a rotated cursor in the scanner, compared with a control task requiring no adaptation. We were able to spatially resolve adaptation-driven GABA changes at the cerebellar nuclei and in the cerebellar cortex in the left and the right cerebellar hemisphere independently and found that simple movement of the right hand increases GABA in the right cerebellar nuclei and decreases GABA in the left. When isolating adaptation-driven GABA changes, we found an increase in GABA in the left cerebellar nuclei and a decrease in GABA in the right cerebellar nuclei during adaptation. Early adaptation-driven GABA change in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance: Participants showing greater GABA decrease adapted better, suggesting that this early GABA change is behaviourally relevant. Early GABA change also correlated with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network: Participants showing a greater decrease in GABA also showed greater strength increase in cerebellar network connectivity. These results were specific to GABA, specific to adaptation and specific to the cerebellar network. This study provides the first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during a motor adaptation task. Characterising these naturally occurring neurochemical changes may provide a basis for developing therapeutic interventions to facilitate neurochemical changes in the cerebellum that can improve human motor adaptation.

                Adult regeneration in spinal cord is poor in mammalian but remarkable in the neonatal mammals and some vertebrates, including fish and salamanders. Increasing evidences basis of this interspecies and ontogeny highlighted the pivotal roles of neuron extrinsic factors-the glial scar, which exert confusing inhibiting or promoting regeneration function, but the spatiotemporal ordering of cellular and molecular events that drive repair processes in scar formation remains poorly understood. Here, we firstly constructed tissue-wide gene expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of scar formation using the spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology in Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. We analyzed the transcriptomes of nearly 15449 spots from 32 samples and distinguished normal and damage response regions. Compared to histological changes, spatial mapping of differentiation transitions in spinal cord injury site delineated the possible trajectory between subpopulations of fibroblast, glia and immune cell more comprehensively and defined the extent of scar boundary and core more accurately. Locally, we identified gene expression gradients from leading edge to the core of scar areas that allow for re-understanding of the scar microenvironment and found some regulators in special cell types, such as Thbs1 and Col1a2 in macrophage, CD36 and Postn in fibroblast, Plxnb2 and Nxpe3 in microglia, Clu in astrocyte and CD74 in oligodendrocyte. Last, we profiled the bidirectional ligand-receptor interactions at the neighbor cluster boundary, contributing to maintain scar architecture during gliosis and fibrosis, and found GPR37L1_PSAP and GPR37_PSAP were top 2 enriched gene-pairs between microglia and fibroblast or microglia and astrocyte. Together, the establishment of these profiles firstly uncovered scar spatial heterogeneity and lineage trajectory, provide an unbiased view of scar and served as a valuable resource for CNS injury treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effectiveness and relationship between biased and unbiased measures of dopamine release and clearance</a></h4>

              
                Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is an effective tool for measuring dopamine (DA) release and clearance throughout the brain, including the ventral and dorsal striatum. Striatal DA terminals are abundant with signals heavily regulated by release machinery and the dopamine transporter (DAT). Peak height is a common method for measuring release but can be affected by changes in clearance. The Michaelis-Menten model has been a standard in measuring DA clearance, but requires experimenter fitted modeling subject to experimenter bias. The current study presents the use of the first derivative (velocity) of evoked DA signals as an alternative approach for measuring dopamine release and clearance and can be used to distinguish the two measures. Maximal upwards velocity predicts reductions in DA peak height due to D2 and GABAB receptor stimulation and by alterations in calcium concentrations. The Michaelis-Menten maximal velocity (Vmax) measure, an approximation for DAT numbers, predicted maximal downward velocity in slices and in vivo. Dopamine peak height and upward velocity were similar between wildtype C57 (WT) and DAT knock out (DATKO) mice. In contrast, downward velocity was considerably reduced and exponential decay (tau) was increased in DATKO mice, supporting use of both measures for changes in DAT activity. In slices, the competitive DAT inhibitors cocaine, PTT and WF23 increased peak height and upward velocity differentially across increasing concentrations, with PTT and cocaine reducing these measures at high concentrations. Downward velocity and tau values decreased and increased respectively across concentrations, with greater potency and efficacy observed with WF23 and PTT. In vivo recordings demonstrated similar effects of WF23 and PTT on measures of release and clearance. Tau was a more sensitive measure at low concentrations, supporting its use as a surrogate for the Michaelis-Menten measure of apparent affinity (Km). Together, these results inform on the use of these measures for DA release and clearance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Even well-practiced movements benefit from repetition</a></h4>

              
                Professional golf players spend years practicing, but will still perform one or two practice swings without a ball before executing the actual swing. Why do they do this? In this study we tested the hypothesis that repeating a well-practiced movement leads to a reduction of movement variability. To operationalize this hypothesis, participants were tested in a center-out reaching task with four different targets, on four different days. To probe the effect of repetition they performed random sequences from one to six movements to the same target. Our findings show that, with repetition, movements are not only initiated earlier but their variability is reduced across the entire movement trajectory. Furthermore, this effect is present within and across the four sessions. Together, our results suggest that movement repetition changes the tradeoff between movement initiation and movement precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging impairs primary task resumption and attentional control processes following interruptions</a></h4>

              
                Attentional selection of working memory content is impaired after an interruption. This effect was shown to increase with age. Here we investigate how electrophysiological mechanisms underlying attentional selection within working memory differ during primary task resumption between younger and older adults. Participants performed a working memory task, while be-ing frequently interrupted with either a cognitively low- or high-demanding arithmetic task. Afterwards, a retrospective cue (retro-cue) indicated the working memory content required for later report. The detrimental effect of the interruption was evident in both age groups, but while younger adults were more strongly affected by a high- than by a low-demanding inter-ruption, the performance deficit appeared independently of the cognitive requirements of the interruption task in older adults. A similar pattern was found regarding frontal-posterior con-nectivity in the theta frequency range, suggesting that aging decreases the ability to selectively maintain relevant information within working memory. The power of mid-frontal theta oscilla-tions (4-7 Hz) featured a comparable effect of interruptions in both age groups. However, pos-terior alpha power (8-14 Hz) following the retro-cue was more diminished by a preceding in-terruption in older adults. These results suggest an age-related deficit in the attentional selec-tion and maintenance of primary task information following an interruption that appeared in-dependent from the cognitive requirements of the interrupting task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical and thalamic influences on striatal involvement in instructed, serial reversal learning; implications for the organisation of flexible behaviour.</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility is essential for enabling an individual to respond adaptively to changes in their environment. Evidence from human and animal research suggests that the control of cognitive flexibility is dependent on an array of neural architecture. Cortico-basal ganglia circuits have long been implicated in cognitive flexibility. In particular, the role of the striatum is pivotal, acting as an integrative hub for inputs from the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, and modulation by dopamine and acetylcholine. Striatal cholinergic modulation has been implicated in the flexible control of behaviour, driven by input from the centromedian-parafascicular nuclei of the thalamus. However, the role of this system in humans is not clearly defined as much of the current literature is based on animal work. Here, we aim to investigate the roles corticostriatal and thalamostriatal connectivity in serial reversal learning. Functional connectivity between the left centromedian-parafascicular nuclei and the associative dorsal striatum was significantly increased for negative feedback compared to positive feedback. Similar differences in functional connectivity were observed for the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, but these were localised to when participants switched to using an alternate response strategy following reversal. These findings suggest that connectivity between the centromedian-parafascicular nuclei and the striatum may be used to generally identify potential changes in context based on negative outcomes, and the effect of this signal on striatal output may be influenced by connectivity between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum.

                Food choice is one of the most fundamental and most frequent value-based decisions for all animals including humans. However, the neural circuitry involved in food-based decisions is only recently being addressed. Given the relatively fast dynamics of decision formation, EEG-informed fMRI analysis is highly beneficial for localizing this circuitry in humans. Here by using the EEG correlates of evidence accumulation in a simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI dataset, we found a significant role for the right temporal-parietal operculum (PO) and medial insula including gustatory cortex (GC) in binary choice between food items. These activations were uncovered by using the EEG energy (power 2) as the BOLD regressor and were missed if conventional analysis with the EEG signal itself were to be used, in agreement with theoretical predictions for EEG and BOLD relations. No significant positive correlations were found with higher powers of EEG (powers 3 or 4) pointing to specificity and sufficiency of EEG energy as the main correlate of the BOLD response. This finding extends the role of cortical areas traditionally involved in palatability processing to value-based decision making and offers the EEG energy as a key regressor of BOLD response in simultaneous EEG-fMRI designs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down contribution to motor network reorganization during action preparation</a></h4>

              
                It is unclear whether the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) recorded in humans during action preparation mirrors motor areas activation escalation, or if its early and late phases reflect the engagement of different functional networks. Here, we aimed at recording the TMS evoked-potentials (TEP) stimulating the supplementary motor area (SMA) to assess whether and how cortical excitability and functional connectivity of this region change as the BP increases. We hypothesize that, at later stages, the SMA functional network should become more connected to regions relevant for the implementation of the final motor plan. We performed TMS-EEG recordings on fourteen healthy subjects during the performance of a visuomotor Go/No-go task, eliciting and recording cortical activity and functional connectivity at -700 ms and -300 ms before the onset of visual stimuli over the SMA. When approaching stimulus onset, and thus BP peak, the SMA increased its functional connectivity with movement-related structures in the gamma and alpha bands, indicating a regional top-down preparation to implement the motor act. Beta-band connectivity, instead, was maintained constant for the whole BP time-course, being potentially related to sustained attention required by the experimental task. These findings reveal that the BP is not a mere result of increased activation of the SMA, but the functional networks in which this region is involved qualitatively changes over time, becoming more related to the execution of the motor act.

                Self-relevant concepts are major building blocks of spontaneous thought, and their dynamics in a natural stream of thought are likely to reveal one's internal states important for mental health. Here we conducted an fMRI experiment (n = 62) to examine brain representations and dynamics of self-generated concepts in the context of spontaneous thought using a newly developed free association-based thought sampling task. The dynamics of conceptual associations were predictive of individual differences in general negative affectivity, replicating across multiple datasets (n = 196). Reflecting on self-generated concepts strongly engaged brain regions linked to autobiographical memory, conceptual processes, emotion, and autonomic regulation, including the medial prefrontal and medial temporal subcortical structures. Multivariate pattern-based predictive modeling revealed that the neural representations of valence became more person-specific as the level of perceived self-relevance increased. Overall, this study provides a hint of how self-generated concepts in spontaneous thought construct inner affective states and idiosyncrasies.

                The Fluid And White matter Suppression (FLAWS) MRI sequence allows for the acquisition of multiple T1-weighted contrasts in a single sequence acquisition. However, its acquisition time is prohibitive for use in clinical practice when the k-space is linearly downsampled and reconstructed using the Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA) technique. This study proposes a FLAWS sequence optimization tailored to allow for the acquisition of FLAWS images with a Cartesian phyllotaxis k-space undersampling and compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction at 3T. The CS FLAWS sequence parameters were determined using a method previously employed to optimize FLAWS imaging at 1.5T and 7T. In-vivo experiments show that the proposed CS FLAWS optimization allows to reduce the FLAWS sequence acquisition time from 8 mins to 6 mins without decreasing the FLAWS image quality. In addition, this study demonstrates for the first time that T1-weighted imaging with low B1 sensitivity and T1 mapping can be performed with the FLAWS sequence at 3T for both GRAPPA and CS reconstructions. The FLAWS T1 mapping was validated using in-silico, in-vitro and in-vivo experiments with comparison against the inversion recovery turbo spin echo and MP2RAGE T1 mappings. These new results suggest that the recent advances in FLAWS imaging allow to combine the MP2RAGE imaging benefits (T1-weigthed imaging with low B1 sensitivity and T1 mapping) and with the previous version of FLAWS imaging benefits (multi T1-weighted contrast imaging) in a single 6 mins sequence acquisition.

                Photoreceptor degeneration leads to irreversible vision loss in humans with retinal dystrophies such as Retinitis Pigmentosa. Whereas photoreceptor loss is permanent in mammals, zebrafish possesses the ability to regenerate retinal neurons and restore visual function. Following acute damage, Muller glia (MG) re-enter the cell cycle and produce multipotent progenitors whose progeny differentiate into mature neurons. Both MG reprogramming and proliferation of retinal progenitor cells require reactive microglia and associated inflammatory signaling. Paradoxically, MG in zebrafish models of photoreceptor degeneration fail to re-enter the cell cycle and regenerate lost cells. Here, we used the zebrafish cep290 mutant to demonstrate that progressive cone degeneration generates an immune response but does not stimulate MG proliferation. Acute light damage triggered photoreceptor regeneration in cep290 mutants but cones were only restored to pre-lesion densities. Using irf8 mutant zebrafish, we found that the chronic absence of microglia reduced inflammation and rescued cone degeneration in cep290 mutants. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed sustained expression of notch3 in MG of cep290 mutants and inhibition of Notch signaling induced MG to re-enter the cell cycle. Our findings provide new insights on the requirements for MG to proliferate and the potential for immunosuppression to prolong photoreceptor survival.

                Complex febrile seizures (CFS), a subset of paediatric febrile seizures (FS), have been studied for their prognosis, epileptogenic potential and neurocognitive outcome. We evaluated their functional connectivity differences with simple febrile seizures (SFS) in children with recent-onset FS. Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) datasets of 24 children with recently diagnosed FS (SFS n=11; CFS n=13) were analysed. Functional connectivity (FC) was estimated using time series correlation of seed region to whole brain voxels and network topology was assessed using graph theory measures. Regional connectivity differences were correlated with clinical characteristics (FDR corrected p < 0.05). CFS patients demonstrated increased FC of the bilateral middle temporal pole (MTP), and bilateral thalami when compared to SFS. Network topology study revealed increased clustering coefficient and decreased participation coefficient in basal ganglia and thalamus suggesting an inefficient-unbalanced network topology in patients with CFS. The number of seizure recurrences negatively correlated with the integration of Left Thalamus ( r= -0.58 ) and FC measures of Left MTP to 'Right Supplementary Motor and left Precentral' connectivity (r=-0.53). The FC of Right MTP to Left Amygdala, Putamen, Parahippocampal, and Orbital Frontal Cortex ( r=0.61 ) and FC of Left Thalamus to left Putamen, Pallidum, Caudate, Thalamus Hippocampus and Insula (r 0.55) showed a positive correlation to the duration of the longest seizure. The findings of the current study report altered connectivity in children with CFS proportional to the seizure recurrence and duration. Regardless of the causal/consequential nature, such observations demonstrate the imprint of these disease-defining variables of febrile seizures on the developing brain.

                The detection of visual motion enables sophisticated animal navigation, and studies in flies have provided profound insights into the cellular and circuit basis of this neural computation. The fly's directionally selective T4 and T5 neurons respectively encode ON and OFF motion. Their axons terminate in one of four retinotopic layers in the lobula plate, where each layer encodes one of four cardinal directions of motion. While the input circuitry of the directionally selective neurons has been studied in detail, the synaptic connectivity of circuits integrating T4/T5 motion signals is largely unknown. Here we report a 3D electron microscopy reconstruction, wherein we comprehensively identified T4/T5's synaptic partners in the lobula plate, revealing a diverse set of new cell types and attributing new connectivity patterns to known cell types. Our reconstruction explains how the ON and OFF motion pathways converge. T4 and T5 cells that project to the same layer, connect to common synaptic partners symmetrically, that is with similar weights, and also comprise a core motif together with bilayer interneurons, detailing the circuit basis for computing motion opponency. We discovered pathways that likely encode new directions of motion by integrating vertical and horizontal motion signals from upstream T4/T5 neurons. Finally, we identify substantial projections into the lobula, extending the known motion pathways and suggesting that directionally selective signals shape feature detection there. The circuits we describe enrich the anatomical basis for experimental and computations analyses of motion vision and bring us closer to understanding complete sensory-motor pathways.

                Antisense oligonucleotide therapy targeting ATXN2, a gene in which mutations cause neurodegenerative diseases spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has entered clinical trials in humans. Additional methods to lower ataxin 2 levels would be beneficial not only in uncovering potentially cheaper or less invasive therapies, but also in gaining greater mechanistic insight into how ataxin 2 is normally regulated. We performed a genome-wide fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based CRISPR screen in human cells and identified multiple subunits of the lysosomal vacuolar ATPase (v ATPase) as regulators of ataxin 2 levels. We demonstrate that Etidronate, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that inhibits the v ATPase, lowers ataxin 2 protein levels in mouse and human neurons. Moreover, oral administration of the drug to mice in their water supply and food is sufficient to lower ataxin-2 levels in the brain. Thus, we uncover Etidronate as a safe and inexpensive compound for lowering ataxin-2 levels and demonstrate the utility of FACS-based screens for identifying targets to modulate levels of human disease proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting RTN4/NoGo-Receptor reduces levels of ALS protein ataxin-2</a></h4>

              
                Gene-based therapeutic strategies to lower ataxin-2 levels are emerging for neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). To identify additional ways of reducing ataxin-2 levels, we performed a genome-wide screen in human cells for regulators of ataxin-2 and identified RTN4R, the gene encoding the RTN4/NoGo-Receptor, as a top hit. RTN4R knockdown, or treatment with a peptide inhibitor, was sufficient to lower ataxin-2 protein levels in mouse and human neurons in vitro and Rtn4r knockout mice have reduced ataxin-2 levels in vivo. Remarkably, we observed that ataxin-2 shares a role with the RTN4/NoGo-Receptor in limiting axonal regeneration. Reduction of either protein increases axonal regrowth following axotomy. These data define the RTN4/NoGo-Receptor as a novel therapeutic target for ALS and SCA2 and implicate the targeting of ataxin-2 as a potential treatment following nerve injury.

	<p>Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis. To date, there has been no study on the relationship between antibody (Ab) titers and clinical phenotype. This study aims to clarify the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid Ab titers and clinical manifestations of anti-NMDAR encephalitis at onset. Seventy-six consecutive patients with a definite diagnosis were enrolled. The relationship between Ab titers and different onset symptoms including psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and memory deficits were analyzed. We further investigated the correlation between Ab titers and clinical severity as assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the clinical assessment scale for autoimmune encephalitis (CASE), respectively. The Ab titers had a median value of 1:10 (range 1:1&amp;amp;ndash;1:100). There was no significant difference in titers among various clinical factors including gender and combination of tumor and other diseases (each p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms at onset had higher titers than those with seizures (p = 0.008) and memory deficits (p = 0.003). The mRS scores revealed a significant but weak correlation with Ab titers (r = 0.243, p = 0.034), while CASE scores did not correlate with the titers (p = 0.125). Our findings indicated that the Ab titers were associated with the type of onset symptoms, with a higher level of patients with psychiatric symptoms. Regarding the clinical severity, the titers showed a weak correlation with the mRS, but no correlation with the CASE.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: A previous study has shown that cognitive training with neurofeedback (CT-NF) using down-regulation improves cognitive functions in young adults. Neurofeedback has two strategies for manipulating brain activity (down-regulation and upregulation). However, the benefit of CT-NF with the upregulation of cognitive functions is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the upregulation of CT-NF improves a wide range of cognitive functions compared to cognitive training alone. (2) Methods: In this double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), 60 young adults were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CT-NF group, CT alone group, and an active control (ACT) group who played a puzzle game. Participants in the three groups used the same device (tablet PC and 2ch NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy)) and performed the training game for 20 min every day for four weeks. We measured brain activity during training in all groups, but only CT-NFs received NF. We also measured a wide range of cognitive functions before and after the intervention period. (3) Results: The CT-NF groups showed superior beneficial effects on episodic memory, working memory, and attention compared to the CT alone and ACT groups. In addition, the CT-NF group showed an increase in brain activity during CT, which was associated with improvements in cognitive function. (4) Discussion: This study first demonstrated that the CT-NF using the upregulation strategy has beneficial effects on cognitive functions compared to the CT alone. Our results suggest that greater brain activities during CT would enhance a benefit from CT.</p>

	<p>We investigated whether treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to protect spiral ganglion cells (SGCs), could also protect hair cells (HCs) and supporting cells (SCs) in the organ of Corti of a guinea pig model of sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss was induced by administration of kanamycin/furosemide and two BDNF treatments were performed: (1) by gelatin sponge (BDNF-GS) with acute cochlear implantation (CI), and (2) through a mini-osmotic pump (BDNF-OP) with chronic CI. Outer HCs (OHCs), inner HCs (IHCs), Border, Phalangeal, Pillar, Deiters&amp;amp;rsquo;, and Hensen&amp;amp;rsquo;s cells were counted. The BDNF-GS cochleas had significantly fewer OHCs compared to the untreated ones, while the IHC and SC numbers did not differ between treated and untreated cochleas. The BDNF-OP group showed similar cell numbers to the untreated group. SGC packing density was not correlated with the total number of SCs for either BDNF group. Our data suggest that: (1) BDNF does not prevent cell death in the organ of Corti, and that the protection of SGCs could result from a direct targeting by BDNF; (2) BDNF might induce a different function/activity of the remaining cells in the organ of Corti (independently from cell number).</p>

	<p>Background: Hydrocephalus among Severe Acquired Brain Injury (SABI) patients remains overlooked during rehabilitation. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of traumatic and non-traumatic SABI patients with hydrocephalus, consecutively admitted over 9 years in a tertiary referral specialized rehabilitation hospital. Patients were treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt before or during inpatient rehabilitation and assessed using the Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale and Disability Rating Scale. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of post-surgical complications. Linear regression models were used to investigate predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), disability, and cognitive function. Results: Of the 82 patients, 15 had post-surgical complications and 16 underwent cranioplasty. Shunt placement complication risk was higher when fixed vs. when programmable pressure valves were used. A total of 56.3% achieved functional improvement at discharge and 88.7% improved in cognitive function; of the 82 patients, 56% were discharged home. In multiple regression analyses, higher disability at discharge was related to cranioplasty and longer LOS, while poorer cognitive function was associated with cranioplasty. Increase in LOS was associated with increasing time to shunt and decreasing age. Conclusions: A significant improvement in cognitive and functional outcomes can be achieved. Cranioplasty increased LOS, and fixed pressure valves were related to poorer outcomes.</p>

	<p>Verbal fluency (VF) is an informative cognitive task. Lesion and functional imaging studies implicate distinct cerebral areas that support letter versus semantic fluency and the understanding of neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying task performance. Most lesion studies include chronic stroke patients. People with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) provide complementary evidence for lesion-deficit associations, as different brain areas are affected in stroke versus PPA. In the present study we sought to determine imaging, clinical and demographic correlates of VF in PPA. Thirty-five patients with PPA underwent an assessment with letter and category VF tasks, evaluation of clinical features and an MRI scan for volumetric analysis. We used stepwise regression models to determine which brain areas are associated with VF performance while acknowledging the independent contribution of clinical and demographic factors. Letter fluency was predominantly associated with language severity (R2 = 38%), and correlated with the volume of the left superior temporal regions (R2 = 12%) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal area (R2 = 5%). Semantic fluency was predominantly associated with dementia severity (R2 = 47%) and correlated with the volume of the left inferior temporal gyrus (R2 = 7%). No other variables were significantly associated with performance in the two VF tasks. We concluded that, independently of disease severity, letter fluency is significantly associated with the volume of frontal and temporal areas whereas semantic fluency is associated mainly with the volume of temporal areas. Furthermore, our findings indicated that clinical severity plays a critical role in explaining VF performance in PPA, compared to the other clinical and demographic factors.</p>

SF3B1-mutated MDS, which is strongly associated with ringed sideroblast morphology, is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to severe, often fatal anemia. However, functional evidence linking SF3B1 mutations to the anemia described...

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance Analysis of Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm on systems of linear equations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Problem solving and modelling in traditional substitution methods at large scale for systems using sets of simultaneous equations is time consuming. For such large scale global-optimization problem, Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as meta-heuristics for random search technique perform faster. Therefore, this study applies the SA to solve the problem of linear equations and evaluates its performances against Genetic Algorithms (GAs), a population-based search meta-heuristic, which are widely used in Travelling Salesman problems (TSP), Noise reduction and many more. This paper presents comparison between performances of the SA and GA for solving real time scientific problems. The significance of this paper is to solve the certain real time systems with a set of simultaneous linear equations containing different unknown variable samples those were simulated in Matlab using two algorithms-SA and GA. In all of the experiments, the generated random initial solution sets and the random population of solution sets were used in the SA and GA respectively. The comparison and performances of the SA and GA were evaluated for the optimization to take place for providing sets of solutions on certain systems. The SA algorithm is superior to GA on the basis of experimentation done on the sets of simultaneous equations, with a lower fitness function evaluation count in MATLAB simulation. Since, complex non-linear systems of equations have not been the primary focus of this research, in future, performances of SA and GA using such equations will be addressed. Even though GA maintained a relatively lower number of average generations than SA, SA still managed to outperform GA with a reasonably lower fitness function evaluation count. Although SA sometimes converges slowly, still it is efficient for solving problems of simultaneous equations in this case. In terms of computational complexity, SA was far more superior to GAs.

                Background: Gamification is an innovative approach to engaging in activities that people believe as less interesting. Recycling has been an issue not taken aware by the people in environmental sustainability. There are substantial studies on recycling intention due to the continual growth of unethical and unsustainable waste disposal. Creative approaches to recycling awareness activities should be made to fulfil youths’ increasing interest in and demand for recycling. The main objective of this study is to explore the factors related to youths’ recycling intentions after experiencing a gamified online recycling learning activity, Edcraft Gamified Learning (EGL). Gamified recycling education is believed to be a practical and engaging approach for youths. Methods: 100 students participated in EGL, consisting of two levels of plastic crafting and recycling activities. They experienced online EGL at home between May and September in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic total lockdown in Malaysia, namely, Movement Control Order (MCO). 29 participants were selected to participate in five focus group discussions (FGDs) with five to eight participants per session to explore their opinions towards gamified learning, motivation and recycling intention. Results: This paper reports the findings of the FGDs. A codebook was developed based on the codes from the FGD feedback. The codes were rated by two raters, followed by an assessment of inter-rater reliability and thematic analysis. The findings emerged and were confirmed with four themes as factors that influence recycling intention. They are gameful experience, social influence, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Conclusion: The dependent variable, recycling intention, was connected to the four themes to verify the conceptual framework. One limitation of the study was the design of the EGL activity, which was only carried out over two days with two levels of gamified recycling education, as students had concurrent academic online classes during that period.

                Background: The study aimed to examine the effect of administering CHAGURO (a product of the combination of siamese pumpkin and tuna-based powder) on the lipid profile in prediabetes individuals with dyslipidemia. Methods: The experimental trial was conducted with two intervention groups, with each group receiving a dose of 7.5g/70kg body weight (BW)/day (low dose) and 15g/70kg BW/day (high dose) for 60 days. Respondents were randomized into intervention groups using simple randomization. Before and after the intervention, pre-test and post-test examinations were performed, factors examined included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, eating intake with the SQ-FFQ (Semi Quantitative-Food Frequency Questionnaire) interview, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity using InternationalPhysical Activity Questionnaires-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). During the intervention, blood pressure and BMI data were taken before and after the study. Statistical analysis included descriptive tests, independent and paired T-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to the baseline, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in the two groups did not improve significantly by 60 days. For lipid variables, a significant improvement in the cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (chol/HDL) ratios were observed when compared against the baseline for the two groups. When comparing the changes between groups, 7.5 g of CHAGURO showed a larger improvement in HDL-C (mean differences: 1.86 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.86-4.59), compared to 15 g of CHAGURO (mean differences: -3.62 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.53-0.28). A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the chol/HDL ratio was observed in the 7.5 g CHAGURO group (mean differences: -0.20 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39-(-0.01)). Conclusions: CHAGURO can be a functional food alternative to improve the condition of prediabetes people with dyslipidemia.

                Introduction: Faith and systems of beliefs are known to impact not only the emotional, but also the immunological state of believers in ways that we are just starting to understand. Moreover, clinical implications of previous studies are limited.  The aim of the “HEALING” (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) Study was to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting a chaplain coupled with biblical readings. Methods: Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to find those who were the most in need of an intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at the bedside (n= 20) or in the chapel (n= 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n=19). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and 60 minutes after the meeting to measure white blood cells (WBC), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings of the same passage from the Bible (n=21). Results: Lymphocyte counts increased more often after the more successful visits, but the immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe=0.003) correlation was revealed between changes in lymphocytes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions: Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplains’ main message is understood.

                IIntroduction : Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children. Estimate potentially preventable variables that impact the length of hospital stay are a priority to reduce the costs associated with this disease. This study aims to identify clinical variables associated with length of hospital stay of bronchiolitis in children in a tropical middle-income country Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 417 infants with bronchiolitis in tertiary centers in Colombia. All medical records of all patients admitted throughto the emergency department were reviewed. To identify factors independently associated we use negative binomial regression model, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and adjust for potential confounding variables Results : The median of the length of hospital stay was 3.68 days, with a range of 0.774 days to 29 days, 138 (33.117%) of patients have a hospital stay of 5 or more days. After modeling and controlling for potential confounders age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, Detection of RSV isolation, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS Conclusions : Our results show that in infants with bronchiolitis, Detection of RSV isolation, age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, efforts to reduce the probability of RSV infection can reduce the high medical cost associates with prolonged LOS in bronchiolitis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic evaluation of NIPT aneuploidy detection software tools with clinically validated NIPT samples</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Priit Paluoja, Hindrek Teder, Amin Ardeshirdavani, Baran Bayindir, Joris Vermeesch, Andres Salumets, Kaarel Krjutškov, Priit Palta</p>

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a powerful screening method for fetal aneuploidy detection, relying on laboratory and computational analysis of cell-free DNA. Although several published computational NIPT analysis tools are available, no prior comprehensive, head-to-head accuracy comparison of the various tools has been published. Here, we compared the outcome accuracies obtained for clinically validated samples with five commonly used computational NIPT aneuploidy analysis tools (WisecondorX, NIPTeR, NIPTmer, RAPIDR, and GIPseq) across various sequencing depths (coverage) and fetal DNA fractions. The sample set included cases of fetal trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). We determined that all of the compared tools were considerably affected by lower sequencing depths, such that increasing proportions of undetected trisomy cases (false negatives) were observed as the sequencing depth decreased. We summarised our benchmarking results and highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of each computational NIPT software. To conclude, trisomy detection for lower coverage NIPT samples (e.g. 2.5M reads per sample) is technically possible but can, with some NIPT tools, produce troubling rates of inaccurate trisomy detection, especially in low-FF samples.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Internal state effects on behavioral shifts in freely behaving praying mantises (Tenodera sinensis)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shanel C. Pickard, David J. Bertsch, Zoe Le Garrec, Roy E. Ritzmann, Roger D. Quinn, Nicholas S. Szczecinski</p>

How we interact with our environment largely depends on both the external cues presented by our surroundings and the internal state from within. Internal states are the ever-changing physiological conditions that communicate the immediate survival needs and motivate the animal to behaviorally fulfill them. Satiety level constitutes such a state, and therefore has a dynamic influence on the output behaviors of an animal. In predatory insects like the praying mantis, hunting tactics, grooming, and mating have been shown to change hierarchical organization of behaviors depending on satiety. Here, we analyze behavior sequences of freely hunting praying mantises (<i>Tenodera sinensis</i>) to explore potential differences in sequential patterning of behavior as a correlate of satiety. First, our data supports previous work that showed starved praying mantises were not just more often attentive to prey, but also more often attentive to <i>further</i> prey. This was indicated by the increased time fraction spent in attentive bouts such as prey monitoring, head turns (to track prey), translations (closing the distance to the prey), and more strike attempts. With increasing satiety, praying mantises showed reduced time in these behaviors and exhibited them primarily towards close-proximity prey. Furthermore, our data demonstrates that during states of starvation, the praying mantis exhibits a stereotyped pattern of behavior that is highly motivated by prey capture. As satiety increased, the sequenced behaviors became more variable, indicating a shift away from the necessity of prey capture to more fluid presentations of behavior assembly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Revealing mechanisms of infectious disease spread through empirical contact networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pratha Sah, Michael Otterstatter, Stephan T. Leu, Sivan Leviyang, Shweta Bansal</p>

The spread of pathogens fundamentally depends on the underlying contacts between individuals. Modeling the dynamics of infectious disease spread through contact networks, however, can be challenging due to limited knowledge of how an infectious disease spreads and its transmission rate. We developed a novel statistical tool, INoDS (Identifying contact Networks of infectious Disease Spread) that estimates the transmission rate of an infectious disease outbreak, establishes epidemiological relevance of a contact network in explaining the observed pattern of infectious disease spread and enables model comparison between different contact network hypotheses. We show that our tool is robust to incomplete data and can be easily applied to datasets where infection timings of individuals are unknown. We tested the reliability of INoDS using simulation experiments of disease spread on a synthetic contact network and find that it is robust to incomplete data and is reliable under different settings of network dynamics and disease contagiousness compared with previous approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in two host-pathogen systems: <i>Crithidia bombi</i> in bumblebee colonies and Salmonella in wild Australian sleepy lizard populations. INoDS thus provides a novel and reliable statistical tool for identifying transmission pathways of infectious disease spread. In addition, application of INoDS extends to understanding the spread of novel or emerging infectious disease, an alternative approach to laboratory transmission experiments, and overcoming common data-collection constraints.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">CNNM proteins selectively bind to the TRPM7 channel to stimulate divalent cation entry into cells</a></h4>

Magnesium is essential for cellular life, but how it is homeostatically controlled still remains poorly understood. Here, we report that members of CNNM family, which have been controversially implicated in both cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux, selectively bind to the TRPM7 channel to stimulate divalent cation entry into cells. Coexpression of CNNMs with the channel markedly increased uptake of divalent cations, which is prevented by an inactivating mutation to the channel’s pore. Knockout (KO) of <i>Trpm7</i> in cells or application of the TRPM7 channel inhibitor NS8593 also interfered with CNNM-stimulated divalent cation uptake. Conversely, KO of <i>CNNM3</i> and <i>CNNM4</i> in HEK-293 cells significantly reduced TRPM7-mediated divalent cation entry, without affecting TRPM7 protein expression or its cell surface levels. Furthermore, we found that cellular overexpression of phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs), known CNNMs binding partners, stimulated TRPM7-dependent divalent cation entry and that CNNMs were required for this activity. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that deletion of <i>CNNM3</i> and <i>CNNM4</i> from HEK-293 cells interfered with heterologously expressed and native TRPM7 channel function. We conclude that CNNMs employ the TRPM7 channel to mediate divalent cation influx and that CNNMs also possess separate TRPM7-independent Mg<sup>2+</sup> efflux activities that contribute to CNNMs’ control of cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.

This work addresses the need for new chemical matter in product development for control of pest insects and vector-borne diseases. We present a barcoding strategy that enables phenotypic screens of blood-feeding insects against small molecules in microtiter plate-based arrays and apply this to discovery of novel systemic insecticides and compounds that block malaria parasite development in the mosquito vector. Encoding of the blood meals was achieved through recombinant DNA-tagged <i>Asaia</i> bacteria that successfully colonised <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes. An arrayed screen of a collection of pesticides showed that chemical classes of avermectins, phenylpyrazoles, and neonicotinoids were enriched for compounds with systemic adulticide activity against <i>Anopheles</i>. Using a luminescent <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> reporter strain, barcoded screens identified 48 drug-like transmission-blocking compounds from a 400-compound antimicrobial library. The approach significantly increases the throughput in phenotypic screening campaigns using adult insects and identifies novel candidate small molecules for disease control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noncanonical projections to the hippocampal CA3 regulate spatial learning and memory by modulating the feedforward hippocampal trisynaptic pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiaoxiao Lin, Michelle Amalraj, Crisylle Blanton, Brenda Avila, Todd C. Holmes, Douglas A. Nitz, Xiangmin Xu</p>

The hippocampal formation (HF) is well documented as having a feedforward, unidirectional circuit organization termed the trisynaptic pathway. This circuit organization exists along the septotemporal axis of the HF, but the circuit connectivity across septal to temporal regions is less well described. The emergence of viral genetic mapping techniques enhances our ability to determine the detailed complexity of HF circuitry. In earlier work, we mapped a subiculum (SUB) back projection to CA1 prompted by the discovery of theta wave back propagation from the SUB to CA1 and CA3. We reason that this circuitry may represent multiple extended noncanonical pathways involving the subicular complex and hippocampal subregions CA1 and CA3. In the present study, multiple retrograde viral tracing approaches produced robust mapping results, which supports this prediction. We find significant noncanonical synaptic inputs to dorsal hippocampal CA3 from ventral CA1 (vCA1), perirhinal cortex (Prh), and the subicular complex. Thus, CA1 inputs to CA3 run opposite the trisynaptic pathway and in a temporal to septal direction. Our retrograde viral tracing results are confirmed by anterograde-directed viral mapping of projections from input mapped regions to hippocampal dorsal CA3 (dCA3). We find that genetic inactivation of the projection of vCA1 to dCA3 impairs object-related spatial learning and memory but does not modulate anxiety-related behaviors. Our data provide a circuit foundation to explore novel functional roles contributed by these noncanonical hippocampal circuit connections to hippocampal circuit dynamics and learning and memory behaviors.

                Many important scientific discoveries require lengthy experimental processes of trial and error and could benefit from intelligent prioritization based on deep domain understanding. While exponential growth in the scientific literature makes it difficult to keep current in even a single domain, that same rapid growth in literature also presents an opportunity for automated extraction of knowledge via text mining. We have developed a web application implementation of the KinderMiner algorithm for proposing ranked associations between a list of target terms and a key phrase. Any key phrase and target term list can be used for biomedical inquiry. We built the web application around a text index derived from PubMed. It is the first publicly available implementation of the algorithm, is fast and easy to use, and includes an interactive analysis tool. The KinderMiner web application is a public resource offering scientists a cohesive summary of what is currently known about a particular topic within the literature, and helping them to prioritize experiments around that topic. It performs comparably or better to similar state-of-the-art text mining tools, is more flexible, and can be applied to any biomedical topic of interest. It is also continually improving with quarterly updates to the underlying text index and through response to suggestions from the community. The web application is available at https://www.kinderminer.org.

                Xie et al. demonstrate that Cbln2-expressing neurons in the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus form a neural circuit to the cervical spinal cord to maintain repetitive orofacial self-grooming, suggesting a brain-to-spinal sensorimotor loop for repetitive behavior in mice.

                Many studies of neural coding identify features that are consistent across animals and treat individual variation as noise. Using an interpretable representation of hundreds of population recordings in primate retina, Shah et al. reveal structures in individual variability, co-variability of different cell types, sex-related differences, and similarities between macaque and human.

                Strategies are commonly used to improve working memory performance, but whether they change the information held in mind is less clear. Using a self-ordered selection task, Chiang et al. show that adopting sequencing strategies shifts information from single, highly tuned neurons to more distributed population codes in lateral prefrontal cortex.

                Tada et al. show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 followed by vaccination results in broadly neutralizing antibody. The C.1.2 variant has a highly mutated spike and is the most neutralization-resistant variant; however, its affinity for ACE2 is decreased. Thus, the virus cannot evolve to escape humoral response without becoming less fit.

                Lozano-Rodríguez et al. show that naïve subjects have enhanced SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T reactions, but reduced humoral specific responses compared to individuals recovered from COVID-19. However, almost eight months after vaccination, comparable specific responses are observed, with equivalent levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and neutralizing antibodies.

They also present the structures of the Kappa and Beta S-ACE2 complexes, where a population shift towards the three receptor-binding domain up conformation was observed. In combination with biochemical data these structures show how the S protein variants efficiently recognize and bind to ACE2.

It is widely believed that external radiation is responsible but a study now suggests there must be an additional, unknown source.
