	<p>Although the issue has been repeatedly explored, data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s sleep quality are inconsistent. To clarify these discrepancies, here we investigate possible age-related differences. During the lockdown, 112 parents of toddlers (0–3 years, N = 61) and pre-schoolers (4–5 years, n = 51) completed an online survey including the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Sleep-related items required an additional retrospective judgment, referring to the pre-pandemic period. During the lockdown, sleep schedules were delayed in both age groups whereas sleep quality (CSHQ total scores) improved in pre-schoolers but not in toddlers. Between-groups comparisons revealed that, prior to the lockdown, pre-schoolers showed worse sleep quality than toddlers, whereas this difference disappeared during home confinement. Also, pre-schoolers’ sleep timing was advanced before the lockdown and delayed during the lockdown relative to toddlers’. Our data highlight a significant modulation of age on the impact of the pandemic crisis on sleep, with pre-schoolers experiencing greater effects than toddlers. This profile suggests that factors affecting sleep features have different weights at different ages: sleep patterns would be mainly determined by developmental factors (i.e., biological drive) in younger children, whereas environmental factors (e.g., major lifestyle changes) would have a stronger effect on older ones.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-Type Specific Responses to Associative Learning in the Primary Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be a critical site for movement initiation and motor learning. Surprisingly, it has also been shown to possess reward-related activity, presumably to facilitate reward-based learning of new movements. However, whether reward-related signals are represented among different cell types in M1, and whether their response properties change after cue-reward conditioning remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging to monitor the activity of different neuronal cell types in M1 while mice engaged in a classical conditioning task. Our results demonstrate that most of the major neuronal cell types in M1 showed robust but differential responses to both cue and reward stimuli, and their response properties undergo cell-type specific modifications after associative learning. PV-INs' responses became more reliable to the cue stimulus, while VIP-INs' responses became more reliable to the reward stimulus. PNs only showed robust response to the novel reward stimulus, and they habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-IN responses emerged and became more reliable to both conditioned cue and reward stimuli after conditioning. These observations suggest that cue- and reward-related signals are represented among different neuronal cell types in M1, and the distinct modifications they undergo during associative learning could be essential in triggering different aspects of local circuit reorganization in M1 during reward-based motor skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transmit Field Bias Correction of T1w/T2w Myelin Maps</a></h4>

              
                T1-weighted divided by T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) myelin maps were initially developed for neuroanatomical analyses such as identifying cortical areas, but they are increasingly used in statistical comparisons across individuals and groups with other variables of interest. Existing T1w/T2w myelin maps contain residual radiofrequency transmit field (B1+) biases, which may be correlated with these variables of interest, leading to potentially spurious results. Here we propose multiple methods for correcting these transmit field biases using either explicit measures of the transmit field or alternatively a 'pseudo-transmit' approach that is highly correlated with the transmit field. We find that the resulting corrected T1w/T2w myelin maps are both better neuroanatomical measures (e.g., for use in cross-species comparisons), and more appropriate for statistical comparisons across individuals and groups (e.g., sex, age, or body-mass-index). We recommend that investigators who use the T1w/T2w approach for mapping cortical myelin use these B1+ transmit field corrected myelin maps going forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning Orientations: a Discrete Geometry Model</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brain, many neuronal ensembles are involved in representing spatial structure of the environment. In particular, there exist cells that encode the animal's location and cells that encode head direction. A number of studies have addressed properties of the spatial maps produced by these two populations of neurons, mainly by establishing correlations between their spiking parameters and geometric characteristics of the animal's environments. The question remains however, how the brain may intrinsically combine the direction and the location information into a unified spatial framework that enables animals' orientation. Below we propose a model of such a framework, using ideas and constructs from algebraic topology and synthetic affine geometry.

                A common approach to interpreting spiking activity is based on identifying the firing fields---regions in physical or configuration spaces that elicit responses of neurons. Common examples include hippocampal place cells that fire at preferred locations in the navigated environment, head direction cells that fire at preferred orientations of the animal's head, view cells that respond to preferred spots in the visual field, etc. In all these cases, firing fields were discovered empirically, by trial and error. We argue that the existence and a number of properties of the firing fields can be established theoretically, through topological analyses of the neuronal spiking activity.

                Western Pacific Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinsonism dementia Complex (ALS-PDC) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to the traditional consumption of cycad seeds by the Chamorro people of Guam. Little is known about the etiological role of cycad toxin in ALS-PDC. Patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells were derived from age and sex matched affected and unaffected patient lymphoid cells then differentiated into cerebral organoids. After three months, the ALS-PDC affected organoids were smaller, their neurons had less extensive neurite outgrowth, and the organoids had more reactive astrocytes and M1 microglia, fewer resting and M2 microglia, and more open extracellular space. Most of these phenomena could be recapitulated by exposing unaffected organoids to {beta}-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA), a toxic amino acid produced by cyanobacteria living with cycad plants. Furthermore, ALS-PDC affected organoids exhibited an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to BMAA exposure via activation of caspase1/NLRP3 inflammasome. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the organoids showed that the most down regulated pathways were taurine, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; protein digestion; and absorption. The most down-regulated biological processes were type I interferon signaling, regulation of neuron differentiation and extracellular matrix organization. Our results suggested that the etiology of ALS-PDC is due to metabolic disorders that shifted microglia to a more proinflammatory M1 state instead of a non-inflammatory, repairing M2 state, which exacerbated inflammation and reduced extracellular matrix strength. Supplementation of transforming growth factor beta to ALS/PDC affected organoids increased the expression of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) and restored M2 microglia populations and extracellular matrix organization. Organoids containing networks of neurons, astrocytes, microglia derived from iPSC with our protocol provides an excellent cellular model for neurodegenerative disease modeling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The degree of context un/familiarity impacts the emotional feeling and preaware cardiac-brain activity: a study with emotionally salient naturalistic paradigm using DENS Dataset</a></h4>

              
                Emotion experiments with naturalistic paradigms are emerging and giving new insights into dynamic brain activity. Context familiarity is considered as an important dimensions of emotion processing by appraisal theorists. However, how the context un/familiarity of the naturalistic stimuli influences the central and autonomic activity is not probed yet [check it]. Hence, we tried to address this issue in this work by breaking it down into three questions. 1) What is the relation between context un/familiarity with the neural correlates of self-assessment affective dimensions viz. valence and arousal; 2) the influence of context un/familiarity in cardiac-brain mutual interaction during emotion processing; 3.) brain network reorganization to accommodate the degree of context familiarity. We found that the less-context familiarity is primarily attributed to negative emotion feeling mediated by lack of predictability of sensory experience. Whereas, with high-context familiarity, both positive and negative emotions are felt. For less-context familiarity, the arousal activity is negatively correlated with EEG power. In addition, the cardiac activity for both high and less context familiarity is modulated before the reported self-awareness of emotional feeling. The correlation of cortical regions with cardiac activity and connectivity patterns reveals that ECG is modulated by salient feature during pre-awareness and correlates with AIC and conceptual hub in high-familiarity. Whereas, for the low familiarity, the cardiac activity is correlated with the exteroceptive sensory regions. In addition, we found that OFC and dmPFC have high connectivity with less-context familiarity, whereas AIC has high connectivity with high-context familiarity. To the best of our knowledge, the context familiarity and its influence on cardiac and brain activity have never been reported with a naturalistic paradigm. Hence, this study significantly contributes to understanding automatic processing of emotions by analyzing the effect of context un/familiarity on affective feelings, the dynamics of cardiac-brain mutual interaction, and the brain's effective connectivity during pre-awareness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct progressions of neuronal activity changes underlie the formation and consolidation of a gustatory associative memory</a></h4>

              
                Acquiring new memories is a multi-stage process. Ample of studies have convincingly demonstrated that initially acquired memories are labile, and only stabilized by later consolidation processes. These multiple phases of memory formation are known to involve modification of both cellular excitability and synaptic connectivity, which in turn change neuronal activity at both the single neuron and ensemble levels. However, the specific mapping between the known phases of memory and the observed changes in neuronal activity remains unknown. Here we address this unknown in the context of conditioned taste aversion learning by continuously tracking gustatory cortex (GC) neuronal taste responses from alert rats in the 24 hours following a taste-malaise pairing. We found that the progression of neuronal activity changes in the GC depend on the neuronal organizational level. The population response changed continuously; these changes, however, were only reflected in the population mean amplitude during the acquisition and consolidation phases, and in the known quickening of the ensemble state dynamics after the time of consolidation. Together our results demonstrate how complex dynamics in different representational level of cortical activity underlie the formation and stabilization of memory within the cortex.

                Recent studies using single-cell RNA-seq have revealed cellular heterogeneity in the developing mammalian cerebellum, yet the regulatory logic underlying this cellular diversity remains to be elucidated. Using integrated single-cell RNA and ATAC analyses, we resolved developmental trajectories of cerebellar progenitors and identified putative trans- and cis-elements that control cell state transition. We reverse-engineered gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of each cerebellar cell type. Through in silico simulations and in vivo experiments, we validated the efficacy of GRN analyses and uncovered the molecular control of a newly identified stem zone, the posterior transitory zone (PTZ), which contains multipotent progenitors for granule neurons, Bergmann glia, and choroid plexus epithelium. Importantly, we showed that perturbing cell fate specification of PTZ progenitors causes posterior cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, the most common cerebellar birth defect in humans. Our study provides a foundation for comprehensive studies of developmental programs of the mammalian cerebellum.

                Defining reference models for population variation, and the ability to study individual deviations is essential for understanding inter-individual variability and its relation to the onset and progression of medical conditions. In this work, we assembled a reference cohort of neuroimaging data from 82 sites (N=58,836; ages 2-100) and use normative modeling to characterize lifespan trajectories of cortical thickness and subcortical volume. Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1,985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gpr19 is a circadian clock-controlled orphan GPCR with a role in modulating free-running period and light resetting capacity of the circadian clock</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Gpr19 encodes an evolutionarily conserved orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with no established physiological function in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of Gpr19 in the circadian clock system. Experimental Approach: We examined whether and how the master circadian clock neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) express Gpr19. By analysing Gpr19-deficient (Gpr19-/-) mice, we asked whether Gpr19 has a role in modulating free-running period and light resetting capacity of the circadian clock. Key Results: Compared with the known common core clock genes, Gpr19 was identified to show several distinct yet limited features related to the circadian clock. Gpr19 mRNA was mainly expressed in the middle-to-dorsal region of the SCN. A conserved cAMP-responsive element within the Gpr19 promoter drove the circadian expression of Gpr19. Gpr19-/- mice exhibited a prolonged circadian period and a delayed initiation of daily locomotor activity in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Gpr19 deficiency caused the downregulation of several genes that normally peak during the night, including Bmal1 and Gpr176. Gpr19-/- mice had a reduced capacity for phase shift to early subjective night light. The defect was only observed for phase-delay, but not phase-advance, and accompanied by reduced response of c-Fos expression in the dorsal region of the SCN, while apparently normal in the ventral part of the SCN, in Gpr19-/- mice. Conclusion and Implications: Gpr19 is an SCN-enriched orphan GPCR with a distinct role in circadian regulation and thus may be a potential target for alleviating circadian clock disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task space exploration improves adaptation after incompatible virtual surgeries</a></h4>

              
                Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn new motor skills, a process that requires novel muscle activity patterns. Muscle synergies may simplify the generation of muscle patterns through the selection of a small number of synergy combinations. Learning new motor skills may then be achieved by acquiring novel muscle synergies. In a previous study, we used myoelectric control to construct virtual surgeries that altered the mapping from muscle activity to cursor movements. After compatible virtual surgeries, which could be compensated by recombining subject-specific muscle synergies, participants adapted quickly. In contrast, after incompatible virtual surgeries, which could not be compensated by recombining existing synergies, participants explored new muscle patterns, but failed to adapt. Here, we tested whether task space exploration can promote learning of novel muscle synergies, required to overcome an incompatible surgery. Participants performed the same reaching task as in our previous study, but with more time to complete each trial, thus allowing for exploration. We found an improvement in trial success after incompatible virtual surgeries. Remarkably, improvements in movement direction accuracy after incompatible surgeries occurred faster for corrective movements than for the initial movement, suggesting that learning of new synergies is more effective when used for feedback control. Moreover, reaction time was significantly higher after incompatible than after compatible virtual surgeries, suggesting an increased use of an explicit adaptive strategy to overcome incompatible surgeries. Taken together, these results indicate that exploration is important for skill learning and suggest that human participants, with sufficient time can learn new muscle synergies.

                Exosomes are secreted by every cell in our body under both physiological and pathological conditions. They travel in the blood, CSF, and all studied biofluids. Their biological roles have been reported to include delivery of important physiological cargo between organs and cells, clearance of toxic proteins; maintenance of cellular stasis, and the propagation of disease pathology. In the case of Alzheimers disease (AD) exosomes have been shown to carry pathological proteins such as amyloid, yet the specificity of this association of amyloid and exosomes is unclear. To address this deficiency, we utilized Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) to measure the binding of amyloid to exosomes. Here we report that Ab40 and Ab42 bind to exosomes in a saturable and endothermic manner, a phenomenon not observed with the scrambled versions of either peptide. This points to this interaction being more specific than previously understood, and to amyloid associated with exosomes as an important pool of this peptide in the plasma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Columnar processing of border ownership in primate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                To understand a visual scene, the brain segregates figures from background by assigning borders to foreground objects. Neurons in primate visual cortex encode which object owns a border (border ownership), but the underlying circuitry is not understood. Here we used multielectrode probes to record from border ownership selective units in different layers in macaque visual area V4 to study the laminar organization and timing of border ownership selectivity. We find that border ownership selectivity occurs first in deep layer units, in contrast to spike latency for small stimuli in the classical receptive field. Units on the same penetration typically share the preferred side of border ownership, also across layers, similar to orientation preference. Units are often border ownership selective for a range of border orientations, where the preferred sides of border ownership are systematically organized in visual space. Together our data reveal a columnar organization of border ownership in V4 where the earliest border ownership signals are not simply inherited from upstream areas, but computed by neurons in deep layers, and may thus be part of signals fed back to upstream cortical areas or the oculomotor system early after stimulus onset. The finding that preferred border ownership is clustered and can cover a wide range of spatially contiguous locations, suggests that the asymmetric context integrated by these neurons is provided in a systematically clustered manner, possibly through corticocortical feedback and horizontal connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual association cortex links cues with conjunctions of reward and locomotor contexts</a></h4>

              
                Postrhinal cortex (POR) and neighboring lateral visual association areas are necessary for identifying objects and interpreting them in specific contexts, but how POR neurons encode the same object across contexts remains unclear. Here, we imaged excitatory neurons in mouse POR across tens of days throughout initial cue-reward learning and reversal learning. As such, neurons were tracked across sessions/trials where the same cue was rewarded or unrewarded, during both locomotor and stationary contexts. Surprisingly, a large class of POR neurons were minimally cue-driven prior to learning. After learning, distinct clusters within this class responded selectively to a given cue when presented in a specific conjunction of reward and locomotion contexts. In addition, another class involved clusters of neurons whose cue responses were more transient, insensitive to reward learning, and adapted over thousands of presentations. These two classes of POR neurons may support context-dependent interpretation and context-independent identification of sensory cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal responses to focused ultrasound are gated by pre-stimulation brain rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Background: Owing to its high spatial resolution and penetration depth, transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) is one of the most promising approaches to non-invasive neuromodulation. Identifying the impact of the stimulation waveform and endogenous neural activity on neuromodulation outcome is critical to harnessing the potential of tFUS. Objective: Here we tested a new form of tFUS where the amplitude of the ultrasonic waveform is modulated at a rate much slower than the operating frequency. Moreover, we sought to identify the relationship between pre-stimulation neural activity and the neuronal response to tFUS. Methods: We applied three minutes of amplitude modulated (AM) tFUS at 40 Hz to the rat hippocampus while recording local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) from the sonicated region. To assess the role of AM, we also tested continuous-wave (CW) stimulation. Results: AM tFUS reduced firing rate during and immediately after stimulation. On the other hand, CW tFUS produced an acute firing rate increase that was abolished after sonication. For both waveforms, firing rate changes were stronger in units exhibiting high baseline LFP power, particularly in the gamma band (30-250 Hz). The neuromodulatory effect was also influenced by the prevalence of sharp wave ripples (SWR) during the pre-stimulation period, with firing rates modulated by up to 33% at units showing frequent baseline SWR. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that AM and CW tFUS produce qualitatively different neuronal outcomes, and that baseline rhythms may effectively gate the response to tFUS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The looping lullaby: closed-loop neurostimulation decreases sleepers' sensitivity to environmental noise</a></h4>

              
                Study Objective: Sleep is critical for physical and mental health. However, sleep disruption due to noise is a growing problem, causing long-lasting distress and fragilizing entire populations mentally and physically. Here for the first time, we tested an innovative and non-invasive potential countermeasure for sleep disruptions due to noise. Methods: We developed a new, modeling-based, closed-loop acoustic neurostimulation procedure (CLNS) to precisely phase-lock stimuli to slow oscillations (SO). We used CLNS to align, soft sound pulses to the start of the SO positive deflection to boost SO and sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Participants underwent three overnight EEG recordings. The first night served to determine each participant 's individual noise arousal threshold. The remaining two nights occurred in counterbalanced order: in the Disturbing night, loud, real-life noises were repeatedly presented; in the Intervention night, similar loud noises were played while using the CLNS to boost SO. All experimental manipulations were performed in the first three hours of sleep; participants slept undisturbed for the rest of the night. Results: In contrast to the Disturbing night, the probability of arousals caused by noise was significantly decreased in the Intervention night. Moreover, the CLNS intervention increased NREM duration and sleep spindle power across the night. Conclusions: These results show that our CLNS procedure can effectively protect sleep from disruptions caused by noise. Remarkably, even in the presence of loud environmental noise, CLNS ' soft and precisely timed sound pulses played a beneficial role in protecting sleep continuity. This represents the first successful attempt at using CLNS in a noisy environment.

                Recombinant human alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-insulin-like growth factor-2 (rhNAGLU-IGF2) is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for Sanfilippo B, a lysosomal storage disease. The fusion protein with IGF2 permits binding to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, because recombinant human NAGLU (rhNAGLU) is poorly mannose 6-phosphorylated. We previously administered rhNAGLU-IGF2 intracerebroventricularly to Sanfilippo B mice. We demonstrated therapeutic restoration of NAGLU, normalization of lysosomal storage, and improvement in markers of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Here, we studied intracerebroventricular rhNAGLU-IGF2 in murine and canine Sanfilippo B to determine potential effects on the behavioral phenotype and survival. Heparan sulfate (HS) levels in brain and heart were reduced following treatment with rhNAGLU-IGF2 or rhNAGLU. Treated mice showed improvement in disease markers such as beta-hexosaminidase, CD68, and LAMP1. We found a more normal number of stretch attend postures, a fear pose, in mice treated with either rhNAGLU or rhNAGLU-IGF2 vs vehicle-treated Sanfilippo B mice on elevated plus maze testing (p<0.001). We found a more normal dark/light activity pattern in Sanfilippo B mice treated with rhNAGLU-IGF2 compared to vehicle-treated Sanfilippo B mice (p=0.025). We found a 61% increase in survival in Sanfilippo B mice treated with rhNAGLU-IGF2 (mean 53d, median 48d) compared to vehicle-treated Sanfilippo B mice (mean 33d, median 37d; p<0.001). In canine Sanfilippo B, we found that rhNAGLU-IGF2 administered into cerebrospinal fluid normalized heparan sulfate and beta-hexosaminidase activity in gray and white matter brain regions. Proteomics analysis of cerebral cortex showed restoration of protein concentrations in pathways relevant to cognitive function, synapse, and the lysosome. Treatment with rhNAGLU-IGF2 may improve the phenotype of Sanfilippo B disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal dynamics of neural responses in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including sub-additive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low contrast. These phenomena are often studied independently. Here, we demonstrate these phenomena within the same experiment and model the underlying neural computations with a single computational model. We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from patients presented with stimuli that varied in contrast, duration, and inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Aggregating data across patients yielded 88 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1-V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several non-linear features: peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations; the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs; response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model comprised of a small set of canonical neuronal operations: linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex, and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down feedback enables flexible coding strategies in olfactory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In chemical sensation, multiple models have been proposed to explain how odors are represented by patterns of neuronal activity in the olfactory cortex. One hypothesis is that the identity of combinations of active neurons within specific sniff-related time windows are critical for encoding information about odors. Another model is that patterns of neural activity evolve across time and it is this temporal structure that is essential for encoding odor information. Interestingly, we found that top-down feedback to the olfactory bulb dictates what information is transmitted to the olfactory cortex by switching between these two strategies. Using a detailed model of the early olfactory system, we demonstrate that feedback control of inhibitory granule cells in the main olfactory bulb influences the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in mitral cells, thereby restructuring the firing patterns of piriform cortical cells across time. This resulted in performance gains in both the accuracy and reaction time of odor discrimination tasks. These findings lead us to propose a new framework for early olfactory computation, one in which top-down feedback to the bulb flexibly controls the temporal structure of neural activity in olfactory cortex, allowing the early olfactory system to dynamically switch between two distinct models of coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamocortical and intracortical contributions to stimulus-evoked and oscillatory activity in rodent primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical, horizontal connections seem ideally suited to contribute to cortical processing by spreading information across cortical space and coordinating activity between distant cortical sites. In sensory systems experiments have implicated horizontal connections in the generation of receptive fields and have in turn led to computational models of receptive field generation that rely on the contribution of horizontal connections. Testing the contribution of horizontal connections at the mesoscopic level has been difficult due to the lack of a suitable method to observe the activity of intracortical horizontal connections. Here, we develop such a method based on the analysis of the relative residues of the cortical laminar current source density reconstructions. In the auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils, the method is then tested by manipulating the contribution of horizontal connections by surgical dissection. Our results indicate that intracortical horizontal connections contribute to the frequency-tuning of mesoscopic cortical patches. Futhermore, we dissociated a type of cortical gamma oscillation based on horizontal connections between mesoscopic patches from gamma oscillations locally generated within mesoscopic patches. The data further imply that global and local coordination of activity during sensory stimulation occur in a low and high gamma frequency band, respectively. Taken together the present data demonstrate that intracortical horizontal connections play an important role in generating cortical feature tuning and coordinate neuronal oscillations across cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bispectrum-based Cross-frequency Functional Connectivity: A Study of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to affect functional connectivity (FC) across many brain regions. Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the first use of cross-bispectrum to reconstruct a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. An increase of within-band FC in AD is observed in low-frequency bands using both methods. Bispectrum also detects multiple cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD in delta-theta coupling. An increased importance of low-frequency coupling and decreased importance of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD. Integration properties of AD networks are more vulnerable than HC, while the segregation property is maintained in AD. Moreover, the segregation property of {gamma} is less vulnerable in AD, suggesting the shift of importance from high-frequency activity towards low-frequency components. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD. Moreover, the results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using bispectrum to reconstruct FC networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of a developmental switch in information transfer between whisker S1 and S2 cortex in mice</a></h4>

              
                The whiskers of rodents are a key sensory organ that provides critical tactile information for animal navigation and object exploration throughout life. Previous work has explored the developmental sensory-driven activation of the primary sensory cortex processing whisker information (wS1), also called barrel cortex. This body of work has shown that the barrel cortex is already activated by sensory stimuli during the first post-natal week. However, it is currently unknown when over the course of development these stimuli begin being processed by higher order cortical areas, such as secondary whisker somatosensory area (wS2). Here we investigate for the first time the developmental engagement of wS2 by sensory stimuli and the emergence of cortico-cortical communication from wS1 to wS2. Using in vivo wide-field imaging and electrophysiological recordings in control and conditional knock-out mice we find that wS1 and wS2 are able to process bottom-up information coming from the thalamus already right after birth. We identify that it is only at the end of the first post-natal week that wS1 begins to provide excitation into wS2, a connection which begins to acquire feed-forward inhibition characteristics after the second post-natal week. Therefore, we have uncovered a developmental window during which excitatory versus inhibitory functional connectivity between wS1 and wS2 takes place.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamo-hippocampal pathway regulates incidental memory load: insights from sex differences</a></h4>

              
                Memory can be challenged by increasing both its required duration and the amount of information to be encoded, namely the memory load. The dorsal hippocampus (dHP) has been involved in memory consolidation, which is the stabilization of a trace from short-term (STM) to long-term memory (LTM), as well as in the ability to process high information load. However, how memory load influences memory consolidation, and the underlying neural mechanisms, are yet unknown. To address this question, we used male and female mice that, despite having in our Different Object recognition Task (DOT) the same STM capacity of 6 objects, spontaneously show differences in the number of objects directly transferred to LTM, when tested over longer delays. Males memorize all 6 objects encoded, while females remember only up to 4, both at 1 and 24 h delays. Interestingly, males activate more the dHP (as measured by c-Fos expression), while females the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE). Optogenetic inhibition of the RE-dHP pathway during off-line memory consolidation favors 6-object LTM retention in females by removing inhibitory control over dHP activation, while chemogenetic RE-activation impairs it in males. Our data represent a first demonstration of a sub-cortical control of dHP recruitment, that might underlie its sex-dependent activation during incidental memory, with potential also for clinical application.

                Neural circuits carry out complex computations that allow animals to evaluate food, select mates, move toward attractive stimuli, and move away from threats. In insects, the subesophageal zone (SEZ) is a brain region that receives gustatory, pheromonal, and mechanosensory inputs and contributes to the control of diverse behaviors, including feeding, grooming, and locomotion. Despite its importance in sensorimotor transformations, the study of SEZ circuits has been hindered by limited knowledge of the underlying diversity of SEZ neurons. Here, we generate a collection of split-GAL4 lines that provides precise genetic targeting of 138 different SEZ cell types in adult D. melanogaster, comprising approximately one third of all SEZ neurons. We characterize the single cell anatomy of these neurons and find that they cluster by morphology into six supergroups that organize the SEZ into discrete anatomical domains. We find that the majority of local SEZ interneurons are not classically polarized, suggesting rich local processing, whereas SEZ projection neurons tend to be classically polarized, conveying information to a limited number of higher brain regions. This study provides insight into the anatomical organization of the SEZ and generates resources that will facilitate further study of SEZ neurons and their contributions to sensory processing and behavior.

                If a gabor pattern drifts in one direction while its internal texture drifts in the orthogonal direction, its perceived position deviates further and further away from its true path. We first evaluated the illusion using manual tracking. Participants followed the gabor with a stylus on a drawing tablet that coincided optically with the horizontal monitor surface. Their hand and the stylus were not visible during the tracking. The magnitude of the tracking illusion corresponded closely to previous perceptual and pointing measures indicating that manual tracking is a valid measure for the illusion. This allowed us to use it in a second experiment to capture the behavior of the illusion as it eventually degrades and breaks down in single trials. Specifically, the deviation of the gabor stops accumulating at some point and either stays at a fixed offset or resets toward the veridical position. To report the perceived trajectory of the gabor, participants drew it after the gabor was removed from the monitor. Resets were detected and analyzed and they suggest that there is a spatial limit beyond which the illusion saturates or resets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overlapping influences shape motor activity during hasty sensorimotor decisions</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals are able to adjust their speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) at will depending on the urge to act, favoring either cautious or hasty decision policies in different contexts. An emerging view is that SAT regulation relies on influences exerting broad changes on the motor system, tuning its activity up globally when hastiness is at premium. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. Fifty subjects performed a task involving choices between left and right index fingers, in which incorrect choices led either to a high or to a low penalty in two contexts, inciting them to emphasize either cautious or hasty policies. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation on multiple motor representations, eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEP) in nine finger and leg muscles. MEP amplitudes allowed us to probe activity changes in the corresponding finger and leg representations, while subjects were deliberating about which index to choose. Our data indicate that hastiness entails a broad amplification of motor activity, though this amplification was limited to the chosen side. On top of this effect, we identified a local suppression of motor activity, surrounding the chosen index representation. Hence, a decision policy favoring speed over accuracy appears to rely on overlapping processes producing a broad (but not global) amplification and a surround suppression of motor activity. The latter effect may help increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the chosen representation, as supported by single-trial correlation analyses indicating a stronger differentiation of activity changes in finger representations in the hasty context.

                The voltage-dependent motor protein, Prestin (SLC26A5) is responsible for the electromotive behavior of outer hair cells (OHCs). Here, we determined the structure of dolphin Prestin in complex with Cl- and the inhibitor Salicylate using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures establish the specific structural features of mammalian Prestin and reveal small but significant differences with the transporter members of the SLC26 family of membrane proteins. Comparison with SLC26A9 point to conformational differences in the special relationship between the core and gate domains. Importantly, we highlight substantial alterations to the hydrophobic footprint of Prestin as it relates to the membrane, which point to a potential influence of Prestin on its surrounding lipid. The structure of Prestin bound to the inhibitor Salicylate confirms the nature of the anion binding pocket, formed by TM3 and TM10 in the Core domain and a set of anion coordinating residues which include Q97, F101, F137, S398 and R399. The presence of a well-defined density for Salycilate points to an inhibition mechanism based on competition for the anion-binding pocket of Prestin. These observations illuminate the structural basis of Prestin electromotility, a key component in the mammalian cochlear amplifier.

<p>The "paintbrush" axon terminals from neurons of the nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc) exert a powerful boosting effect upon the ascending visual transmission in the optic tectum of birds. Although classically considered a cholinergic nucleus, Ipc neurons in adult chicks express VGLUT2 instead of VAChT. Performing <i>in-situ</i> hybridization and immunohistochemistry in chick embryos, the authors find that both vesicular transporters are strongly expressed in Ipc neurons throughout development, along with other cholinergic markers, but there is a marked decrease in VAChT expression before hatching. <i>Ex-vivo</i> deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular fillings reveal that Ipc axons exhibit conspicuous morphological transformations until late in development, suggesting that the presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release might be related to the growing and remodeling of this complex axon.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons can change their classical neurotransmitters during ontogeny, sometimes going through stages of dual release. Here, we explored the development of the neurotransmitter identity of neurons of the avian nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc), whose axon terminals are retinotopically arranged in the optic tectum (TeO) and exert a focal gating effect upon the ascending transmission of retinal inputs. Although cholinergic and glutamatergic markers are both found in Ipc neurons and terminals of adult pigeons and chicks, the mRNA expression of the acetylcholine vesicular transporter, VAChT, is weak or absent. To explore how the Ipc neurotransmitter identity is established during ontogeny, we analyzed the expression of mRNAs coding for cholinergic (ChAT, VAChT, and CHT) and glutamatergic (VGluT2 and VGluT3) markers in chick embryos at different developmental stages. We found that between E12 and E18, Ipc neurons expressed all cholinergic mRNAs, and also VGluT2 mRNA; however, from E16 through posthatch stages, VAChT mRNA expression was specifically diminished. Our ex-vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular filling experiments revealed that Ipc axons exhibit a mature paintbrush morphology late in development, experiencing marked morphological transformations during the period of presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release. Additionally, although ChAT protein immunoassays increasingly label the growing Ipc axon, this labeling was consistently restricted to sparse portions of the terminal branches. Combined, these results suggest that the synthesis of glutamate and acetylcholine, and their vesicular release, are complexly linked to the developmental processes of branching, growing and remodeling of these unique axons.</p>

     alt="Characterization of Tbr2-expressing retinal ganglion cells"/>
<p>Using genetic sparse labeling and recording on a newly engineered <i>T-brain 2</i> (Tbr2)<sup>CreERT2</sup> mouse line paired with various reporter lines, we identified seven types of Tbr2-expressing retina ganglion cells, including M1–M6 types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and a Pou4f1<sup>+</sup> RGC with bushy and small dendritic arbors stratifying into the OFF sublaminae (in red). Additionally, we identified three types of Tbr2-expressing amacrine cells, including two widefield and a mediumfield displaced amacrine cell (AC) types, all with dendritic arbors stratifying into the ON sublaminae (in black). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Tbr2 is essential for the survival of these RGCs and displaced ACs, as well as maintaining the expression of Opn4.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mammalian retina contains more than 40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes based on their unique morphologies, functions, and molecular profiles. Among them, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) are the first specified RGC type emerging from a common retinal progenitor pool during development. Previous work has shown that T-box transcription factor <i>T-brain 2</i> (<i>Tbr2</i>) is essential for the formation and maintenance of ipRGCs, and that Tbr2-expressing RGCs activate <i>Opn4</i> expression upon native ipRGC ablation, suggesting that Tbr2<sup>+</sup> RGCs contain a reservoir for ipRGCs. However, the identity of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> RGCs has not been fully vetted. Here, using genetic sparse labeling and single cell recording, we showed that Tbr2-expressing retinal neurons include RGCs and a subset of GABAergic displaced amacrine cells (dACs). Most Tbr2<sup>+</sup> RGCs are intrinsically photosensitive and morphologically resemble native ipRGCs with identical retinofugal projections. Tbr2<sup>+</sup> RGCs also include a unique and rare Pou4f1-expressing OFF RGC subtype. Using a loss-of-function strategy, we have further demonstrated that <i>Tbr2</i> is essential for the survival of these RGCs and dACs, as well as maintaining the expression of <i>Opn4</i>. These data set a strong foundation to study how Tbr2 regulates ipRGC development and survival, as well as the expression of molecular machinery regulating intrinsic photosensitivity.</p>

     alt="Organization and neural connections of the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust"/>
<p>Single cell tracer injections suggest that the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust integrates sensory signals with internal compass information to drive descending and premotor neurons that are likely involved in steering of the animal during locomotion. Overlap of inputs and outputs of the central complex in the gall and ovoid body of the lateral complex suggest feedback loops in the sky compass system.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral complexes (LXs) are bilaterally paired neuropils in the insect brain that mediate communication between the central complex (CX), a brain center controlling spatial orientation, various sensory processing areas, and thoracic motor centers that execute locomotion. The LX of the desert locust consists of the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), and the medial and lateral bulb. We have analyzed the anatomical organization and the neuronal connections of the LX in the locust, to provide a basis for future functional studies. Reanalyzing the morphology of neurons connecting the CX and the LX revealed likely feedback loops in the sky compass network of the CX via connections in the gall of the LAL and a newly identified neuropil termed ovoid body. In addition, we characterized 16 different types of neuron that connect the LAL with other areas in the brain. Eight types of neuron provide information flow between both LALs, five types are LAL input neurons, and three types are LAL output neurons. Among these are neurons providing input from sensory brain areas such as the lobula and antennal neuropils. Brain regions most often targeted by LAL neurons are the posterior slope, the wedge, and the crepine. Two descending neurons with dendrites in the LAL were identified. Our data support and complement existing knowledge about how the LAL is embedded in the neuronal network involved in processing of sensory information and generation of appropriate behavioral output for goal-directed locomotion.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In 1994, Burrill and Easter described the retinal projections in embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term “arborization fields” (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital Max Planck Zebrafish Brain Atlas. In our system, individual AFs are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei; AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation, and activation experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the synergy created by merging classical neuroanatomy with a cellular-resolution digital brain atlas resource and functional imaging in larval zebrafish.</p>

     alt="Differential expression of microRNAs in the developing avian auditory hindbrain"/>
<p>This study analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) in the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were broadly expressed in all four auditory nuclei. In the nucleus magnocelluaris (NM), nine miRNAs showed a spatially differential expression along the cochleotopic axis at embryonic Day 13, a prehearing stage. Quantification resulted in four distinct miRNA expression patterns, namely, homogenous, gradient, selective, and highly selective. The latter two expression patterns matched rhombomeric boundaries of this plurisegmental nucleus. Bioinformatics identified several functional groups of target mRNAs that might play an important role during ontogeny of this nucleus. This study adds miRNAs to the list of developmental gradients in the auditory system.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The avian auditory hindbrain is a longstanding model for studying neural circuit development. Information on gene regulatory network (GRN) components underlying this process, however, is scarce. Recently, the spatiotemporal expression of 12 microRNAs (miRNAs) was investigated in the mammalian auditory hindbrain. As a comparative study, we here investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the orthologous miRNAs during development of the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were expressed both at E13, an immature stage, and P14, a mature stage of the auditory system. In most auditory nuclei, a homogeneous expression pattern was observed at both stages, like the mammalian system. An exception was the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). There, at E13, nine miRNAs showed a differential expression pattern along the cochleotopic axis with high expression at the rostromedial pole. One of them showed a gradient expression whereas eight showed a spatially selective expression at the rostral pole that reflected the different rhombomeric origins of this composite nucleus. The miRNA differential expression persisted in the NM to the mature stage, with the selective expression changed to linear gradients. Bioinformatics analysis predicted mRNA targets that are associated with neuronal developmental processes such as neurite and synapse organization, calcium and ephrin-Eph signaling, and neurotransmission. Overall, this first analysis of miRNAs in the chicken central auditory system reveals shared and strikingly distinct features between chicken and murine orthologues. The embryonic gradient expression of these GRN elements in the NM adds miRNA patterns to the list of cochleotopic and developmental gradients in the central auditory system.</p>

     alt="ErbB4 mediates amyloid β-induced neurotoxicity through JNK/tau pathway activation: Implications for Alzheimer's disease"/>
<p>We investigated the role of ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV) neurons during Alzheimer's disease. Results revealed that ErbB4 in PV neurons might mediate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and reduce c-Fos by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/tau pathway, ultimately resulting in cognitive deficits. Moreover, JNK was activated by Aβ treatment rather than NRG1β1 treatment, suggesting that NRG1β1 and Aβ have different effects on ErbB4 downstream signaling pathways, probably providing a mechanism for NRG1 anti-Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons was associated with Aβ-induced cognitive deficits; however, the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we found that specific deletion of ErbB4 in PV neurons significantly attenuated oligomeric Aβ-induced neuronal toxicity and inhibited Aβ-induced decreases of PSD95 and synaptophysin. Moreover, specific ablation of ErbB4 in PV neurons altered activity-related protein c-Fos and decreased hippocampal PV neurons, especially in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hAPP-J20 mice. Furthermore, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a protein downstream of ErbB4, was activated by Aβ but not ErbB4's ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) β1, suggesting different downstream pathways for Aβ and NRG1β1. JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by the ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 and by pretreatment with NRG1β1. More importantly, siRNA knockdown of ErbB4 decreased JNK phosphorylation and expression, tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Thr 205, and Bax expression. Therefore, ErbB4 might mediate Aβ-induced neuropathology through the JNK/tau pathway and represent a potential therapeutic target in patients with AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual modulation of spectrotemporal receptive fields in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have established significant anatomical and functional connections between visual areas and primary auditory cortex (A1), which may be important for perceptual processes such as communication and spatial perception. However, much remains unknown about the microcircuit structure of these interactions, including how visual context may affect different cell types across cortical layers, each with diverse responses to sound. The present study examined activity in putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons across cortical layers of A1 in awake male and female mice during auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimulation. We observed a subpopulation of A1 neurons responsive to visual stimuli alone, which were overwhelmingly found in the deep cortical layers and included both excitatory and inhibitory cells. Other neurons for which responses to sound were modulated by visual context were similarly excitatory or inhibitory but were less concentrated within the deepest cortical layers. Important distinctions in visual context sensitivity were observed among different spike rate and timing responses to sound. Spike rate responses were themselves heterogeneous, with stronger responses evoked by sound alone at stimulus onset, but greater sensitivity to visual context by sustained firing activity following transient onset responses. Minimal overlap was observed between units with visual-modulated firing rate responses and spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) which are sensitive to both spike rate and timing changes. Together, our results suggest visual information in A1 is predominantly carried by deep layer inputs and influences sound encoding across cortical layers, and that these influences independently impact qualitatively distinct responses to sound.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal dynamics of human microglia are linked with brain developmental processes across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the brain's resident macrophages, shape neural development and wiring, and are key neuroimmune hubs in the pathological signature of neurodevelopmental disorders. In the human brain, microglial development has not been carefully examined yet, and most of our knowledge derives from rodents. We established an unprecedented collection of 97 post-mortem tissues enabling quantitative, sex-matched, detailed analysis of microglia across the human lifespan. We identify the dynamics of these cells in the human telencephalon, describing novel waves in microglial density across gestation and infancy, controlled by a balance of proliferation and apoptosis, which track key neurodevelopmental milestones. These profound changes in microglia are also observed in bulk RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq datasets. This study provides unparalleled insight and detail into the spatiotemporal dynamics of microglia across the human lifespan. Our findings serve as a solid foundation for elucidating how microglia contribute to shaping neurodevelopment in humans.

	<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), gait impairment is one of the most prominent symptoms. For a sensitive assessment of pathological gait patterns, a comprehensive analysis and processing of several gait analysis systems is necessary. The objective of this work was to determine the best diagnostic gait system (DIERS pedogait, GAITRite system, and Mobility Lab) using six machine learning algorithms for the differentiation between people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and healthy controls, between pwMS with and without fatigue and between pwMS with mild and moderate impairment. The data of the three gait systems were assessed on 54 pwMS and 38 healthy controls. Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear, radial basis function (rbf) and polynomial kernel were applied for the detection of subtle walking changes. The best performance for a healthy-sick classification was achieved on the DIERS data with a SVM rbf kernel (k = 0.49 ± 0.11). For differentiating between pwMS with mild and moderate disability, the GAITRite data with the SVM linear kernel (k = 0.61 ± 0.06) showed the best performance. This study demonstrates that machine learning methods are suitable for identifying pathologic gait patterns in early MS.</p>

	<p>A single bout of aerobic exercise improves executive function; however, the mechanism(s) underlying this improvement remains unclear. Here, we employed a 20-min bout of aerobic exercise, and at pre- and immediate post-exercise sessions examined executive function via pro- (i.e., saccade to veridical target location) and anti-saccade (i.e., saccade mirror symmetrical to a target) performance and pupillometry metrics. Notably, tonic and phasic pupillometry responses in oculomotor control provided a framework to determine the degree that arousal and/or executive resource recruitment influence behavior. Results demonstrated a pre- to post-exercise decrease in pro- and anti-saccade reaction times (p = 0.01) concurrent with a decrease and increase in tonic baseline pupil size and task-evoked pupil dilations, respectively (ps &amp;amp;lt; 0.03). Such results demonstrate that an exercise-induced improvement in saccade performance is related to an executive-mediated “shift” in physiological and/or psychological arousal, supported by the locus coeruleus norepinephrine system to optimize task engagement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Metal atom-guided conformational analysis of single polynuclear coordination molecules</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microscopic observation of single molecules is a rapidly expanding field in chemistry and differs from conventional characterization techniques that require a large number of molecules. One of such form of single-molecule microscopy is high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), which is especially suitable for coordination compounds because of its atomic number&ndash;dependent contrast. However, to date, single-molecule observations using HAADF-STEM has limited to simple planar molecules. In the present study, we demonstrate a direct structural investigation of nonplanar dendronized polynuclear Ir complexes with subnanometer resolution using Ir as an atomic label. Decreasing the electron dose to the dendrimer complexes is critical for the single-molecule observation. A comparison with simulated STEM images of conformational isomers is performed to determine the most plausible conformation. Our results enlarge the potential of electron microscopic observation to realize structural analysis of coordination macromolecules, which has been impossible with conventional methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Temperature sensitivity of permafrost carbon release mediated by mineral and microbial properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temperature sensitivity (<I>Q</I><SUB>10</SUB>) of permafrost carbon (C) release upon thaw is a vital parameter for projecting permafrost C dynamics under climate warming. However, it remains unclear how mineral protection interacts with microbial properties and intrinsic recalcitrance to affect permafrost C fate. Here, we sampled permafrost soils across a 1000-km transect on the Tibetan Plateau and conducted two laboratory incubations over 400- and 28-day durations to explore patterns and drivers of permafrost C release and its temperature response after thaw. We find that mineral protection and microbial properties are two types of crucial predictors of permafrost C dynamics upon thaw. Both high C release and <I>Q</I><SUB>10</SUB> are associated with weak organo-mineral associations but high microbial abundances and activities, whereas high microbial diversity corresponds to low <I>Q</I><SUB>10</SUB>. The attenuating effects of mineral protection and the dual roles of microbial properties would make the permafrost C-climate feedback more complex than previously thought.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Olfactory receptor-dependent receptor repression in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>In olfactory systems across phyla, most sensory neurons express a single olfactory receptor gene selected from a large genomic repertoire. We describe previously unknown receptor gene&ndash;dependent mechanisms that ensure singular expression of receptors encoded by a tandem gene array [<I>Ionotropic receptor 75c</I> (<I>Ir75c</I>), <I>Ir75b</I>, and <I>Ir75a</I>, organized 5' to 3'] in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. Transcription from upstream genes in the cluster runs through the coding region of downstream loci and inhibits their expression in cis, most likely via transcriptional interference. Moreover, Ir75c blocks accumulation of other receptor proteins in trans through a protein-dependent, posttranscriptional mechanism. These repression mechanisms operate in endogenous neurons, in conjunction with cell type&ndash;specific gene regulatory networks, to ensure unique receptor expression. Our data provide evidence for inter-olfactory receptor regulation in invertebrates and highlight unprecedented, but potentially widespread, mechanisms for ensuring exclusive expression of chemosensory receptors, and other protein families, encoded by tandemly arranged genes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Longitudinal tracking of neuronal mitochondria delineates PINK1/Parkin-dependent mechanisms of mitochondrial recycling and degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered mitochondrial quality control and dynamics may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, but we understand little about these processes in neurons. We combined time-lapse microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy to track individual mitochondria in neurons lacking the fission-promoting protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and delineate the kinetics of PINK1-dependent pathways of mitochondrial quality control. Depolarized mitochondria recruit Parkin to the outer mitochondrial membrane, triggering autophagosome formation, rapid lysosomal fusion, and Parkin redistribution. Unexpectedly, these mitolysosomes are dynamic and persist for hours. Some are engulfed by healthy mitochondria, and others are deacidified before bursting. In other cases, Parkin is directly recruited to the matrix of polarized mitochondria. Loss of PINK1 blocks Parkin recruitment, causes LC3 accumulation within mitochondria, and exacerbates Drp1KO toxicity to dopamine neurons. These results define a distinct neuronal mitochondrial life cycle, revealing potential mechanisms of mitochondrial recycling and signaling relevant to neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The structural basis of bacterial manganese import</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metal ions are essential for all forms of life. In prokaryotes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) permeases serve as the primary import pathway for many micronutrients including the first-row transition metal manganese. However, the structural features of ionic metal transporting ABC permeases have remained undefined. Here, we present the crystal structure of the manganese transporter PsaBC from <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> in an open-inward conformation. The type II transporter has a tightly closed transmembrane channel due to "extracellular gating" residues that prevent water permeation or ion reflux. Below these residues, the channel contains a hitherto unreported metal coordination site, which is essential for manganese translocation. Mutagenesis of the extracellular gate perturbs manganese uptake, while coordination site mutagenesis abolishes import. These structural features are highly conserved in metal-specific ABC transporters and are represented throughout the kingdoms of life. Collectively, our results define the structure of PsaBC and reveal the features required for divalent cation transport.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid generation of maternal mutants via oocyte transgenic expression of CRISPR-Cas9 and sgRNAs in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maternal products are exclusive factors to drive oogenesis and early embryonic development. As disrupting maternal gene functions is either time-consuming or technically challenging, early developmental programs regulated by maternal factors remain mostly elusive. We provide a transgenic approach to inactivate maternal genes in zebrafish primary oocytes. By introducing three tandem single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter into Tg(<I>zpc</I>:<I>zcas9</I>) embryos, we efficiently obtained maternal <I>nanog</I> and <I>ctnnb2</I> mutants among GFP-positive F<SUB>1</SUB> offspring. Notably, most of these maternal mutants displayed either sgRNA site&ndash;spanning genomic deletions or unintended large deletions extending distantly from the sgRNA targets, suggesting a prominent deletion-prone tendency of genome editing in the oocyte. Thus, our method allows maternal gene knockout in the absence of viable and fertile homozygous mutant adults. This approach is particularly time-saving and can be applied for functional screening of maternal factors and generating genomic deletions in zebrafish.</p>

                <p>Micronutrients control phytoplankton growth in the ocean, influencing carbon export and fisheries. It is currently unclear how micronutrient scarcity affects cellular processes and how interdependence across micronutrients arises. We show that proximate causes of micronutrient growth limitation and interdependence are governed by cumulative cellular costs of acquiring and using micronutrients. Using a mechanistic proteomic allocation model of a polar diatom focused on iron and manganese, we demonstrate how cellular processes fundamentally underpin micronutrient limitation, and how they interact and compensate for each other to shape cellular elemental stoichiometry and resource interdependence. We coupled our model with metaproteomic and environmental data, yielding an approach for estimating biogeochemical metrics, including taxon-specific growth rates. Our results show that cumulative cellular costs govern how environmental conditions modify phytoplankton growth.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Large slip, long duration, and moderate shaking of the Nicaragua 1992 tsunami earthquake caused by low near-trench rock rigidity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Large earthquake ruptures propagating up to areas close to subduction trenches are infrequent, but when they occur, they heavily displace the ocean seafloor originating destructive tsunamis. The current paradigm is that the large seafloor deformation is caused by local factors reducing friction and increasing megathrust fault slip, or prompting the activation of ancillary faults or energy sources. As alternative to site-specific models, it has been proposed that large shallow slip could result from depth-dependent rock rigidity variations. To confront both hypotheses, here, we map elastic rock properties across the rupture zone of the <I>M</I><SUB>S</SUB>7.0-<I>M</I><SUB>W</SUB>7.7 1992 Nicaragua tsunami earthquake to estimate a property-compatible finite fault solution. The obtained self-consistent model accounts for trenchward increasing slip, constrains stress drop, and explains key tsunami earthquake characteristics such as long duration, high-frequency depletion, and magnitude discrepancy. The confirmation that these characteristics are all intrinsic attributes of shallow rupture opens new possibilities to improve tsunami hazard assessment.</p>

                <p>The use of entangled sensors improves the precision limit from the standard quantum limit (SQL) to the Heisenberg limit. Most previous experiments beating the SQL are performed on the sensors that are well isolated under extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate a sub-SQL interferometer at ambient conditions by using a multispin system, namely, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. We achieve two-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 1.79 &plusmn; 0.06 dB beyond the SQL and three-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 2.77 &plusmn; 0.10 dB. Besides, a magnetic sensitivity of 0.87 &plusmn; 0.09 dB beyond the SQL is achieved by two-spin interference for detecting a real magnetic field. Particularly, the deterministic and joint initialization of NV negative state, NV electron spin, and two nuclear spins is realized at room temperature. The techniques used here are of fundamental importance for quantum sensing and computing, and naturally applicable to other solid-state spin systems.</p>

This study presents a stretchable anisotropic conductive film (S-ACF) that can electrically connect high-resolution stretchable circuit lines to other electrodes whether they are rigid, flexible, or stretchable. The key concepts of this study are (i) high-resolution (~50 &mu;m) but low&ndash;contact resistance (0.2 ohm in 0.25 mm<sup>2</sup>) interfacing by periodically embedding conductive microparticles in thermoplastic film, (ii) low-temperature interfacing through the formation of chemical bonds between the S-ACF and the substrates, (iii) economical interfacing by selectively patterning the S-ACF, and (iv) direct interfacing of chips by using the adhesion of the thermoplastic matrix. We integrate light-emitting diodes on the patterned S-ACF and demonstrate stable light operation at large biaxial areal stretching (<SUB>xy</SUB> = 70%).</p>

Despite early observations of a lacustrine environment, few of the subsequent deposits exhibit demonstrable lacustrine character. We suggest instead that most of the stratigraphic section explored to date can be best explained as eolian and/or volcaniclastic sediments subaerially chemically weathered by acidic precipitation in a reduced atmosphere. Most of the deposits in Gale crater seemingly did not form in an ancient lake, but the results nonetheless shed considerable light on ancient climate, environmental change, and the astrobiology of Mars. Discoveries by Curiosity provide a critical piece to Mars&rsquo; global alteration puzzle.</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for diagnostics that can be rapidly adapted and deployed in a variety of settings. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have shown worrisome effects on vaccine and treatment efficacy, but no current point-of-care (POC) testing modality allows their specific identification. We have developed miSHERLOCK, a low-cost, CRISPR-based POC diagnostic platform that takes unprocessed patient saliva; extracts, purifies, and concentrates viral RNA; performs amplification and detection reactions; and provides fluorescent visual output with only three user actions and 1 hour from sample input to answer out. miSHERLOCK achieves highly sensitive multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations associated with variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Our modular system enables easy exchange of assays to address diverse user needs and can be rapidly reconfigured to detect different viruses and variants of concern. An adjunctive smartphone application enables output quantification, automated interpretation, and the possibility of remote, distributed result reporting.</p>

                <p>Rotation-translation conversion is a popular way to achieve power transmission in machinery, but it is rarely selected by nature. One unique case is that of bacteria swimming, which is based on the collective reorganization and rotation of flagella. Here, we mimic such motion using the light-driven evolution of a self-organized periodic arch pattern. The range and direction of translation are altered by separately varying the alignment period and the stimulating photon energy. Programmable self-propelling actuators are realized via a specific molecular assembly within a photoresponsive cholesteric medium. Through rationally presetting alignments, parallel transports of microspheres in customized trajectories are demonstrated, including convergence, divergence, gathering, and orbital revolution. This work extends the understanding of the rotation-translation conversion performed in an exquisitely self-organized system and may inspire future designs for functional materials and intelligent robotics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Differential H4K16ac levels ensure a balance between quiescence and activation in hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are able to reconstitute the bone marrow while retaining their self-renewal property. Individual HSCs demonstrate heterogeneity in their repopulating capacities. Here, we found that the levels of the histone acetyltransferase MOF (males absent on the first) and its target modification histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation are heterogeneous among HSCs and influence their proliferation capacities. The increased proliferative capacities of MOF-depleted cells are linked to their expression of CD93. The CD93<sup>+</sup> HSC subpopulation simultaneously shows transcriptional features of quiescent HSCs and functional features of active HSCs. CD93<sup>+</sup> HSCs were expanded and exhibited an enhanced proliferative advantage in <I>Mof</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> animals reminiscent of a premalignant state. Accordingly, low <I>MOF</I> and high <I>CD93</I> levels correlate with poor survival and increased proliferation capacity in leukemia. Collectively, our study indicates H4K16ac as an important determinant for HSC heterogeneity, which is linked to the onset of monocytic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Nanocapsules modify membrane interaction of polymyxin B to enable safe systemic therapy of Gram-negative sepsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Systemic therapy of Gram-negative sepsis remains challenging. Polymyxin B (PMB) is well suited for sepsis therapy due to the endotoxin affinity and antibacterial activity. However, the dose-limiting toxicity has limited its systemic use in sepsis patients. For safe systemic use of PMB, we have developed a nanoparticulate system, called D-TZP, which selectively reduces the toxicity to mammalian cells but retains the therapeutic activities of PMB. D-TZP consists of an iron-complexed tannic acid nanocapsule containing a vitamin D core, coated with PMB and a chitosan derivative that controls the interaction of PMB with endotoxin, bacteria, and host cells. D-TZP attenuated the membrane toxicity associated with PMB but retained the ability of PMB to inactivate endotoxin and kill Gram-negative bacteria. Upon intravenous injection, D-TZP protected animals from pre-established endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis, showing no systemic toxicities inherent to PMB. These results support D-TZP as a safe and effective systemic intervention of sepsis.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons provide indispensable excitatory input to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which is important for the coordinated release of gonadotropins, estrous cyclicity and ovulation. However, Kiss1 neurons also send projections to many other brain regions within and outside the hypothalamus. Two different populations of Kiss1 neurons, one in the arcuate nucleus (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) and another in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and periventricular nucleus (PeN; Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>) of the hypothalamus are differentially regulated by ovarian steroids, and are believed to form direct contacts with GnRH neurons as well as other neurons. To investigate the projection fields from Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> and Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in female mice, we used anterograde projection analysis, and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) to explore their functional input to select target neurons within the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH) hypothalamus, key preautonomic nuclei. Cre-dependent viral (AAV1-DIO-ChR2 mCherry) vectors were injected into the brain to label the two Kiss1 neuronal populations. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) for mCherry and neuropeptides combined with confocal microscopy was used to determine the projection-fields of both Kiss1 neuronal groups. Whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics were used to elucidate the functional input to the PVH and DMH. Our analysis revealed many common but also several clearly separate projection fields between the two different populations of Kiss1 neurons. In addition, optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1 projections to PVH prodynorphin, Vglut2 and DMH CART-expressing neurons, revealed excitatory glutamatergic input from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and inhibitory GABAergic input from Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons. Therefore, these steroid-sensitive Kiss1 neuronal groups can differentially control the excitability of target neurons to coordinate autonomic functions with reproduction.</p>

                Background: Around 15 million babies are born prematurely in the world every year. The most common cause of neonatal death in Ethiopia is premature birth. To reduce the rate of preterm delivery by correcting modifiable or preventable causes, the availability of local data is important. Hence, this study aimed to identify the determinants of preterm birth among women who gave birth in public hospitals in central Ethiopia. Methods: An Institutional-based unmatched case-control study was conducted at public hospitals in central Ethiopia to select 170 cases and 340 controls. The collected data were entered into EPI INFO and transferred to SPSS for analysis. Tables, graphs, and proportions were used to present the results. Binary and multiple logistic regressions analysis were computed to identify determinants of preterm birth. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a p-value < 0.05 were computed to determine the presence of an association between preterm birth and independent variables. Results: A total of 166 cases and 332 controls participated in the study, giving a response rate of 97.6%. Cigarette smoking (AOR=3.77, 95% CI=1.35,10.56), alcohol consumption (AOR=1.85, 95% CI=1.11,3.10), wanted but unplanned pregnancy (AOR=3,95% CI=1.68,5.34), neither wanted nor planned pregnancy(AOR=3.61% CI=1.62,8.06), lack of antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR=4.13, 95% CI=1.95, 8.74), adverse birth outcomes (AOR=5.66, 95% CI=2.88,11.12), presence of a diagnosed illness (AOR=2.81, 95% CI=1.37, 5.76), presence of one or more of obstetrics complications(AOR=6.44, 95% CI=5.49, 3.35, 9), and hemoglobin level < 11g/dl  (AOR=2.78, 95% CI=1.48, 5.22) were determinants of preterm birth. Conclusion:-In this study, cigarette smoking status, alcohol drinking status, pregnancy status, adverse birth outcomes, ANC visits, obstetric complications,  presence of medical illness, and anemia were identified as determinants of preterm birth. It is important to encourage such women to attend ANC visits, stop smoking, and abstain from alcohol.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal closed-loop deep brain stimulation using multiple independently controlled contacts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gihan Weerasinghe, Benoit Duchet, Christian Bick, Rafal Bogacz</p>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment option for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. The symptoms of these disorders are known to be associated with pathological synchronous neural activity in the basal ganglia and thalamus. It is hypothesised that DBS acts to desynchronise this activity, leading to an overall reduction in symptoms. Electrodes with multiple independently controllable contacts are a recent development in DBS technology which have the potential to target one or more pathological regions with greater precision, reducing side effects and potentially increasing both the efficacy and efficiency of the treatment. The increased complexity of these systems, however, motivates the need to understand the effects of DBS when applied to multiple regions or neural populations within the brain. On the basis of a theoretical model, our paper addresses the question of how to best apply DBS to multiple neural populations to maximally desynchronise brain activity. Central to this are analytical expressions, which we derive, that predict how the symptom severity should change when stimulation is applied. Using these expressions, we construct a closed-loop DBS strategy describing how stimulation should be delivered to individual contacts using the phases and amplitudes of feedback signals. We simulate our method and compare it against two others found in the literature: coordinated reset and phase-locked stimulation. We also investigate the conditions for which our strategy is expected to yield the most benefit.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SiGMoiD: A super-statistical generative model for binary data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiaochuan Zhao, Germán Plata, Purushottam D. Dixit</p>

In modern computational biology, there is great interest in building probabilistic models to describe collections of a large number of co-varying binary variables. However, current approaches to build generative models rely on modelers’ identification of constraints and are computationally expensive to infer when the number of variables is large (<i>N</i>~100). Here, we address both these issues with Super-statistical Generative Model for binary Data (SiGMoiD). SiGMoiD is a maximum entropy-based framework where we imagine the data as arising from super-statistical system; individual binary variables in a given sample are coupled to the same ‘bath’ whose intensive variables vary from sample to sample. Importantly, unlike standard maximum entropy approaches where modeler specifies the constraints, the SiGMoiD algorithm infers them directly from the data. Due to this optimal choice of constraints, SiGMoiD allows to model collections of a very large number (<i>N</i>>1000) of binary variables. Finally, SiGMoiD offers a reduced dimensional description of the data, allowing us to identify clusters of similar data points as well as binary variables. We illustrate the versatility of SiGMoiD using several datasets spanning several time- and length-scales.

Phylogenomic analyses of hundreds of protein-coding genes aimed at resolving phylogenetic relationships is now a common practice. However, no software currently exists that includes tools for dataset construction and subsequent analysis with diverse validation strategies to assess robustness. Furthermore, there are no publicly available high-quality curated databases designed to assess deep (>100 million years) relationships in the tree of eukaryotes. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use software package, PhyloFisher (https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher), written in Python 3. PhyloFisher includes a manually curated database of 240 protein-coding genes from 304 eukaryotic taxa covering known eukaryotic diversity, a novel tool for ortholog selection, and utilities that will perform diverse analyses required by state-of-the-art phylogenomic investigations. Through phylogenetic reconstructions of the tree of eukaryotes and of the Saccharomycetaceae clade of budding yeasts, we demonstrate the utility of the PhyloFisher workflow and the provided starting database to address phylogenetic questions across a large range of evolutionary time points for diverse groups of organisms. We also demonstrate that undetected paralogy can remain in phylogenomic “single-copy orthogroup” datasets constructed using widely accepted methods such as all vs. all BLAST searches followed by Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) clustering and application of automated tree pruning algorithms. Finally, we show how the PhyloFisher workflow helps detect inadvertent paralog inclusions, allowing the user to make more informed decisions regarding orthology assignments, leading to a more accurate final dataset.

The objective of this study was to determine the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-A), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes on the susceptibility to herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). Methods: Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science) were searched as of April 1 st, 2021. Authors, publication year, targeted genes, genotype and allele frequency in each case and control groups were collected. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the publication quality. The pooled estimates of association of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A -238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) and susceptibility to HNP were assessed using Z test. Results: We screened 3,067 unique studies for eligibility and three, two and nine case-control studies on IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI were included, respectively, in our meta-analysis. The studies consisting 369 HNP cases and 433 controls for IL-1A -889C>T, 252 cases and 259 controls for TNF-A -238G>A and 1130 cases and 2096 controls for VDR TaqI. Our pooled estimates indicated that there was no significant association of those SNPs with the susceptibility to HNP in any genotype, dominant model, recessive model, or allele comparations. Conclusion: Although individual studies suggested the important role of gene expression dysregulation associated with SNPs in IL-1A, TNF-A, and VDR, our data indicated that IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI had weak association with HNP susceptibility in both genotypes and allele distributions. However, since heterogeneity was identified among studies included in this meta-analysis, further meta-analysis with a larger population and subgroup analysis on specific population are warranted to support this finding.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Metabolite Signature of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the Alzheimer's disease metabolite signature through magnetic resonance spectroscopy in adults with Down syndrome and its relation with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cortical thickness.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 118 adults with Down syndrome from the Down Alzheimer Barcelona Imaging Initiative and 71 euploid healthy controls from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration cohort. We measured the levels of myo-inositol (a marker of neuroinflammation) and N-acetyl-aspartate (a marker of neuronal integrity) in the precuneus using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We investigated the changes with age and along the disease continuum (asymptomatic, prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease dementia stages). We assessed the relationship between these metabolites and Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio, phosphorylated tau-181, neurofilament light (NfL), and YKL-40 cerebrospinal fluid levels as well as amyloid positron emission tomography uptake using Spearman correlations controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, we computed the relationship between cortical thickness and metabolite levels using Freesurfer.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asymptomatic adults with Down syndrome had a 27.5% increase in the levels of myo-inositol, but equal levels of N-acetyl-aspartate compared to euploid healthy controls. With disease progression, myo-inositol levels increased, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate levels decreased in symptomatic stages of the disease. Myo-inositol was associated with amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers, mainly at symptomatic stages of the disease, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate was related to neurodegeneration biomarkers in symptomatic stages. Both metabolites were significantly associated with cortical thinning, mainly in symptomatic participants.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy detects Alzheimer's disease related inflammation and neurodegeneration, and could be a good noninvasive disease-stage biomarker in Down syndrome. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal Changes in Hippocampal Network Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is connected to 2 distinct cortical brain networks, the posterior–medial and the anterior–temporal networks, involving different medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. The aim of this study was to assess the functional alterations of these 2 networks, their changes over time, and links to cognition in Alzheimer's disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed MTL connectivity in 53 amyloid-β–positive patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia and 68 healthy elderly controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. First, we compared the functional connectivity of the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks within the control group to highlight their specificities. Second, we compared the connectivity of these networks between groups, and between baseline and 18-month follow-up in patients. Third, we assessed the association in the connectivity changes between the 2 networks, and with cognitive performance.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found decreased connectivity in patients specifically between the hippocampus and the posterior–medial network, together with increased connectivity between several MTL subregions and the anterior–temporal network. Moreover, changes in the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks were interrelated such that decreased MTL–posterior–medial connectivity was associated with increased MTL–anterior–temporal connectivity. Finally, both MTL–posterior–medial decrease and MTL–anterior–temporal increase predicted cognitive decline.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that longitudinal connectivity changes in the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal hippocampal networks are linked together and that they both contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. These results shed light on the critical role of the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and clinical symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Background: Most natural plants used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are limited to marine plants. To carry out applications, colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNps) should have appropriate properties such as homogeneous shapes, small and narrow particle size distribution, and long time stability. This study aims to determine the effects of a variable process of AgNps mediated mangrove Rhizophora stylosa (RS) leaf extract, and antibacterial activity.  Methods: Synthesis of AgNps was carried out by stirring silver nitrate solution with aqueous extract. The characterization of AgNps was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) zetasizer and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Evaluation of antibacterial activity was carried out on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Reaction conditions such as the concentration of metal ions (0.001 M, 0.005 M, and 0.01 M), extracts (1%, 3%, and 5% v/v), and the reaction time on the size and stability of nanoparticles were also explored. Results: The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption of colloidal AgNps in a wavelength range of 403–443 nm.  TEM analysis showed that as-synthesized AgNps were spherical in shape with a size range of 5–87 nm. The use of 0.001 M and 0.005 M of Ag+ resulted in a smaller diameter than the synthesized AgNps, using 0.01 M Ag+, in the same extract concentration. The range of zeta potential was -24.9 mV to -27.7 mV. The as-synthesized AgNps were stable for more than one month. The XRD analysis showed four peaks, which were attributed to the face centered cubic crystal structure of metallic silver. The results of the silver nanoparticles synthesis showed good activity on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with an inhibition zone between 4.1–7.2 mm. Conclusions: The AgNps synthesized with RS leaf extract, which is a reducing agent, showed good potential as an antibacterial component.

                Background: The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer conclusions from otherwise limited analyses. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses. Methods: We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm. Results: Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions. Conclusions: We postulate that the ”more is better” approach, currently prevalent in the scientific community, might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long computational processing times inherent to large datasets.

                Background: This study investigated how the inclusion of Boesenbergia pandurata extract (BPE) in goldfish feed affects fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens.   Methods: Four fish feeds, were prepared by adding BPE at the concentrations of 0 (control), 2, 4, and 6 g kg-1, respectively, and 120 goldfish (Cyprinus carpio; initial weight 5 g) were separated into 12 boxes and fed with specific pellets and examined thrice. The experiment lasted 12 weeks, beginning with the different feeds, fish growth was measured at Weeks 4 and 8 after the feeding period. Moreover, a challenge test with pathogen bacteria to assay disease resistance was administered at Week 8 after the feeding period, and the survival rate and relative percentage of survival were quantified at Week 12.   Results: At Week 8, the goldfish that were fed BPE-containing feeds were significantly heavier than the fish that received the control feed (pellet without BPE), and the highest weight gain, reaching 72.44 g, was obtained with Pellet 3; accordingly, the specific growth rate after BPE treatment (5.7%) was higher than that after control treatment. Conversely, the feed conversion ratio in the control group, 2.03, was higher than the ratios in the BPE groups, which were decreased to 0.55–0.90. Lastly, BPE treatment consistently enhanced the immunity parameters of goldfish (relative to control treatment) at weeks 4 and 8, and following BPE treatment, the rate of resistance against bacterial infection, 68.3%–77.0%, was higher than that after control treatment.   Conclusions: BPE addition in goldfish feed clearly produces a positive effect by enhancing fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by pathogenic bacteria, and 4 g kg-1 is the optimal BPE concentration in feed prepared for goldfish.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis: to investigate the association of adherence to plant-based diets with cardiovascular disease risk [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are characterised as healthy dietary patterns that emphasise the intake of plant foods and limit the intake of animal foods. The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are common examples of healthy dietary patterns that are mainly plant based. There are different dietary pattern analysis approaches and scoring systems available to construct indices that measure adherence to a dietary pattern. Nutritional epidemiology studies necessitate the use of appropriate dietary indices when investigating diet-disease associations. Methods: This systematic review protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. PubMed–Medline, Scopus and relevant biomedical databases within EBSCOhost will be searched up to August 2021 using relevant key words. Two reviewers will independently screen the identified records and review the eligible full texts for inclusion. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or through discussion with a third reviewer. Appropriate meta-analysis will be performed where possible and consistency of the findings checked through subgroup analysis. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed and quantified, and publication bias investigated. Relevant sensitivity analyses will be performed to substantiate the robustness of the study findings. Conclusion: Currently, there is some inconsistency in defining and measuring adherence to a PBD across study populations. In addition to this, a lack of global data on the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. This systematic review could aid in promoting the worldwide uptake of these findings for policy and practice purposes. This research will use previously published studies; and therefore, will not require ethical approval.

<p>Binge ethanol activates astrocytes resulting in an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (red) in the basolateral amygdala. When astrocytic receptor signaling was activated using GFAP-Gq-GPCR designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, it decreased ethanol consumption and ameliorated alcohol-induced depression of glutamate in the amygdala.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Binge drinking is a common occurrence in the United States, but a high concentration of alcohol in the blood has been shown to have reinforcing and reciprocal effects on the neuroimmune system in both dependent and non-dependent scenarios. The first part of this study examined alcohol's effects on the astrocytic response in the central amygdala and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in a non-dependent model. C57BL/6J mice were given access to either ethanol, water, or sucrose during a “drinking in the dark” paradigm, and astrocyte number and astrogliosis were measured using immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that non-dependent consumption increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) density but not the number of GFAP+ cells, suggesting that non-dependent ethanol is sufficient to elicit astrocyte activation. The second part of this study examined how astrocytes impacted behaviors and the neurochemistry related to alcohol using the chemogenetic tool, DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Transgenic GFAP-hM3Dq mice were administered clozapine N-oxide both peripherally, affecting the entire central nervous system (CNS), or directly into the BLA. In both instances, GFAP-Gq-signaling activation significantly reduced ethanol consumption and correlating blood ethanol concentrations. However, GFAP-Gq-DREADD activation throughout the CNS had more broad effects resulting in decreased locomotor activity and sucrose consumption. More targeted GFAP-Gq-signaling activation in the BLA only impacted ethanol consumption. Finally, a glutamate assay revealed that after GFAP-Gq-signaling activation glutamate concentrations in the amygdala were partially normalized to control levels. Altogether, these studies support the theory that astrocytes represent a viable target for alcohol use disorder therapies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent alcohol drinking is widely recognized as a significant public health problem, and evidence is accumulating that sufficient levels of consumption during this critical period of brain development have an enduring impact on neural and behavioral function. Recent studies have indicated that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure alters astrocyte function, astrocyte–neuronal interactions, and related synaptic regulation and activity. However, few of those studies have included female animals, and a broader assessment of AIE effects on the proteins mediating astrocyte-mediated glutamate dynamics and synaptic function is needed. We measured synaptic membrane expression of several such proteins in the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampal formation (DH, VH) from male and female rats exposed to AIE or adolescent intermittent water. In the DH, AIE caused elevated expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) in both males and females, elevated postsynaptic density 95 expression in females only, and diminished NMDA receptor subunit 2A expression in males only. AIE and sex interactively altered ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) expression in the DH. In the VH, AIE elevated expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter and the glutamate aspartate transporter 1 (GLAST) in males only. Compared to males, female animals expressed lower levels of GLT-1 in the DH and greater levels of ephrin receptor B6 (EphB6) in the VH, in the absence of AIE effects. These results support the growing literature indicating that adolescent alcohol exposure produces long-lasting effects on astrocyte function and astrocyte-neuronal interactions. The sex and subregion specificity of these effects have mechanistic implications for our understanding of AIE effects generally.</p>

     alt="Ethanol modulation of cerebellar neuroinflammation in a postnatal mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders"/>
<p>Postnatal exposure to ethanol resulted in pro-inflammatory molecule expression in mouse cerebellum that persisted for several days suggesting that anti-inflammatory agents may be effective in treating infants with FASD. Cerebellar microglial ramification and novel immune molecules were differentially regulated by ethanol. We demonstrate novel mechanisms for ethanol modulation of neuroinflammation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are alarmingly common, result in significant personal and societal loss, and there is no effective treatment for these disorders. Cerebellar neuropathology is common in FASD and causes aberrant cognitive and motor function. Ethanol-induced neuroinflammation is believed to contribute to neuropathological sequelae of FASD, and was previously demonstrated in the cerebellum in animal models of FASD. We now demonstrate neuroinflammation persists in the cerebellum several days following cessation of ethanol treatment in an early postnatal mouse model, with meaningful implications for timing of therapeutic intervention in FASD. We also demonstrate by Sholl analysis that ethanol decreases ramification of microglia cell processes in cells located near the Purkinje cell layer but not those near the external granule cell layer. Ethanol did not alter the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules or molecules that constitute NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Interestingly, ethanol decreased the expression of IL-23a (P19) and IL-12Rβ1 suggesting that ethanol may suppress IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. Fractalkine-fractalkine receptor (CX3CL1-CX3CR1) signaling is believed to suppress microglial activation and our demonstration that ethanol decreases CX3CL1 expression suggests that ethanol modulation of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling may contribute to cerebellar neuroinflammation and neuropathology. We demonstrate ethanol alters the expression of specific molecules in the cerebellum understudied in FASD, but crucial for immune responses. Ethanol increases the expression of NOX-2 and NGP and decreases the expression of RAG1, NOS1, CD59a, S1PR5, PTPN22, GPR37, and Serpinb1b. These molecules represent a new horizon as potential targets for development of FASD therapy.</p>

     alt="Extracellular microvesicles promote microglia-mediated pro-inflammatory responses to ethanol"/>
<p>Ethanol causes the secretion of pro-inflammatory microvesicles (MVs) from brain tissue. Ethanol-induced MVs reproduce the pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation seen with ethanol alone, and inhibition of their secretion blocks ethanol-induced neuroinflammation. Microglia are required for the generation of pro-inflammatory MVs, with MV secretion involving activation of microglial PI3K.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pathology features pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation. The underlying cellular processes that promote this activation remain unclear. Previously considered cellular debris, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as mediators of inflammatory signaling in several disease states. We investigated the role of microvesicles (MVs, 50 nm–100 µm diameter EVs) in pro-inflammatory and microglial functional gene expression using primary organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC). Ethanol caused a unique immune gene signature that featured: temporal induction of pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β, reduction of homeostatic microglia state gene Tmem119, progressive increases in purinergic receptor P2RY12 and the microglial inhibitory fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, an increase in the microglial presynaptic gene C1q, and a reduction in the phagocytic gene TREM2. MV signaling was implicated in this response as reduction of MV secretion by imipramine blocked pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β induction by ethanol, and ethanol-conditioned MVs (EtOH-MVs) reproduced the ethanol-associated immune gene signature in naïve OBSC slices. Depletion of microglia prior to ethanol treatment prevented pro-inflammatory activity of EtOH-MVs, as did incubation of EtOH-MVs with the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin. Ethanol caused HMGB1 secretion from cultured BV2 microglia in MVs through activation of PI3 kinase. In summary, these studies find MVs modulate pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation changes associated with ethanol. Thus, MVs may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce neuroinflammation in the setting of alcohol abuse or other diseases that feature a neuroimmune component.

<p>After a single, binge-level exposure to ethanol in development, we found subtle effects on glia in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol treatment reduced colocalization between two astrocytic markers, GFAP and Aldh1L1; induced region-specific changes in microglia volume, process morphology, and density; and had no effect on glial interactions.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of nonheritable, preventable mental disability and are characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. FASD occurs in almost 5% of births in the United States, but despite this prevalence there is no known cure, largely because the biological mechanisms that translate alcohol exposure to neuropathology are not well understood. While the effects of early ethanol exposure on neuronal survival and circuitry have received more attention, glia, the cells most closely tied to initiating and propagating inflammatory events, could be an important target for alcohol in the developing brain. Inflammation is known to alter developmental trajectories, but it has recently been shown that even small changes in both astrocytes and microglia in the absence of full-blown inflammatory signaling can alter brain function long-term. Here, we studied the acute response of astrocytes and microglia to a single exposure to ethanol in development across sexes in a mouse model of human third trimester exposure, in order to understand how these cells may transition from their normal developmental path to a different program that leads to FASD neuropathology. We found that although a single ethanol exposure delivered subcutaneously on postnatal day 4 did not cause large changes in microglial morphology or the expression of AldH1L1 and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus, subtle effects were observed. These findings suggest that even a single, early ethanol exposure can induce mild acute alterations in glia that could contribute to developmental deficits.</p>

<p>Microglia structural reorganization, and altered neuroimmune signaling, are implicated in pathological adaptations that promote excessive drinking. Here we used Iba1 immunohistochemistry, high-resolution confocal microscopy, and digital reconstruction analyses of Iba1-positive microglia in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats during withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and an ethanol-naïve (air)-exposed group. We found that CIE and LPS led to dichotomous alterations in microglia structural complexity in the PL cortex that were largely absent in the NAc. These findings add to a growing body of literature pointing towards altered microglia structural complexity, and presumably function, in ethanol-induced adaptations in the brain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence has linked pathological changes associated with chronic alcohol exposure to neuroimmune signaling mediated by microglia. Prior characterization of the microglial structure–function relationship demonstrates that alterations in activity states occur concomitantly with reorganization of cellular architecture. Accordingly, gaining a better understanding of microglial morphological changes associated with ethanol exposure will provide valuable insight into how neuroimmune signaling may contribute to ethanol-induced reshaping of neuronal function. Here we have used Iba1-staining combined with high-resolution confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to examine microglial structure in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male Long-Evans rats. Rats were either sacrificed at peak withdrawal following 15 days of exposure to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) or 24 hr after two consecutive injections of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS), each separated by 24 hr. LPS exposure resulted in dramatic structural reorganization of microglia in the PL cortex, including increased soma volume, overall cellular volume, and branching complexity. In comparison, CIE exposure was associated with a subtle increase in somatic volume and differential effects on microglia processes, which were largely absent in the NAc. These data reveal that microglial activation following a neuroimmune challenge with LPS or exposure to chronic alcohol exhibits distinct morphometric profiles and brain region-dependent specificity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuroinflammatory contribution of microglia and astrocytes in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ethanol exposure to the fetus during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These disorders vary in severity, can affect multiple organ systems, and can lead to lifelong disabilities. Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is common in FASD, and can result in altered behavior and cognition. The incidence of FASD is alarmingly high, resulting in significant personal and societal costs. There are no cures for FASD. Alcohol can directly alter the function of neurons in the developing CNS. In addition, ethanol can alter the function of CNS glial cells including microglia and astrocytes which normally maintain homeostasis in the CNS. These glial cells can function as resident immune cells in the CNS to protect against pathogens and other insults. However, activation of glia can also damage CNS cells and lead to aberrant CNS function. Ethanol exposure to the developing brain can result in the activation of glia and neuroinflammation, which may contribute to the pathology associated with FASD. This suggests that anti-inflammatory agents may be effective in the treatment of FASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The NaVy paradox: reducing sodium currents increases excitability</a></h4>

              
                Mutations that increase sodium currents in excitatory neurons typically produce hyperexcitability and epileptic seizures. Paradoxically, mutations that reduce NaV1.2 sodium currents also have a similar effect. Two research groups (Spratt et al. and Zhang et al.) have now found that in some excitatory neurons, loss of NaV1.2 increases intrinsic excitability by altering activation and/or expression of potassium channels.

                Lockdowns and school closures deprive adolescents of typical social interactions. In this NeuroView, we explore how the quality of existing peer relationships might moderate—both positively and negatively—the impact of these restrictions on adolescent mental health, and we highlight the importance of individual differences.

                Low et al. record from hundreds of neurons in the entorhinal cortex and reveal transitions between distinct neural maps of space in an unchanging task and environment. These transitions are reversible, synchronized across neurons, and correlated with running speed. Alignment of the two activity manifolds enables reliable position decoding across maps.

                Choi et al. show spine morphology dynamics of the AC-LA circuit during fear conditioning, extinction, and re-conditioning. Using input-specific and activity-dependent spine labeling, they demonstrate that activated spines are enhanced by fear conditioning and subsequently decreased by extinction, which is restored by re-conditioning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glypicans define unique roles for the Hedgehog co-receptors Boi and Ihog in cytoneme-mediated gradient formation</a></h4>

              
                The conserved family of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins plays a key role in cell-cell communication during development, tissue repair and cancer progression, inducing distinct concentration-dependent responses in target cells located at short and long distances. One simple mechanism for long distance dispersal of the lipid modified Hh is the direct contact between cell membranes through filopodia-like structures known as cytonemes. Here we have analyzed in <i>Drosophila</i> the interaction between the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein, necessary for Hh signaling, and the adhesion molecules and Hh coreceptors Ihog and Boi. We describe that glypicans are required to maintain the levels of Ihog, but not of Boi. We also show that the overexpression of Ihog, but not of Boi, regulates cytoneme dynamics through their interaction with glypicans, the Ihog fibronectin III domains being essential for this interaction. Our data suggest that the regulation of glypicans over Hh signaling is specifically given by their interaction with Ihog in cytonemes. Contrary to previous data, we also show that there is no redundancy of Ihog and Boi functions in Hh gradient formation, being Ihog, but not of Boi, essential for the long-range gradient.

                Voltage-dependent proton-permeable channels are membrane proteins mediating a number of important physiological functions. Here we report the presence of a gene encoding H<sub>v</sub>1 voltage-dependent, proton-permeable channels in two species of reef-building corals. We performed a characterization of their biophysical properties and found that these channels are fast-activating and modulated by the pH gradient in a distinct manner. The biophysical properties of these novel channels make them interesting model systems. We have also developed an allosteric gating model that provides mechanistic insight into the modulation of voltage-dependence by protons. This work also represents the first functional characterization of any ion channel in scleractinian corals. We discuss the implications of the presence of these channels in the membranes of coral cells in the calcification and pH-regulation processes and possible consequences of ocean acidification related to the function of these channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Naa12 compensates for Naa10 in mice in the amino-terminal acetylation pathway</a></h4>

              
                Amino-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by a set of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). The NatA complex (including X-linked Naa10 and Naa15) is the major acetyltransferase, with 40-50% of all mammalian proteins being potential substrates. However, the overall role of amino-terminal acetylation on a whole-organism level is poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Male mice lacking <i>Naa10</i> show no globally apparent <i>in vivo</i> amino-terminal acetylation impairment and do not exhibit complete embryonic lethality. Rather <i>Naa10</i> nulls display increased neonatal lethality, and the majority of surviving undersized mutants exhibit a combination of hydrocephaly, cardiac defects, homeotic anterior transformation, piebaldism and urogenital anomalies. <i>Naa12</i> is a previously unannotated <i>Naa10</i>-like paralogue with NAT activity that genetically compensates for <i>Naa10</i>. Mice deficient for<i> Naa12</i> have no apparent phenotype, whereas mice deficient for <i>Naa10</i> and <i>Naa12 </i>display embryonic lethality. The discovery of <i>Naa12</i> adds to the currently known machinery involved in amino-terminal acetylation in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The need for practical insecticide-resistance guidelines to effectively inform mosquito-borne disease control programs</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring local mosquito populations for insecticide resistance is critical for effective vector-borne disease control. However, widely used phenotypic assays, which are designed to monitor the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance (technical resistance), do not translate well to the efficacy of vector control products to suppress mosquito numbers in the field (practical resistance). This is because standard testing conditions such as environmental conditions, exposure dose, and type of substrate differ dramatically from those experienced by mosquitoes under field conditions. In addition, field mosquitoes have considerably different physiological characteristics such as age and blood-feeding status. Beyond this, indirect impacts of insecticide resistance and/or exposure on mosquito longevity, pathogen development, host-seeking behavior, and blood-feeding success impact disease transmission. Given the limited number of active ingredients currently available and the observed discordance between resistance and disease transmission, we conclude that additional testing guidelines are needed to determine practical resistance—the efficacy of vector control tools under relevant local conditions— in order to obtain programmatic impact.

                Inactivating mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT). Despite extensive research into MECP2 function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here, we used an evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, using 1028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA-approved drugs led to three promising targets, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). The drugs targeting these three proteins (Pacritinib, DMF, and EPO) were able to rescue different phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and appeared to converge on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of RTT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-linear dimensionality reduction on extracellular waveforms reveals cell type diversity in premotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits are thought to contain a large number of cell types that coordinate to produce behavior. Current in vivo methods rely on clustering of specified features of extracellular waveforms to identify putative cell types, but these capture only a small amount of variation. Here, we develop a new method (WaveMAP) that combines non-linear dimensionality reduction with graph clustering to identify putative cell types. We apply WaveMAP to extracellular waveforms recorded from dorsal premotor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a decision-making task. Using WaveMAP, we robustly establish eight waveform clusters and show that these clusters recapitulate previously identified narrow- and broad-spiking types while revealing previously unknown diversity within these subtypes. The eight clusters exhibited distinct laminar distributions, characteristic firing rate patterns, and decision-related dynamics. Such insights were weaker when using featurebased approaches. WaveMAP therefore provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of cell types in cortical circuits.

                African trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. These unicellular parasites are transmitted by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. In the mammalian host's circulation, proliferating slender stage cells differentiate into cell cycle-arrested stumpy stage cells when they reach high population densities. This stage transition is thought to fulfil two main functions: first, it auto-regulates the parasite load in the host; second, the stumpy stage is regarded as the only stage capable of successful vector transmission. Here, we show that proliferating slender stage trypanosomes express the mRNA and protein of a known stumpy stage marker, complete the complex life cycle in the fly as successfully as the stumpy stage, and require only a single parasite for productive infection. These findings suggest a reassessment of the traditional view of the trypanosome life cycle. They may also provide a solution to a long-lasting paradox, namely the successful transmission of parasites in chronic infections, despite low parasitemia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixed matrix factorization: a novel algorithm for the extraction of kinematic-muscular synergies</a></h4>

              
                Synergistic models have been employed to investigate motor coordination separately in the muscular and kinematic domains. However, the relationship between muscle synergies, constrained to be non-negative, and kinematic synergies, whose elements can be positive and negative, has received limited attention. Existing algorithms for extracting synergies from combined kinematic and muscular data either do not enforce non-negativity constraints or separate non-negative variables into positive and negative components. We propose a mixed matrix factorization (MMF) algorithm based on a gradient descent update rule which overcomes these limitations. It directly assesses the relationship between kinematic and muscle activity variables, by enforcing the non-negativity constrain on a subset of variables. We validated the algorithm on simulated kinematic-muscular data generated from known spatial synergies and temporal coefficients, by assessing the similarity between extracted and ground truth synergies and temporal coefficients when the data are corrupted by different noise levels. We also compared the performance of MMF to that of non-negative matrix factorization applied to separate positive and negative components (NMFpn). Finally, we factorized kinematic and EMG data collected during upper-limb movements to demonstrate the potential of the algorithm. MMF achieved almost perfect reconstruction on noiseless simulated data. It performed better than NMFpn in recovering the correct spatial synergies and temporal coefficients with noisy simulated data. It allowed to correctly select the original number of ground truth synergies. We showed meaningful applicability to real data. MMF can also be applied to any multivariate data that contains both non-negative and unconstrained variables.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precision dynamical mapping using topological data analysis reveals a unique hub-like transition state at rest</a></h4>

              
                Even in the absence of external stimuli, neural activity is both highly dynamic and organized across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The continuous evolution of brain activity patterns during rest is believed to help maintain a rich repertoire of possible functional configurations that relate to typical and atypical cognitive phenomena. Whether these transitions or "explorations" follow some underlying arrangement or instead lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using a precision dynamics approach, we aimed at revealing the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest at the single participant level. We hypothesized that by revealing and characterizing the overall landscape of whole brain configurations (or states) we could interpret the rules (if any) that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. To generate the landscape of whole-brain configurations we used Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach. Across all participants, we consistently observed a rich topographic landscape in which the transition of activity from one state to the next involved a central hub-like "transition state." The hub topography was characterized as a shared attractor-like basin where all canonical resting-state networks were represented equally. The surrounding periphery of the landscape had distinct network configurations. The intermediate transition state and traversal through it via a topographic gradient seemed to provide the underlying structure for the continuous evolution of brain activity patterns at rest. In addition, differences in the landscape architecture were more consistent within than between subjects, providing evidence of idiosyncratic dynamics and potential utility in precision medicine.

                Electric phenomena in brain tissue can be measured using extracellular potentials, such as the local field potential, or the electro-encephalogram. The interpretation of these signals depend on the electric structure and properties of extracellular media, but the measurements of these electric properties are subject to controversy. Some measurements point to a model where the extracellular medium is purely resistive, and thus parameters such as electric conductivity and permittivity should be independent of frequency. Other measurements point to a pronounced frequency dependence of these parameters, with scaling laws that are consistent with capacitive or diffusive effects. However, these experiments correspond to different preparations, and it is unclear how to correctly compare them. Here, we provide for the first time, impedance measurements in various preparations, for acute brain slices and primary cell cultures, and we compare to measurements using the same setup in artificial cerebrospinal fluid with no biological material. The measurements show that when the current flows across a cell membrane, the frequency dependence of the macroscopic impedance between intracellular and extracellular electrodes is significant, and cannot be captured by a model with resistive media. Fitting a mean-field model to the data shows that this frequency dependence could be explained by the ionic diffusion mainly associated to Debye layers surrounding the membranes. We conclude that neuronal membranes and their ionic environment induce strong deviations to resistivity, that should be taken into account to correctly interpret extracellular potentials generated by neurons.

                Reconstruction of serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) data greatly facilitates neuroscience research, but such reconstruction is computationally expensive. Informative data about physiological functions can in theory be obtained from ssEM datasets by extracting distinct cellular structures without large-scale reconstruction, but an efficient method is needed to accomplish this. Here, we developed a Region-CNN (R-CNN) based deep learning method to identify, segment, and reconstruct synapses and mitochondria from ssEM data. We applied this method to explore the changes in synaptic and mitochondrial configuration in the auditory cortex of mice subjected to auditory fear conditioning. Upon reconstructing over 135,000 mitochondria and 160,000 synapses, we found that fear conditioning significantly increases the number while decreasing the size of mitochondria, and also noted that it promoted the formation of multi-contact synapses comprising a single axonal bouton and multiple postsynaptic sites from different dendrites. Combinatorial modeling indicated that such multi-dendritic synapses increased information storage capacity of new synapses by over 50%, representing a synaptic memory engram. Our method achieved high accuracy and speed in synapse and mitochondrion extraction, and its application revealed structural and functional insights about cellular engrams associated with fear conditioning.

                Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a feature of critical cerebral disorders. Obesity has been linked to raised ICP, and especially to disorders such as idiopathic intracranial pressure (IIH). We aimed to explore the impact of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on ICP, cephalic sensitivity and structural retinal changes with the dual goal of developing a disease model for non-traumatic raised ICP and IIH. Rats were fed high-fat diet or matched control diet. To assess pain sensitivity, Von Frey and light/dark box testing were performed. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning was used to measure body composition. Optic nerve head and retinal structures were evaluated using optical coherence tomography. Intraocular pressure was assessed. Rats were then implanted with telemetric device for continuous ICP recording. At the end, eye histology and molecular analysis on choroid plexus (CP) and trigeminal ganglion (TG) were performed. The DIO rats had double the abdominal fat mass. ICP was 55% higher in obese rats (p=0.003). Altered pain thresholds were found in DIO rats as denoted by a lower periorbital threshold (p=0.0002). Expression of Calca and Trpv1 was elevated in TG. Furthermore, a peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer swelling (p=0.0026) with subsequent neuroretinal degeneration p=0.02) was detected in DIO rats. There was a trend to increased expression of AQP1 and NKCC1 at CP. This study demonstrates for the first time that DIO leads to raised ICP, with clinically relevant sequalae. Our novel model for non-traumatic raised ICP could expand the knowledge regarding disorders with elevated ICP and IIH.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired dynamics of brain precapillary sphincters and first order capillaries explains reduced neurovascular functions in aging</a></h4>

              
                The microvascular inflow tract (MIT), i.e. penetrating arterioles, precapillary sphincters and first order capillaries, is the bottleneck for brain blood flow and energy supply. However, the exact structural and functional alterations during aging remain elusive. Using in vivo 4-dimensional (xyzt) two-photon imaging, we showed an age-dependent decrease in vaso-responsivity, which was accompanied by reduced sensitivity of MIT to pinacidil and papaverine, and to vasoconstrictors endothelin-1 and to L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Reduced responsivity was accompanied by an age-dependent decrease in capillary density close to the arterioles and by loss of pericyte processes, whereas the number of pericyte somas and the pericyte SMA density were preserved. The age-related reduction in vascular reactivity was most pronounced at precapillary sphincters, highlighting its crucial role for capillary blood flow regulation. Mathematical modeling further revealed dysregulated but protected pressure and flow in aged mice towards vasoconstriction. Prevention of reduced responsivity of the MIT may ameliorate the blood flow decrease associated with brain aging and age-related brain frailty.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic and membrane conductance underlie phase transition in a simple half-center oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmically active neural circuits often contain reciprocally inhibitory modules that act as half-center oscillators. In half-center oscillators, alternating burst discharges require a mechanism to transition activity from one phase to the next, which requires particular synaptic and membrane properties. Here we found that active membrane properties of specific neurons and the temporal dynamics of particular synapses both contribute to the production of a stable rhythmic motor pattern in the swim central pattern generator (CPG) of the nudibranch mollusc, Dendronotus iris. This CPG is composed of only four neurons that are organized into two competing modules of a half-center oscillator. Each module is composed of a Swim Interneuron 2 (Si2) and the contralateral Swim Interneuron 3 (Si3). Si2 and Si3 each inhibit their own contralateral counterparts; however, the S2 contralateral synapses have a more negative reversal potential, making them more effective at hyperpolarizing the Si2 and the electrically coupled Si3 of the other module. Si3 rebounds first from inhibition due to a hyperpolarization-activated slow inward current. Si3 excites the Si2 in its module through both chemical and electrical synapses. An Si2-evoked slow inhibitory synaptic potential in Si3 suppresses its firing, terminating the burst generated by the module. Using dynamic clamping, we showed that the magnitude of the slow inhibition sets the periodicity of the oscillator. Thus, the network-driven oscillation is produced by each module rebounding from inhibition, maintaining the burst through self-excitation, and then terminating its burst through a buildup of slow synaptic inhibition, thereby releasing the other module from inhibition.

                When choosing between different options, we tend to consider specific attribute qualities rather than deliberating over some general sense of the objects' overall values. The importance of each attribute together with its quality will determine our preference rankings over the available alternatives. Here, we show that the relative importance of the latent attributes within food rewards reliably differs when the items are evaluated in isolation compared to when binary choices are made between them. Specifically, we used standard regression and sequential sampling models to examine six datasets in which participants evaluated, and chose between, multi-attribute snack foods. We show that models that assume that attribute importance remains constant across evaluation and choice contexts fail to reproduce fundamental patterns in the choice data and provide quantitatively worse fits to the choice outcomes, response times, and confidence reports compared to models that allow for attribute importance to vary across preference elicitation methods. Our results provide important evidence that incorporating attribute-level information into computational models helps us to better understand the cognitive processes involved in value-based decision-making.

                Microglia are key remodelers of neuronal synapses during brain development, but the mechanisms that regulate this process and its ultimate impact on neural circuit function are not well defined. We previously identified the IL-1 family cytokine Interleukin-33 (IL-33) as a novel mediator of microglial synapse remodeling. Here we define the phagocytic program induced in microglia in response to IL-33. We find that IL-33 markedly alters the microglial enhancer landscape and exposes AP-1 transcription factor sites that promote target gene expression. We identify the scavenger receptor MARCO and the pattern recognition receptor TLR2 as downstream mediators of IL-33 dependent synapse engulfment. Conditional deletion of IL-33 in the CNS or its receptor on microglia results in increased numbers of excitatory synapses in the corticothalamic circuit and spontaneous epileptiform activity as well as increased seizure susceptibility by early adulthood. These findings define novel mechanisms through which IL-33 coordinates experience-dependent synaptic refinement to restrict hyperexcitability in the developing brain.

                Sensory stimuli evoke spiking neural responses that innately or after learning drive suitable behavioral outputs. How are these spiking activities intrinsically patterned to encode for innate preferences, and could the neural response organization impose constraints on learning? We examined this issue in the locust olfactory system. Using a diverse odor panel, we found that ensemble activities both during ('ON response') and after stimulus presentations ('OFF response') could be linearly mapped onto overall appetitive preference indices. Although diverse, ON and OFF response patterns generated by innately appetitive odorants were still limited to a low-dimensional subspace (a 'neural manifold'). Similarly, innately non-appetitive odorants evoked responses that were separable yet confined to another neural manifold. Notably, only odorants that evoked neural response excursions in the appetitive manifold were conducive for learning. In sum, these results provide insights on how encoding for innate preferences can also set limits on associative learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential mechanisms of cold sensitivity in mouse trigeminal and vagal ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                Thermal signals are critical elements in the operation of interoceptive and exteroceptive neural circuits, essential for triggering thermally-driven reflexes and conscious behaviors. A fraction of cutaneous and visceral sensory endings are activated by cold temperatures. Compared to somatic (DRG and TG) neurons, little is known about the mechanisms underlying cold sensitivity of visceral vagal neurons. We used pharmacological and genetic tools for a side-by-side characterization of cold-sensitive (CS) neurons in adult mouse trigeminal (TG) and vagal ganglia (VG). We found that CS neurons are more abundant in VG than in TG. In both ganglia, sensitivity to cold varied widely and was enhanced by the potassium channel blocker 4-AP. The majority of CS neurons in VG co-express TRPA1 markers and cold-evoked responses are severely blunted in Trpa1 KO mice, with little impact of TRPM8 deletion or pharmacological TRPM8 blockade. Consistent with these findings, the expression of TRPM8-positive neurons was low in VG and restricted to the rostral jugular ganglion. In vivo retrograde labelling of airway-innervating vagal neurons demonstrated their enhanced cold sensitivity and a higher expression of TRPA1 compared to neurons innervating the stomach wall. In contrast, the majority of CS TG neurons co-express TRPM8 markers and their cold sensitivity is reduced after TRPM8 deletion or blockade. However, pharmacological or genetic reduction of TRPA1 showed that these channels contribute significantly to their cold sensitivity in TG. In both ganglia, a fraction of CS neuron respond to cooling by a mechanism independent of TRPA1 or TRPM8 yet to be characterized.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peptidergic modulation of fear responses by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Many neuronal populations that release fast-acting excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain also contain slower acting neuropeptides. These facultative peptidergic cell types are common, but it remains uncertain whether obligate peptidergic neurons exist. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization, genetically-targeted electron microscopy, and electrophysiological characterization data strongly suggest that neurons of the non-cholinergic, centrally-projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus in mice are fundamentally obligately peptidergic. We further show, using fiber photometry, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, anterograde projection mapping, and a battery of behavioral assays, that this peptidergic population both promotes fear responses and analgesia and activates in response to loss of motor control and pain. Together, these findings elucidate an integrative, ethologically relevant function for the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and functionally align the nucleus with the periaqueductal gray, where it resides. This work advances our understanding of the peptidergic modulation of fear and provides a framework for future investigations of putative obligate peptidergic systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contextual expectations shape cortical reinstatement of sensory representations</a></h4>

              
                When making a turn at a familiar intersection, we know what items and landmarks will come into view. These perceptual expectations, or predictions, come from our knowledge of the context, however it is unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in cortex. To address this, human participants learned the spatial layout of animals positioned in a cross maze. During fMRI, participants navigated between animals to reach a target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one quarter of trials ended early, with a blank screen presented instead. Using multivariate pattern similarity analysis, we reveal that activity patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing the same item compared to different items. Further, item effects in posterior hippocampus were specific to the sequence context. Critically, activity patterns associated with seeing an item in visual cortex and posterior medial cortex, were also related to activity patterns when an item was expected, but omitted, suggesting sequence predictions were reinstated in these regions. Finally, multivariate connectivity showed that patterns in the posterior hippocampus at one position in the sequence were related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial cortex at a later position. Together, our results support the idea that hippocampal representations facilitate sensory processing by modulating visual cortical activity in anticipation of expected items.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voltage imaging in Drosophila using a hybrid chemical-genetic rhodamine voltage reporter</a></h4>

              
                We combine a chemically-synthesized, voltage-sensitive fluorophore with a genetically encoded, self-labeling enzyme to enable voltage imaging in Drosophila melanogaster. Previously, we showed that a rhodamine voltage reporter (RhoVR) combined with the HaloTag self-labeling enzyme could be used to monitor membrane potential changes from mammalian neurons in culture and brain slice. Here, we apply this hybrid RhoVR-Halo approach in vivo to achieve selective neuron labeling in intact fly brains. We generate a Drosophila UAS-HaloTag reporter line in which the HaloTag enzyme is expressed on the surface of cells. We validate the voltage sensitivity of this new construct in cell culture before driving expression of HaloTag in specific brain neurons in flies. We show that selective labeling of synapses, cells, and brain regions can be achieved with RhoVR-Halo in either larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or in whole adult brains. Finally, we validate the voltage sensitivity of RhoVR-Halo in fly tissue via dual-electrode/imaging at the NMJ, show the efficacy of this approach for measuring synaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in muscle cells, and perform voltage imaging of carbachol-evoked depolarization and osmolarity-evoked hyperpolarization in projection neurons and in interoceptive subesophageal zone neurons in fly brain explants following in vivo labeling. We envision the turn-on response to depolarizations, fast response kinetics, and two-photon compatibility of chemical indicators, coupled with the cellular and synaptic specificity of genetically-encoded enzymes, will make RhoVR-Halo a powerful complement to neurobiological imaging in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupil correlates of decision variables in mice playing a competitive mixed-strategy game</a></h4>

              
                In a competitive game involving an animal and an opponent, the outcome is contingent on the choices of both players. To succeed, the animal must continually adapt to competitive pressure, or else risk being exploited and lose out on rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be trained to play the iterative competitive game 'matching pennies' against a virtual computer opponent. We find that the animals' performance is well described by a hybrid computational model that includes Q-learning and choice kernels. Comparing between matching pennies and a non-competitive two-armed bandit task, we show that the tasks encourage animals to operate at different regimes of reinforcement learning. To understand the involvement of neuromodulatory mechanisms, we measure fluctuations in pupil size and use multiple linear regression to relate the trial-by-trial transient pupil responses to decision-related variables. The analysis reveals that pupil responses are modulated by observable variables, including choice and outcome, as well as latent variables for value updating, but not action selection. Collectively, these results establish a paradigm for studying competitive decision-making in head-fixed mice and provide insights into the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation in the decision process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A population of descending neurons that regulate the flight motor of Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Like many insect species, Drosophila melanogaster are capable of maintaining a stable flight trajectory for periods lasting up to several hours(1, 2). Because aerodynamic torque is roughly proportional to the fifth power of wing length(3), even small asymmetries in wing size require the maintenance of subtle bilateral differences in flapping motion to maintain a stable path. Flies can even fly straight after losing half of a wing, a feat they accomplish via very large, sustained kinematic changes to the both damaged and intact wings(4). Thus, the neural network responsible for stable flight must be capable of sustaining fine-scaled control over wing motion across a large dynamic range. In this paper, we describe an unusual type of descending neurons (DNg02) that project directly from visual output regions of the brain to the dorsal flight neuropil of the ventral nerve cord. Unlike most descending neurons, which exist as single bilateral pairs with unique morphology, there is a population of at least 15 DNg02 cell pairs with nearly identical shape. By optogenetically activating different numbers of DNg02 cells, we demonstrate that these neurons regulate wingbeat amplitude over a wide dynamic range via a population code. Using 2-photon functional imaging, we show that DNg02 cells are responsive to visual motion during flight in a manner that would make them well suited to continuously regulate bilateral changes in wing kinematics. Collectively, we have identified a critical set of DNs that provide the sensitivity and dynamic range required for flight control.

	<p>Background: We aimed to assess the effects of modulated neuroprotection with intermittent administration in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Retrospective analysis of 60 patients divided into two groups, with and without neuroprotective treatment with Actovegin, Cerebrolysin, pyritinol, L-phosphothreonine, L-glutamine, hydroxocobalamin, alpha-lipoic acid, carotene, DL-α-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, thiamine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, Q 10 coenzyme, and L-carnitine alongside standard treatment. Main outcome measures: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after TBI, Extended Glasgow Coma Scale (GOS E), Disability Rankin Scale (DRS), Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), all assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results: Patients receiving neuroprotective treatment recovered more rapidly from UWS than controls (p = 0.007) passing through a state of minimal consciousness and gradually progressing until the final evaluation (p = 0.000), towards a high cognitive level MOCA = 22 ± 6 points, upper moderate disability GOS-E = 6 ± 1, DRS = 6 ± 4, and an assisted gait, FIM =101 ± 25. The improvement in cognitive and physical functioning was strongly correlated with lower UWS duration (−0.8532) and higher GCS score (0.9803). Conclusion: Modulated long-term neuroprotection may be the therapeutic key for patients to overcome UWS after severe TBI.</p>

	<p>Decision making is a complex cognitive phenomenon commonly used in everyday life. Studies have shown differences in behavioral strategies in risky decision-making tasks over the course of aging. The development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for fMRI studies of decision making in older adults using risky decision-making tasks. To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects.</p>

	<p>Background and objectives: Parkinson’s disease (PD) and schizophrenia often share symptomatology. Psychotic symptoms are prevalent in patients with PD, and similar motor symptoms with extrapyramidal signs are frequently observed in antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia as well as premorbid families. However, few studies have examined the relationship between PD and schizophrenia. We performed this study to evaluate whether genetic variants which increase PD risk influence the risk of developing schizophrenia, and vice versa. Materials and Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) with summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was applied. Summary statistics were extracted for these instruments from GWAS of PD and schizophrenia; Results: We found an increase in the risk of schizophrenia per one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the genetically-predicted PD risk (inverse-variance weighted method, odds ratio = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.05−1.15; p = 3.49 × 10−5). The association was consistent in sensitivity analyses, including multiple TSMR methods, analysis after removing outlier variants with potential pleiotropic effects, and analysis after applying multiple GWAS subthresholds. No relationships were evident between PD and smoking or other psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, or alcohol dependence. However, we did not find a reverse relationship; genetic variants increasing schizophrenia risk did not alter the risk of PD; Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that increased genetic risk of PD can be associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. This association supports the intrinsic nature of the psychotic symptom in PD rather than medication or environmental effects. Future studies for possible comorbidities and shared genetic structure between the two diseases are warranted.</p>

	<p>The beneficial effects of regular physical activity (PA) on cognitive functions have received much attention. Recent research suggests that regular PA may also enhance creative thinking, an indispensable cognitive factor for invention and innovation. However, at what intensity regular PA brings the most benefits to creative thinking remains uninvestigated. Furthermore, whether the levels of regular PA affect the acute PA effects on creative thinking is also unclear. In the present study, using a previous dataset that investigated the effects of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on creative thinking in healthy Japanese young adults (22.98 ± 1.95 years old) in the year 2020, we tested the association between different intensities of regular PA (i.e., vigorous, moderate, and walking) and creative thinking with the cross-sectional baseline data using multiple linear regression. We also investigated whether regular PA levels were associated with the acute aerobic exercise intervention effects on creative thinking. The results showed that cross-sectionally, the regular PAs were differentially associated with divergent but not convergent thinking. Specifically, whereas the amount of vigorous-intensity PA was positively associated with fluency and flexibility, the amount of walking was positively associated with novelty on the alternate uses test (AUT) measuring divergent thinking. Importantly, the explained variances of fluency, flexibility, and novelty were 20.3% (p = 0.040), 18.8% (p = 0.055), and 20.1% (p = 0.043), respectively. None of the regular PAs predicted convergent thinking (i.e., an insight problem-solving task), nor were they associated with the acute aerobic exercise intervention effects on divergent and convergent thinking. These findings suggest that engaging in regular vigorous-intensity PA and walking may be useful strategies to enhance different aspects of divergent thinking in daily life.</p>

	<p>Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease determined by the loss of the paternal copy of the 15q11-q13 region, and it is characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances. The aims of this retrospective study were to analyze interictal EEG findings in a group of PWS patients and to correlate them with genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. The demographic, clinical, genetic, EEG, and neuroimaging data of seventy-four patients were collected. Associations among the presence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities, genotype, and clinical and neuroimaging features were investigated. Four patients (5.4%) presented drug-sensitive epilepsy. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—focal or multifocal—were present in 25.7% of the cases, and the normalization of the EEG occurred in about 25% of the cases. In 63.2% of the cases, the paroxysmal abnormalities were bilaterally localized over the middle–posterior regions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 39 patients (abnormal in 59%). No relevant associations were found between paroxysmal EEG abnormalities and all of the other variables considered. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—in particular, with a bilateral middle–posterior localization—could represent an important neurological feature of PWS that is not associated with genotype, cognitive or behavioral endophenotypes, MRI anomalies, or prognosis.</p>

	<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects oculomotor (eye movement) control. Dysfunctional oculomotor control may result in reading or educational difficulties. This randomized controlled crossover study sought to investigate the feasibility of a larger scale trial and effects of a single session of spinal manipulation on oculomotor control in children with ADHD. Thirty children participated in the study and were randomized into either control-first or spinal manipulation first groups. The results indicate that the trial was feasible. Secondary outcomes showed that there was a significant decrease in reading time after the spinal manipulation intervention compared to the control intervention. Future studies of the effects of spinal manipulation on oculomotor control in children with ADHD are suggested.</p>

<p>Shortening the open duration of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) channel genetically by the RyR2-E4872Q mutation or pharmacologically by R-carvedilol prevented learning and memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mouse model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is driven by a vicious cycle of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, breaking this vicious cycle by suppressing neuronal hyperactivity may represent a logical approach to stopping AD progression. In support of this, we have recently shown that genetically and pharmacologically limiting ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) open time prevented neuronal hyperactivity, memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in a rapid, early onset AD mouse model (5xFAD). Here, we assessed the impact of limiting RyR2 open time on AD-related deficits in a relatively late occurring, slow developing AD mouse model (3xTG-AD) that bears more resemblance (compared to 5xFAD) to that of human AD. Using behavioral tests, long-term potentiation recordings, and Golgi and Nissl staining, we found that the RyR2-E4872Q mutation, which markedly shortens the open duration of the RyR2 channel, prevented learning and memory impairment, defective long-term potentiation, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mice. Furthermore, pharmacologically shortening the RyR2 open time with R-carvedilol rescued these AD-related deficits in 3xTG mice. Therefore, limiting RyR2 open time may offer a promising, neuronal hyperactivity-targeted anti-AD strategy.</p>
