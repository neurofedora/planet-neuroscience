                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the commonest primary brain cancers. They are characterized by a pattern of aggressive growth and diffuse infiltration of the host brain that severely limits the efficacy of conventional treatments and patient outcomes, which remain generally poor. Recent work has described a suite of mechanisms via which HGGs interact, predominantly bidirectionally, with various cell types in the host brain including neurons, glial cells, immune cells, and vascular elements to drive tumor growth and invasion. These insights have the potential to inspire novel approaches to HGG therapy that are critically needed. This review explores HGG–host brain interactions and considers whether and how they might be exploited for therapeutic gain.

">The intersection of endocrine signaling and neuroimmune communication regulates neonatal nociception</a></h4>

              
                Neonatal pain is a significant clinical issue but the mechanisms by which pain is produced early in life are poorly understood. Our recent work has linked the transcription factor serum response factor downstream of local growth hormone (GH) signaling to incision-related hypersensitivity in neonates. However, it remains unclear if similar mechanisms contribute to inflammatory pain in neonates. We found that local GH treatment inhibited neonatal inflammatory myalgia but appeared to do so through a unique signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) dependent pathway within sensory neurons. The STAT1 transcription factor appeared to regulate peripheral inflammation itself by modulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) release from sensory neurons. Data suggests that STAT1 upregulation, downstream of GH signaling, contributes to neonatal nociception during muscle inflammation through a novel neuroimmune loop involving cytokine release from primary afferents. Results could uncover new ways to treat muscle pain and inflammation in neonates.

	<p>Background: Neural efficiency refers to the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to function with reduced resource expenditure while maintaining high performance levels. Previous research has demonstrated that table tennis athletes have greater neural efficiency at the conscious level. However, it is unknown whether they exhibit greater neural efficiency at the unconscious level. Therefore, this study aims to investigate unconscious perceptual processing and neural efficiency in elite table tennis athletes through tasks involving the judgment of spin serves. Methods: Fifty healthy, right-handed individuals participated in this study, including 25 elite table tennis athletes and 25 control participants without professional training experience. To evaluate the unconscious perceptual characteristics of both groups, we used a combination of masked priming paradigm and event-related potential techniques. Results: The behavioral results reveal that, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes displayed reduced reaction times (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and increased priming effects (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) under unconscious conditions. The electrophysiological findings indicated that both groups elicited N1, N2, and P2 components. Notably, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes exhibited significantly lower amplitude responses at the occipital lobe electrodes PO3, POz, PO4, O1, Oz, and O2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion: These results further support the neural efficiency hypothesis, indicating that prolonged professional training enhances athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; capacities for specialized unconscious cognitive processing.</p>

	<p>The main goal of the current work was to assess the age sensitivity of a novel battery of cool and hot Executive Function (EF) tasks developed for the middle childhood period: the Executive Brain Battery (EBB). To this end, we carried out a first study in which the EBB was administered to six age groups ranging from 6 to 11. Additionally, in a second study, we compared children at the end of middle childhood (age 11 years) and adult performance in the EBB. Results showed that tasks included in the EBB were suitable for all age groups, with more age-related changes being found in cool than hot EF tasks. Moreover, at the end of middle childhood, children reach an adult-like performance in most of these cool and hot tasks. The present findings extend previous research suggesting that cool and hot EFs exhibit different patterns of age-related growth in middle childhood. Additionally, the EEB could become a useful tool for research on EFs during middle childhood that could be adapted for a wide range of populations.</p>

	<p>Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) often suffer from cognitive dysfunction (CD), affecting their quality of life and daily functioning. Current treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, have limited efficacy and notable side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that modulates cortical activity, shows promise in improving cognitive function with minimal side effects and low cost, and could potentially serve as a valuable adjunct to existing therapies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness of tDCS for CD in SUD patients to inform clinical practice and future research. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review includes studies that used tDCS for SUD-related CD. The criteria for inclusion encompassed participants aged 18 and older with a diagnosis of SUD, the use of tDCS (either conventional or high-definition), control groups receiving sham stimulation or no intervention, and cognitive outcome measures for substance-related cognitive function using validated tools. Databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO, with specific keywords. Twenty-two studies met the criteria, suggesting tDCS can improve cognitive functions in SUD patients, though results varied. Effectiveness may depend on the brain area targeted, stimulation parameters, task requirements, and individual differences. tDCS shows potential in treating SUD-related CD, but further research is needed to optimize stimulation protocols and address study variability. Future studies should use functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain mechanisms by which tDCS improves cognitive function in SUDs and focus on larger, long-term trials to confirm efficacy and refine tDCS treatment parameters.</p>

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

                <p>Reading depends on a brain region known as the "visual word form area" (VWFA) in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region's function is debated because its stimulus selectivity is not absolute, it is modulated by a variety of task demands, and it is inconsistently localized. We used fMRI to characterize the combination of sensory and cognitive factors that activate word-responsive regions that we precisely localized in 16 adult humans (4 male). We then presented three types of character strings: English words, pseudowords, and unfamiliar characters with matched visual features. Participants performed three different tasks while viewing those stimuli: detecting real words, detecting color in the characters, and detecting color in the fixation mark. There were three primary findings about the VWFA's response: (1) It preferred letter strings over unfamiliar characters even when the stimuli were ignored during the fixation task. (2) Compared with those baseline responses, engaging in the word reading task enhanced the response to words but suppressed the response to unfamiliar characters. (3) Attending to the stimuli to judge their color had little effect on the response magnitudes. Thus, the VWFA is uniquely modulated by a cognitive signal that is specific to voluntary linguistic processing and is not additive. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that communication between the VWFA and a left frontal language area increased when the participant engaged in the linguistic task. We conclude that the VWFA is inherently selective for familiar orthography, but it falls under control of the language network when the task demands it.</p>

                <p>Motion-induced anxiety and agoraphobia are more frequent symptoms in patients with vestibular migraine (VM) than migraine without vertigo. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a therapeutic target for migraine and VM, but the link between motion hypersensitivity, anxiety, and CGRP is relatively unexplored, especially in preclinical mouse models. To further examine this link, we tested the effects of systemic CGRP and off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) on elevated plus maze (EPM) and rotarod performance in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Rotarod ability was assessed using two different dowel diameters: mouse dowel (<I>r</I> = 1.5&nbsp;cm) versus rat dowel (<I>r</I> = 3.5&nbsp;cm). EPM results indicate that CGRP alone or OVAR alone did not increase anxiety indices. However, the combination of CGRP and OVAR did elicit anxiety-like behavior. On the rotarod, CGRP reduced performance in both sexes on a mouse dowel but had no effect on a rat dowel, whereas OVAR had a significant effect on the rat dowel. These results suggest that only the combination of CGRP with vestibular stimulation induces anxiety-like behavior and that CGRP affects the dynamic balance function in mice depending on the type of challenge presented. These findings suggest that anxiety-like behaviors can be teased out from imbalance behaviors in a mouse model of "migraine." Future studies are aimed to determine if CGRP receptor antagonists that have been effective treating migraineurs and mouse "migraine" models may also reduce the anxiety observed in migraine.</p>

                Background Endodontic treatment is the most common method for resolving pulpal and periapical pathology. However, various studies have reported that almost 11%–13% of all teeth that undergo extraction after endodontic treatment show the presence of cracks, craze lines, and vertical root fractures. Teeth with inadequate post endodontic restoration are more prone to fracture and coronal leakage, resulting in the diffusion of oral fluids, bacteria, bacterial products, and possibly root canal treatment failure. Furthermore, studies have advocated the use of endodontically treated teeth with restorative materials that have a similar or higher elastic modulus than the tooth for providing stiffness against forces that cause root fracture. Intraorifice barriers made of restorative materials that can bond to radicular dentin could thus be used to reinforce the radicular dentin while also preventing coronal microleakage. Although the sealing ability of intraorifice barriers has been widely compared in the literature, there have been few studies on the strengthening effect of the materials used in the study as intraorifice barriers when placed into the root canal. As a result, the current in vitro study aims to assess the effect of various materials as intraorifice barriers (Cention N, Resin modified glass ionomer cement, and short fiber reinforced flowable composite) on the force required fracture teeth after root canal treatment. Methods This in vitro study will be done on extracted human mandibular premolars with single root canal where after doing root canal treatment 2-3 mm obturating material would be replaced by intra orifice barriers (Cention N, resin modified glass ionomer cement [RMGIC], and short fiber reinforced flowable composite). The force required to fracture teeth will be calculated using universal testing machine.

                Background: The protein interaction between the viral surface S-glycoprotein and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) is key to the virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2. The potential role that effective drug repurposing strategies may have to help stem the impact of future outbreaks has been brought to light in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This study outlines a comprehensive approach towards in-silico drug discovery which aims to identify hit agents that can be suitably translated into a clinical setting. Methods: We use two different computational platforms to analyze the viral S-glycoprotein in its bound conformational state to the ACE2 receptor. We employed a comprehensive screening approach to shortlist compounds capable of binding to the viral target interface and corroborated these findings using both Schrödinger’s Glide and AutoDock Vina. Molecular dynamic simulation studies further verified the stability of the interaction at the viral-host protein interface. Results: Lymecycline, pentagalloylglucose, polydatin, and hexoprenaline were identified as prime candidates for further studies given the robust and stable nature of their interaction at the viral-host interface and relevance for clinical testing. These agents were shown in a 100-nanosecond simulation trajectory to favorably disrupt key binding interactions at the viral-host interface and may potentially inhibit viral entry into host cells. In all hit molecules it was observed that inhibiting the interaction with the following key viral binding residues: Lys17, Gly496, Tyr 505, and key host residues: His34, Asp38, Lys353, played a critical role toward the inhibition of the viral-host protein interaction. Conclusions: Our study is unique in its comprehensive approach to identify agents that can bind to the S-glycoprotein-ACE2 interface using multiple computational platforms. Among the hit compounds shortlisted in this study, both lymecycline and hexoprenaline may be considered as candidates for preliminarily clinical studies to assess their therapeutic potential in the management of COVID-19 infections.

                Background Systemic hypertension is a global non-communicable disease that creates an essential need for alternate forms of lifestyle modifications, including exercise, to lower elevated blood pressure. Mat Pilates, a feasible form of mind-body coordinated exercise, may provide benefits with limited resources. Objective This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of Mat Pilates on resting blood pressure and health-related quality of life in individuals with systemic hypertension. Methods A two-arm, single-blinded, block randomized controlled trial will be recruited with120 participants into control and experimental groups (1:1 ratio). Mat Pilates will be administered to the experimental group and standard care to the control group for 12 weeks. Resting and central blood pressure, health-related quality of life, and echocardiographic parameters will be measured before and after the trial. We hypothesized that Pilates may not be beneficial in lowering resting blood pressure in hypertensive patients. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will test the within- and between-group effects of Mat Pilates on various outcomes. Ethics and Dissemination The trial was approved by the Institutional Research Committee, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Kasturba Medical College, and Kasturba Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee, Manipal. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. All stakeholders and committees will communicate key findings regarding the implementation of mind-body association exercises as a measure of lifestyle modification in individuals with systemic hypertension.

                Background Dietary supplements (DS) use among Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased widely due to the country’s economic and financial situation. This study was conducted (1) to estimate the prevalence of DS use among persons with T2DM amid the escalating economic crisis in Lebanon; (2) to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of DS use; and (3) to determine any significant association between socio-economic and socio-demographic factors and the use of DS modality Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the worst episode of the economic crisis between October and April 2022 on 460 adult patients with T2DM of both sexes. Patients were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Almost 4 out of 10 patients with T2DM in our study were found to be using DS, where 27.6% take multivitamins frequently. One-third of the participants agreed that nutritional supplements are necessary to control diabetes symptoms and complications. Around 41.1% of the participants complained about hypoglycemia and used DS to control their blood sugar levels (56.4%), while the rest used it to improve their health (35.5%) and control their diet (2.2%). The predictors of DS usage were the patient’s level of education [OR=3.9, CI=1.5-10, p=0.003), self-monitoring of blood sugars (OR=4.9, CI=1.68-14.6; p=0.004) and reading the nutrition label [OR=59.3, CI=6.3-55.8, p=0.000]. Conclusion This study estimated the prevalence of DS use and abuse, among persons with diabetes type II and found three significant predictors of DS use among patients with T2DM. Public health experts should encourage healthy discussions and awareness with their patients to comprehend their views regarding DS use.

                Background Blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (B-MCL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma. It is characterized by blastoid morphology with high proliferation and inconsistent immunohistochemistry (IHC), making it a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Methods This is a retrospective analytical cohort study. We reviewed biopsy confirmed cases of B-MCL diagnosed over a period of 10 years (January 2012 to December 2022). The clinical presentation, histopathological and IHC findings, treatment received, and survival outcomes were studied. Randomly selected cases of classic MCL (n=12), diagnosed during the same period served as controls. Results A total of 12 cases were studied. Four cases were transformed from previously diagnosed MCL; 8 cases arose de novo. Mean age was 61.17 years and the male: female ratio was 5:1. Half of the cases showed extra nodal extension and 81.8% had bone marrow involvement. Gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of extra nodal involvement. Histopathological examination showed diffuse involvement of the lymph node with medium sized cells. On immunohistochemistry, one of the cases showed loss of CD5 expression while the other had aberrant CD10 expression. Mean Ki-67 index was 58.09% in the cases and 16.33% in controls and was statistically significant (p=0.005). The median overall survival (OS) for cases was 2 years vs 8 years in controls. The p53 over expression (>30% nuclear positivity) was seen in 66.6% cases (4/6). Conclusion There are several factors that contribute to the aggressiveness of B-MCL, and new treatment approaches might be required to improve patient outcomes.

                <p>by Eric Tatara, Qinyun Lin, Jonathan Ozik, Marynia Kolak, Nicholson Collier, Dylan Halpern, Luc Anselin, Harel Dahari, Basmattee Boodram, John Schneider</p>

Access to treatment and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential in reducing opioid use and associated behavioral risks, such as syringe sharing among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Syringe sharing among PWID carries high risk of transmission of serious infections such as hepatitis C and HIV. MOUD resources, such as methadone provider clinics, however, are often unavailable to PWID due to barriers like long travel distance to the nearest methadone provider and the required frequency of clinic visits. The goal of this study is to examine the uncertainty in the effects of travel distance in initiating and continuing methadone treatment and how these interact with different spatial distributions of methadone providers to impact co-injection (syringe sharing) risks. A baseline scenario of spatial access was established using the existing locations of methadone providers in a geographical area of metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, USA. Next, different counterfactual scenarios redistributed the locations of methadone providers in this geographic area according to the densities of both the general adult population and according to the PWID population per zip code. We define different reasonable methadone access assumptions as the combinations of short, medium, and long travel distance preferences combined with three urban/suburban travel distance preference. Our modeling results show that when there is a low travel distance preference for accessing methadone providers, distributing providers near areas that have the greatest need (defined by density of PWID) is best at reducing syringe sharing behaviors. However, this strategy also decreases access across suburban locales, posing even greater difficulty in regions with fewer transit options and providers. As such, without an adequate number of providers to give equitable coverage across the region, spatial distribution cannot be optimized to provide equitable access to all PWID. Our study has important implications for increasing interest in methadone as a resurgent treatment for MOUD in the United States and for guiding policy toward improving access to MOUD among PWID.

Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a valuable experimental tool to study the immune state in health and following immune challenges such as infectious diseases, (auto)immune diseases, and cancer. Several tools have been developed to reconstruct B cell and T cell receptor sequences from AIRR-seq data and infer B and T cell clonal relationships. However, currently available tools offer limited parallelization across samples, scalability or portability to high-performance computing infrastructures. To address this need, we developed nf-core/airrflow, an end-to-end bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq processing workflow which integrates the Immcantation Framework following BCR and TCR sequencing data analysis best practices. The Immcantation Framework is a comprehensive toolset, which allows the processing of bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq data from raw read processing to clonal inference. nf-core/airrflow is written in Nextflow and is part of the nf-core project, which collects community contributed and curated Nextflow workflows for a wide variety of analysis tasks. We assessed the performance of nf-core/airrflow on simulated sequencing data with sequencing errors and show example results with real datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to the high-throughput processing of large AIRR-seq datasets, we validated and extended previously reported findings of convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 97 COVID-19 infected individuals and 99 healthy controls, including a mixture of bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets. Using this dataset, we extended the convergence findings to 20 additional subjects, highlighting the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to validate findings in small in-house cohorts with reanalysis of large publicly available AIRR datasets.

                Introduction Amid changing social dynamics, the world of higher education faces, among other challenges, the growing impact on the mental health of students. In this scenario, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the important role of autonomy support as it generates positive effects on students' motivation and well-being. Methods The present study tests the predictive capacity of the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in a higher education institution, in relation to the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, autonomous motivation and depressive symptoms. A sample composed of 356 Spanish university students of which 237 were male (66.57%) from different grades and courses, aged between 17 and 57 years (M = 20.83; SD = 3.44), from middle socioeconomic strata, was used, and selected through purposive sampling. Results After the analysis of structural equations, the results showed that the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support positively predicted the satisfaction of basic psychological needs and this the autonomous motivation; but negatively depressive symptoms. Conclusions The model describes the possible importance of promoting the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in higher education as a protective factor for well-being and mental health. These findings highlight the importance of motivational strategies that higher education teachers must implement to promote student motivation and well-being.

                Background Renal blood flow (RBF) is regulated by an autonomic nervous system and is reduced in older adults. Massage has been previously found to increase blood flow. Objective This two-armed double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the immediate effects of Thai foot massage (TFM) on RBF, psychological stress, and heart rate variability (HRV) in older adult persons. Material and Methods The 26 healthy older adult volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to the TFM group (13 persons) and the control group (13 persons). The TFM group received a 15-minute Thai foot massage, and the control group received a 15-minute bed rest. Primary outcomes – RBF parameters [peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), volumetric arterial blood flow (VF)] and secondary outcomes – HRV parameters [standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and low frequency per high frequency (LF/HF)] were measured after each intervention. Results Results showed that the VF significantly increased after TFM (P < 0.05) but not in control. Meanwhile, the stress index significantly reduced after TFM (P < 0.05). SDNN and RMSSD, the proxies of parasympathetic activity, also significantly increased in the TFM group (p < 0.05). Only RMSSD was significantly enhanced in the control group. No side effects were observed. Conclusion The TFM could increase RBF and alleviate psychological stress through parasympathetic activity actuation. Therefore, this intervention might improve RBF and relieve stress in the older population. Further study should be carried out on a larger population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-830/v3?src=rss">UKB.COVID19: an R package for UK Biobank COVID-19 data processing and analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of some covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a high complexity hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Background The micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a pivotal role in the Latin America economy, creating jobs, boosting local economic activity and contribute to the socio-economic development of the region. The purpose is to reflect on the current costs management prices, the common challenges faced by SMEs in the region, and effective strategies to improve the profitability and sustainability of these companies. Methods it is addressed as a review study of type reflective, which used the dialectic as a method for the construction of the speech, based on techniques of triangulation of information. Result in order to obtain the results, these study topics were pre-selected: (a) determinants of the costs of production in the SMES, b) strategies for the reduction and control of production costs, and c) impact of production costs on the profitability of SMES. Conclusion the present research article delves into the pivotal factors influencing production costs within microenterprises and small businesses situated in the Latin American context. This study posits that the determinants underpinning these costs encompass a spectrum of elements including but not limited to labor, raw materials and supplies, energy and utilities, infrastructure and logistics, regulatory frameworks, and administrative intricacies. Furthermore, the intricate interplay of technology adoption and innovative capabilities is also recognized as a crucial facet in this cost determination paradigm. The overarching understanding underscores the direct and substantial influence of these multifaceted determinants on the operational expenditure of microenterprises and small businesses.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Susac syndrome (SuS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. We aimed to enhance diagnostic precision by developing the SPAMS (SuS, PACNS, MS) score, a practical radiological tool.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study included 99 patients (43 SuS, 37 MS, 19 PACNS) from South American countries. Relevant MRI features were identified through an elastic-net model determined key variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SPAMS score assigned 2 points for snowball lesions, 1 point for spokes-like lesions, or if there are more than 4 lesions in the corpus callosum, corpus callosum involvement, or cerebellar involvement. It subtracted 1 point if gadolinium-enhancing lesions or 4 points if Dawson's fingers are present. Bootstrapping validated the optimal cutoff at 2 points, exhibiting a diagnostic performance of area under the curve = 0.931, sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 89%, positive predictive value = 88%, negative predictive value = 89%, and accuracy = 88%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When specific MRI findings coexisted, the SPAMS score differentiated SuS from MS and PACNS. Access to MRI and standard protocol sequences makes it a valuable tool for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially preventing disability progression and severe clinical outcomes.

                Frisbie et al. demonstrate that stromal-to-tumor cell mitochondrial transfer drives ovarian cancer metastasis and clonal heterogeneity. Carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells donate mitochondria to vulnerable tumor cells, enhancing tumor cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and respiratory capacity and triggering ANGPTL3 secretion to further promote tumor growth. These findings offer a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

                mTORC1 is a master metabolic regulator that stimulates anabolic cell growth and proliferation and suppresses catabolic processes such as autophagy. Joshi et al. find that mTORC1 activity oscillates throughout the cell cycle, promoting progression through interphase and entry into mitosis and resulting in differential sensitivity to autophagy induction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91114">SPAG7 deletion causes intrauterine growth restriction, resulting in adulthood obesity and metabolic dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                From a forward mutagenetic screen to discover mutations associated with obesity, we identified mutations in the <i>Spag7</i> gene linked to metabolic dysfunction in mice. Here, we show that SPAG7 KO mice are born smaller and develop obesity and glucose intolerance in adulthood. This obesity does not stem from hyperphagia, but a decrease in energy expenditure. The KO animals also display reduced exercise tolerance and muscle function due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, SPAG7-deficiency in developing embryos leads to intrauterine growth restriction, brought on by placental insufficiency, likely due to abnormal development of the placental junctional zone. This insufficiency leads to loss of SPAG7-deficient fetuses in utero and reduced birth weights of those that survive. We hypothesize that a ‘thrifty phenotype’ is ingrained in SPAG7 KO animals during development that leads to adult obesity. Collectively, these results indicate that SPAG7 is essential for embryonic development and energy homeostasis later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89986">Cholinergic input to mouse visual cortex signals a movement state and acutely enhances layer 5 responsiveness</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine is released in visual cortex by axonal projections from the basal forebrain. The signals conveyed by these projections and their computational significance are still unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that basal forebrain cholinergic axons in the mouse visual cortex provide a binary locomotion state signal. In these axons, we found no evidence of responses to visual stimuli or visuomotor prediction errors. While optogenetic activation of cholinergic axons in visual cortex in isolation did not drive local neuronal activity, when paired with visuomotor stimuli, it resulted in layer-specific increases of neuronal activity. Responses in layer 5 neurons to both top-down and bottom-up inputs were increased in amplitude and decreased in latency, whereas those in layer 2/3 neurons remained unchanged. Using opto- and chemogenetic manipulations of cholinergic activity, we found acetylcholine to underlie the locomotion-associated decorrelation of activity between neurons in both layer 2/3 and layer 5. Our results suggest that acetylcholine augments the responsiveness of layer 5 neurons to inputs from outside of the local network, possibly enabling faster switching between internal representations during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88261">The scheduling of adolescence with Netrin-1 and UNC5C</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine axons are the only axons known to grow during adolescence. Here, using rodent models, we examined how two proteins, Netrin-1 and its receptor, UNC5C, guide dopamine axons toward the prefrontal cortex and shape behaviour. We demonstrate in mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>) that dopamine axons reach the cortex through a transient gradient of Netrin-1-expressing cells – disrupting this gradient reroutes axons away from their target. Using a seasonal model (Siberian hamsters; <i>Phodopus sungorus</i>) we find that mesocortical dopamine development can be regulated by a natural environmental cue (daylength) in a sexually dimorphic manner – delayed in males, but advanced in females. The timings of dopamine axon growth and UNC5C expression are always phase-locked. Adolescence is an ill-defined, transitional period; we pinpoint neurodevelopmental markers underlying this period.

                The evolutionary conservation of non-core RAG regions suggests significant roles that might involve quantitative or qualitative alterations in RAG activity. Off-target V(D)J recombination contributes to lymphomagenesis and is exacerbated by RAG2’ C-terminus absence in <i>Tp53<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice thymic lymphomas. However, the genomic stability effects of non-core regions from both <i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> and <i>Rag2<sup>c/c</sup></i> in <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-lymphoblastic leukemia (<i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL), the characteristics, and mechanisms of non-core regions in suppressing off-target V(D)J recombination remain unclear. Here, we established three mouse models of <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL in mice expressing full-length RAG (Rag<sup>f/f</sup>), core RAG1 (Rag1<sup>c/c</sup>), and core RAG2 (Rag2<sup>c/c</sup>). The <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> (<i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> and <i>Rag2<sup>c/c</sup></i>) leukemia cells exhibited greater malignant tumor characteristics compared to <i>Rag<sup>f/f</sup></i> cells. Additionally, <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells showed higher frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination and oncogenic mutations than <i>Rag<sup>f/f</sup></i>. We also revealed decreased RAG cleavage accuracy in <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells and a smaller recombinant size in <i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells, which could potentially exacerbate off-target V(D)J recombination in <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the non-core RAG regions, particularly the non-core region of RAG1, play a significant role in preserving V(D)J recombination precision and genomic stability in <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL.

">Statistical learning beyond words in human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Interest in statistical learning in developmental studies stems from the observation that 8-month-olds were able to extract words from a monotone speech stream solely using the transition probabilities (TP) between syllables (Saffran et al., 1996). A simple mechanism was thus part of the human infant's toolbox for discovering regularities in language. Since this seminal study, observations on statistical learning capabilities have multiplied across domains and species, challenging the hypothesis of a dedicated mechanism for language acquisition. Here, we leverage the two dimensions conveyed by speech -speaker identity and phonemes- to examine (1) whether neonates can compute TPs on one dimension despite irrelevant variation on the other and (2) whether the linguistic dimension enjoys an advantage over the voice dimension. In two experiments, we exposed neonates to artificial speech streams constructed by concatenating syllables while recording EEG. The sequence had a statistical structure based either on the phonetic content, while the voices varied randomly (Experiment 1) or on voices with random phonetic content (Experiment 2). After familiarisation, neonates heard isolated duplets adhering, or not, to the structure they were familiarised with. In both experiments, we observed neural entrainment at the frequency of the regularity and distinct Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to correct and incorrect duplets, highlighting the universality of statistical learning mechanisms and suggesting it operates on virtually any dimension the input is factorised. However, only linguistic duplets elicited a specific ERP component consistent with an N400, suggesting a lexical stage triggered by phonetic regularities already at birth. These results show that, from birth, multiple input regularities can be processed in parallel and feed different higher-order networks.

">An essential role for glial cells in postingestive nutrient sensing</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility is an essential trait for survival of any organism. For example, choosing an appropriate food source is vital. To do so, the food's nutritive value needs to be evaluated. Several studies have demonstrated that Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults, as mammals, are able to distinguish between nutritious and non-nutritious carbohydrates independent of their taste. Several groups of neurons have been implicated in postprandial sugar sensing in adult flies (Dus et al., 2011, 2015; Miyamoto et al., 2012; Park et al., 2016; Musso et al., 2023). In larvae, neurons expressing Gr43a, a fructose receptor, have been shown to be implicated in postingestive glucose sensing (Mishra et al., 2013). How can a fructose sensor mediate glucose sensing? We show that postingestive glucose, and also sorbitol, sensing involves carbohydrate conversion into fructose via the polyol pathway in glial cells. Glia-derived fructose is subsequently sensed via Gr43a expressed in neurons, which leads to behavioral adaptation. Thus, in postingestive nutrient sensing, the glial cells play a central role in information processing and regulation of behavior.

">Episodic rhythmicity is generated by a distributed neural network in the developing mammalian spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Spinal circuits produce diverse motor outputs that coordinate the rhythm and pattern of locomotor movements. Despite the episodic nature of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms encoding these episodes are not well understood. This study investigated mechanisms producing episodic rhythms evoked by dopamine in isolated neonatal mouse spinal cords. Dopamine-induced rhythms were primarily synchronous and propagated rostro-caudally across spinal segments, with occasional asynchronous episodes. Electrical stimulation of the L5 dorsal root could entrain episodes across segments, indicating afferent control of the rhythm generator and a distributed rostro-caudal network. Episodic activity was observed in isolated thoracic or sacral segments after full spinal transection or bilateral ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) lesions, suggesting a network coupled via VLF projections. Rhythmicity was recorded from axons projecting through the VLF and dorsal roots, but not from cholinergic recurrent excitation via motoneurons or isolated dorsal inhibitory circuits. The data suggest episodic rhythmicity is generated by a flexibly coupled network of spinal interneurons distributed throughout the spinal cord.

">Patterns of neural activity in prelimbic cortex neurons correlate with attentional behavior in the rodent continuous performance test</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention, the ability to focus on a stimulus or task over extended periods, is crucial for higher level cognition, and is impaired in individuals diagnosed with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. Translational tasks like the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT) can be used to study the cellular mechanisms underlying sustained attention. Accumulating evidence points to a role for the prelimbic cortex (PrL) in sustained attention, as electrophysiological single unit and local field (LFPs) recordings reflect changes in neural activity in the PrL in mice performing sustained attention tasks. While the evidence correlating PrL electrical activity with sustained attention is compelling, limitations inherent to electrophysiological recording techniques, including low sampling in single unit recordings and source ambivalence for LFPs, impede the ability to fully resolve the cellular mechanisms in the PrL that contribute to sustained attention. In vivo endoscopic calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium sensors in behaving animals can address these questions by simultaneously recording up to hundreds of neurons at single cell resolution. Here, we used in vivo endoscopic calcium imaging to record patterns of neuronal activity in PrL neurons using the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6f in mice performing the rCPT at three timepoints requiring differing levels of cognitive demand and task proficiency. A higher proportion of PrL neurons were recruited during correct responses in sessions requiring high cognitive demand and task proficiency, and mice intercalated non-responsive-disengaged periods with responsive-engaged periods that resemble attention lapses. During disengaged periods, the correlation of calcium activity between PrL neurons was higher compared to engaged periods, suggesting a neuronal network state change during attention lapses in the PrL. Overall, these findings illustrate that cognitive demand, task proficiency, and task engagement differentially recruit activity in a subset of PrL neurons during sustained attention.

">Activating Cognitive Processes in Human Cortex at Multiple Low-Frequency Bands</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain function, governing various cognitive processes. While electrophysiological studies have characterized the frequency properties of these oscillations, their spatial resolution is limited. In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides high spatial resolution but was initially restricted to a narrow frequency range. This study aims to bridge the gap by investigating the role of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) oscillations across multiple frequency bands in cognitive processes using high temporal resolution task-fMRI data. Our findings reveal that different frequency bands are associated with distinct functional processes. Specifically, the slow-1 to slow-3 bands primarily contribute to local sensory information processing, while the slow-4 band is crucial for various fundamental cognitive functions, including somatic motor function and social cognitive function. The slow-5 band is involved in cognitive processes requiring higher memory load, integrated cognitive processing, and attention maintenance. Through multiband activation analysis, this study underscores the importance of analyzing a broad frequency range to capture the full spectrum of brain function. These findings highlight the diverse roles of different frequency bands in brain activity, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of cognitive processes. This research enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes and has significant implications for cognitive neuroscience and clinical applications.

                Human visual working memory (VWM) is known to be capacity-limited, but the nature of this limit continues to be debated. Recent work has proposed that VWM is supported by a finite (~ 3) set of content-free pointers, acting as stand-ins for individual objects and binding features together. Here, based on two visual working memory experiments (N=20 each) examining memory for simple and complex objects, we report a sustained MEG response over right pos-terior cortex whose magnitude tracks the core hypothesized properties of this system: load-dependent, capacity-limited and content-free. These results provide novel evidence for a finite set of content-free pointers underlying VWM.

">Epileptiform activity and seizure risk follow long-term non-linear attractor dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Many biological systems display circadian and slow multi-day rhythms, such as hormonal and cardiac cycles. In patients with epilepsy, these cycles also manifest as slow cyclical fluctuations in seizure propensity. However, such fluctuations in symptoms are consequences of the complex interactions between the underlying physiological, pathophysiological, and external causes. Therefore, identifying an accurate model of the underlying system that governs the multi-day rhythms allows for a more reliable seizure risk forecast and targeted interventions. To achieve this goal, we adopt the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis to approximate a linear representation of nonlinear seizure propensity dynamics. The HAVOK framework leverages Koopman theory and delay-embedding to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear system of leading delay-embedded coordinates driven by the low-energy coordinate (i.e., forcing). Our findings reveal the topology of attractors underlying multi-day seizure cycles, showing that seizures tend to occur in regions of the manifold with strongly nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the identified system driven by forcings with short periods up to a few days accurately predicts patients' slower multi-day rhythms, which improves seizure risk forecasting.

                The ability to successfully remember past events is critical to our daily lives, yet the neural mechanisms underlying the motivation to retrieve is unclear. Although reward-system activity and feedback-related signals have been observed during memory retrieval, whether this signal reflects intrinsic reward or goal-attainment is unknown. Adjudicating between these two alternatives is crucial for understanding how individuals are motivated to engage in retrieval and how retrieval supports later remembering. To test these two accounts, we conducted between-subjects recognition memory tasks on human participants undergoing scalp electroencephalography and varied test-phase goals (recognize old vs. detect new items). We used an independently validated feedback classifier to measure positive feedback evidence. We find positive feedback following successful retrieval regardless of task goals. Together, these results suggest that successful retrieval is intrinsically rewarding. Such a feedback signal may promote future retrieval attempts as well as bolster later memory for the successfully retrieved events.

">Contrast-dependent response modulation in convolutional neural networks captures behavioral and neural signatures of visual adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Human perception remains robust under challenging viewing conditions. Robust perception is thought to be facilitated by nonlinear response properties, including temporal adaptation (reduced responses to repeated stimuli) and contrast gain (shift in the contrast response function with pre-exposure to a stimulus). Temporal adaptation and contrast gain have both been shown to aid object recognition, however, their joint effect on perceptual and neural responses remains unclear. Here, we collected behavioural measurements and electrocorticography (EEG) data while human participants (both sexes) classified objects embedded within temporally repeated noise patterns, whereby object contrast was varied. Our findings reveal an interaction effect, with increased categorization performance as a result of temporal adaptation for higher but not lower contrast stimuli. This increase in behavioral performance after adaptation is associated with more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of evoked neural responses, as well as better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To elucidate the neural computations underlying these effects, we endowed deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with various temporal adaptation mechanisms, including intrinsic suppression and temporal divisive normalisation. We demonstrate that incorporating a biologically-inspired contrast response function to modify temporal adaptation helps DCNNs to accurately capture human behaviour and neural activation profiles. Moreover, we find that networks with multiplicative temporal adaptation mechanisms, such as divisive normalization, show higher robustness against spatial shifts in the inputs compared to DCNNs employing additive mechanisms. Overall, we reveal how interaction effects between nonlinear response properties influence human perception in challenging viewing contexts and investigate potential computations that mediate these effects.

">An aging-sensitive compensatory secretory phospholipase that confers neuroprotection and cognitive resilience</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive reserve theory posits a role for compensatory mechanisms in the aging brain in moderating cognitive decline and risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the identities of such mechanisms have remained elusive. A screen for hippocampal dentate granule cell (DGC) synapse loss-induced factors identified a secreted phospholipase, Pla2g2f, whose expression increases in DGCs during aging. Pla2g2f deletion in DGCs exacerbates aging-associated pathophysiological changes including synapse loss, inflammatory microglia, reactive astrogliosis, impaired neurogenesis, lipid dysregulation and hippocampal-dependent memory loss. Conversely, boosting Pla2g2f in DGCs during aging is sufficient to preserve synapses, reduce inflammatory microglia and reactive gliosis, prevent hippocampal-dependent memory impairment and modify trajectory of cognitive decline. Ex vivo, neuronal-PLA2G2F mediates intercellular signaling to decrease lipid droplet burden in microglia. Boosting Pla2g2f expression in DGCs of an aging-sensitive AD model reduces amyloid load and improves memory. Our findings implicate PLA2G2F as a compensatory neuroprotective factor that counteracts aging-associated cognitive decline.

                Women show resilience to cognitive aging, in the absence of dementia, in many populations. To dissect sex differences, we utilized the FCG and XY* mouse models. Female gonads and sex chromosomes improved cognition in aging mice of both sexes. Further, presence of a second X in male and female mice conferred cognitive resilience while its absence in females blocked it. In the hippocampal proteome of aging female mice, the second X increased proteins involved in synaptogenesis signaling - a potential pathway to improved cognition.

">Structured flexibility in recurrent neural networks via neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                The goal of theoretical neuroscience is to develop models that help us better understand biological intelligence. Such models range broadly in complexity and biological detail. For example, task-optimized recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have generated hypotheses about how the brain may perform various computations, but these models typically assume a fixed weight matrix representing the synaptic connectivity between neurons. From decades of neuroscience research, we know that synaptic weights are constantly changing, controlled in part by chemicals such as neuromodulators. In this work we explore the computational implications of synaptic gain scaling, a form of neuromodulation, using task-optimized low-rank RNNs. In our neuromodulated RNN (NM-RNN) model, a neuromodulatory subnetwork outputs a low-dimensional neuromodulatory signal that dynamically scales the low-rank recurrent weights of an output-generating RNN. In empirical experiments, we find that the structured flexibility in the NM-RNN allows it to both train and generalize with a higher degree of accuracy than low-rank RNNs on a set of canonical tasks. Additionally, via theoretical analyses we show how neuromodulatory gain scaling endows networks with gating mechanisms commonly found in artificial RNNs. We end by analyzing the low-rank dynamics of trained NM-RNNs, to show how task computations are distributed.

">Engineering anti-amyloid antibodies with transferrin receptor targeting improves safety and brain biodistribution</a></h4>

              
                Although the first generation of immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are now clinically approved, further optimization could improve both efficacy and safety. Here, we report an antibody transport vehicle (ATV) targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR) for brain delivery of amyloid beta (A{beta}) antibodies. We show that introduction of asymmetrical Fc mutations (ATVcisLALA) allowed the molecule to selectively retain effector function only when bound to A{beta} while mitigating TfR-related hematology liabilities. ATVcisLALA:A{beta} maintained the ability to induce microglial phagocytosis of A{beta} both ex vivo and in vivo. Mice treated with ATVcisLALA:A{beta} exhibited broad brain parenchymal antibody distribution and enhanced plaque target engagement, whereas anti-A{beta} IgG was highly localized to arterial perivascular spaces where cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is commonly found and likely plays a role in induction of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Importantly, ATVcisLALA:A{beta} mitigated ARIA-like lesions and vascular inflammation associated with anti-A{beta} treatment in a mouse model of amyloid deposition. Taken together, ATVcisLALA has the potential to significantly improve both safety and efficacy of A{beta} immunotherapy through enhanced biodistribution mediated by transport across the blood-brain barrier.

">Olfactory projection neuron rewiring in the brain of an ecological specialist</a></h4>

              
                Animals' behaviours can vary greatly between even closely-related species. While changes in the sensory periphery have frequently been linked to species-specific behaviours, very little is known about if and how individual cell types in the central brain evolve. Here, we develop a set of advanced genetic tools to compare homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia - which specialises on a single fruit - and Drosophila melanogaster. Through systematic morphological analysis of olfactory projection neurons (PNs), we reveal that global anatomy of these second-order neurons is conserved. However, high-resolution, quantitative comparisons identify a striking case of convergent rewiring of PNs in two distinct olfactory pathways critical for D. sechellia's host location. Calcium imaging and labelling of pre-synaptic sites in these evolved PNs demonstrate that novel functional connections with third-order partners are formed in D. sechellia. This work demonstrates that peripheral sensory evolution is accompanied by highly-selective wiring changes in the central brain to facilitate ecological specialisation, and paves the way for systematic comparison of other cell types throughout the nervous system.

">Environmental context sculpts spatial and temporal visual processing in thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral state modulates neural activity throughout the visual system; this is largely due to changes in arousal that alter internal brain state. However, behaviors are constrained by the external environmental context, so it remains unclear if this context itself dictates the regime of visual processing, apart from ongoing changes in arousal. Here, we addressed this question in awake head-fixed mice while they passively viewed visual stimuli in two different environmental contexts: either a cylindrical tube, or a circular running wheel. We targeted high-density silicon probe recordings to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and simultaneously measured several electrophysiological and behavioral correlates of arousal changes, and thus controlled for them across contexts. We found surprising differences in spatial and temporal processing in dLGN across contexts, even in identical states of alertness and stillness. The wheel context (versus tube) showed elevated baseline activity, faster visual responses, and smaller but less selective spatial receptive fields. Further, arousal caused similar changes to visual responsiveness across all conditions, but the environmental context mainly changed the overall set-point for this relationship. Together, our results reveal an unexpected influence of the physical environmental context on fundamental aspects of visual processing in the early visual system.

">Spatial (Mis)match Between EEG and fMRI Signal Patterns Revealed by Spatio-Spectral Source-Space EEG Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                In this work, we aimed to directly compare and integrate EEG whole-brain patterns of neural dynamics with concurrently measured fMRI BOLD data. For that purpose, we set out to derive EEG patterns based on a spatio-spectral decomposition of band-limited EEG power in the source-reconstructed space. On a large data set of 72 subjects resting-state hdEEG-fMRI we showed that the proposed approach is reliable both in terms of the extracted patterns as well as their spatial BOLD signatures. The five most robust EEG spatio-spectral patterns include, but go beyond, the well-known occipital alpha power dynamics. The EEG spatial-spectral patterns show relatively weak, yet statistically significant spatial similarity to their fMRI BOLD signatures, particularly the patterns that show stronger temporal synchronization with BOLD. However, we observed an insignificant relation between the temporal synchronization and spatial overlap of the EEG spatio-spectral patterns and the classical fMRI BOLD resting state networks (as obtained by independent component analysis). This provides evidence that both EEG (frequency-specific) power and BOLD signal capture reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. Rather than being mutually redundant, these are only partially overlapping, carrying to a large extent complementary information concerning the underlying low-frequency dynamics. Finally, we report and interpret the most stable source space EEG-fMRI patterns, along with the corresponding EEG electrode space patterns better known from the literature.

">Guided by touch: Tactile Cues in Hand Movement Control</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, touch is associated with exteroception and is rarely considered a relevant sensory cue for controlling movements in space, unlike vision. We developed a technique to isolate and evaluate tactile involvement in controlling sliding finger movements over a surface. Young adults traced a 2D shape with their index finger under direct or mirror-reversed visual feedback to create a conflict between visual and somatosensory inputs. In this context, increased reliance on somatosensory input compromises movement accuracy. Based on the hypothesis that tactile cues contribute to guiding hand movements, we predicted poorer performance when the participants traced with their bare finger compared to when their tactile sensation was dampened using a smooth finger splint. The results supported this prediction. EEG source analyses revealed smaller current in the presumed somatosensory cortex during sensory conflict, but only when the finger directly touched the surface. This finding suggests the gating of task-irrelevant somatosensory inputs. Together, our results emphasize touch's involvement in movement control, challenging the notion that vision predominantly governs goal-directed hand or finger movements.

">Role of somatic HCN in epileptiform activity in subicular neurons</a></h4>

              
                The subiculum, owing to its bursting nature and recurrent connections, plays a critical role in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). Studying neuronal subtypes in the subiculum can elucidate the mechanisms underlying the patterning of epileptiform firing. We observed that epileptogenic 4AP-0Mg induced different patterns of epileptiform discharges in burst firing neurons and interneurons. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels regulate the intrinsic excitability of the neurons by governing the neuronal firing properties and membrane potential. To study the role of Ih (HCN currents) in epileptiform activity in subicular neurons, we modeled subicular HCN currents in the dynamic clamp that mimicked downregulation and overexpression observed in epilepsy-associated pathophysiology. Our results indicated that the burst firing neurons contribute to the epileptic firing characteristics due to HCN in the subiculum. We subsequently investigated the homeostatic modulation of HCN during the epileptiform activity in subicular burster cells. Our study is the first report showing Ih in rat subicular neurons during 4AP 0Mg-induced epileptogenic activity undergoes modulation on a time scale of a few minutes. Additionally, we observed that the changes in sag and chirp responses were persistent after the wash-out of 4AP-0Mg; thus, the changes appear irreversible. Our studies further showed that the neuronal excitability changes paralleled the changes in the HCN conductance during epileptogenesis. We conclude that a very rapid decline in somatic HCN function during epileptiform activity represents a previously unidentified mechanism of homeostatic dysfunction over a very short period, impeding the ability of a neuron to reestablish its regulatory processes in the subicular burster cells.

">Sensorimotor restriction affects sleep-related motor memory consolidation through altered slow oscillation-spindle coupling.</a></h4>

              
                Sleep benefits memory consolidation through periodic sleep spindle activity and associated memory reactivations. The temporal organization of spindles in "trains" is considered a critical sleep mechanism for the timed and repeated reactivation of memories. Also, evidence suggests that a timely phase-locking between slow oscillations (SO) and spindles facilitates learning-related synaptic plasticity. Here, we investigated the contribution of the clustering and coupling of spindles with SO in motor memory consolidation by experimentally promoting local synaptic depression in sensorimotor cortical regions, through upper-limb immobilization, following motor sequence learning. Our results reveal that the cluster-based organization of sleep spindles is independent of daytime sensorimotor experience, while leading to distinct overnight behavioral outcomes. Interestingly, immobilization induced a phase shift in the SO-spindle coupling for spindles occurring in trains but not when isolated outside trains. We demonstrate that spindle trains may promote skill-specific strengthening of motor memories, while isolated spindles may instead create memory-instability conditions leading to enhanced skill transfer.

">EFMouse: a Matlab toolbox to model electric fields in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Compared to the rapidly growing literature on transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) in humans, research into the mechanisms underlying neuromodulation by tES using in-vivo animal models is growing but still relatively rare. Such research, however, is key to overcoming experimental limitations in humans and essential to build a detailed understanding of the in-vivo consequences of tES that can ultimately lead to development of targeted and effective therapeutic applications of noninvasive brain stimulation. The sheer difference in scale and geometry between animal models and the human brain contributes to the complexity of designing and interpreting animal studies. Here we extend previous approaches to model intracranial electric fields to generate predictions that can be tested with in-vivo intracranial recordings. Although the toolbox has general applicability and could be used to predict intracranial fields for any tES study using mice, we illustrate its usage by comparing fields in a high-density multi-electrode montage with a more traditional two electrode montage. Our simulations show that both montages can produce strong focal homogeneous electric fields in targeted areas. However, the high-density montage produces a field that is more perpendicular to the visual cortical surface, which is expected to result in larger changes in neuronal excitability.

">History-dependent spiking facilitates efficient encoding of polarization angles in neurons of the central complex</a></h4>

              
                Many insects use the polarization pattern of the sky for spatial orientation. Since flying insects perform rapid maneuvers, including saccadic yaw turns which alternate with translational flight, they perceive highly dynamic polarization input to their navigation system. The tuning of compass-neurons in the central complex of insects, however, has been mostly investigated with polarized-light stimuli that rotated at slow and constant velocities, and thus were lacking these natural dynamics. Here we investigated the dynamic response properties of compass-neurons, using intracellular recordings in the central complex of bumblebees. We generated naturalistic stimuli by rotating a polarizer either according to a sequence of head orientations that have been reported from freely flying bumblebees, or at constant velocities between 30{degrees}/s and 1920{degrees}/s, spanning almost the entire range of naturally occurring rotation velocities. We found that compass neurons responded reliably across the entire range of the presented stimuli. In their responses, we observed a dependency on spiking history. We further investigated this dependency using a rate code model taking spiking history into account. Extending the model to a neuronal population with different polarization tuning, which mirrored the neuronal architecture of the central complex, suggests that spiking history has a directly impact on the overall population activity, which has two effects: First, it facilitates faster responses to stimulus changes during highly dynamic flight maneuvers, and increases sensitivity for course deviations during straight flight. Second, population activity during phases of constant polarization input is reduced, which might conserve energy during straight flight.

">Combined effects of pharmacological interventions and intermittent theta-burst stimulation on motor sequence learning</a></h4>

              
                Drugs that modulate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or {gamma}-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors can shed light on their role in synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation. However, research on the combined effects of these drugs and exogenous stimulation on motor learning is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of pharmacological interventions combined with intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on human motor learning. Nine right-handed healthy subjects (mean age {+/-} SD: 31.56 {+/-} 12.96 years; 6 females) participated in this double-blind crossover study. All participants were assigned to four drug conditions in a randomized order: (1) D-cycloserine (partial NMDA receptor agonist), (2) D-cycloserine + dextromethorphan (NMDA receptor agonist + antagonist), (3) lorazepam (GABAA receptor agonist), and (4) placebo (identical microcrystalline cellulose capsule). After drug intake, participants practiced the 12-item keyboard sequential task as a baseline measure. Two hours after drug intake, iTBS was administered at the primary motor cortex. Following iTBS, the retention test was performed in the same manner as the baseline measure. Our findings revealed that lorazepam combined with iTBS impaired motor learning during the retention test. Future studies are still needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms through which TMS may influence human motor learning.

">The Genetic Architecture of the Human Corpus Callosum and its Subregions</a></h4>

              
                The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest set of white matter fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. In humans, it is essential for coordinating sensorimotor responses, performing associative/executive functions, and representing information in multiple dimensions. Understanding which genetic variants underpin corpus callosum morphometry, and their shared influence on cortical structure and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, can provide molecular insights into the CCs role in mediating cortical development and its contribution to neuropsychiatric disease. To characterize the morphometry of the midsagittal corpus callosum, we developed a publicly available artificial intelligence based tool to extract, parcellate, and calculate its total and regional area and thickness. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD), we extracted measures of midsagittal corpus callosum morphometry and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of European participants (combined N = 46,685). We then examined evidence for generalization to the non-European participants of the UKB and ABCD cohorts (combined N = 7,040). Post-GWAS analyses implicate prenatal intracellular organization and cell growth patterns, and high heritability in regions of open chromatin, suggesting transcriptional activity regulation in early development. Results suggest programmed cell death mediated by the immune system drives the thinning of the posterior body and isthmus. Global and local genetic overlap, along with causal genetic liability, between the corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity and bipolar disorders were identified. These results provide insight into variability of corpus callosum development, its genetic influence on the cerebral cortex, and biological mechanisms related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.

">Phonological representations of auditory and visual speech in the occipito-temporal cortex and beyond</a></h4>

              
                Speech is a multisensory signal that can be extracted from the voice and the lips. Previous studies suggested that occipital and temporal regions encode both auditory and visual speech features but their precise location and nature remain unclear. We characterized brain activity using fMRI (in male and female) to functionally and individually define bilateral Fusiform Face Areas (FFA), the left Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), an audio-visual speech region in the left Superior Temporal Sulcus (lSTS) and control regions in bilateral Para-hippocampal Place Areas (PPA). In these regions, we performed multivariate patterns classification of corresponding phonemes (speech sounds) and visemes (lip movements). We observed that the VWFA and lSTS represent phonological information from both vision and sounds. The multisensory nature of phonological representations appeared selective to the anterior portion of VWFA, as we found viseme but not phoneme representation in adjacent FFA or even posterior VWFA, while PPA did not encode phonology in any modality. Interestingly, cross-modal decoding revealed aligned phonological representations across the senses in lSTS, but not in VWFA. A whole-brain cross-modal searchlight analysis additionally revealed aligned audio-visual phonological representations in bilateral pSTS and left somato-motor cortex overlapping with oro-facial articulators. Altogether, our results demonstrate that auditory and visual phonology are represented in the anterior VWFA, extending its functional coding beyond orthography. The geometries of auditory and visual representations do not align in the VWFA as they do in the STS and left somato-motor cortex, suggesting distinct multisensory representations across a distributed phonological network.

">Reduced monitoring of task performance is an effective biomarker of autism</a></h4>

              
                People continuously track and adjust their behavior using external and internal signals. Autistic individuals manifest reduced sensorimotor error correction and slower updating of perceptual priors, yielding reduced behavioral flexibility. A potential reason for this reduced flexibility is a lessened sensitivity to both external and internal feedback. A key brain region involved in online monitoring of behavior and updating world models, known to be atypically activated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). During a two-tone pitch discrimination task, we used EEG to track ASD participants' ACC response dynamics, as manifested in their feedback-related negativity (FRN) component produced following "incorrect" feedback. We found that the FRN is missing in more than half of the ASD (17/30) participants, while clearly present in almost all non-autistics (33/35). Moreover, only in non-autistics, feedback affected performance in the following trial. Their responses were slower following an erred trial, their accuracy was improved following hard and correct trials, and they were more affected by the perceptual priors following easy and correct trials. Non-autistics' EEG response to feedback was also sensitive to trial difficulty, while the EEG response of ASD participants was not. Overall, we observed EEG and behavioral correlates of reduced sensitivity to both external and internal feedback in ASD. These observations suggest that increasing the salience of the external feedback could improve ASDs' error monitoring and perhaps increase their behavioral flexibility.

">Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Thalamic strokes produce a range of neurological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms depending on the thalamic nuclei involved. While thalamic strokes are traditionally associated with severe cognitive deficits, recent studies suggest more modest impairments. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the severity of cognitive impairment following thalamic stroke. Methods: We recruited 40 patients (median age 51) with chronic isolated thalamic stroke and 45 healthy subjects. All subjects underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing. Cluster and principal component analyses were used to discriminate patients from healthy subjects based on cognitive performance. Disconnectome maps and cortical thickness were analyzed to understand the distant impact of thalamic strokes. Results: Two cognitive profiles emerged. Cluster 1 included mostly healthy subjects (n = 43) and patients with no or minor deficits (n = 20); Cluster 2 included patients (n = 19) and 2 healthy subjects with severe deficits of verbal memory, executive functions, and attention. Cluster 1 included all patients with right thalamic stroke. Cluster 2 included all patients with bilateral stroke or mammillothalamic tract disruption. Patients with left-sided stroke were equally divided between Cluster 1 and 2. Other significant differences included age, education, interthalamic adhesion disruption, lesion volume, and location. Disconnectome maps showed larger disruptions of the anterior thalamic projection in patients with left-sided stroke of Cluster 2. Interpretation: Contrary to common expectations, our findings indicate that many patients with thalamic stroke have relatively good cognitive outcomes. In contrast, we identified some of the factors behind poor outcomes that may help clinicians.

">Multivariate Neural Patterns of Reward and Anxiety in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa</a></h4>

              
                People with anorexia nervosa (AN) commonly exhibit elevated anxiety and atypical reward responsiveness. To examine multivariate neural patterns associated with reward and the impact of anxiety on reward, we analyzed fMRI data from a monetary reward task using representational similarity analysis, a multivariate approach that measures trial by trial consistency of neural responses. Twenty-five adolescent girls with AN and 22 mildly anxious controls lacking any history of AN were presented personalized anxiety-provoking or neutral words before receiving a reward, and neural response patterns in reward regions were analyzed. Consistent with our preregistered hypothesis, AN participants showed lower representational similarity than controls during neutral-word rewarded trials. Within groups, controls showed significant representational similarity in reward circuit regions including the left nucleus accumbens, left basolateral amygdala, and left medial orbitofrontal cortex, which were not observed in AN. Further, reward-related prefrontal cognitive control areas - left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - showed significant representational similarity in both groups, but a larger spatial extent in controls. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant between-group differences for the effects of anxiety-words on reward representational similarity, and representational similarity did not predict longitudinal symptom change over six months. Overall, the results demonstrate relatively inconsistent trial-by-trial responses to reward receipt in the neutral state in AN compared with controls in both reward circuit and cognitive control regions, but no significant differential effects of anxiety states on reward responses. These results add to dynamic understandings of reward processing in AN that have potential implications for planning and guiding reward-focused interventions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Taste and health are critical factors to be considered when choosing foods. Prioritizing healthiness over tastiness requires self-control. It has also been suggested that self-control is guided by cognitive control. We then hypothesized that neural mechanisms underlying healthy food choice are associated with both self-control and cognitive control. Human participants performed a food choice task and a working memory task during functional MRI scanning. Their degree of self-control was assessed behaviorally by the value discount of delayed monetary rewards in intertemporal choice. Prioritizing healthiness in food choice was associated with greater activity in the superior, dorsolateral, and medial prefrontal cortices. Importantly, the prefrontal activity was greater in individuals with smaller delay discounting (i.e. high self-control) who preferred a delayed larger reward to an immediate smaller reward in intertemporal choice. On the other hand, working memory activity did not show a correlation with delay discounting or food choice activity, which was further supported by supplementary results that analyzed data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in healthy food choice, which requires self-control, but not working memory, for maximization of reward attainments in a remote future.</span>

The impaired cortical function is believed to be a direct and immediate effect of pathologically patterned basal ganglia output, mediated to the cerebral cortex by way of the ventral motor thalamus. However, recent studies in humans with Parkinson’s disease and in animal models of the disease have provided strong evidence suggesting that the involvement of the cerebral cortex is much broader than merely serving as a passive conduit for subcortical disturbances. In the present review, we discuss Parkinson’s disease–related changes in frontal cortical motor regions, focusing on neuropathology, plasticity, changes in neurotransmission, and altered network interactions.

	<p>To ensure survival, the visual system must rapidly extract the most important elements from a large stream of information. This necessity clashes with the computational limitations of the human brain, so a strong early data reduction is required to efficiently process information in fast vision. A theoretical early vision model, recently developed to preserve maximum information using minimal computational resources, allows efficient image data reduction by extracting simplified sketches containing only optimally informative, salient features. Here, we investigate the neural substrates of this mechanism for optimal encoding of information, possibly located in early visual structures. We adopted a flicker adaptation paradigm, which has been demonstrated to specifically impair the contrast sensitivity of the magnocellular pathway. We compared flicker-induced contrast threshold changes in three different tasks. The results indicate that, after adapting to a uniform flickering field, thresholds for image discrimination using briefly presented sketches increase. Similar threshold elevations occur for motion discrimination, a task typically targeting the magnocellular system. Instead, contrast thresholds for orientation discrimination, a task typically targeting the parvocellular system, do not change with flicker adaptation. The computation performed by this early data reduction mechanism seems thus consistent with magnocellular processing.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning the visual recognition of morphologically complex verbs in Korean, a morphologically rich, agglutinative language with inherent polymorphemic characteristics. In an fMRI experiment with a lexical decision paradigm, we investigated whether verb inflection types (base, regular, and irregular) are processed through separate mechanisms or a single system. Furthermore, we explored the semantic influence in processing inflectional morphology by manipulating the semantic ambiguity (homonymous vs. unambiguous) of inflected verbs. The results showed equivalent activation levels in the left inferior frontal gyrus for both regular and irregular verbs, challenging the dichotomy between the two. Graded effects of verb regularity were observed in the occipitotemporal regions, with regular inflections eliciting increased activation in the fusiform and lingual gyri. In the middle occipital gyrus, homonyms showed decreased activation relative to that of unambiguous words, specifically for base and irregular forms. Furthermore, the angular gyrus exhibited significant modulation with all verb types, indicating a semantic influence during morphological processing. These findings support single-system theories and the connectionist framework, challenging the assumptions of purely orthographic morphological decomposition and dual-mechanism accounts. Furthermore, they provide evidence for a semantic influence during morphological processing, with differential reliance on semantic activation for regular and irregular inflections.</p>

	<p>Music is integrated into daily life when listening to it, playing it, and singing, uniquely modulating brain activity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), celebrated for its ecological validity, has been used to elucidate this music&amp;amp;ndash;brain interaction. This scoping review synthesizes 22 empirical studies using fNIRS to explore the intricate relationship between music and brain function. This synthesis of existing evidence reveals that diverse musical activities, such as listening to music, singing, and playing instruments, evoke unique brain responses influenced by individual traits and musical attributes. A further analysis identifies five key themes, including the effect of passive and active music experiences on relevant human brain areas, lateralization in music perception, individual variations in neural responses, neural synchronization in musical performance, and new insights fNIRS has revealed in these lines of research. While this review highlights the limited focus on specific brain regions and the lack of comparative analyses between musicians and non-musicians, it emphasizes the need for future research to investigate the complex interplay between music and the human brain.</p>

	<p>An efficient mode of evaluation for eye movements is the use of objective eye tracking systems combined with subjective tests (NSUCO or DEM), which are easily applicable across all age groups and in eye care clinical settings. The objective of this study was to characterize fixations during reading in two groups: a group of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDG, 24 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and a group of children with oculomotor anomalies but without NDD (OAG, 24 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years). The results obtained were compared with those from a control group (CG, 20 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years). Specifically, the outcomes obtained with two subjective score systems, the Northeastern State University College of Optometry&amp;amp;rsquo;s Oculomotor (NSUCO) test and the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test, were compared with the objective analysis obtained through a commercially available eye tracker (Tobii Eye X, Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden). Specialized analysis software, namely Clinical Eye Tracker 2020 (Thomson Software Solutions, Welham Green, UK), was used. It was found that children with NDD had impaired oculomotor skills. A higher number of regressions, more fixations, and longer durations of fixations appear to be characteristic signs of this population group. Additionally, children with NDD took longer to complete the DEM test, as well as exhibiting more errors. The use of objective videoculographic systems for eye tracking and subjective tests like the NSUCO or DEM are good tools to assess saccadic movements, allowing the detection of oculomotor abnormalities in children with NDD.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether spatial or temporal prediction of the tactile stimulus contributes to tactile sensitivity. To investigate the effect of spatial prediction on tactile sensitivity, electrical stimuli were provided for the digit nerve in one of five fingers, and advanced notice of the stimulating finger was provided before the stimulus in some trials but not in others. There was no significant effect of spatial prediction on the intensity at the perceptual threshold of the digit nerve stimulus. This indicates that spatial prediction of the tactile stimulus does not influence tactile sensitivity. To examine the effect of temporal prediction, an auditory warning cue was provided 0, 1, or 10 s before the electrical stimulus to the digit nerve. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 0 s warning cue. This indicates that temporal prediction enhances tactile sensitivity. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 10 s warning cue. This means that the contribution of temporal prediction to the tactile sensitivity is greater as the warning cue is closer to the time of the stimulus. This finding may be explained by a defense mechanism activated when humans predict that a tactile stimulus is coming soon.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Tinnitus involves the conscious awareness of a tonal or composite noise for which there is no identifiable corresponding external acoustic source. For many people, tinnitus is a disorder associated with symptoms of emotional distress, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic arousal, behavioural changes, and functional disability. Many symptoms can be addressed effectively using education or cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is no treatment that effectively reduces or alters tinnitus-related neurophysiological activity and thus the tinnitus percept. In this systematic review, we evaluated the effectiveness of neuromodulation therapies for tinnitus that explicitly target pathological synchronous neural activity. (2) Methods: Multiple databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of neuromodulation interventions for tinnitus in adults, with 24 trials included. The risk of bias was assessed, and where appropriate, meta-analyses were performed. (3) Results: Few trials used acoustic, vagal nerve, or transcranial alternating current stimulation, or bimodal stimulation techniques, with limited evidence of neuromodulation or clinical effectiveness. Multiple trials of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were identified, and a synthesis demonstrated a significant improvement in tinnitus symptom severity in favour of tDCS versus control, although heterogeneity was high. (4) Discussion: Neuromodulation for tinnitus is an emerging but promising field. Electrical stimulation techniques are particularly interesting, given recent advances in current flow modelling that can be applied to future studies.</p>

                <p>The role of gamma rhythm (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in visual processing is debated; stimuli like gratings and hue patches generate strong gamma, but many natural images do not. Could image gamma responses be predicted by approximating images as gratings or hue patches? Surprisingly, this question remains unanswered, since the joint dependence of gamma on multiple features is poorly understood. We recorded local field potentials and electrocorticogram from two female monkeys while presenting natural images and parametric stimuli varying along several feature dimensions. Gamma responses to different grating/hue features were separable, allowing for a multiplicative model based on individual features. By fitting a hue patch to the image around the receptive field, this simple model could predict gamma responses to chromatic images across scales with reasonably high accuracy. Our results provide a simple "baseline" model to predict gamma from local image properties, against which more complex models of natural vision can be tested.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain can result from nervous system injury and can persist in the absence of external stimuli. Although ongoing pain characterizes the disorder, in many individuals, the intensity of this ongoing pain fluctuates dramatically. Previously, it was identified that functional magnetic resonance imaging signal covariations between the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and spinal trigeminal nucleus are associated with moment-to-moment fluctuations in pain intensity in individuals with painful trigeminal neuropathy (PTN). Since this brainstem circuit is modulated by higher brain input, we sought to determine which cortical sites might be influencing this brainstem network during spontaneous fluctuations in pain intensity. Over 12&nbsp;min, we recorded the ongoing pain intensity in 24 PTN participants and classified them as fluctuating (<I>n</I> = 13) or stable (<I>n</I> = 11). Using a PAG seed, we identified connections between the PAG and emotional-affective sites such as the hippocampal and posterior cingulate cortices, the sensory-discriminative posterior insula, and cognitive-affective sites such as the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices that were altered dependent on spontaneous high and low pain intensity. Additionally, sliding-window functional connectivity analysis revealed that the dlPFC&ndash;PAG connection anticorrelated with perceived pain intensity over the entire 12&nbsp;min period. These findings reveal cortical systems underlying moment-to-moment changes in perceived pain in PTN, which likely cause dysregulation in the brainstem circuits previously identified, and consequently alter the appraisal of pain across time.</p>

                Fondrakö is the local wisdom of the Nias ethnic community and has two functions. First are the oral religious holy book teaching ancestors' values and philosophy. Second is the highest consensus institution of the traditional society formulating and making decisions on the socio-religious law to guarantee the order of the community. This paper explains that social differentiation has happened in the modern era; philosophical values of fondrakö remain to live up to this day and experience the proliferation of rites. The argumentation built through this paper is that primitive culture will not simply disappear in the modern community just because it experiences accommodation and the decrease of emotional intensity into new forms. Social laws of primitive religion are not always contradictory and can run parallel with civilization.

                Background A holistic architectural education is the culmination of learning knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, which eventually reflects in the quality of graduates. Even though different schools of thought have made various kinds of qualitative contributions towards the evolution of architectural education in India, it has largely been dominated by the quantitative and technical aspects of its regulating framework. Architects engage with the demanding contradictions between responsibilities of an ethical nature, the dynamic challenges of practice, and the intricacies of architectural imagination. The aesthetical and imaginative foundations of the field make it incumbent upon the architects to possess a balance of ecumenical proficiencies for accountability and personalization. The purpose of the study is to identify relevant attributes of Competency Based Education (CBE) that can be adopted for architectural education in India. Methods This research follows a narrative review approach and a descriptive-analytic method to broadly understand the attributes of CBE and its potential relevance to architectural education in India. 313 articles were searched on various search strings based on their relevance to the inquiry. 66 documents written in English language were included and appraised through the Scale of the Assessment for Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to avoid any risk of bias. The PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram has been used to report the findings of this narrative review Result The study identifies eight critical parameters of CBE with respect to its definitions, origins, transitions, regulatory environment, characteristics, approaches and implications on teaching-learning, frameworks and models of assessment; and challenges, which makes a case for the relevance of CBE for architectural education in India, which hasn’t been explored yet. Conclusion The broader expectations of ‘being competent’ can be addressed through a conscious adoption of strategies of relevant attributes of CBE which can encourage building attitudes and temperament for life-long learning

                Background: Edible films intended for food packaging have been produced from hydrocolloids, lipids, resins, and composites, including gelatin. Gelatin is known to have a good filming ability and has been suggested as an alternative to non-biodegradable plastics. Naturally active compounds incorporated into film packaging may not only protect the food product from oxidation and microbial contamination, but they may also alter the physicochemical properties of the film. Silver nanoparticles have been used in food packaging as active agents due to their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The addition may affect the characteristics of the packaging. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of the addition of silver nanoparticles on the physicochemical characteristics of edible film from Pangasius sp. skin gelatin. Methods: Mangrove extract of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza was used to synthesize silver into nanoparticle size. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with different concentrations (0, 2, 4 and 8%) were added into gelatin-based edible film. The edible films produced were observed for their physicochemical characteristics, including thickness, tensile strength, elongation, water vapour transmission, moisture content, pH, and colour. Results: AgNPs affected the colour of the fish-gelatin-based edible film, as an increased concentration of AgNPs resulted in a darker film. Nevertheless, the addition of AgNPs showed no significant effect on the thickness (145–216 µm), tensile strength (14.58–19.72 MPa), elongation (21.86–54.19%), water vapour transmission (30.91–42.55 g/m2/day), moisture content (9.57–11.16%) or pH (5.92–6.01) of the fish-gelatin-based edible film. Conclusions: The addition of AgNPs has no significant effect on gelatin-based edible film physicochemical properties except colour. Therefore, the incorporated edible film has the potential to be developed further.

                Foreign bodies (FB) in the aerodigestive tract are common, especially in children. The type of foreign body in the esophagus can vary and include magnets. A magnet that lodges in the esophagus should be extracted within 24 hours to prevent complications due to associated chemical reactions. In rural areas, there are several limitations to extracting FBs from the esophagus. We report a case of a magnetic FB that lodged in the esophagus of a three-year-old boy. The extraction was successfully done by esophagoscopy with the modification of a hook that was attached to the endoscope. This innovation may help physician all over the world, especially in rural areas. In the future, this innovation could be produced on an industrial scale.

                Background Fluid resuscitation is an essential component for sepsis treatment. Although several studies demonstrated that dynamic variables were more accurate than static variables for prediction of fluid responsiveness, fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic variables is not standard for treatment. The objectives were to determine the effects of dynamic inferior vena cava (IVC)-guided versus (vs.) static central venous pressure (CVP)-guided fluid resuscitation in septic patients on mortality; and others, i.e., resuscitation targets, shock duration, fluid and vasopressor amount, invasive respiratory support, length of stay and adverse events. Methods A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2016 and April 2020. Septic patients were stratified by acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) <25 or ≥25 and randomized by blocks of 2 and 4 to fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic IVC or static CVP. Results Of 124 patients enrolled, 62 were randomized to each group, and one of each was excluded from mortality analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The 30-day mortality rates between dynamic IVC vs. static CVP groups were not different (34.4% vs. 45.9%, p=0.196). Relative risk for 30-day mortality of dynamic IVC group was 0.8 (95%CI=0.5-1.2, p=0.201). Different outcomes were median (interquartile range) of shock duration (0.8 (0.4-1.6) vs. 1.5 (1.1-3.1) days, p=0.001) and norepinephrine (NE) dose (6.8 (3.9–17.8) vs. 16.1 (7.6–53.6) milligrams, p=0.008 and 0.1 (0.1-0.3) vs. 0.3 (0.1-0.8) milligram⋅kilogram−1, p=0.017). Others were not different. Conclusions Dynamic IVC-guided fluid resuscitation does not affect mortality of septic patients. However, this may reduce shock duration and NE dose, compared with static CVP guidance.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                <p>by Patrick Bryant, Frank Noé</p>

Structure prediction of protein complexes has improved significantly with AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-multimer (AFM), but only 60% of dimers are accurately predicted. Here, we learn a bias to the MSA representation that improves the predictions by performing gradient descent through the AFM network. We demonstrate the performance on seven difficult targets from CASP15 and increase the average MMscore to 0.76 compared to 0.63 with AFM. We evaluate the procedure on 487 protein complexes where AFM fails and obtain an increased success rate (MMscore>0.75) of 33% on these difficult targets. Our protocol, AFProfile, provides a way to direct predictions towards a defined target function guided by the MSA. We expect gradient descent over the MSA to be useful for different tasks.

                <p>by David Moreau, Kristina Wiebels</p>

Open science principles are revolutionizing the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of research. Meta-analysis has become a key technique for synthesizing data across studies in a principled way; however, its impact is contingent on adherence to open science practices. Here, we outline 9 quick tips for open meta-analyses, aimed at guiding researchers to maximize the reach and utility of their findings. We advocate for outlining preregistering clear protocols, opting for open tools and software, and the use of version control systems to ensure transparency and facilitate collaboration. We further emphasize the importance of reproducibility, for example, by sharing search syntax and analysis scripts, and discuss the benefits of planning for dynamic updating to enable living meta-analyses. We also recommend publication in open-access formats, as well as open data, open code, and open access publication. We close by encouraging active promotion of research findings to bridge the gap between complex syntheses and public discourse, and provide a detailed submission checklist to equip researchers, reviewers and journal editors with a structured approach to conducting and reporting open meta-analyses.

<i>Streptomyces</i> are renowned for their prolific production of specialized metabolites with applications in medicine and agriculture. These multicellular bacteria present a sophisticated developmental cycle and play a key role in soil ecology. Little is known about the impact of <i>Streptomyces</i> phage on bacterial physiology. In this study, we investigated the conditions governing the expression and production of “Samy,” a prophage found in <i>Streptomyces ambofaciens</i> ATCC 23877. This siphoprophage is produced simultaneously with the activation of other mobile genetic elements. Remarkably, the presence and production of Samy increases bacterial dispersal under in vitro stress conditions. Altogether, this study unveiled a new property of a bacteriophage infection in the context of multicellular aggregate dynamics.

Alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage regulation has been identified as a major means of gene expression regulation in metazoans. However, in fungi, its impact remains elusive as its study has thus far been restricted to model yeasts. Here, we first re-analyzed TSS-seq data to define genuine TSS clusters in 2 species of pathogenic <i>Cryptococcu</i>s. We identified 2 types of TSS clusters associated with specific DNA sequence motifs. Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in <i>Cryptococcus</i>, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. ChiP-Seq and DamID-Seq analyses suggest that at some loci, the role of Tur1 might be direct. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in <i>C</i>. <i>neoformans</i>. We demonstrated here that a <i>tur1Δ</i> mutant strain is more sensitive to superoxide stress and phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages than the wild-type (WT) strain.

                Background Stool consistency is an important outcome measure to evaluate in the investigation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is one of the most commonly used tools for evaluation of stool consistency. BSS ranges from 1-7 and each score is assigned to a given consistency of the feces. Self-reported characterizations can differ from an expert evaluation, and the reliability of BSS is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of BSS by comparing patient scores with expert scores. Methods Patients with inflammatory bowel disease collected stool samples throughout a 3-year follow-up. The stool´s consistency was evaluated with BSS by the patients and matched with an expert score. Agreement between patient and expert scores was assessed using Cohen’s kappa. Results BSS scores from 2280 fecal samples collected from 992 patients at up to five time points were included. When all samples were compared, there was good to substantial agreement between patient and expert scores (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.66-0.72). When the BSS scores were simplified and categorized as 1 (scores 1-2), 2 (scores 3-5) or 3 (scores 6-7), the agreement improved slightly (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.73-0.77). When the scores from the first sample per patient were compared, the experts were more likely to assign higher scores compared to the patient. The proportion of the lowest assigned scores (1-2) was 12.1% for patients and 8.1% for experts. Conclusions The agreement between patient and expert BSS scores is good to substantial, especially when the BSS scores are simplified into three categories.

<br/>
<p>Despite therapeutic suppression of relapses, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often experience subtle deterioration, which extends beyond the definition of “progression independent of relapsing activity.” We propose the concept of smouldering-associated-worsening (SAW), encompassing physical and cognitive symptoms, resulting from smouldering pathological processes, which remain unmet therapeutic targets. We provide a consensus-based framework of possible pathological substrates and manifestations of smouldering MS, and we discuss clinical, radiological, and serum/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for potentially monitoring SAW. Finally, we share considerations for optimizing disease surveillance and implications for clinical trials to promote the integration of smouldering MS into routine practice and future research efforts.

                Scheiblich et al. uncover a novel mechanism by which microglia use tunneling nanotubes to connect with α-syn- or tau-burdened neurons, enabling transfer of these proteins to microglia for clearance. Microglia donate mitochondria to restore neuronal health, shedding light on new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

                Wang et al. identify a high-risk LUAD component-associated tRF, tRF-Val-CAC-024, that binds to ALDOA and promotes its oligomerization, resulting in increased enzyme activity and enhanced aerobic glycolysis in LUAD. The therapeutic effect of inhibiting tRF-Val-CAC-024 using LNPs proved effective in a CDX model.

                Touarin et al. report NMR monitoring of Gal-1 binding to cell surface ligands. They find that interaction with the pre-BCR changes Gal-1 binding to specifically target α2,3-sialylated glycoconjugates at the pre-B cell surface. This targeting regulates pre-BCR signaling, a key checkpoint during B cell development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84532">Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition is essential for proper pancreatic endocrine specification and differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo pathway plays a central role in tissue development and homeostasis. However, the function of Hippo in pancreatic endocrine development remains obscure. Here, we generated novel conditional genetically engineered mouse models to examine the roles of Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in the development stages of endocrine specification and differentiation. While YAP1 protein was localized to the nuclei in bipotent progenitor cells, Neurogenin 3 expressing endocrine progenitors completely lost YAP1 expression. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that inactivation of YAP1 requires both an intact Hippo pathway and Neurogenin 3 protein. Gene deletion of Lats1 and 2 kinases (<i>Lats1&amp;2</i>) in endocrine progenitor cells of developing mouse pancreas using <i>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></i> blocked endocrine progenitor cell differentiation and specification, resulting in reduced islets size and a disorganized pancreas at birth. Loss of <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> in Neurogenin 3 expressing cells activated YAP1/TAZ transcriptional activity and recruited macrophages to the developing pancreas. These defects were rescued by deletion of <i>Yap1/Wwtr1</i> genes, suggesting that tight regulation of YAP1/TAZ by Hippo signaling is crucial for pancreatic endocrine specification. In contrast, deletion of <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> using β-cell-specific Ins1<i><sup>CreER</sup></i> resulted in a phenotypically normal pancreas, indicating that <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> are indispensable for differentiation of endocrine progenitors but not for that of β-cells. Our results demonstrate that loss of YAP1/TAZ expression in the pancreatic endocrine compartment is not a passive consequence of endocrine specification. Rather, Hippo pathway-mediated inhibition of YAP1/TAZ in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for endocrine specification and differentiation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96041">Spatiotemporal changes in Netrin/Dscam1 signaling dictate axonal projection direction in Drosophila small ventral lateral clock neurons</a></h4>

              
                Axon projection is a spatial- and temporal-specific process in which the growth cone receives environmental signals guiding axons to their final destination. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in axonal projection direction without well-defined landmarks remain elusive. Here, we present evidence showcasing the dynamic nature of axonal projections in <i>Drosophila</i>’s small ventral lateral clock neurons (s-LNvs). Our findings reveal that these axons undergo an initial vertical projection in the early larval stage, followed by a subsequent transition to a horizontal projection in the early-to-mid third instar larvae. The vertical projection of s-LNv axons correlates with mushroom body calyx expansion, while the s-LNv-expressed Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam1) interacts with Netrins to regulate the horizontal projection. During a specific temporal window, locally newborn dorsal clock neurons secrete Netrins, facilitating the transition of axonal projection direction in s-LNvs. Our study establishes a compelling in vivo model to probe the mechanisms of axonal projection direction switching in the absence of clear landmarks. These findings underscore the significance of dynamic local microenvironments in the complementary regulation of axonal projection direction transitions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89367">Temporally resolved early bone morphogenetic protein-driven transcriptional cascade during human amnion specification</a></h4>

              
                Amniogenesis, a process critical for continuation of healthy pregnancy, is triggered in a collection of pluripotent epiblast cells as the human embryo implants. Previous studies have established that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is a major driver of this lineage specifying process, but the downstream BMP-dependent transcriptional networks that lead to successful amniogenesis remain to be identified. This is, in part, due to the current lack of a robust and reproducible model system that enables mechanistic investigations exclusively into amniogenesis. Here, we developed an improved model of early amnion specification, using a human pluripotent stem cell-based platform in which the activation of BMP signaling is controlled and synchronous. Uniform amniogenesis is seen within 48 hr after BMP activation, and the resulting cells share transcriptomic characteristics with amnion cells of a gastrulating human embryo. Using detailed time-course transcriptomic analyses, we established a previously uncharacterized BMP-dependent amniotic transcriptional cascade, and identified markers that represent five distinct stages of amnion fate specification; the expression of selected markers was validated in early post-implantation macaque embryos. Moreover, a cohort of factors that could potentially control specific stages of amniogenesis was identified, including the transcription factor TFAP2A. Functionally, we determined that, once amniogenesis is triggered by the BMP pathway, TFAP2A controls the progression of amniogenesis. This work presents a temporally resolved transcriptomic resource for several previously uncharacterized amniogenesis states and demonstrates a critical intermediate role for TFAP2A during amnion fate specification.

                High-throughput vertebrate animal model systems for the study of patient-specific biology and new therapeutic approaches for aggressive brain tumors are currently lacking, and new approaches are urgently needed. Therefore, to build a patient-relevant in vivo model of human glioblastoma, we expressed common oncogenic variants including activated human EGFR<sup>vIII</sup> and PI3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup> under the control of the radial glial-specific promoter <i>her4.1</i> in syngeneic <i>tp53</i> loss-of-function mutant zebrafish. Robust tumor formation was observed prior to 45 days of life, and tumors had a gene expression signature similar to human glioblastoma of the mesenchymal subtype, with a strong inflammatory component. Within early stage tumor lesions, and in an in vivo and endogenous tumor microenvironment, we visualized infiltration of phagocytic cells, as well as internalization of tumor cells by <i>mpeg1.1</i>:EGFP+ microglia/macrophages, suggesting negative regulatory pressure by pro-inflammatory cell types on tumor growth at early stages of glioblastoma initiation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting of master inflammatory transcription factors <i>irf7</i> or <i>irf8</i> led to increased tumor formation in the primary context, while suppression of phagocyte activity led to enhanced tumor cell engraftment following transplantation into otherwise immune-competent zebrafish hosts. Altogether, we developed a genetically relevant model of aggressive human glioblastoma and harnessed the unique advantages of zebrafish including live imaging, high-throughput genetic and chemical manipulations to highlight important tumor-suppressive roles for the innate immune system on glioblastoma initiation, with important future opportunities for therapeutic discovery and optimizations.

                Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons modulate the processing of odor information. However, less is known about how PV interneurons dynamically remodel neural circuit responses in the olfactory bulb (OB) and its physiological significance. This study showed that a reinforced odor discrimination task up-regulated the activity of ErbB4 kinase in mouse OB. ErbB4 knock-out in the OB impaired dishabituation of odor responses and discrimination of complex odors, whereas odor memory or adaptation had no alteration in mice. RNAscope analysis demonstrated that ErbB4-positive neurons are localized throughout the OB, whereas within the internal and external plexiform layers, ErbB4 mRNA are largely expressed in PV-positive interneurons. ErbB4 knock-out in PV interneurons disrupted odor-evoked responses of mitral/tufted cells, and led to increased power in the ongoing local field potential in awake mice. We also found a decrease in the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents and deficits in stimulus-evoked recurrent and lateral inhibition onto mitral cells, suggesting broad impairments in inhibitory circuit following PV-ErbB4 loss. Similarly, ErbB4 ablation in OB PV interneurons disrupted olfactory discrimination and dishabituation in mice. These findings provide novel insights into the role of PV-ErbB4 signaling in inhibitory circuit plasticity, ongoing oscillations, and OB output, which underlies normal olfactory behaviors.

                Cortical layer 6 (L6) neurons uniquely respond to orexin, a neuropeptide influencing arousal and emotion. We show that Drd1a-Cre+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex are selectively sensitive to orexin and regulate prefrontal network activation in vitro and in vivo. Chronically silencing these neurons impairs orexin-induced prefrontal activation and reduces anxiety-like behaviour, indicating that orexin-responsive L6 neurons modulate emotional states and may be a substrate for anxiety regulation.

This study first utilized the deformation-based morphometry analysis to identify structural abnormalities, which were used as the seed region to investigate the functional connectivity with the whole brain. Next, a correlation analysis was performed between the altered imaging findings and neuropsychiatry assessments. Finally, the potential role of structural-functional abnormalities in the diagnosis of epilepsy was further explored by using mediation analysis. Compared with healthy controls (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 28), the area of reduced structural volume was concentrated in the bilateral cerebellum, right thalamus, and right middle cingulate cortex, with frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes also affected in early-onset focal epilepsy (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 26), while late-onset patients (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31) displayed cerebellar, thalamic, and cingulate atrophy. Furthermore, correlation analyses suggest an association between structural abnormalities and cognitive assessments. Dysfunctional connectivity in the cerebellum, cingulate cortex, and frontal gyrus partially mediates the relationship between structural abnormalities and the diagnosis of early-onset focal epilepsy. This study identified structural and functional abnormalities in early-onset and late-onset focal epilepsy and explored characters in cognitive performance. Structural-functional coupling may play a potential role in the diagnosis of epilepsy.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) is a critical site for understanding the neural correlates of affect and emotion. While the activity of the sgACC is functionally homogenous, it is comprised of multiple Brodmann Areas (BAs) that possess different cytoarchitectures. In some sgACC BAs, Layer 5 is sublaminated into L5a and L5b which has implications for its projection targets. To understand how the transcriptional profile differs between the BAs, layers, and sublayers of human sgACC, we collected layer strips using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing. We found no significant differences in transcript expression in these specific cortical layers between BAs within the sgACC. In contrast, we identified striking differences between Layers 3 and 5a or 5b that were concordant across sgACC BAs. We found that sublayers 5a and 5b were transcriptionally similar. Pathway analyses of L3 and L5 revealed overlapping biological processes related to synaptic function. However, L3 was enriched for pathways related to cell-to-cell junction and dendritic spines whereas L5 was enriched for pathways related to brain development and presynaptic function, indicating potential functional differences across layers. Our study provides important insight into normative transcriptional features of the sgACC.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>What is the function of auditory hemispheric asymmetry? We propose that the identification of sound sources relies on the asymmetric processing of two complementary and perceptually relevant acoustic invariants: actions and objects. In a large dataset of environmental sounds, we observed that temporal and spectral modulations display only weak covariation. We then synthesized auditory stimuli by simulating various actions (frictions) occurring on different objects (solid surfaces). Behaviorally, discrimination of actions relies on temporal modulations, while discrimination of objects relies on spectral modulations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed that actions and objects are decoded in the left and right hemispheres, respectively, in bilateral superior temporal and left inferior frontal regions. This asymmetry reflects a generic differential processing—through differential neural sensitivity to temporal and spectral modulations present in environmental sounds—that supports the efficient categorization of actions and objects. These results support an ecologically valid framework of the functional role of auditory brain asymmetry.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease. Previous evidence suggests that postmenopausal females are at heightened risk for developing dementia. However, the potential effects of gender (i.e. postmenopausal female) on functional connectivity density (FCD) in individuals with SCD are not well understood. A total of 56 healthy controls and 57 subjects with SCD were included. The short-range and long-range FCD (srFCD and lrFCD) mapping of each participant was calculated. The interactive effect of gender × diagnosis on the FCD was explored by two-way analysis of variance. The interaction effect of gender × diagnosis on lrFCD was primarily in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). The older males with SCD exhibited significantly enhanced lrFCD in the right MFG relative to other subgroups. The lrFCD of the right MFG was positively associated with cognitive performance in older females with SCD. Cognition-related functional terms were significantly related to the right MFG. Decreased lrFCD of the right MFG in cognitively normal older women may explain why postmenopausal females have a higher risk for progression to dementia than men. Furthermore, this altered pattern could be applied to identify individuals with a high risk for dementia.</span>

Currently, its underlying neurogenetic mechanism remains unclear. Here, this study aimed to investigate the association between cortical thickness (CTh) and genetic phenotypes in BA. We conducted a systematic search in five databases and extracted gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Meta-analysis of 10 studies (343 addicted individuals and 355 controls) revealed that the BA group showed thinner CTh in the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, orbital-frontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.005). Meta-regression showed that the CTh in the precuneus and postcentral gyrus were negatively associated with the addiction severity (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0005). More importantly, the CTh phenotype of BA was spatially correlated with the expression of 12 genes (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05), and the dopamine D2 receptor had the highest correlation (rho = 0.55). Gene enrichment analysis further revealed that the 12 genes were involved in the biological processes of behavior regulation and response to stimulus (FDR &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the thinner CTh in cognitive control-related brain areas in BA, which could be associated with the expression of genes involving dopamine metabolism and behavior regulation.</span>

To examine the discrepancy between self-rated and observer-rated depression severity, self- and observer-ratings discrepancy (SOD) was defined, and the higher and lower SOD groups were selected from depressed patients as participants showing extreme deviation. Resting-state functional MRI analysis was performed to examine regions with significant differences in functional connectivity in the two groups. The results showed that, in the higher SOD group compared to the lower SOD group, there was increased functional connectivity between the frontal pole and precuneus, both of which are subregions of the default mode network that have been reported to be associated with ruminative and self-referential thinking. These results provide insight into the association of brain circuitry with discrepancies between self- and observer-rated depression severity and may lead to more treatment-oriented diagnostic reclassification in the future.</span>

	<p>Background: Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are chronic skin diseases found all over the world that cause a lot of suffering to patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: whether people suffering from psoriasis and AD have greater problems with recognizing emotions, the effectiveness of attention and memory processes, and whether they use different strategies of coping with stress than healthy people. Methods: This study involved 90 patients, including 30 patients with psoriasis, 30 patients with AD and 30 healthy patients, aged 21 to 63 years, including 54 women and 36 men. This study used a battery of the CANTAB Cognitive Tests, Mini-COPE Questionnaire Inventory, Toronto Alexithymia Scale TAS Questionnaire, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and Eczema Area and Severity Index. Results: People with psoriasis and AD had higher total scores on the alexithymia scale and had greater difficulty in identifying and verbalizing emotions. People with psoriasis and AD are less likely to choose the correct stimulus and achieve a shorter length of the sequence that should be remembered. Psoriasis patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to use the strategy of a sense of humor in stressful situations. AD patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to use strategies of operative thinking, denial and self-blame, and the strategy of seeking instrumental support is used more often. Conclusions: Patients with psoriasis and AD require a holistic approach; in addition to dermatological treatment, psychological support, psychotherapeutic support and possible psychiatric treatment are recommended.</p>

	<p>To investigate the reliability of L2 listening tests and explore potential factors affecting the reliability, a reliability generalization (RG) meta-analysis was conducted in the present study. A total number of 122 alpha coefficients of L2 listening tests from 92 published articles were collected and submitted to a linear mixed effects RG analysis. The papers were coded based on a coding scheme consisting of 16 variables classified into three categories: study features, test features, and statistical results. The results showed an average reliability of 0.818 (95% CI: 0.803 to 0.833), with 40% of reliability estimates falling below the lower bound of CI. The presence of publication bias and heterogeneity was found in the reliability of L2 listening tests, indicating that low reliability coefficients were likely omitted from some published studies. In addition, two factors predicting the reliability of L2 listening tests were the number of items and test type (standardized and researcher- or teacher-designed tests). The study also found that reliability is not a moderator of the relationship between L2 listening scores and theoretically relevant constructs. Reliability induction was identified in reporting the reliability of L2 listening tests, too. Implications for researchers and teachers are discussed.</p>

	<p>Objective: to identify advanced or &amp;amp;ldquo;so-called inoperable&amp;amp;rdquo; cases of tympanojugular paragangliomas (PGLs) and analyze how each case is surgically managed and followed afterward. Study Design: a retrospective case series study. Methods: Out of 262 type C and D TJPs and more than 10 cases of advanced or so-called inoperable cases, files of 6 patients with a diagnosis of advanced tympanojugular PGLs who were referred to an otology and skull-base center between 1996 and 2021 were reviewed to analyze management and surgical outcomes. The criteria for choosing these cases involve having one or more of the following features: (1) a large-sized tumor; (2) a single ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA); (3) involvement of the vertebral artery; (4) a considerable involvement of the ICA; (5) an extension to the clivus, foramen magnum, and cavernous sinus; (6) large intradural involvement (IDE); and (7) bilateral or multiple PGLs. Results: The age range at presentation was 25&amp;amp;ndash;43 years old, with a mean of 40.5 years: two females and four males. The presenting symptoms were glossal atrophy, hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus, dysphonia, shoulder weakness, and diplopia. The modified Infratemporal Fossa Approach (ITFA) with a transcondylar&amp;amp;ndash;transtubercular extension is the principal approach in most cases, with additional approaches being used accordingly. Conclusions: The contemporary introduction of carotid artery stenting with the direct and indirect embolization of PGLs has made it possible to operate on many cases, which was otherwise considered impossible to treat surgically. Generally, the key is to stage the removal of the tumor in multiple stages during the management of complex PGLs to decrease surgical morbidities. A crucial aspect is to centralize the treatment of PGLs in referral centers with experienced surgeons who are trained to plan the stages and manage possible surgical complications.</p>

	<p>Long COVID-19 is characterized by ongoing symptoms or prolonged or long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 contraction which persist beyond 4 weeks from the initial onset of symptoms. Gender and duration of hospitalization (DH) are key risk factors for developing long COVID-19 syndrome, but their impact and interplay need further study. This research involved 996 long COVID-19 patients, and we compared the levels of general psychopathology, depression, agitated depression, anxiety, and medication use between hospitalized and non-hospitalized males and females. In the hospitalized patients, multivariate regressions assessed the impact of gender, DH, and the interaction of these variables. The females had higher levels of long COVID-19 symptoms, psychotropic drug use, depression, anxiety, and general psychopathology than the males. The non-hospitalized females exhibited more severe agitated depression than the non-hospitalized males. In females, DH was more strongly correlated with the number of psychotropic medications used during long COVID-19. A negative correlation was found between DH and severity of agitated depression in the female patients only. These results highlight that the gender-specific relationship between DH and agitated depression severity should be explored further.</p>

	<p>A new dyslexia screening test for Italian, Tiltan-IT, is presented. The test was developed based on an integrated dual-route model of reading, which describes in detail specific mechanisms underpinning early visual processes as well as the lexical and the sublexical routes. The principle according to which the test was developed is that each dyslexia type is manifested in different kinds of errors and in different kinds of stimuli, and we therefore included stimuli sensitive to each dyslexia type in the test. Tiltan-IT is a reading aloud test that includes word, nonword, and word pair lists. The test was administered to 618 Italian-speaking children (2nd&amp;amp;ndash;8th grade). Each error produced by the children was classified through the coding scheme developed to detect the different types of dyslexias described by the reading model. The Tiltan-IT was able to identify 110 children with dyslexia. The identified dyslexia types included letter position dyslexia, attentional dyslexia, letter identity dyslexia, surface dyslexia, vowel dyslexia, consonant conversion dyslexia, multi-letter phonological dyslexia, voicing dyslexia. The results confirm that the selection of items in the Tiltan-IT enabled the detection of the wide variety of dyslexias in Italian, some of them for the first time, adding evidence for the cross-linguistic validity of multiple types of developmental dyslexias and for the dual-route model of reading.</p>

	<p>The insula is often considered the fifth lobe of the brain and is increasingly recognized as one of the most connected regions in the brain, with widespread connections to cortical and subcortical structures. As a follow-up to our previous tractography work, we investigated the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) profiles of insular subregions and assessed their concordance with structural connectivity. We used the CONN toolbox to analyze the rsFC of the same 19 insular regions of interest (ROIs) we used in our prior tractography work and regrouped them into six subregions based on their connectivity pattern similarity. Our analysis of 50 healthy participants confirms the known broad connectivity of the insula and shows novel and specific whole-brain and intra-connectivity patterns of insular subregions. By examining such subregions, our findings provide a more detailed pattern of connectivity than prior studies that may prove useful for comparison between patients.</p>

	<p>Pain is a complex response to noxious stimuli. Upon detection of the nociceptive stimulus by first-order neurons or nociceptors, an action potential ascends to the spinal dorsal horn, a crucial site for synapsing with second-order neurons. These second-order neurons carry the nociceptive stimulus to supraspinal regions, notably the thalamus. Although extensive research has focused on spinal-level nociceptive mechanisms (e.g., neurotransmitters, receptors, and glial cells), the thalamus is still poorly elucidated. The role of the thalamus in relaying sensory and motor responses to the cortex is well known. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms in the synapse between the second-order and third-order neurons that transmit this impulse to the somatosensory cortex, where the response is processed and interpreted as pain, is still lacking. Thus, this review investigated the thalamus&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in transmitting nociceptive impulses. Current evidence indicates the involvement of the neurotransmitters glutamate and serotonin, along with NMDA, P2X4, TLR4, FGR, and NLRP3 receptors, as well as signaling pathways including ERK, P38, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, cytokines, and glial cells at nociceptive synapses within the thalamus.</p>

                <p>Many neurons including vasopressin (VP) magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) generate afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) during spiking to slow firing, a phenomenon known as spike frequency adaptation. The AHP is underlain by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents, and while slow component (sAHP) features are well described, its mechanism remains poorly understood. Previous work demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is a primary source of sAHP activation in SON oxytocin neurons, but no obvious channel coupling was described for VP neurons. Given this, we tested the possibility of an intracellular source of sAHP activation, namely, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling organelles endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in male and female Wistar rats. We demonstrate that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion greatly inhibits sAHPs without a corresponding decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Caffeine sensitized AHP activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast to ER, disabling mitochondria with CCCP or blocking mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporters (MCUs) enhanced sAHP amplitude and duration, implicating mitochondria as a vital buffer for sAHP-activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Block of mitochondria Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via triphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>) failed to affect sAHPs, indicating that mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not contribute to sAHP activation. Together, our results suggests that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activates sAHPs and mitochondria shape the spatiotemporal trajectory of the sAHP via Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in VP neurons. Overall, this implicates organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and specifically ER&ndash;mitochondria-associated membrane contacts, as an important site of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain activity that regulates sAHP signaling pathways. Thus, this site plays a major role in influencing VP firing activity and systemic hormonal release.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e0195242024?rss=1">Neural Representation of Valenced and Generic Probability and Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>Representing the probability and uncertainty of outcomes facilitates adaptive behavior by allowing organisms to prepare in advance and devote attention to relevant events. Probability and uncertainty are often studied only for valenced (appetitive or aversive) outcomes, raising the question of whether the identified neural machinery also processes the probability and uncertainty of motivationally neutral outcomes. Here, we aimed to dissociate valenced from valence-independent (i.e., generic) probability (<I>p</I>; maximum at <I>p</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) and uncertainty (maximum at <I>p</I> = 0.5) signals using human neuroimaging. In a Pavlovian task (<I>n</I> = 41; 19 females), different cues predicted appetitive, aversive, or neutral liquids with different probabilities (<I>p</I> = 0, <I>p</I> = 0.5, <I>p</I> = 1). Cue-elicited motor responses accelerated, and pupil sizes increased primarily for cues that predicted valenced liquids with higher probability. For neutral liquids, uncertainty rather than probability tended to accelerate cue-induced responding and decrease pupil size. At the neural level, generic uncertainty signals were limited to the occipital cortex, while generic probability also activated the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These generic probability and uncertainty signals contrasted with cue-induced responses that only encoded the probability and uncertainty of valenced liquids in medial prefrontal, insular, and occipital cortices. Our findings show a behavioral and neural dissociation of generic and valenced signals. Thus, some parts of the brain keep track of motivational charge while others do not, highlighting the need and usefulness of characterizing the exact nature of learned representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e0261242024?rss=1">{beta}-arrestins Are Scaffolding Proteins Required for Shh-Mediated Axon Guidance</a></h4>

              
                <p>During nervous system development, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) guides developing commissural axons toward the floor plate of the spinal cord. To guide axons, Shh binds to its receptor Boc and activates downstream effectors such as Smoothened (Smo) and Src family kinases (SFKs). SFK activation requires Smo activity and is also required for Shh-mediated axon guidance. Here we report that &beta;-arrestin1 and &beta;-arrestin2 (&beta;-arrestins) serve as scaffolding proteins that link Smo and SFKs in Shh-mediated axon guidance. We found that &beta;-arrestins are expressed in rat commissural neurons. We also found that Smo, &beta;-arrestins, and SFKs form a tripartite complex, with the complex formation dependent on &beta;-arrestins. &beta;-arrestin knockdown blocked the Shh-mediated increase in Src phosphorylation, demonstrating that &beta;-arrestins are required to activate Src kinase downstream of Shh. &beta;-arrestin knockdown also led to the loss of Shh-mediated attraction of rat commissural axons in axon turning assays. Expression of two different dominant-negative &beta;-arrestins, &beta;-arrestin1 V53D which blocks the internalization of Smo and &beta;-arrestin1 P91G-P121E which blocks its interaction with SFKs, also led to the loss of Shh-mediated attraction of commissural axons. In vivo, the expression of these dominant-negative &beta;-arrestins caused defects in commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord of chick embryos of mixed sexes. Thus we show that &beta;-arrestins are essential scaffolding proteins that connect Smo to SFKs and are required for Shh-mediated axon guidance.</p>

                <p>Music, like spoken language, is often characterized by hierarchically organized structure. Previous experiments have shown neural tracking of notes and beats, but little work touches on the more abstract question: how does the brain establish high-level musical structures in real time? We presented Bach chorales to participants (20 females and 9 males) undergoing electroencephalogram (EEG) recording to investigate how the brain tracks musical phrases. We removed the main temporal cues to phrasal structures, so that listeners could only rely on harmonic information to parse a continuous musical stream. Phrasal structures were disrupted by locally or globally reversing the harmonic progression, so that our observations on the original music could be controlled and compared. We first replicated the findings on neural tracking of musical notes and beats, substantiating the positive correlation between musical training and neural tracking. Critically, we discovered a neural signature in the frequency range ~0.1&nbsp;Hz (modulations of EEG power) that reliably tracks musical phrasal structure. Next, we developed an approach to quantify the phrasal phase precession of the EEG power, revealing that phrase tracking is indeed an operation of active segmentation involving predictive processes. We demonstrate that the brain establishes complex musical structures online over long timescales (&gt;5&nbsp;s) and actively segments continuous music streams in a manner comparable to language processing. These two neural signatures, phrase tracking and phrasal phase precession, provide new conceptual and technical tools to study the processes underpinning high-level structure building using noninvasive recording techniques.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e1587232024?rss=1">Cell- and Pathway-Specific Disruptions in the Accumbens of Fragile X Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The mesocorticolimbic system, which includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), is essential for regulating socioemotional behaviors. We employed optogenetics to compare the functional properties of the BLA-&gt;NAcC, PFC-&gt;NAcC, and reciprocal PFCBLA pathways in <I>Fmr1&ndash;/y::Drd1a-tdTomato</I> male mice. In FXS mice, the PFCBLA reciprocal pathway was unaffected, while significant synaptic modifications occurred in the BLA/PFC-&gt;NAcC pathways. We observed distinct changes in D1 striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and separate modifications in D2 SPNs. In FXS mice, the BLA/PFC-&gt;NAcC-D2 SPN pathways demonstrated heightened synaptic strength. Focusing on the BLA-&gt;NAcC pathway, linked to autistic symptoms, we found increased AMPAR and NMDAR currents and elevated spine density in D2 SPNs. Conversely, the amplified firing probability of BLA-&gt;NAcC-D1 SPNs was not accompanied by increased synaptic strength, AMPAR and NMDAR currents, or spine density. These pathway-specific alterations resulted in an overall enhancement of excitatory-to-spike coupling, a physiologically relevant index of how efficiently excitatory inputs drive neuronal firing, in both BLA-&gt;NAcC-D1 and BLA-&gt;NAcC-D2 pathways. Finally, the absence of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) led to impaired long-term depression specifically in BLA-&gt;D1 SPNs. These distinct alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity within circuits targeting the NAcC highlight the potential role of postsynaptic mechanisms in selected SPNs in the observed circuit-level changes. This research underscores the heightened vulnerability of the NAcC in the context of FMRP deficiency, emphasizing its pivotal role in the pathophysiology of FXS.</p>

                <p>Magnetogenetics was developed to remotely control genetically targeted neurons. A variant of magnetogenetics uses magnetic fields to activate transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels when coupled with ferritin. Stimulation with static or RF magnetic fields of neurons expressing these channels induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and modulates behavior. However, the validity of ferritin-based magnetogenetics has been questioned due to controversies surrounding the underlying mechanisms and deficits in reproducibility. Here, we validated the magnetogenetic approach Ferritin-iron Redistribution to Ion Channels (FeRIC) using electrophysiological (Ephys) and imaging techniques. Previously, interference from RF stimulation rendered patch-clamp recordings inaccessible for magnetogenetics. We solved this limitation for FeRIC, and we studied the bioelectrical properties of neurons expressing TRPV4 (nonselective cation channel) and transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A; chloride-permeable channel) coupled to ferritin (FeRIC channels) under RF stimulation. We used cultured neurons obtained from the rat hippocampus of either sex. We show that RF decreases the membrane resistance (Rm) and depolarizes the membrane potential in neurons expressing TRPV4<sup>FeRIC</sup>. RF does not directly trigger action potential firing but increases the neuronal basal spiking frequency. In neurons expressing TMEM16A<sup>FeRIC</sup>, RF decreases the Rm, hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, and decreases the spiking frequency. Additionally, we corroborated the previously described biochemical mechanism responsible for RF-induced activation of ferritin-coupled ion channels. We solved an enduring problem for ferritin-based magnetogenetics, obtaining direct Ephys evidence of RF-induced activation of ferritin-coupled ion channels. We found that RF does not yield instantaneous changes in neuronal membrane potentials. Instead, RF produces responses that are long-lasting and moderate, but effective in controlling the bioelectrical properties of neurons.</p>

                <p>Linking sensory input and its consequences is a fundamental brain operation. During behavior, the neural activity of neocortical and limbic systems often reflects dynamic combinations of sensory and task-dependent variables, and these "mixed representations" are suggested to be important for perception, learning, and plasticity. However, the extent to which such integrative computations might occur outside of the forebrain is less clear. Here, we conduct cellular-resolution two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the superficial "shell" layers of the inferior colliculus (IC), as head-fixed mice of either sex perform a reward-based psychometric auditory task. We find that the activity of individual shell IC neurons jointly reflects auditory cues, mice's actions, and behavioral trial outcomes, such that trajectories of neural population activity diverge depending on mice's behavioral choice. Consequently, simple classifier models trained on shell IC neuron activity can predict trial-by-trial outcomes, even when training data are restricted to neural activity occurring prior to mice's instrumental actions. Thus, in behaving mice, auditory midbrain neurons transmit a population code that reflects a joint representation of sound, actions, and task-dependent variables.</p>

                <p>It has been suggested that, prior to a saccade, visual neurons predictively respond to stimuli that will fall in their receptive fields after completion of the saccade. This saccadic remapping process is thought to compensate for the shift of the visual world across the retina caused by eye movements. To map the timing of this predictive process in the brain, we recorded neural activity using electroencephalography during a saccade task. Human participants (male and female) made saccades between two fixation points while covertly attending to oriented gratings briefly presented at various locations on the screen. Data recorded during trials in which participants maintained fixation were used to train classifiers on stimuli in different positions. Subsequently, data collected during saccade trials were used to test for the presence of remapped stimulus information at the post-saccadic retinotopic location in the peri-saccadic period, providing unique insight into when remapped information becomes available. We found that the stimulus could be decoded at the remapped location ~180&nbsp;ms post-stimulus onset, but only when the stimulus was presented 100&ndash;200&nbsp;ms before saccade onset. Within this range, we found that the timing of remapping was dictated by stimulus onset rather than saccade onset. We conclude that presenting the stimulus immediately before the saccade allows for optimal integration of the corollary discharge signal with the incoming peripheral visual information, resulting in a remapping of activation to the relevant post-saccadic retinotopic neurons.</p>

                <p>Light plays an essential role in a variety of physiological processes, including vision, mood, and glucose homeostasis. However, the intricate relationship between light and an animal's feeding behavior has remained elusive. Here, we found that light exposure suppresses food intake, whereas darkness amplifies it in male mice. Interestingly, this phenomenon extends its reach to diurnal male Nile grass rats and healthy humans. We further show that lateral habenula (LHb) neurons in mice respond to light exposure, which in turn activates 5-HT neurons in the dorsal Raphe nucleus (DRN). Activation of the LHb-&gt;5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> circuit in mice blunts darkness-induced hyperphagia, while inhibition of the circuit prevents light-induced anorexia. Together, we discovered a light-responsive neural circuit that relays the environmental light signals to regulate feeding behavior in mice.</p>

                <p>Completely ignoring a salient distractor presented concurrently with a target is difficult, and sometimes attention is involuntarily attracted to the distractor's location (attentional capture). Employing the N2ac component as a marker of attention allocation toward sounds, in this study we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of auditory attention across two experiments. Human participants (male and female) performed an auditory search task, where the target was accompanied by a distractor in two-third of the trials. For a distractor more salient than the target (Experiment 1), we observe not only a distractor N2ac (indicating attentional capture) but the full chain of attentional dynamics implied by the notion of attentional capture, namely, (1) the distractor captures attention before the target is attended, (2) allocation of attention to the target is delayed by distractor presence, and (3) the target is attended after the distractor. Conversely, for a distractor less salient than the target (Experiment 2), although responses were delayed, no attentional capture was observed. Together, these findings reveal two types of spatial attentional dynamics in the auditory modality (distraction with and without attentional capture).</p>

                <p>Mature vertebrates maintain posture using vestibulospinal neurons that transform sensed instability into reflexive commands to spinal motor circuits. Postural stability improves across development. However, due to the complexity of terrestrial locomotion, vestibulospinal contributions to postural refinement in early life remain unexplored. Here we leveraged the relative simplicity of underwater locomotion to quantify the postural consequences of losing vestibulospinal neurons during development in larval zebrafish of undifferentiated sex. By comparing posture at two timepoints, we discovered that later lesions of vestibulospinal neurons led to greater instability. Analysis of thousands of individual swim bouts revealed that lesions disrupted movement timing and corrective reflexes without impacting swim kinematics, and that this effect was particularly strong in older larvae. Using a generative model of swimming, we showed how these disruptions could account for the increased postural variability at both timepoints. Finally, late lesions disrupted the fin/trunk coordination observed in older larvae, linking vestibulospinal neurons to postural control schemes used to navigate in depth. Since later lesions were considerably more disruptive to postural stability, we conclude that vestibulospinal contributions to balance increase as larvae mature. Vestibulospinal neurons are highly conserved across vertebrates; we therefore propose that they are a substrate for developmental improvements to postural control.</p>

                Background Public tenders are vital for a country’s GDP and citizens’ quality of life, enabling public administration to achieve various goals. Developing and developed countries allocate over 10% of their GDP to public procurement. This highlights the significant societal support public tenders can provide, making it important to consider how they can further benefit society. Policy and implications Public procurement can achieve policy objectives and benefit society by selecting tenders based on criteria beyond price, such as economic advantage and social benefits. This approach, endorsed by EU directives since 2014, encourages innovation and socially responsible practices. Contracting authorities in the EU can use social, environmental, and qualitative criteria to determine the most advantageous offers. Poland’s Public Procurement Law (PPL) allows contract award criteria based on quality and price, including social aspects. Contracting authorities can specify criteria like employing marginalized groups, though these criteria often face scrutiny and legal challenges. Non-price criteria aim to enhance competition and achieve social, environmental, and economic goals. Recommendations EU and Polish laws permit and encourage using social aspects as contract award criteria in public procurement. However, contracting authorities must analyze priorities, risk balancing, time constraints, and departmental coordination to effectively implement these criteria. This approach can improve the social situation and support specific groups. Conclusions Public procurement significantly influences a country’s economy and quality of life, with EU and Polish laws allowing social criteria in contract awards. Directive 2014/24/EU supports tenders based on economic and social benefits. Poland’s PPL aligns with this, emphasizing marginalized group employment. Effective implementation fosters job creation, social integration, and improved living standards.

                Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasms that exhibit a wide array of histological heterogeneities. Most patients presenting with SGCs are asymptomatic, as they are typically slow-growing and localized. Primary surgical resection is the cornerstone treatment for SGCs and radiotherapy is performed in selected cases. There is no consensus on concrete standard post-operative guidelines. Patients are followed-up for years, however an agreed duration of follow-up is less elucidated in the literature present on the subject. Distant metastases are the primary cause of treatment failure. Post-operative diagnostic evidence of disease recurrence or distant metastases is heavily guided by radiological examinations. Patients with SGCs have better outcomes with a well-structured and lengthy follow-up plan. This review aims to suggest an appropriate follow-up duration and radiological modalities used post-operatively for SGC patients.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Sui’s hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Background Many behavioural, pharmacological, and metabolic studies in mice require fasting, yet the possibility of fasting-induced torpor affecting data is rarely considered. Torpor is a state characterised by depressed metabolism and profound alterations in physiology and behaviour. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a chronic food restriction paradigm, common in behavioural studies, was sufficient to induce torpor in mice. Methods Mice were food restricted to ~85-90% of their bodyweight, as is typically done, and monitored using continuous thermal imaging. Results We observed that body temperature significantly decreased over days of food restriction, and it was significantly related to the drop in bodyweight (r2=0.8989, p<0.0001). All mice reliably entered torpor daily from day 8 of food restriction which coincided with bodyweight stabilisation at ~85%. We found a strong positive relationship between the magnitude of the decrease of bodyweight and the proportion of mice entering torpor each day (r2=0.8715, p<0.0001). Conclusions Overall, we found that torpor is readily induced in response to food restriction. Considering that hunger is frequently used as a motivational drive in behavioural tasks, it is likely that torpor occurrence is common in such studies, while remaining undetected and unaccounted for. Due to the profound effect of torpor on physiology, it is possible that torpor induction may be confounding subsequent data and represents an important source of variation. We recommend that body temperature is always monitored noninvasively in studies where food restriction is employed, to determine when torpor is occurring, and that torpor history is appropriately controlled for within and across experimental groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-829/v1?src=rss">The effect of food timing on torpor propensity and characteristics in laboratory mice during a common food restriction paradigm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Many behavioural, pharmacological, and metabolic studies in mice require fasting, yet the possibility of fasting-induced torpor affecting the data is rarely considered. Torpor is a state characterised by depressed metabolism and profound alterations to physiology and behaviour. In this study we aimed to determine how the effects of torpor on experimental outcomes could be mitigated. Methods To this end, timing and characteristics of fasting-induced torpor in response to feeding in the morning versus feeding in the night were compared using non-invasive monitoring of peripheral body temperature. Results Night-fed mice entered significantly more torpor bouts per day compared to morning-fed mice (Morning: 2.79±0.197 (mean ± SEM); Night: 4.79±0.533 (mean ± SEM); p=0.0125), but these bouts were shorter on average by ~1.5h. Latency to the first torpor bout following feeding tended to be shorter during night feeding (Morning: 9.57±0.8h (mean ± SEM); Night: 6.66±1.2h (mean ± SEM); p=0.0928). Moreover, torpor bouts typically occurred during the dark phase in the morning-fed group, whilst night feeding resulted in a shift of torpor occurrence to earlier in the day (Morning: 14.2±0.4 ZT h (mean ± SEM); Night: 12.2±0.9 ZT h (mean ± SEM); p=0.0933). There was a high degree of variation in torpor occurrence within and between animals in each group. Conclusions We recommend that feeding time is kept consistent between days and the same across animals to minimise variation in torpor occurrence. Moreover, the timing of food provision may be optimised to allow measurements to be taken during euthermia, to mitigate the effects of torpor on the variables investigated. Finally, we recommend that body temperature is monitored non-invasively to determine when torpor is occurring, and that testing, or sample collection is conducted when the torpor history is comparable between animals.
